It is the terminus of the goods-only Thames Haven branch. History The Thames Haven Railway Company was incorporated in 1836 to build a railway from Romford to Shell Haven, which was then a lobster fishing village. The powers for construction were renewed in 1846, though in 1853, the scheme to Romford was abandoned in favour of a single, four-mile branch, which was to run from a junction with Tilbury-Pitsea line to a new port to be called Thames Haven. After this, the branch was to be transferred to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway for ¬£48,000. It was intended to develop Thames Haven as a continental port for fish and cattle, as well as passengers, though this ambitious plan proved hard to realise owing to political instability in Europe in 1870, and then a ban on the importation of foreign cattle due to disease concerns. The passenger service from Fenchurch Street ended in 1880. By the 1890s, the branch saw just one train a day.Gotheridge (1985) p. 4 Occasional passenger trains ran until 1909.Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley page 85 A new service for workers from Tilbury and East Tilbury to Thames Haven began on 1 January 1923, which lasted until 9 June 1958, there were four intermediate halts at Mayes Crossing, Curry Marsh, London & Thames Haven Oil Wharves and Thames Haven. Corringham Light Railway The Corringham Light Railway, authorised in 1899, connected to the Thames Haven branch on its opening in 1901. It was initially intended to enter into an agreement with the LT&SR; to run passenger trains onto the CLR, either by changing at a new platform or reversing at Thames Haven station. Even though the Thames Haven line had been re-signalled in 1889 to passenger standards, the passenger service was never re-instated after withdrawal in 1880- although one special did run over the branch in 1903, with the passengers changing at the old Thames Haven island platform.Kay (2008) p. 29 During the First World War, with the explosives factory at Kynochtown, some workers appealed for through-trains to Thames Haven from London, as problems had arisen with the motor transport which carried workers from Stanford-le- Hope to Corringham station. This request was never granted.Kay (2008) p. 47.Passenger service on the line was withdrawn in 1952 and parts of the line were absorbed into the Thames Haven complex in 1971. Although no regular passenger trains ran after 1880, the station building was still standing in 1938.Scott (1981) p. 44  Thames Haven branch freight operations  The principal use of the Thames Haven Branch (Engineer's Line Reference THN) is for freight. The branch formerly served the Shell Haven refinery and the Coryton oil refinery transporting petroleum products from the refineries in rail tank wagons. Liquefied ammonia was also transported from the Shell Haven site, and to the Fisons Ltd works at Stanford-le-Hope for the manufacture of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate fertiliser (since closed). The export of ammonia from Shell Haven ceased in 1980, Shell Haven refinery closed in 1999, and Coryton refinery closed in 2012. The branch formerly had a siding, at from the datum, used by British Dredging, this was out of use by 1997. The branch is connected to the national rail system at Thames Haven Junction between East Tilbury and Stanford-le-Hope stations from a datum at London Fenchurch Street. The western end of the branch is a two track line designated Down Thames Haven and Up Thames Haven running nearly 2 miles to Port Junction located at from the datum. The boundary between Network Rail infrastructure and DP World is at the former British Dredging siding at . From Port Junction the branch splits into 3 lines: * the most northerly line designated the Thames Haven Single runs to terminus junction at where the line connects to the former Coryton and Corringham lines. From terminus junction the line branches north and east to the currently out of use Thames Oilport (formerly Coryton refinery), and directly to the east to the \\"not in regular use\\" Thames Haven Yard * the next line to the south is designated Port Arrivals * the most southerly line is Port Departures, both these lines connect to the currently six loading sidings of the London Gateway port. Railway operations at the port from the Network Rail boundary are controlled by the London Gateway Rail Control Centre located at the eastern end of the sidings. The branch is not electrified and is only accessible by diesel locomotives, it has a route availability of 8, that is limited to an axle load of ‚â§22.8 tonne. There are currently (2017) nine freight paths to, and nine paths available from, London Gateway every weekday.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two yellowish flowers which have a white labellum with pale red markings.Caladenia denticulata subsp. denticulata habit C. denticulata subsp. denticulata with wasp Description Caladenia denticulata subsp. denticulata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. One or two flowers are borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide at the base, linear to lance-shaped, pale to greenish-yellow and has a drooping, dark brown, thread-like glandular tip. The arching lateral sepals and petals are similar in size, shape and colour to the dorsal sepal although the petals are slightly narrower and shorter. The labellum is white with pale red markings, and curves forward with white to pale red teeth along its margins, the teeth decreasing in size towards the tip. There are up to 13 pairs of anvil-shaped, cream-coloured calli in two rows along about half the length of the labellum and decreasing in size towards the tip. Flowering occurs between August and early October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia denticulata was first formally described by John Lindley in 1840 and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 2015, Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman described three subspecies, including subspecies denticulata and the descriptions were published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (denticulata) is a Latin word meaning \\"with small teeth\\", referring to the small teeth on the labellum. Distribution and habitat Yellow spider orchid occurs in the south-west corner of Western Australia between Waroona and Eneabba in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions where it grows in wandoo and York gum woodland.

He played two seasons for Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League. Born to parents of German ancestry, Sabburg was considered one of the best fieldsman in Queensland even though he wasn't a full-time cricketer. He still managed to impress Brisbane Heat coach to earn a spot in the team for two seasons. He never got to bowl or bat in his first season, but he took five catches and played his part in Brisbane Heat's winning campaign in 2012-13 Big Bash League. He became a notable player after he took a successful catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen on the 4th day of the first Test between England and Australia. Sabburg was fielding at fine leg for only two deliveries when Ryan Harris left the field for a short time. Pietersen hit a short ball from Mitchell Johnson towards fine leg where it was caught by Sabburg sprinting from the boundary to secure a catch. Pietersen was dismissed for 26 and Australia went on to win the game by 381 runs.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/25074929 Sabburg said after the game: \\"It wasn't a very hard catch, to be honest. I just had to do the simple things and catch it. All the boys got around so it was pretty awesome. I was hoping 'Harry' was going to stay off ‚Ä¶ I wanted to stay on.\\" It also was not the first time substitute fielders were notably used in a Test between England and Australia. In 2005 at Trent Bridge England's substitute fielder Gary Pratt famously ran out Ricky Ponting. Sabburg is formally an uncapped Test player - his brief moment on the field during a Test match does not count towards official records. Cricket purists claim that players like Marnus Labuschagne or Sabburg are the reason why substitute fielders should not be credited for catches or appearances on the field.

Morococala is part of the so- called Bolivian Tin Belt, a string of plutons of Permian to Pliocene age extending from Peru over Bolivia to Argentina. These may or may not be associated with surface volcanic features but contain many mineral deposits. Some areas are associated with Late Miocene ignimbrites, such as Morococala and Los Frailes Plateau. A number of mineralization areas exist at Morococala in the sediment layers, many of them in the sediment layers and associated with volcanic structures.  Composition  Tuffs are gray to white and typically rich in crystals in a mostly devitrified matrix. The rocks of Morococala are dominantly dacite and rhyodacite. There is a north-south gradient with the larger northern part of the field being latitic and the smaller southern part rhyolitic. Phenocrysts include biotite, feldspar and quartz. In addition, the peraluminous minerals andalusite, cordierite and muscovite. Hydrothermal alteration has occurred on these rocks.  Basement  Various Silurian and Devonian sedimentary formations exist in the area as well. A number of subvolcanic intrusions of Oligocene to Miocene age are also found there.  Eruptive history  The oldest date obtained on intrusive rocks at San Pablo is 23.3 ¬± 0.4 million years ago. Hydrothermal alteration occurred later, 20.2 ¬± 0.35 million years ago. The ignimbrite was deposited much later, 6 million years ago. Three different stages of ignimbritic volcanism have been delineated by argon-argon dating. The first and oldest occurred 8.4 million years ago and formed the rhyolitic tuffs. The second 6.8 million years ago also formed a rhyolitic tuff and originated from the Condoriri caldera. The third 6.4 million years ago originated from the Tankha Tankha caldera.

It was built by Daimler-Benz from 1939 ‚Äì 1944 in the Mercedes-Benz plant Gaggenau, and from 1944 ‚Äì 1945 by Saurer. The vehicle is a long-bonnet truck and was offered as a rear-wheel-drive truck (L 4500 S) and as an all-wheel-drive truck (L 4500 A). The German Wehrmacht used the L 4500 with armoured cabins as Flaks during World War II. Due to the lack of production material, the cabin was replaced with the simplified standardised Wehrmacht cabin and the mudwings with simplified wings in 1943. Also, the L 4500 chassis was used for the Sonderkraftfahrzeug 4.  Description  Wehrmacht L 4500 S The L 4500 is a truck with a long bonnet, U-shape ladder frame and two beam axles. Both axles are leaf sprung. The front axle has single wheels whereas the rear axle has twin wheels. The tyres have the size 10.5‚Äî20\\". A pneumo-hydraulic brake-system is used, each wheel has a drum brake, the parking brake locks the rear wheels only. For steering, a ZF Type 721 steering system is used. From the engine, the torque is transmitted to a manual five-speed gearbox with a single disc dry clutch. The gearbox has a reduction gear. Only the rear wheels are driven. Unlike the L 4500 S, the L 4500 A has an offroad gear, which automatically switches on the front-wheel-drive, and disables even torque distribution. The Mercedes-Benz OM 67/4 Diesel engine was installed in the L 4500. It is a six- cylinder, straight, four-stroke, precombustion-chamber-injected, water-cooled diesel engine with OHV-Valvetrain.

It is often confused with the European barracuda Sphyraena sphyraena. Description Sphyraena viridensis has a long, fusiform body with a long, streamlined pointed snout which has a long mouth lined with two rows of sharp, fang-like teeth and a jutting lower jaw. There are no scales on the preoperculum, unlike S. sphyraena which has scales on both the anterior and posterior margins of the preoperculum. There are numerous transverse dark bars on the dorsum and these are longer,extending below the lateral line, towards the head while in S. sphyraena they do not extend to the lateral line. Generally the colouration is a countershaded dark above, silvery below and the barring fades on dead specimens. Juveniles are described as being dark yellow or greenish in colour. S. viridensis averages smaller than S. sphyraena growing to a standard length of 65 cm, although the average length is 35‚Äì40 cm. but specimens up to 114.5 cm have been caught of the Azores. The rod caught record is 10.2 kg which was caught off Lanzarote in the Canary Islands in 2007. Distribution The exact distribution of Sphyraena viridensis is unclear because of confusion with S. sphyraena. It occurs in the eastern central Atlantic around the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde Islands and the Canary Islands and has been recorded in the eastern Mediterranean off Lebanon. It has also been recorded in the Mediterranean in the Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, off Israel, Algeria, Corsica and Sicily. Ecology In the Azores fish made up all of the diet and the most important species in the diet of Sphyraena viridensis was the bluejack mackerel Trachurus picturatus being found as having been preyed upon by 72.4% of the fish sampled and making up nearly two thirds of the weight of prey taken. Other species taken in this study included single examples of bogue Boops boops, ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo and axillary sea bream Pagellus acarnae, as well as an unidentified species of the Exocoetidae. Unidentified fish remains were found in nearly 20% of the specimens sampled. In the same study the predatory behaviour of S.viridensis was observed and they are active pursuit predators of fish with one or many barracudas pursuing fish, either singling out lone prey or attacking shoals of prey fish. The pursuit was rapid and was usually over in 8‚Äì40 seconds and the more fish were involved the higher the rate of success was. In these observations other fish species than those sampled from specimens were observed as prey e.g. longspine snipefish Macrorhamphosus scolopax and boar fish Capros aper. It is also known to feed on cephalopods and crustaceans. right In summer they form schools of up to 180 fish, although most schools number 30-40 fish, in areas where there are strong currents. These schools are predominantly made up of sub-adult fish with the smaller fish nearer to the surface and the larger, usually female, fish at the bottom of the school at depths of up to 30m. In winter the only aggregations are small groups of juveniles in shallow bays. No territorial behaviour was observed. Schooling is thought to be an anti predator defence and to facilitate mating with the smaller males being attracted to the larger females, in addition groups of barracudas were more successful in hunting prey fish than single fish. This species does not appear to mix with other barracuda species in mixed schools but there are reports of these fish associating with whale sharks in the Azores and an instance of them actively swimming towards a manta ray Mobula tarapacana. In the Azores juveniles of Sphyraena viridensis are preyed upon by the lizard fish Synodus saurus, this predation shows that there is an overlap in habitat between the juvenile barracudas and the lizard fish which occur in sheltered, very enclosed bays with sandy substrates. Fisheries Sphyraena viridensis is landed in small quantities in the eastern Mediterranean by fishermen using in trammel-nets and beach-seines. It has been reported from markets in Turkey but it is generally caught as a bycatch, although as numbers increase in the Mediterranean it may be becoming a more important species for fisheries.

The plot tells about an extraterrestrial spaceship that crash- lands in the Chertanovo district of Moscow. The Russian government immediately introduces martial law, as the locals grow increasingly angry at the unwelcome guest. The film stars Irina Starshenbaum, Alexander Petrov, Rinal Mukhametov and Oleg Menshikov. According to Bondarchuk, the movie is a social allegory. The script writers stated that it was inspired by the 2013 Biryulyovo riots. The project became the fourth Russian film transferred to the IMAX 3D format. The premiere of the film in Russia was on 26 January 2017. Attraction became a box office hit, grossing more than 1 billion rubles and becoming the highest- grossing Russian sci-fi movie. It was also a moderate critical success with the Russian media. The film received mixed reviews from western critics. A sequel, Invasion, premiered on New Year's Day 2020. Plot The storyline revolves around Colonel Valentin Lebedev, who is in charge of the military operation, his daughter Yulia, who develops a romantic relationship with the alien Hekon, and her former boyfriend Artyom who is the main antagonist. Hekon is a representative of a technologically-advanced humanoid race who travels to Earth incognito for research purposes. While traveling through the Solar System, his spaceship is damaged by a meteor shower. The Russian Air Force mistakes his spaceship for a NATO military spacecraft and damages it by firing missiles into it, causing it to crash into several buildings in Moscow and kill hundreds of people. It is on that same day when Yulia and Artyom have finished attending a meteor-watching event, that Yulia's friend Svetlana is killed while watching some meteors. The Russian government decides not to enter into contact with the ship and let it fix itself on its own. The area around the landing site is evacuated and cordoned off; Moscow is then placed under a curfew. Meanwhile, Yulia, Artyom, and his friends Khariton, Ruslan, and Piton sneak into the crash site to investigate the alien: after they beat him up and cause him to crash down a building, they retrieve his armor before an army patrol may find them. On another day, Yulia sneaks again to retrieve the alien, placing him with a nerdy classmate known as \\"Google\\" to help the alien recover. While examining his body, she notices a wristband forming on her right wrist, which manipulates water. The alien, who introduces himself as \\"Hekon\\", was initially unsure about Earth and its people, but tells them that he is looking for a device known as \\"Shilk\\", that allows him to travel through space without destroying his body. Shilk, like the spaceship, appears to be attracting water. As he goes out to the streets to look for the device, the police mistake him for a drug addict and send him off to a police station to be interrogated. Meanwhile, Artyom and his friends drive in their car to inform Colonel Lebedev about the alien's armor that they had hidden in their garage. They stumble upon a crowd who are angry over rationed water, as the spaceship appears to absorb water in order to repair itself. Ruslan decides to provoke the crowd into becoming a disorderly riot. Artyom is hit by a policeman's baton as he tries to convince people to stop rioting, and is taken to the police station but he forgets to tell Colonel Lebedev about his discovery. In order to get Shilk, Yulia goes to see her father, who interrupts his meeting with his officers when she informed him that she is pregnant with Hekon's child. She actually says this to distract him, so Hekon can disguise himself as a scientist and take Shilk from its container, and also because she was upset that he did not spend much time with her after her mother died. Yulia confesses her true feelings for Hekon in a phone call to Artyom, while Artyom arrives with his friends to beat up the alien. Hekon fights back, and when one of Artyom's friends tries to shoot Hekon, Ruslan is shot by accident instead. Artyom and one of his friends flee before the police would arrest them. He reports this incident to gather many supporters and form a group to attack Hekon's spaceship, and avenge Ruslan's death, for which he blames the alien. In spite of his initial support, Piton sometimes expresses doubt on Artyom's goals. Artyom's group breaks through a police barricade, triggering several other robotic suits to come out and fight against the mob. Yulia and Hekon drive through the police barricade and the mob using an armored car to return him and Shilk back to their ship, while fending off against Artyom, who angrily rampages using Hekon's suit. Hekon defeats Artyom, but Artyom shoots him and Yulia with a dropped rifle. Saddened by this, Colonel Lebedev follows several walking suits as they carry Yulia and Hekon to the spaceship, where its machinery uses water to nurse Yulia's injuries. The spaceship's computer also responds to Lebedev's questions about Hekon's mission to observe the Earth, as its warlike civilizations and history had made it very unsafe for interstellar contact. However, Yulia's love for Hekon, and her willingness to protect him, have caused the computer's authorities to rewrite the results of their study on Earth. Yulia, her father, and everyone else return to their daily lives, as the spaceship departs and releases excess water. Meanwhile, Artyom is arrested and presumably sent to a prison camp. The moral of the movie is vocalized by Yulia at the end: The truth is that one alien from far away trusted us more than we trust ourselves. Cast Production Casting During the filming, the actor Alexander Petrov cut open his leg with glass and damaged his tendons, after which he was forced to remove his cast and use an understudy. In addition, Fyodor Bondarchuk expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the close relations between the main characters in the roles of actress Irina Starshenbaum and actor Alexander Petrov create difficulties in the production of the film. Filming Principal photography began in November 2015. The shooting took place in strict secrecy in different regions of Moscow, mainly in Chertanovo, and at the facilities of the Ministry of Defense with the participation of the latest military equipment of the Russian Armed Forces. The shooting involved armored personnel carriers, helicopters, Uranus-6 robots, drones, armored vehicles GAZ Tigr, Typhoon (AFV family) and the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.  Post-production  The visual effects involved 255 artists of the Russian company Main Road Post, which until that time worked on the films Metro (2013 film), August Eighth (2012 film), Wanted (2008 film), Stalingrad (2013 film) and The Duelist (2016 film). It took about a year and a half to work with effects. The most difficult effects are considered the moment of the fall of the spacecraft. Soundtrack The music for the picture was written by composer Ivan Burlyaev. The soundtrack includes 34 tracks. To record the soundtrack, the latest musical workstation (synthesizer) Yamaha Montage 8 was used at that time, which, according to the composer, was not sold anywhere else. On January 26, the soundtrack for the film was released on Yandex Music, and on January 27 in iTunes. Release Attraction was released in Russia, Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan on 26 January 2017 and Vietnam on 27 January 2017.

Tennyson had been severely stung by the more hostile reviews of the 1832 book, which had found some of his poems silly, affected and obscure. He meant to reinstate himself in critical esteem, and to this end he very heavily revised the best of his earlier work, often following the reviewers‚Äô detailed criticisms. This in many cases, such as ≈ínone and The Lady of Shalott, resulted in greatly improved versions. In the new poems contained in the second volume he also took to heart the general tenor of the advice his critics had given. By 1840 the work of revision and composition was complete, or virtually so. The increasing danger of his earlier poems being pirated in their unrevised forms in America impelled him to forestall that threat by finding a publisher, and in March 1842, partly at his friend Edward FitzGerald's insistence, a contract was signed with Edward Moxon. Publication Dante Gabriel Rossetti illustration for the 10th edition A first edition of 800 copies was published by Moxon on 14 May, of which 500 copies had been sold by September. An edition was published in Boston the same year by the firm of W. D. Ticknor, who sent Tennyson one of the first copyright payments made by any American publisher to a British writer. Home sales were from the start highly encouraging, and his two-thirds profit agreement with Moxon earned Tennyson more than ¬£600 during the first four years, alleviating his serious financial difficulties. As succeeding editions came out Tennyson began to add more poems, such as Come Not When I Am Dead and The Eagle. The 10th edition, in 1857, was illustrated by Rossetti, Millais, Holman Hunt and others, and by 1868 a 19th edition had appeared. Reception Clarkson Frederick Stanfield illustration for the 10th edition Tennyson's friends were enthusiastic about the new poems included in the second volume. Thomas Carlyle found it \\"infinitely gratifying to find one true soul more, a great melodious Poet-soul, breathing the vital air along with us. Such I discover, to my own satisfaction, is this Book of Alfred's.\\" Edward FitzGerald thought it \\"such a volume as has not been published since the time of Keats: and which‚Ä¶will never be suffered to die\\", but when it came to the old poems in the first volume he deplored the inclusion of \\"the Merman, the Mermaid, and those everlasting Eleanores, Isabels, ‚Äì which always were, and are, and must be, a nuisance\\". Robert Browning deplored the revisions there, privately writing that \\"The alterations are insane. Whatever is touched is spoiled.\\" The reviewers differed from him on this point; indeed their reaction to the whole book was generally favourable, and not only because several of them were personal friends of Tennyson. Leigh Hunt, in the Church of England Quarterly Review, praised the book and called Tennyson \\"a kind of philosophical Keats\\". James Spedding wanted to see a long poem from him; he also, along with John Sterling and the anonymous reviewer in the Atlas, thought that human sympathy was the strong point of the volume. On the other hand the Christian Remembrancer believed Tennyson \\"had not yet become human enough\\", and similarly the Westminster Review, the London University Magazine and Hogg's Weekly Instructor urged him to draw on the sympathies of his own personal experiences. Many reviewers encouraged him to introduce more contemporary relevance and didacticism into his poems, rather than indulging his Romantic temperament. There was widespread agreement that the best poems were those dealing with domestic life, even when they were somewhat trite. The overall outcome of the publication of Poems was that Tennyson began to be taken much more seriously than he had previously been, with many seeing him as the leading poet of the younger generation, worthy of one day being made Poet Laureate.

The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 was carrying 26 passengers and 4 crew and was flying from Gabon's capital Libreville to Franceville via Port-Gentil when an engine failed. The crew tried to return to Libreville International Airport; however they overflew it and nosedived into the sea. At least 19 people were killed in the crash. It was the second deadliest plane crash in Gabon. Gabon President Omar Bongo declared three days of national mourning in response to the disaster. Flight Flight 221 was a regular domestic passenger service operated by a Gabonese airline, Gabon Express. At the time the airline was the second largest airline in Gabon, with over 60 destinations. The flight was carrying 26 passengers and 4 crew. Among the passengers were 7 French nationals, 2 Lebanese and a German. Shortly after takeoff from Libreville the crew reported problems with the aircraft. A failure of the oil pressure on the No.2 engine occurred, causing the crew to turn back. While returning the crew tried to extend the aircraft's landing gear, however it did not do so, due to problems with the hydraulics. Witnesses on the ground stated that the aircraft was operating with only one engine. Flight 221 then nose-dived into the sea . The tail and the front part of the aircraft separated from the main body. As the aircraft was not fully submerged, several survivors managed to escape from the sinking wreckage. 4 hours after the initial impact, the wreckage sank and fully submerged , with many people still trapped inside the wreckage. Search and Rescue Immediately after the crash, fire crew and emergency services were deployed. 11 survivors were evacuated from the scene and were taken by helicopters to local hospital in Libreville; none had received serious injuries. Divers were deployed by authorities to rescue people trapped inside the wreckage. Local fishermen, French Navy and French military also joined the rescue effort. Aftermath As the crash of Flight 221 claimed 19 lives, the President of Gabon, Omar Bongo, declared three days of national mourning in honor to the victims of the crash. A government official stated that a national funeral will be held in response to the crash.

In contrast to such two-dimensional beamforming (2DBF), 3DBF adapts the radiation beam pattern in both elevation and azimuth planes to provide more degrees of freedom in supporting users. By utilizing information on angle of arrival (AoA) of users provided by suitable antenna hardware such as sector antenna or planar array in both elevation and azimuth planes and estimating direction of arrival (DoA) of each users' signal, base station is capable of distinguishing different users using proper beamforming and also steering the array's beam to a desired direction which optimizes some preferred performance metric of the network.  Different types of 3DBF  Depending on the way that the antenna downtilt is changed, 3DBF can be classified into two categories: * Static 3DBF refers to a system where the antenna tilt at the BS is set to a fixed value according to some statistical metrics. * Dynamic 3DBF that steers the BS antenna tilting angle instantaneously according to specific user locations.

It forms as rock debris falls onto a steep snow slope from a cliff above and slides down the snow surface to come to a rest at the foot of the slope. Over a long period of time, sufficient material can accumulate in this way to produce a distinct bank of stony material which, long after the snowbed has melted away, remains as a rampart (a bank or mound similar to a manmade rampart). The debris may also accumulate through avalanching or landslide. Protalus ramparts may be distinguished from glacial moraines by their lack of rock fragments with glacial abrasion or striations. The morphology of the site may also suggest it being unfavourable for the development of a glacier, but suitable for this mechanism.Shakesby, R. 2002 Classic Landforms of the Brecon Beacons, Geographical Association pp14-15 Protalus ramparts are recorded in the Cairngorms and northwest Highlands of Scotland. An especially large example on the north side of Baosbheinn measures 1 km in length and reaches a height of 55 m. It is thought to result from a major rock slope failure, however evidence leads some to class it as a protalus rock glacier.Price, R.J. 1983 Scotland's Environment during the last 30,000 years, Scottish Academic Press, Edinburgh p140 Ballantyne, C.K. & Harris, C. 1994 The Periglaciation of Great Britain, Cambridge University Press, pp240-241 Several features amongst the mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park have been interpreted by some authors as protalus ramparts but as moraines by others.

Work Opposition research on Mitt Romney Fusion GPS was hired in 2012 to do opposition research on U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney. In February 2012, the magazine Mother Jones published an article on Frank VanderSloot and his company Melaleuca, who combined had given $1 million to a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney. After the article was published, an intern at Fusion GPS did a search of Idaho court records on VanderSloot by phone and fax. In January 2013, VanderSloot sued Mother Jones for defamation in the February 2012 article. In the course of the litigation, VanderSloot deposed Fusion GPS founder Simpson on the \\"theory that Mother Jones conspired with Obama's team to defame VanderSloot\\". The seventh Judicial District Court of the State of Idaho dismissed the lawsuit in 2015. Case Number CV-2013-532. Planned Parenthood In August 2015, Planned Parenthood retained Fusion GPS to defensively investigate the veracity of a series of undercover videos released by anti-abortion activists David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt from The Center for Medical Progress that they claim showed Planned Parenthood officials agreeing to sell fetal tissues obtained through abortions to medical researchers. Fusion GPS hired video and transcription experts to analyze the videos and summarized the findings in a forensic report. The report claimed that the \\"unedited\\" videos posted by activists had been \\"heavily edited\\". The anti-abortion activists attributed the gaps to \\"bathroom breaks and waiting periods.\\" The report was provided to U.S. congressional leadership as evidence as they were considering funding and other issues related to Planned Parenthood operations. After a grand jury declined to indict Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing, on March 28, 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged with 15 felonies in the State of California - one for each of the people whom they had filmed without consent, and one for criminal conspiracy to invade privacy. On 21 June 2017, fourteen of these charges were dismissed, with leave to amend, on the grounds that they were legally insufficient. On June 30, 2017, state prosecutors refiled the 14 dismissed charges with numerical identifications for each video. On August 24, 2017, the San Francisco Superior Court rejected new defense motions to dismiss the charges and allowed the case to proceed. Daleiden then pleaded not guilty, while Merritt did not enter a plea at the time. Prevezon Holding In 2013, the US Department of Justice, represented by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, sued Prevezon Holding, a Republic of Cyprus corporation registered in New York State as a foreign business corporation, under the Magnitsky Act for money-laundering part of $230 million in stolen funds. The lawsuit sought forfeiture of various assets and real estate holdings in the US. In May 2017, the lawsuit was settled for $6 million, less than half what Bharara soughtUS vs Prevezon case settled, without Prevezon admitting to any wrongdoing and with both sides claiming victory. The sole shareholder of Prevezon was Russian citizen Denis Katsyv, whose father is Petr Katsyv, vice president of Russia's state-run rail monopoly and \\"reportedly a business associate of Vladimir Yakunin, a confidant of Vladimir Putin\\". Katsyv's Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was not licensed to practice in the US, and Katsyv hired the law firm of BakerHostetler to represent Prevezon; BakerHostetler hired Fusion GPS in early 2014 to provide research help for the litigation, who later on hired Edward Baumgartner for work on discovery. On October 18, 2016, the appellate court disqualified BakerHostetler from the case because they had represented Bill Browder‚Äôs hedge fund Hermitage Capital Management for nine months from 2008 to 2009 when the U.S. Justice Department was investigating a tax fraud scheme in Russia involving \\"co-opted Hermitage portfolio companies\\". The U.S. Justice Department had argued that Hermitage Capital was a victim of the tax fraud and that BakerHofstetler's prior work on behalf of Hermitage Capital created a conflict of interest. As part of their litigation support for BakerHostetler and their client Prevezon, Fusion GPS investigated Browder, a witness central to the U.S. Justice Department's case. On July 27, 2017, Fusion GPS accused the White House of trying to \\"smear\\" it for investigating the president's alleged ties to Russia. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointed to Browder's testimony as vindication of Trump's claims that ongoing investigations into potential ties between his campaign and Moscow are political ploys to undermine his presidency. Fusion GPS countered that it worked only with a law firm in New York \\"to provide support for civil litigation\\" unrelated to Russian efforts to do away with the Magnitsky Act, saying it had no reason to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Browder lodged a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department in 2016 that Fusion GPS may have lobbied \\"for Russian interests in a campaign to oppose the pending Global Magnitsky Act [and] failed to register under [U.S. law]\\". The US Global Magnitsky Act (not to be confused with the Magnitsky Act) is a human rights law passed on December 23, 2016. It is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer and auditor working for Browder who died in a Russian prison after uncovering a corruption scheme that he was then charged with having helped concoct. On March 30, 2017, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa called for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into purported connections between Fusion GPS and Russia, and an inquiry as to whether Fusion GPS was acting as an unregistered foreign agent. The company denied the claims that they were engaged in lobbying or had violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act. According to the Washington Post‚Ä≤s \\"Fact Checker\\" column, there is \\"no evidence that the Russian government paid for Fusion‚Äôs work on the Prevezon defense at the same time Fusion investigated Trump‚Äôs business dealings in Russia.\\" Trump dossier and Christopher Steele In September 2015, Fusion GPS was hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political website, to do opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. In spring 2016 when Trump had emerged as the probable Republican candidate, the Free Beacon stopped funding investigation into Trump. From April 2016 through October 2016, the law firm Perkins Coie, on behalf of the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, retained Fusion GPS to continue opposition research on Trump. In June 2016, Fusion GPS retained Christopher Steele, a private British corporate intelligence investigator and former MI-6 agent, to research any Russian connections to Trump. Steele produced a 35-page series of uncorroborated memos from June to December 2016, which became the document known as the Donald Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier. Fusion GPS provided Marc Elias, the lead election lawyer for Perkins Coie, with the resulting dossier and other research documents. The firm is being sued for defamation by three Alfa-Bank owners named in the dossier as connected to Putin. German Khan, one of the litigants and one of Russia's wealthiest citizens, is the father-in-law of lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who was charged in the Mueller probe for making false statements to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to one count and in April 2018 was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine of $20,000. =House Intelligence Committee investigation= On October 4, 2017, Chairman Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to the management of the company, demanding documents and testimony in late October and early November 2017. According to a Democratic committee source, the subpoenas were issued unilaterally by the Republican majority of the committee. On October 18, 2017, the House Intelligence Committee held a private meeting with two executives of Fusion GPS, Peter Fritsch, and Thomas Catan. The purpose was to seek information about their creation of \\"the opposition-research dossier that makes salacious claims about President Donald Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia.\\" The meeting was attended by committee staff and a single committee member, Representative Tom Rooney (R-FL). In response to the questions asked at the meeting, Fritsch and Catan invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self- incrimination. Their attorney, Joshua Levy, said that prior to the meeting he had informed the committee in writing that his clients would invoke their rights, but they were compelled to appear nevertheless. He added they would cooperate with \\"serious\\" investigations but that a \\"Trump cabal has carried out a campaign to demonize our client for having been tied to the Trump dossier.\\" On October 23, 2017, Fusion GPS filed for a court injunction against Nunes' subpoena seeking the firm's bank records for a period of more than two years, arguing it would damage and possibly destroy the business as well as violate their First Amendment rights. On January 4, 2018 U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon struck down Fusion's application, ruling that Fusion's bank must turn over the financial records subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee; Fusion asked the judge to stay his order because they plan to appeal. On October 28, 2017, The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative political website, told the House Intelligence Committee that it had retained Fusion GPS's services from 2015 to May 2016, to research Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. The objective was the discovery of damaging information. The Free Beacon and its primary source of funding, hedge fund manager Paul Singer, denied any involvement in the creation of the Steele dossier, pointing out that they had stopped funding research on Trump before Steele was engaged. On January 2, 2018, the founders of Fusion GPS, Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritsch, authored an op-ed in The New York Times, requesting that Republicans \\"release full transcripts of our firm‚Äôs testimony\\" and further explaining that, \\"the Steele dossier was not the trigger for the F.B.I.‚Äôs investigation into Russian meddling. As we told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August, our sources said the dossier was taken so seriously because it corroborated reports the bureau had received from other sources, including one inside the Trump camp.\\" The committee interviewed Simpson for seven hours on November 14, 2017. The transcript of the interview was released on January 18, 2018. Senate Judiciary Committee investigations Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein made arrangements in July 2017 for Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson to testify before their committee. It was agreed that Simpson would not testify in public but would be interviewed privately. The committee wanted to question Simpson about the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). A previous witness, banker and human rights activist Bill Browder, had accused Simpson and Fusion GPS of evading registration as foreign agents for campaigning to influence and overturn the Magnitsky Act. Fusion GPS said through their attorney that they were not required to register under FARA. Senators were expected to also use the hearing \\"to press Justice Department officials on what they know about Veselnitskaya, Prevezon, Fusion GPS and their connections to both the Trump campaign or the Russian government.\\" On August 22, 2017, Simpson was questioned for 10 hours by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a closed-door meeting. The Committee did not release a transcript of the hearing, but indicated that Fusion GPS had given more than 40,000 documents for the investigation. Simpson kept the identities of the firm's clients confidential; the client names‚Äîconservative website The Washington Free Beacon, and the law firm Perkins Coie representing the DNC and the Clinton presidential campaign‚Äîwere revealed in October 2017 as a result of the House Intelligence Committee investigation. On January 2, 2018, Simpson and Fritsch co-authored an op-ed in The New York Times, requesting the two congressional committees to \\"release full transcripts of our firm's testimony\\". On January 8, 2018, a spokesman for Grassley said he did not plan to release the transcript of Simpson's August 22, 2017, testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The next day, January 9, 2018, Feinstein unilaterally released the transcript.  Litigation   Filed by Fridman, Aven, and Khan  In October 2017, Fridman, Aven, and Khan filed a libel suit against Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson for circulating the dossier among journalists and allowing it to be published.  Filed by Cohen  On January 9, 2018, Michael Cohen sued BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS for defamation over allegations about him in the dossier. On April 19, 2018, ten days after his home, office and hotel room were raided by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation, Cohen filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the suit.

Language The Ngugi language was called guwar, a term that, by extension served as one of the names for the people, reflects their word for \\"no\\" (gowarliosislipotinoionalop). It was mutually intelligible with the other Moreton bay languages: Tom Petrie, who had mastered the Brisbane area Turrbal language could, according to his daughter's reminiscences, understand the speech of Ngugi people from the island. According to Anthony Jefferies, Guwar is a variety of Bundjalung, the population being a residue of speakers of that language who, when the rest of the Bundjalung were forced south as a result of the expansion of the incoming Yugara, much of whose terminology was then adopted into Guwar. Country The Ngugi lands covered the entirety of Moreton Island, in their language Mulganpin (Moolgunpin) and covered some . A legend explains the bar at South Passage of Moreton Island as the residue of an old woman's bones. She pursued a young man from Swan Bay east of north Stradbroke island after he had stolen a firestick from her campsite. He stole a canoe at Amity to get over to Moreton Island, and, hot in pursuit, so did the old woman, with each landing, one after the other, at Gunemba. The lad, like Achilles among the maidens of Skyros, hid himself among a band of youths undergoing initiation, but the old lady twigged, venturing into the corroboree, and, catching him, bundled him into her dilly bag, to haul him back home. He managed to shake himself loose, grasp some bone skewers used for combing, and stab her blind. Having turned the tables, he then put her in a canoe and let it drift out on the tide to a sandbank where she died, and her remains formed the Bar which is a feature of that strait. Ecology Moreton island has a thin soil cover, which, on the higher ground to the north is interrupted by stretches of swamp land. Fresh water springs were abundant. Wildlife consisted of many varieties of bird, abundant crabs, numerous bandicoots, and large numbers of venomous snakes, among them, death adders, Tiger, Black, Brown and Carpet snakes. Society The Ngugi are considered to be one of three hordes of what are known collectively called the Quandamooka people. In his archaeological survey over the years 1963-4, Ponosov detected some 72 sites of traditional indigenous habitation on the island. The population of Moreton Island predating European contact is estimated to have been approximately 100, living in groups of 15 to 20. At least five clusters of spacious native huts along the north shore as far as Comboyuro Point (Gnahmoonbilla) were observed by the earliest visitors. Lancelot Threlkeld, using reports from a castaway who had survived among the Moreton Bay blacks, argued in 1824 that they were far more advanced than the more southern tribes, dwelling in hut settlements that had the appearance of small villages. One important site for habitation was the southern side of the Cape Moreton headland, since this was the only area where outcroppings of sandy ironstone existed. These sites were quarried to manufacture stone implements, some of which they traded with the Nunukul on Stradbroke Island. In fishing for mullet, the Ngugi like other Moreton islanders would beat the inshore waters with sticks to enlist the aid of porpoises, who would drive the fish beachwards. They were also expert in catching tailor fish (punba/dai-arli), again enlisting porpoises. The major catches were done when westerlies blew, and Tom Petrie describes one scene he witnessed: > The sea would be calm, and there would be no sign anywhere of a porpoise > (Talobilla); the blacks would go long the beach jobbing with their spears > into the sand under the water, making a queer noise, also beating the water > with the spears. By-and-by, as if in response, porpoises would be seen as > they rose to the surface making for the shore and in front of them schools > of tailor fish. It may seem wonderful, but they were apparently driving the > fish towards the land. When they came near, the blacks would run out into > the surf, and with their spears would job down here and there at the fish, > at times even getting two on one spear, so plentiful were they. As each fish > was speared, it was thrown to shore, and there picked up by the gins. The > porpoises would actually be swimming in and out amongst all this, apparently > quite unafraid of the darkies. Indeed,they seemed rather to be all on good > terms, and I have with my own eyes more than once seen a blackfellow hold > out a fish on a spear to a porpoise, and the creature take and eat it. One > old porpoise was well known and spoken of fondly.He had a piece of root, or > stick of some sort, stuck in his hack, having evidently at one time run into > something,and by this he was recognised, for it could be seen plainly The > blacks told me it had been in him for years, and they declared that the > great man of the island had put it there,thus making him the big fellow of > the tribe of porpoises.I have seen this creature take fish from a spear, and > the white men working on the island told me they often saw him knocking > about with the blacks. At all times porpoises would be spoken of with > affection by these Moreton Island blacks (the ngugi tribe), who said they > never failed when called to drive in fish to them. Several Ngugi names survive behind European transcriptions of their language, for the Cape Moreton headland area: Mijin Boowell, Gunemba, Boogaram-calleem, and Cangallioon. It has been conjectured that these terms refer respectively to the midjin bush and berry, canumba (honey), boogaram (bullroarer) or buggeree (bugara), i.e., the braided string used to swing the bullroarer. The cape was a ritual centre for bora initiation ceremonies. Nearby, according to Thomas Welsby who visited the island in 1900 and collected local lore, there was a cave in which, were anyone to enter it and scratch his head, he would be killed by a stone dropping from the cavern ceiling. A Ngugi headman had a repute for developing fresh corroboree dances and songs, which he would think out after retreating to a place of solitude, and then introduce on his return. Ngugi women had a reputation for making excellent dillies ideal for keeping fish, which they wove from mat-rushes. Mythology In Ngugi legend, Warrajamba who among adjacent tribes was a rainbow serpent, shed his blood and formed a red sandhill at Cowen Cowen. There were two key sandhill sites around which a legend, \\"The Lightning's Playground,\\" was told. Another dreamtime legend regarding the Ngugi's island was that a black snake and a carpet snake travelled in a hollowed-out chestnut tree canoe from the Pine River, over to Moreton island, harried by a dog that swam menacingly alongside them. Since the black snake was ill, the carpet snake steered the craft. After a time there, they smiled on finding the dingo had died of exhaustion, but their canoe had been swept away, cutting them off from their homeland. Eventually, scouring the island they slipped into the bay opposite Southport, and managed to reach the mainland and work their way home. History of contact As part of a campaign of retaliation also involving the Nunukul, after reciprocal hostilities broke out over the setting up of British military stations on the islands, Captain Clunie despatched armed parties on punitive raids. Between July 1831 and December 1832, in several clashes 5 Europeans died, and an estimated 30-40 Ngugi and Nunukal people were injured or slain. In one such sortie soldiers of the 17th Regiment encircled Ngugi camped at the fresh water lagoon on the southern end of Moreton Island, and killed a score of them. The last members of the Ngugi tribe were, according to Tom Petrie, Bournbobian, by then blind and known as Kitty, and Junnumbin (Juno), both sufficiently alert that they identified Petrie after a lapse of a half a century simply by overhearing his voice.

Born in Staffordshire, Grier was profoundly deaf as a child, which resulted in her lack of formal education. When she and her mother, after her father's death, moved to Cambridge, Grier obtained permission to attend lectures at Newnham College as an external student. In order to enroll formally, she had to teach herself basic math and languages to fill the gaps in her prior reading education. Graduating in 1908, she became an assistant teacher at Newnham and in 1913 was promoted to assistant lecturer. In 1915, she transferred to the University of Leeds, where she taught economics until the war ended. In 1921, Grier was appointed as the principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and worked on the overhaul of the college to meet post-war educational requirements. She served on many commissions and committees for the church and government to improve British pedagogy and educational policy. She was involved in some of the most important educational reforms in the interwar period and was one of the authors of both the Hadow Reports and the Spens Report. She became the first woman to serve on Oxford‚Äôs Hebdomadal Council in 1926. Retiring as principal in 1945, she went abroad to China on behalf of the British Council in 1947. As the post for the Council representative in Shanghai was vacant, she was invited to take the post. Serving from 1948 to 1950, she remained in abroad, traveling widely to evaluate education in the country in spite of the dangers of the Chinese Communist Revolution. She was honoured as a Commander in the Order of the British Empier in 1951 and in 1953, was the first Cambridge- educated woman to receive an honorary degree from the university. She died in 1967 and is remembered for her work in developing women‚Äôs education and education policy in Britain.  Early life and education  Mary Lynda Dorothea Grier was born on 3 May 1880 in Rugeley, Staffordshire to Grace (n√©e Allen) and Richard MacGregor Grier. Her father was the rural dean of Rugeley and prebendary of Lichfield. She was the younger sister of Sir Selwyn MacGregor Grier, who would become a British colonial administrator, Governor- in-Chief of the Windward Islands from 1935 to 1937. During her childhood, Grier was deaf and because of her condition was taught at home by an aunt and her mother, who did not understand that her learning difficulties stemmed from her inability to hear. She taught herself to lip read and studied books from her father's library. The family were poor, but became impoverished when her father moved them to Hednesford, a mining town in the South Staffordshire coalfield area. His subsequent death in 1894, created greater economic strain and the family lived with relatives for some time before moving to Cannock. In 1904, Grier and her mother relocated to Cambridge. As her hearing had improved, she began attending lectures of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and met Mary Paley Marshall. Marshall allowed Grier to attend Newnham College, Cambridge as an external student, while she worked on her own to complete the gaps in her education. To pass her Tripos in 1908, Grier had to learn basic math, as well as French, Greek and Latin. She and her classmate Eva Spielman (later Hubback) achieved first class honours in the Economics examination, Part II, outranking any of their male classmates. After graduating, she worked with Marshall as a teaching assistant until 1913.  Career  In 1913, Grier was appointed as an assistant lecturer at Newnham and two years later, she was elevated to lecturer. That year, she became a mentor to Barbara Wootton, laying out a reading list for the reluctant classics student to improve her studies in economics. Later that year, she was teaching the economics courses at the University of Leeds, which D. H. MacGregor had to abandon because he was called into the service during World War I. During her time at Leeds, Grier recognized that she was drawn to the field of education. Having lacked opportunity in her own childhood, she was particularly interested in providing educational opportunities for others who had similar experiences. She became a strong supporter of the Workers‚Äô Educational Association and vice-chancellor, Michael Sadler, who believed that the university had a public duty to serve the broader community. She also met the vice principal of the normal school in Leeds, Winifred Mercier, who would become an influence on her. In later life, Grier wrote biographies of both Mercier and Sadler. At the end of the war, Grier returned to Newnham as a fellow. She also worked at Bedford College, London, tutoring economics. In 1921, she was appointed as the principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She began her tenure focusing on overhauling the university structure from the accommodations to the finances. She oversaw drafting of a constitution to establish college regulations which would increase the staff and student populations and meet the post-war educational demands of women. She introduced philosophy and political students to economics, insisting that it was a behavioural science. Grier, 1929 In 1924, Grier became a member of the Board of Education's Consultative Committee. The committee was the first in the UK to include women in an official government commission and they were charged with giving expert advice on education. From the beginning of the Consultative Committee in 1899, the women members who served used their cause of creating improvements for girls' and women's education, as part of the specific political aim of improving the status of women. Grier joined at the time when the Consultative Committee had made changes in their structure so allow the members, rather than the Board of Education, to direct their fields of study. She worked on reports which became extremely important in British pedagogy and educational policy in the interwar years. These included the Hadow Reports, \\"The Education of the Adolescent (1927), Primary Education (1931), and Infant and Nursery Schools (1933); and the Spens Report on Secondary Education (1938)\\". Grier was invited in 1925 to serve as president of Section F (economics) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which was an unusual distinction for a woman at that time. In 1926, she became the first woman to serve on the Hebdomadal Council of Oxford University. This body was the policy-forming council for the university and throughout her tenure, she served on various committees to improve the overall university system. From 1927 to 1929, she was a member of the Archbishop's Commission on religious education and in 1932, she was appointed for a second term on the Consultative Committee. She would share the distinction with of being the longest serving women members of the Consultative Committee, each consulting for 14 years. Grier supported the founding of Nuffield College in 1937 and served as chair of its education committee from 1943 to 1946, while at the same time serving as faculty fellow from 1944 to 1945. In 1945, she was appointed president of Section L (education) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. That year, she retired as principal of Lady Margaret Hall, but her retirement was short-lived. At the request of the British Council, Grier embarked on an educational lecturing tour of China in 1947 and when the Chinese representative to the council vacated their post in 1948, she accepted the appointment as replacement. She remained in China until 1950, during the Chinese Communist Revolution, and in spite of the dangers, traveled widely to evaluate educational facilities. When she returned to Britain, Grier was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1951 New Year Honours. For the next several years, Grier lectured and did broadcast work on the history and challenges faced in China. She was awarded the first honorary Doctor of Laws given to a woman graduate of Cambridge in 1953. In 1961, she embarked on a world tour, but had to abandon it due to illness. Increasingly in her later years, she suffered from ill- health, becoming extremely deaf and experiencing partial-paralysis.  Death and legacy  Grier died in London on 21 August 1967 and was buried beside her parents in Hednesford. She is remembered as a pioneer in women's education and developing the educational policies throughout the United Kingdom.

The fortified islet was proclaimed an independent principality in 2007 by Renato Barros, self-entitled as Prince Renato, the owner of the piece of land. History The islet and its fort were property of the Portuguese state until king Carlos I of Portugal sold the islet on 9 October 1903 to the Blandy family of Madeira, traditionally involved in winemaking. The money was needed by the king to develop the port of Funchal. In 2000, the Madeiran art teacher Renato de Barros bought the islet and fort from the Blandys for 9,000 contos (the equivalent to ~‚Ç¨45,000), with the aim of studying wave power. In November 2007, Renato Barros presented a \\"request for the detachment of the Principality of the Island of Pontinha\\" to Monteiro Diniz, the sovereign's representative in the Autonomous Region of Madeira. Subsequently, Renato Barros declared the independence of the islet, calling it the Principality of Pontinha and entitling himself its Prince. According to Barros, at the time of the sale of the islet by the king, a royal charter was issued to the buyer, granting them not only the possession of the islet but also the \\"dominion\\" over it (meaning, according to Barros, the charter conceded sovereignty over the landmass to its owner since 1903).

Well trusted by Emperor Zhenzong, Wang Dan was given plenipotentiary authority over some matters after 1008. Wang Dan is generally remembered as a faithful and virtuous official, mainly because he kept a low profile, recruited talented men to the bureaucracy while blocking his notoriously unscrupulous colleague Wang Qinruo from advancing for most of his tenure. But Wang Dan also flattered and encouraged Emperor Zhenzong's excessive and ridiculous Taoist pursuits, for which he expressed regret on his deathbed. Early life Wang Dan was born in 957 or January 958 during the Later Zhou, possibly in Wei County or Nanle County, where his father Wang You () served as a county magistrate during that period. His ancestral home was Shen County. When he was 3 years old, the Later Zhou was overthrown and replaced by the Song dynasty. Wang Dan enjoyed studying from a young age. In 980 he passed the imperial examination with honors, and was assigned to govern Pingjiang County as a magistrate. The circuit fiscal commissioner () Zhao Changyan () was very impressed by his governing, and betrothed his daughter to Wang Dan. In 984, after completing his assignment in Pingjiang, Wang Jiang was assigned to manage the silver mine in the Tan Prefecture. Through the recommendation of Tan's prefect He Chengju (), Wang Dan was transferred to the capital Kaifeng's Palace Library, where he worked as an assistant editorial director (). He worked on the compilations Wenyuan Yinghua and Shi Lei (Ë©©È°û; \\"Poems\\"). He was promoted to assistant director of palace administration (). In 985, Wang Dan was assigned to Zheng Prefecture to serve as the controller- general (). Two years later he was transferred to Hao Prefecture. In 990, Wang Yucheng recommended him to become a circuit fiscal commissioner, but as Wang Dan preferred to work in the capital, he presented a paper and was assigned to work in the Historiography Institute. In 991, he became a drafter (), a post his father had filled just 10 years ago. He impressed many colleagues, and Li Hang () who graduated from the same examination class valued him highly. Qian Ruoshui () was convinced he could become a grand councilor. Becoming a grand councilor Zhao Guangyi (posthumously known as Emperor Taizong) died in May 997 and was succeeded by his son Zhao Heng (posthumously known as Emperor Zhenzong). Under the new monarch, Wang Dan was first made a drafter () in the Secretariat. A few months later, he became a Hanlin Academician while being put in charge of two offices: the Bureau of Personnel Evaluation () and the Memorial-Forwarding and Vetoing Office (). It was said the young emperor had rather favorable impressions of him. When Qian Ruoshui offered to retire, he was asked by the emperor to recommend someone in the central government bureaucracy for promotion. Qian Ruoshui answered that he found Wang Dan suitable for important roles because he had the requisite \\"virtues and reputations\\". The emperor replied, \\"This is exactly the person in my mind.\\" In March 1000, Wang Dan and two other Hanlin Academicians were put in charge of the imperial examination to recruit new scholar-officials. Emerging from 10 days of seclusion in the examination rooms, Wang Dan was immediately made a Supervising Secretary () in the Chancellery as well as an Administrator of the Bureau of Military Affairs. In April 1001, Wang Dan became the Vice-Director () of the Ministry of Works and Vice-Grand councilor (), which enabled him to participate in policy discussions in the Administration Chamber with the emperor. As grand councilor During Wang Dan's tenure, the civil service examination system saw some important institutionalized developments, including: *In 1007, the practice of protecting a candidate's anonymity was extended from the imperial examination in the capital to the departmental examinations in the provinces *In 1015, the Bureau of Examination Copyists () was established to copy examination papers to prevent candidates' handwriting from being recognized by examiners *Between 1007 and 1011, the official promotion system through controlled sponsorship was fully developed Although Wang Dan's role in these changes is unclear, historian Edward Kracke argued that Wang Dan must be behind them, being not only an influential grand councilor, but also an experienced examiner. Wang Dan also sponsored and recommended many talented men for promotion. At least 5 men he recommended became grand councilors: Kou Zhun (who had been grand councilor before), Li Di (), Wang Zeng (), Zhang Shixun (), and L√º Yijian ().

They are thought to be a horde or clan of the Undanbi. Language According to Tom Petrie, the word koala apparently derived from the Djindubari language, where it was called kulla. According to Archibald Meston the dialect itself was called Nhulla. Meston took down a wordlist of 300 items, together with 40 sentences to illustrate the grammar, in 1874. People Generally Europeans described the Djindubari as 'a race of tall fine men and women. The women of Bribie Island generally were described by a member of Oxley's party in 1823 as: 'Tall, straight, well-formed women, far superior in beauty to the men; in fact, to any natives of this country I have ever seen, two of them as handsome as any white women.' Their population at the earliest colonial reckoning was estimated at around 66, roughly 30 men, 16 women and 20 children. The word for the Bora ceremonial rites of initiation on Bribie Island was Dooroo. Colonial observers considered the Djindubari very warlike, regarded with terror by the tribes on the mainland opposite, and, putatively unlike the latter, given to cannibalism. Country Yarun was the name given by the Djindubari to their land, which was subsequently renamed Bribie Island. Norman Tindale regarded the Djindubari as a horde, restricted to Bribie Island, and thus a subunit of a larger tribe, the Undanbi, which he describes as occupying some of territory including the coastal land along Coolum Beach and Moreton Bay, extending from Noosa Heads southwards to the mouth of the Brisbane River, and inland for some ten miles, towards the Pine River district. They were also around the Glasshouse Mountains. The Djindubari formed part of the Gubbi Gubbi tribe. The islanders were described in the 1820s as being settled in fishing villages, composed of clusters of huts, some of them of substantial size, one being described as extending over 24 metres in length, and built with arches, rooms and passageways which, he added, 'would not have disgraced a European architect'. History of contact with whites Matthew Flinders was the first European surveyor known to have landed on the island and to have come into contact with the Djindubari. The incident took place in 1799, and a skirmish broke out, due to a misunderstanding over trading negotiations for a fishing net, in which an attempt was made to snatch Flinders' hat. As Flinders' boat drew away, sticks and, finally, a spear was thrown at them by the jeering Djindubari. Flinders, desiring to impress the islanders with his power, ordered musketeers to open fire, wounding two or three natives, who then fled. After a week, Flinders revisited the island, and it would appear no long term enmity had been aroused, since relations were described as friendly. Some Scottish sailors danced a Highland jig, while the Djindubari responded with a plaintive song that was 'musical and soothing'. Flinders remarked on their large heads, though derogatively characterising one as baboon-like. Two men of the tribe were victims of the massacre of aborigines by poisoning while they visited Kilcoy. By 1894 Meston stated that the tribe had been reduced to just one man and woman.

On 13 January 2004 the aircraft operating the flight, a Yakovlev Yak-40 registered in Uzbekistan as UK-87985, collided with a radar station while landing at Tashkent, flipped over, caught fire and exploded, killing all 37 people on board. Weather was reportedly in bad condition. Flight The Yakovlev Yak-40 was registered in Uzbekistan as UK-87985. The flight was a domestic flight from Termez, a city near the country's border with Afghanistan, to its capital airport, the Tashkent International Airport. Termez became a major hub for humanitarian aid into northern Afghanistan after the start of the War on Terror in 2001. German troops had also been using the airport in Termez as a support base for peacekeeping troops in Afghanistan. The flight was nearly fully loaded, carrying 32 passengers and 5 crew. The flight crew consisted of Captain Alexander Alexan, First Officer Rustam Ilyasov, Flight Instructor Akmal Kamalov and Flight Engineer Noel Kurmaev. The aircraft was cleared to land by controllers at Tashkent at around 1900 hours local time. The area was in full darkness and the weather had deteriorated significantly, with the airport being shrouded in fog that limited visibility on the ground to 1300 meters. 12.5 km from the airport, Flight 1154 increased its rate of descent, bringing it below the glideslope. The crew then maintained level flight until they become nearer to the airport. As the plane approached the threshold of the runway, it was still 30 to 40 meters above ground level, when it should have been less than half that height and in landing configuration. When the pilots became aware that they were running out of runway, they increased engine power, but it was too late for the aircraft to climb and go around. The right wing of the aircraft struck either a radio beacon or a stanchion of approach lights, which tore off the wing, and then hit a concrete wall, losing the left wing. Flight 1154 then flipped over and exploded. Rescue services reached the crash site, but found no survivors. Responses Immediately after the crash, Uzbek police sealed off the crash site. Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov visited the crash site and talked with rescue workers. Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyayev and his aides had arrived at Tashkent airport and approached relatives of the victims and led them to a room. Several hours after the crash, Tashkent International Airport was closed due to foggy condition. Investigation The government ordered a full investigation into the crash. Early indication suggested that bad weather was the cause of the accident. Officials stated that there were no evidence of foul play in the crash. In his 2006 book, Murder in Samarkand, however, former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, wrote that the scene of the crash and the bodies of the victims had been tampered with by Uzbek officials and that \\"there was never any attempt at a proper investigation\\". In 2008, a former Uzbek spy, Ikrom Yakubov, alleged that the plane crashed had been engineered by the Uzbek leadership, lending credibility to the position long held by activists and critics. Yakubov appeared in August 2009 on BBC's Newsnight. Ambassador Murray was quoted in 2008, regarding the Conroy case, by Radio Free Europe: \\"These are not fanciful allegations.

The Immunoscore has been internationally validated in colorectal cancer and provides better prognostic information than the current staging system, TNM. In other malignancies the Immunoscore has not yet been validated. It is based on Jerome Galon's finding from 2006 which revealed a positive association of cytotoxic and memory T cells with survival of colorectal cancer patients.  Introduction  The most common system for classifying the extent of spread of cancer is the TNM classification, which has been used for over 80 years. However, its prognostic accuracy is limited and clinical outcome can significantly vary among patients within the same tumor stage. This method fails to incorporate the effects of the host immune response and focus only on the tumor cells. From the beginning of 21st century, growing evidences supports the important role of the immune system in cancer surveillance and clearance. The ability to avoid immune destruction has been introduced as a hallmark of cancer. Immunoscore incorporates the effects of the host immune response into cancer classification and improves prognostic accuracy. It measures the density of two T lymphocyte populations (CD3/CD8, CD3/CD45RO or CD8/CD45RO) in the center and at the periphery of the tumor. The Immunoscore provides a score ranging from 0 (I0) when low densities of both cell types are found in both regions, to Immunoscore 4 (I4) when high densities are found in both regions.

He later served at Launceston, Tasmania and Queenscliff, Victoria. History Gardner was born in Glasgow, the third son of Rev. William Gardner and his wife Catharine Gardner, n√©e Jarvie. He was educated at Glasgow University for the ministry of the Scottish Church, and after being licensed to preach by the Glasgow presbytery served as assistant to Rev. Robert Smith of Lochwinnoch, one of whose sons was Robert Barr Smith of Adelaide. Gardner's first charge was St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, which opened in Conway Street, Birkenhead, Cheshire in 1840. He married Catherine Forrest in 1844. The Presbyterian Church in Adelaide, whose pastor from 1839 was Dr. Ralph Drummond, started with a meeting house on Angas Street then a building in Gouger Street, close to Victoria Square. This church, as elsewhere, was affected by the \\"Disruption of 1843\\", when Rev. Dr. Thomas Chalmers founded the Free Church of Scotland. Many members, notably Thomas Elder and his brother Capt. William Elder, decided to establish their own church on Chalmers' \\"non-intrusionist\\" principles, and in 1849 asked the Colonial Committee of the Free Church of Scotland to find them a suitable minister. The position was offered to Gardner, who accepted, and with his wife, three children and a servant sailed to Adelaide aboard the Condor, arriving in March 1850. He took advantage of the ship's stopover at Port Melbourne to preach in the John Knox Church, Swanston Street. His first three services were held in the Pulteney Street schoolroom (later Pulteney Grammar School), followed by a room at the rear of the Freemasons' Tavern, then with the swelling of his congregation rented J. B. Neales' Exchange Room in King William Street. Shortly after his arrival, Gardner initiated the purchase from (later Sir) John Morphett of the prominent site on the corner of North Terrace and Pulteney Street, appointed English & BrownThomas English and Henry Brown as architects and builders, laid the foundation stone for what was to become Chalmers' Church on 3 September 1850 and held the first service there on 6 July 1851. Sharing the pulpit was Rev. John Anderson, whom Gardner had persuaded the Strathalbyn Presbyterians to call from Scotland. He was one of the signatories to the deed which signified the union of the three branches of the Presbyterian Churches in Adelaide on 10 May 1865: John Gardner (Chalmers Church), Robert Haining (St. Andrew's, Wakefield Street), John Anderson (Strathalbyn), James Gordon (Gawler), James Lyall (Flinders Street), W. Davidson (Clare), Alexander Law (Mount Barker), and James Moddich (Mount Pleasant) After 18 years' service to the Adelaide congregation, Gardner accepted a call to St. Andrew's Church, Launceston, Tasmania, which at the time had a very strong and wealthy congregation. South Australia was at the time experiencing a financial recession, and the Adelaide church was unable to compete even remotely with the very generous ¬£600 (perhaps $100,000 in today's money) stipend offered by St. Andrew's. Before they left Adelaide, Mrs. Gardner was presented with an album of photographs of prominent SA citizens and church members taken by the Townsend Duryea studio. Gardner left for Launceston on the Coorong in October 1868. No sooner had he arrived than he was embroiled in a dispute with the Managers of St. Andrew's, and was not inducted until December 1868. A protracted state of hostility between Gardner and an influential section of the congregation resulted in declining attendance at services with concomitant reduction in collections and pew rents, and after the initial contract period elapsed his stipend was halved. Secret meetings held by church Managers and the Committee of Advice and Co-operation resulted in demands that Gardner resign, which he refused to do, demanding to be presented publicly with a list of accusations. Unable to dislodge their pastor, his antagonists (which constituted a majority, and the whole of the Sunday school), and abetted by the Rev. John Storie of Hobart, established competing services in the Town Hall next door. At a Kirk Session constituted for the purpose, Gardner met with his accusers at which the church Managers and Rev. Storie were largely discredited. The respected Rev. Robert Russell was brought in as an intermediary, and Gardner finally accepted an offer of ¬£200 for his resignation, and in October 1874 he left Launceston for the seaside town of Queenscliff, Victoria, where he had been offered the Presbyterian pastorate. A complication arose as the official \\"call\\" had been sent care of Rev. Storie, who neglected to pass it on to Gardner, but a way was found to circumvent this lapse of protocol. > People of all classes were sorry when he left [Adelaide], and will be > gratified if in Victoria his experiences are more pleasant than they have > been in Launceston, if, in fact, his lot becomes more like what it was in > South Australia. He was more a man of war than of peace, more resembled a > stormy petrel than a dove, yet had a warm heart and sympathizing nature. In > him extremes met, and folk who relished his oft scathing style of platform > utterances knew that under a rough exterior there was a cordial and kindly > nature. He had no time for those who attempted to reconcile scientific knowledge with Biblical Truth: > Men might say that science proved that the world was not made in six days, > but whatever science might say, he had more respect for the word of God. > They had the fourth commandment to guide them, which ... distinctly states > that in six days the Lord created the heavens and earth, on the seventh day > be rested. ... I know Hebrew better than Hugh Miller ... all the Christian > churches hold that it means a day of 24 hours. ... All acquainted with the > philosophy know that it is the negation as nearly as possible of Christian > truth, and the denial of the Bible as an authoritative standard. Gardner was elected Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly of Victoria for the year 1883‚Äì1884. During this period Rev. Charles Strong was dismissed as a minister of the Victorian Church for his casual association with Judge Higinbotham. The congregation at Queenscliff apparently had no difficulty with Gardner's reactionary character and when he retired he and Mrs Gardner were given a generous farewell. Mrs. Gardner died at their Malvern, Victoria home three years later. Gardner lived with his unmarried daughter until his death.

Built about 1787, it is one of the oldest surviving houses in northeastern Vermont, and one of the best-preserved early houses in Barnet. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Phineas Thurston House stands in a rural area of northeastern Barnet, on the west side of Old Silo Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A single- story ell extends to the north, ending in two carriage bays with keystoned arched openings. The main facade is five bays wide, with nine-over-six sash windows, and a center entrance with an original paneled door and transom window. The interior follows a typical central-chimney plan, although the chimney itself has been removed. The entrance opens into a narrow vestibule, with a winding stair to the attic level, with chambers on either side of the chimney space. There are three rooms along the rear, traditionally a pantry and borning room. The ell housed the summer kitchen. The interior retains much original woodwork and decorative features, with restorative work performed using period materials from other houses. with Barnet was first settled in 1770, but significant growth did not begin until after the American Revolutionary War. Phineas Thurston was part of that wave of settlement, arriving in 1787. He purchased of land, and probably built this house within the following year, using lumber from a recently established nearby sawmill. Based on a survey of period Cape houses in the region performed in 1976, this is one of the best-preservered, and is particularly distinguished by its early ell and carriage bays. The house has been separated in ownership from the surrounding land, which is still used for agriculture.

Early life and career  Romeo Oliva was born in Vallo della Lucania, in the province of Salerno, in 1889, and entered in the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1907, graduating in 1911 with the rank of Ensign.Paolo Alberini, Franco Prosperini, Dizionario biografico Uomini della Marina 1861-1946, Ufficio Storico della Marina Militare, p. 386. Between 1911 and 1912 he participated in the Italo-Turkish War, first on board the battleship Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and then on cruiser Amerigo Vespucci. In 1913-1914 he served with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant on the armored cruiser Marco Polo, stationed in China, after which he was assigned the Regia Marina detachment in Beijing until 24 May 1915, the date of Italy's entry into World War I. Back in Italy, he was first embarked on the scout cruiser Cesare Rossarol and then, in October 1916 (after becoming Lieutenant), on the submarine H 1, as executive officer. In December 1917 he received his first command, the submarine F 18. He served in the submarine branch for the next ten years. For his activities during the First World War, Oliva received two Silver Medals of Military Valor and one Bronze Medal of Military Valor. In 1923 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and four years later to Commander; after a period of shore assignments, at the direction of munitions La Spezia and in the Ministry of the Navy, in 1932 he was appointed commander of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. In 1935 he became Captain and was given command of the heavy cruiser Gorizia, also becoming Chief of Staff of the First Naval Division, until 1937. In 1938-1939 he was Head of Cabinet of the Minister of the Navy, and in January 1939 he was promoted to Rear Admiral and appointed chief of Staff of the 2nd Naval Squadron.  World War II and aftermath  On 1 August 1940, two months after the entry of Italy into World War II, Oliva became deputy commander of the Submarine Squadron Command (the Italian submarine fleet), and in 1941 he was promoted to Vice Admiral.Sommergibilisti decorati con l'Ordine Militare d'Italia. On April 24, 1943 he left the submarine service and was appointed commander of the 7th Naval Division (with flag on the light cruiser Eugenio di Savoia), replacing Admiral Alberto Da Zara. In August 1943, during the last stages of the battle for Sicily, Admiral Luigi Sansonetti contacted Admiral Carlo Bergamini to submit him a plan of attack against the Allied fleet anchored in Palermo and Bona. In fact the planned attack was mostly intended to overcome the friction that were being created between the Italian and German forces, showing that the Regia Marina could still take the initiative.Francesco Mattesini, La Marina e l'8 settembre, p. 96. The ships (light cruisers of the 7th and 8th Naval Divisions) would sail from Genoa, making a stop in La Maddalena (Sardinia) to deceive the enemy about their true intentions, and then shelling the ports of Palermo and Bona. When Bergamini received these orders, he expressed his opposition to the operation against Bona, because, in his view, chances of a successful outcome would be low.Francesco Mattesini, La Marina e l'8 settembre, p. 100. He thereafter proposed at least to reverse the tasks assigned to the two divisions to be deployed, using the faster 7th Division against Bona and the 8th against Palermo. Bergamini also explained his doubts to Admiral Giuseppe Sparzani, and therefore on that evening he was contacted by Sansonetti, who told him of the temporary suspension of all operations.Francesco Mattesini, La Marina e l'8 settembre, p. 101. On August 4, it was decided that the operation would only target the port of Palermo, where, according to aerial reconnaissance, there was a considerable concentration of enemy shipping.Francesco Mattesini, La Marina e l'8 settembre, p. 102. The operation began on August 6; the 7th Division, under the command of Admiral Oliva, ventured near the island of Ustica, where it met a small convoy of British landing craft. Oliva ordered to open fire on them, but soon after, realizing he had compromised the surprise, he reversed course and returned to La Spezia.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940-1943, pp. 404-405. On September 9, 1943, following the announcement of the armistice of Cassibile, Oliva set sail from La Spezia heading for La Maddalena with his Seventh Division, as part of the squadron of Admiral Bergamini. When a German air attack, on that afternoon, sank the battleship Roma, causing the death of Admiral Bergamini, Oliva found herself to be the most senior officer left in the squadron, and therefore took command, taking responsibility and the task of fulfilling the armistice orders.Arrigo Petacco, La flotta si arrende, in La nostra guerra 1940-1945. L'avventura bellica tra bugie e verit√†, p. 178. In compliance with the armistice terms, he raised the black flag, had blacks circles drawn on the decks, and sailed towards Bona, in Algeria, as Supermarina had ordered; he managed to convince Admiral Luigi Biancheri, reluctant to follow such orders, to do the same.Gianni Rocca, Fucilate gli ammiragli. La tragedia della marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale, p. 309. Off the Algerian coast he met the Allied naval squadron carrying Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham and General Dwight Eisenhower; the Italian fleet then headed for Malta, where it arrived on September 11. Here Oliva passed the command to Admiral Da Zara, his senior, who had come from Taranto with a naval group consisting of the battleship Caio Duilio, the light cruiser Luigi Cadorna and Pompeo Magno and the destroyer Nicoloso da Recco. Oliva left the command of the 7th Division on 1 September 1944, during the co-belligerence, and in February 1945 he was given command of the Southern Tyrrhenian Naval Department (headquartered in Naples), which he held until September 1946, a year after the war's end. Meanwhile, he was promoted to Admiral. He subsequently commanded the Taranto Naval Department until March 1948, and then was commander in chief of the fleet of the newly formed Marina Militare until 14 December 1950. He left the active service on 1 January 1952 after reaching the age limits, and died in Rome on May 17, 1975.

In 2013, at the age of 25 years old, he became the subject of international media attention after his $100 million divorce in the province of Quebec was made public. The case files of the divorce revealed a considerable amount of assets which were being dissimulated around the world. According to data compiled by the Bloomberg Agency, Mr. Babikian is alleged to have caused as much as $3 billion in losses for investors in North America and around the world through the website Awesome Penny Stocks. The manipulation may have involved as many as 38 companies. The level of sophistication and success earned him the nickname \\"Wolf of Montreal\\" after Jordan Belfort who is called \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" with the famous eponymous movie. The companies being manipulated were often obscure OTC companies that had shares priced at just pennies. The e-mails which touted those companies helped inflate the price of the shares and brought high liquidity to otherwise illiquid stocks.In 2012, for example, Babikian touted the shares of a pharmaceutical company. The company's market value grew by $700 million in two months. After the emails stopped, the price of the shares collapsed.  The investigation  Babikian's blatant manipulations drew attention of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 13, 2014 the SEC brought civil charges against him alleging that he pumped the shares of a small company, America West Resources and sold $1.9 million of shares to unsuspecting investors in under 90 minutes. FINRA brought separate charges against an alleged partner of Babikian, stockbroker Thomas Belesis, for selling ahead of his clients on the same company and was eventually disbarred. The SEC and Revenue Quebec ordered a freeze on some of his assets which included * $50 million Global 5000 private plane * $2.5 million Bugatti Veyron * $1.5 million Pagani Huayra * Bentley * Lamborghini * BMW X6M * $10 million house in Hollywood Hills * $2.3 million house in Beverly Hills * A dozen apartments in the Atlantis Bahamas hotel * $5 million house in Montreal, Canada * $10 million house vineyard in Oregon * 300+ bottle of rare wines valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars According to the SEC, in 2012, Babikian left Canada with a tax burden in excess of $4 million and never came back and is currently believed to be living in Russia. Letters sent to five addresses linked to Babikian went unanswered and his attorney, Stanley Morris, based out of Santa Monica, California, refused to comment. John Babikian's former partner Eric Van Nguyen faced similar charges in the United States. John Babikian has yet to face any charges in his native province of Qu√©bec.  Big cars and frozen wealth  According to Le Journal de Montr√©al, before the events occurred, Babikian was planning to build a 17,000-square-foot house in Laval, QC, with estimated construction costs of around $13 million. The house was to be built on a plot of approximately 61,000 square meters and would have contained six bathrooms, five bedrooms, three kitchens, a cigar lounge, a private gym, a massage salon, outdoor spill board, library, bar and garage big enough for nine cars.

He has been a UKIP candidate in both the 2015 and the 2017 general election. He served as the national UKIP co-ordinator for Vote Leave, the official leave campaign during the European Union referendum.  Early life  Hunter-Clarke was born in Boston, Lincolnshire. He was brought up in the nearby town of Skegness. At the age of 17, in 2009, he joined the Conservative Party. He went on to become the youngest elected Skegness town councillor at the age of 18.  Education  Hunter-Clarke attended Skegness Grammar School, before studying Law at the University of Chester.  Student activity and early political career  In the May 2011 local elections, Hunter-Clarke was elected as a Skegness town councillor as a Conservative. He defected to the United Kingdom Independence Party in September 2012 at the party's national conference in Birmingham, making him the only UKIP member of Skegness town council. In the May 2013 local elections, he was the UKIP candidate for the Skegness South Seat ward for Lincolnshire County Council. He took the seat, beating the incumbent Conservative councillor, while his father Dean Hunter-Clarke won the Skegness North Seat for UKIP. Hunter-Clarke won the seat whilst reading Law at the University of Chester which caused some controversy at the time. Hunter-Clarke insisted he would be able to combine his studies with being a County Councillor in Lincolnshire. Hunter-Clarke was elected onto UKIP's National Executive Committee in 2014. Hunter-Clarke left UKIP in September 2018.  Political career  It was announced on 20 November 2014 that Hunter-Clarke, then 22, was to become UKIP's parliamentary candidate in the seat of Boston & Skegness. It was a key seat for the party, but Hunter- Clarke was ultimately defeated by the Telegraph journalist, Matt Warman. After the general election Hunter-Clarke became the national UKIP co-ordinator for Vote Leave Ltd. This prompted UKIP to release a statement as the party was currently backing neither Vote Leave nor Grassroots Out for the Electoral Commission designation. Hunter-Clarke was Neil Hamilton's agent for the National Assembly for Wales election in May 2016. On Hamilton's election he made Hunter-Clarke his personal chief of staff. After Hamilton was elected as the group leader, Hunter-Clarke became chief of staff for the group. Hunter- Clarke announced his intention to stand in the Sleaford & North Hykeham by- election, a neighbouring seat to Boston & Skegness, but later withdrew from the contest. In June 2018 Hunter-Clarke was dismissed as the group's Chief of Staff in the National Assembly for Wales after Caroline Jones AM ousted Neil Hamilton AM as the Leader of the UKIP Group. Hunter-Clarke consequently took Caroline Jones and the UKIP Assembly Members to an employment tribunal. At a preliminary hearing on 28 February 2019 the Assembly Commission, Michelle Brown AM and Caroline Jones AM failed in their applications to be removed as respondents in the case. The case continues and a three-day preliminary hearing has been listed to be heard in June 2019. On 3rd/4/5 June 2019 a three day hearing took place in Pontypridd to determine who in fact employed Hunter- Clarke, as still no-one admitted to being his boss. On 4 June it was suggested that Hunter-Clarke had indeed not been dismissed and therefore was entitled to a year's back pay. Following the evidence heard Hunter-Clarke withdrew his claims against the National Assembly for Wales, Caroline Jones AM and the UKIP Group. This left Neil Hamilton AM as the sole respondent in the case. Hunter- Clarke's representative subsequently outlined that it was now clear 'Mr Hamilton was trying to make a political point at Mr Hunter-Clarke's expense'.  Elections  In the May 2013 local elections, Hunter-Clarke was elected to Lincolnshire County Council representing the Skegness South Division. He did not seek re-election. In the May 2015 general election, Hunter-Clarke stood as the UKIP candidate for Boston & Skegness achieving UKIP's second best result nationally polling 34% of the vote. Hunter-Clarke was selected as the UKIP candidate for Pontypridd in the 2017 general election, but was defeated by the incumbent, Owen Smith.

To their west were the Wakka Wakka people, the Gubbi Gubbi were to their north, divided from them by the Mary River. East towards the coast was the southern Undanbi clan of the Ningy Ningy who, together with the Djindubari on Bribie Island, the Dalla referred to as 'Saltwater people' (Mwoirnewar). Social system The Dalla traditionally comprised five clans: * (1) Dalla (alternatively called the Dalambara, Dallanbarah, Ngoera). These inhabited the headwaters of the Mary and Brisbane rivers * (2) The Dungidau, (a language name) centred in the Kilcoy region * (3) The Nalbo (also called Njalbo, Nalboo) inhabited the eastern foothills from Eumundi south as far as Beerwah and Coobalture. * (4) The Dungibara (Doongibarra, Doongiburra) were on the Upper Pine River and the D'Aguilar Range. * (5) The Garumga (also written Garumnga, Garumgma) lay west of the Brisbane River as far as Crows Nest and the Cooyar Range, with a southern limit at Esk. Food The Dalla lived in an ecologically rich environment, flush with kangaroo, possum, bandicoot, echidnas, goanna, scrub turkey and a rich assortment of birdlife. The rivers yielded freshwater turtle, cod, eels, mussels and crayfish. The native grasses were harvested for seeds and nuts and bread was made from fern roots. Roasted and crushed river chestnuts, once soaked, were mixed with honey for cakes. Cunjevoi seeds, once leached of their toxins, were also used to make cakes that were a sidedish for eating with roasted game. Other vegetables in their diet were a waterlily with a flavour not unlike that of an artichoke, pencil orchid roots and wild yams. They had access to a native passionfruit, limes, oranges and quandong berries, eaten after they had been sweetened in sand pits. Most prized was the bunya nut which flourished in the region. The ripeness of bunya nuts was signaled by the onset of bark loss in stands of sugar and white gums. Messages were sent to relatives and nearby tribes to meet up and feast on the harvested nuts at bush clearing set in the mountains as Baroon Pocket, a site described as a paradise in the wilderness by a German missionary who saw it, and one now flooded out by the Baroon Pocket Dam. This intertribal feasting was reciprocated by the coastal peoples who, when the Blue Mountain lorikeets showed up on the Brisbane river, who alert hinterland tribes like the Dalla that mullet (and flounder, bream and whiting) were now running in the bay, ready for fishing. The Dalla would camp on the shores of Moreton Bay and join the culling, which included huge quantities of oysters, so plentiful that they were dredged up by the ton to be burnt for lime when whites settled there. History of contact with whites A late attempt at salvage ethnology undertaken by Lindsay Page Winterbotham who, supported and advised by Norman Tindale, conducted over several years (1950-1955) in-depth interviews with a Jinibara man, Gaiarbau (Willie Mackenzie) which resulted in a massive manuscript conserving Dalla traditions and music which, on failing to get published, he entrusted to the Queensland Museum. * Ngoera * Jarbu.

The existing structure was completed in 1923 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1922, a major upgrading of the highway between Adamana and the Arizona state line with New Mexico. As part of this upgrade, bridges were proposed to cross the Puerco River, near the Indian settlements of Allentown and Sanders, as well as a smaller structure over the Lupton Arroyo near Lupton. Without the bridges over the Puerco, vehicles had to wait for waters to subside to a point where they could ford the river. The wait could reach up to 24 hours. AHD engineered a design for the structures, the design for the bridge near Allentown called for a medium-span deck truss with twenty-foot cantilevered ends. On January 1, 1923 AHD announced bids for all three structures. A Denver construction company, the Midland Bridge Company, was awarded the contract for the Allentown bridge. At a total cost of $11,675, funding was supplied from an Apache County bond issue as well as money from the state road fund. Construction began on January 17 and was completed on July 11. After completion, this stretch of highway would become part of the road later designated U.S. Highway 66. Due to a realignment of U.S. 66 in 1931, the Allentown bridge, along with the Sanders bridge, were no longer on the route. Today the bridge only carries local traffic on the Navajo Nation. Structure left The substructure of the bridge consists of concrete abutments and solid concrete piers, while the superstructure is made of a riveted steel 9-panel Pratt deck truss, with both its ends cantilevered. There are steel lattice guardrails, with timber stringer/pile approach spans on both sides. It is a single span of 90 feet in length and 15.2 feet in width, with a total length of 206 feet. On September 30, 1988, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the earliest bridges with a deck truss design which was built by the State Engineer and, with the Little Hell Canyon Bridge, is one of the two earliest deck truss bridges in the state. The cantilevered ends are unique in Arizona among trusses built for vehicular process.

Allofeeding refers to a parent, sibling or unrelated adult bird feeding altricial hatchlings, which are dependent on parental care for their survival. Allofeeding also refers to food sharing between adults of the same species. Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, courtship, egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care. Allofeeding evolved for different reasons in different species of birds. While sagebrush Brewer's sparrows allofeed to reduce predation during incubation, Sichuan jays allofeed to increase a female's nutritional level prior to egg laying, and chinstrap penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding. While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well- being of the chicks. Arabian babblers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the king penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be altruistic and highly revered. And the far more practical barn owl, of course, peer allofeeds merely to reduce sibling rivalry/competition during meal times. Although many species of birds exhibit allofeeding, there are some species that do not perform allofeeding, such as the Siberian jay.  Allofeeding between mates  Many species of migratory songbirds display allofeeding during the incubation period. During the incubation period, a male songbird will feed its mate through beak-to-beak interaction, while she sits on the eggs. This allofeeding behaviour is suggested to be adaptive because the male is indirectly investing in its offspring. The male uses its energy to forage and retrieve food, and to feed the female. This behaviour of the male reduces the nutritional stress of the female, because it reduces the amount of time the female spends foraging. In addition, the allofeeding behaviour decreases the number of times a female has to leave the nest, which in turn extends the incubation period and reduces the risk of the nest being detected by a predator. Overall, allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased fitness and is therefore considered advantageous. However, Nolan (1958) theorizes that allofeeding is non-adaptive and is derived from anticipatory parental care. Allofeeding during the incubation period can also transpire through both the male and the female interchangeably feeding each other via beak-to-beak interactions, while a mate receiving the food incubates the eggs. Once feeding is completed, the recipient now becomes the feeder and the mate that was just foraging incubates the eggs. For example, sagebrush Brewer's sparrows (Spizella breweri breweri) allofeed in this manner. A recent study by Halley et al., 2015, examined allofeeding in twenty-four nests of sagebrush Brewer's sparrows. This study revealed that allofeeding occurred at low frequencies (55%) in nests with biparental incubation and no allofeeding occurred in uniparental nests. This study suggests that allofeeding is an intraspecific signal required to maintain social bonds between mates, in addition to increasing the nutrition levels of females and concealment of the nest. Furthermore, the study found that incubation sessions per hour were higher in biparental nests with allofeeding than in biparental nests without allofeeding. These findings indicate that allofeeding is beneficial because it reduces the risk of predation from visually oriented predators through increased nest concealment, which can maximize the fitness of males while increasing the fitness of females. There have been many documented observations of allofeeding between mates (mate allofeeding). However, in penguins allofeeding between mates is rare. In 2010, allofeeding was reported for chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica) during the period of chick guarding. The researchers witnessed a male feeding a female, which had a large chick in its nest. The behaviour was engaged by the female frequently pecking the side of the male's bill to stimulate the male to regurgitate its food. This resulted in the male regurgitating its food into the female's open mouth. This allofeeding behaviour was identical to the manner in which a chick begs its parent for food. Notably, during this behaviour the female kept the attention of the male when the chick tried to gain the male's attention. It is proposed that mate allofeeding in chinstrap penguins was performed to strengthen the bond between the pair. Allofeeding between mates can also occur during courtship. Courtship allofeeding occurs in half of bird subfamilies and mainly appears in monogamous bird species. Courtship allofeeding is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs or increase a female's nutritional level before laying eggs. For example, in the Sichuan jay (P. internigrans), females are fed by only one male during courtship. It is suggested that allofeeding the female during courtship increases a female's nutritional level before egg laying. This behaviour was also recorded in Canada jays (P. canadensis).  Allofeeding and parental care   Aptenodytes patagonicus  Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feeding its offspring A parent feeding a non-biological chick via bill-to-bill interactions is a form of allofeeding. Parental allofeeding occurs in all altricial species of birds to ensure proper growth, development, and to prevent starvation of their offspring. This form of allofeeding has been shown to be a form of parental care in some species, such as in king penguins (A. patagonicus). King penguins are pelagic seabirds. King penguin chicks form dense groups called cr√®ches during winter for social thermoregulation when food availability is low. The formation of cr√®ches results from the parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks to gather food from the sea. A study by Lecomte et al., 2015 examined the allofeeding behaviour in king penguins, in which they marked the white underbellies of 74 non-breeding adults and 103 breeding pairs with a unique dark colouring called dye-mark code of Nyanzol-D. Lecomte et al. (2015) found 22% of the marked adults feed 65% of the chicks in cr√®ches, revealing that allofeeding behaviour was most common during the breeding season. Lecomte et al. (2015) also identified that most of the 22% of adult king penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour were unable to successfully breed along with few breeders performing the behaviour. The allofeeding behaviour resulted in more feedings for chicks, which is consistent with study by Pierre et al. (1994) that showed that allofeeding in penguins increases the chick growth rate from 35g/day to 190g/day. From these results, Lecomte et al. (2015) concluded that allofeeding increased the survival rate of chicks in cr√®ches. The results imply that parental allofeeding in king penguins is an altruistic behaviour, where allofeeding benefits the young at a cost to the non-biological parent. Notably, no direct benefits to the non-biological parents have been described. The cost of allofeeding non-biological chicks resulted in no detrimental effects to the fitness of the alloparent, because the cost of allofeeding is low (several grams) when compared to the nutritional costs of an adult king penguin, which is several kilograms. However, it is suggested that allofeeding many chicks may cost each chick lost meals that can cause negative effects on the fitness of allofed chicks. In addition, allofeeding decreases when non-biological parents had offspring.  Pygoscelis antarcticus  The chinstrap penguin (P. antarcticus) is another species of penguin that displays parental allofeeding. Allofeeding in the chinstrap penguin has been observed between the female and its offspring. Similar to mate allofeeding in this species, the offspring of a female will peck the side of the female's bill to signal the female to regurgitate its food into the chick's open mouth.  Perisoreus internigrans  In Sichuan jays (P. internigrans), females are not the only sex that participates in the allofeeding of their offspring. During their first week of life, the chicks are only fed by the male. The male forages and stores food in a pouch within its throat. At the nest, the male regurgitates the semi-digested food from its pouch into the mouths of its chicks. After the first week, the male continues to feed the chicks while the female begins feeding the chicks. The female uses the same method as the male.  Peer allofeeding   Turdoides sqamiceps  There have been many reported cases of allofeeding between siblings in several species of birds. For example, the Arabian babblers (T. sqamiceps) are a territorial, desert-inhabiting species of bird that participate in cooperative breeding. In this species, non- breeders show numerous types of cooperative behaviour, including allofeeding. Adult and immature babblers, as well as previous and newly fledged babblers, will frequently engage in allofeeding behaviour. Carlisle et al. (1986) revealed that Arabian babblers participate in peer allofeeding in order to increase social rank, which increases fitness. This allofeeding behaviour is supported by the Zahavi's hypothesis. An individual (a dominant babbler) can increase in social rank by allofeeding a subordinate babbler. On the contrary, an individual (a subordinate babbler) can decrease in social rank when they are allofed by a dominant babbler. Subordinate babblers have been observed refusing to be allofed by a dominant babbler. The refusal resulted in the dominate babbler becoming aggressive with the subordinate ‚Äì hitting or chasing the subordinate. Dominate babblers also showed the same aggressive behaviours when a subordinate tried to allofeed it.  Tyto alba  Another species that exhibits peer allofeeding is the barn owl (T. alba). Barn owl nest siblings establish a hierarchy for the sharing of food resources via vocal negotiations. It is suggested that barn owl nest siblings show peer allofeeding to reduce sibling competition in the food sharing hierarchy. Peer allofeeding observed in 60 nestling pairs revealed that the behaviour occurs by a donor sibling placing the food item on the ground in front of the receiver sibling, which transfers the food item to its bill using its talons. Alternatively, the donor sibling uses its bill to place the food item in the bill of the receiver sibling. As well, peer allofeeding behaviour in barn owl siblings is proposed to increase the inclusive fitness of the peer performing the allofeeding.  Intraspecific allofeeding   Perisoreus internigrans  Canada jays (Perisoreus canadensis) feeding offspring at the nest Intraspecific allofeeding in Sichuan jays (P. internigrans) is performed during the nestling and fledging period by non-breeders. One to three non- breeders support a nesting breeding pair by feeding the chicks, regurgitating the food from their throat pouches. In 2009, Jing et al. determined that two non-breeders contributed to 44% of feedings in the nest of two Sichuan jays. Jing et al. (2009) suggest that allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased nest survival. In Sichuan jays, allofeeding is hypothesized to be evolutionary selected. In this species, two to three non-breeders will allofeed the young of a breeding pair. The large body mass (21% heavier than Siberian jays) of the Sichuan jays, and the presence of more than one non-breeder, allows one non-breeder to ward off a predator while another non-breeder protects the young from additional predators. Both the large body mass of the non-breeders and the presence of multiple non-breeders reduce the risk of injury or death when predators are encountered. This reveals that the benefits of allofeeding the young outweigh the cost of injury or death of the non-breeder and/or chick when more than one non-breeder is present. Peer allofeeding has also been observed in the Canada jay (P. canadensis). In the gray jay, non-breeders allofeed the young after fledging. Not all species of jays allofeed their young, such as the Siberian jay (P. infaustus). In Siberian jays, non-breeders do not allofeed the chicks of a breeding pair. It is predicted that Siberian jays do not display allofeeding because the cost of predation is too high. Siberian jays are continuously threatened by a more dangerous predators, the Eurasian sparrowhawk and northern goshawk, than Canada jays, which are threatened by the Eurasian red squirrel. One non-breeder per breeding pair and the small size (21% less body mass than the Sichuan jays) of the Siberian jays, in combination with continuous risk of predation, reveals that the non- breeding Siberian jays are unable to confront predators and protect the nest simultaneously. This indicates that the cost of allofeeding the young is more costly to the non-breeder when one non-breeder is present, because an encounter with a predator increases the risk of injury and death of both the young and the non-breeder. This reveals that the benefit of allofeeding the young does not exceed the cost of injury or death of non-breeder and/or young. This is consistent with the predator-avoidance hypothesis, suggesting that the cost of allofeeding in the Siberian jays prevents allofeeding from being evolutionary selected.

Background Bharuch was a major trading port on the west coast of India. As Bharuch was an old settlement of Parsis, there were a considerable number of Parsis in the town. Behram Mowbed, the younger brother of Zanhosht Mowbed, was one of the early priests to settle in Bharuch. A tower of silence in Bharuch was established in 1309. There was a riot in Bombay six months before the event. Riot On 10 May 1857, just five days after the beginning of the Indian rebellion of 1857, a Parsi named Bejonji Sheriaiji Bharucha was accused of disrespecting a mosque by some Muslims and the riots broke out. After five days, 200 Muslims gathered near Bawa Rahan shrine in the north of the town. The police approached but were unable to stop the mob. The mob attacked Dastur Kamdin Dar-e Mihr, a fire temple, and killed its High Priest, Ervad Ardeshir Hormazdji Kamdin. They lynched Bejonji Sheriaiji Bharucha and dragged his body for several lanes. They also attacked Shapurji Narielwala Fire Temple (consecrated in 1783) and also injured its High Priest, Ervad Meherwanji Muncherji Kamdin. Mr. Davies, the Megistrate of Bharuch and the Collector, could not stop the riots. The troops were brought in from nearby towns of Vagra, Amod, Ankleshwar and Hansot. Lt. Richardson led the British contingent sent to bring the peace. Aftermath The Parsis of Bharuch petitioned the Chief of Police of the Bombay Presidency, Bettington, on 19 May 1857 to examine the role of Head Constable. They also petitioned the Governor's Council to establish a commission for investigation. They told Parsi Panchayat to use their influence. Alexander Kinloch Forbes, the Sessions Judge, sentenced imprisonments to 39 out of 61 persons arrested. Two were hanged for the killing of Bharucha and the High Priest. The riots were examined in their connection with the rebellion in 1857 by historians. Taking advantage of the situation, there were attempts to incite the Muslim population to organise disturbance against the British government by the rebels. There was another riot between Parsis and Muslims on 26 November 1885 when a land to build Dargah was not granted by the authorities. As there were Parsi members in the Municipal Council, they were accused for not granting. Khasumate Gujarat (August 1858), compiled by a school teacher, Ervad Kaikhushru Pestonji Vakil, in Gujarati, gives a detailed account of the event.

He attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in London in 1975 and completed Swedish National Defence College's management course in 1976. Schuback was promoted to captain (kommend√∂r) and seagoing unit commander in 1974 and to rear admiral and chief of staff of the Upper Norrland Military District (Milo √ñN) in 1976. He was Vice Chief of the Defence Staff in 1977 and was promoted to vice admiral and Chief of the Defence Staff in 1978. After the Soviet submarine U137 ran aground in Blekinge archipelago in 1981, Schuback in his role as chief of the Defence Staff, had to recreate the Swedish anti- submarine warfare capabilities. New equipment and tactical instructions for the new units were developed under severe time pressure, a strong media pressure and with limited financial resources. Schuback was appointed military commander of the Southern Military District (Milo S) in 1982 and Chief of the Navy in 1984. He retired and left his post in 1990. After retirement, he devoted much of his time to the Foundation Ymer 80, which supports the Swedish polar research. Schuback was also chairman of the association Friends of the Vasa Museum (F√∂reningen Vasamuseets v√§nner) and was involved in the creation of the Stockholm Water Prize. Schuback became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1973. He was an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Society of Naval Sciences, in which he was elected in 1967 as number 903. Schuback was also inspector emeriti of the naval academic association Sj√∂Lund. Personal life In 1952 he married Ann-Mari Hagstr√∂m (born 1928), the daughter of Folke Hagstr√∂m and Ingeborg (n√©e Bostr√∂m). He had three children; Anders, Peter and Katarina.

Human immune cells are used to develop human lymphoid organs within these immunodeficient mice, and many different types of SCID mouse models have been developed. These mice allow researchers to study the human immune system and human disease in a small animal model.  Discovery  The mutation causing SCIDs in mice was discovered by Melvin and Gayle Bosma in 1983 in the CB/17 mouse line. SCIDs occurs in these mice due to a mutation in the gene for protein kinase, DNA activated, catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC), which plays a role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks. This has implications for B and T cell receptor development, which is dependent upon such double-stranded breaks and subsequent repairs in order to rearrange V, D, J or V and J segments. Mice with SCIDs have lymphocyte progenitors, but these cells are unable to survive to maturity. This results in a lack of B and T cells in the thymus and in the secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes. Some SCID mice are able to produce monocytes, granulocytes, and red blood cells from the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) present in their bone marrow. Due to their immunodeficiency, mice with SCIDs often die young if not kept under extremely sterile conditions. The absence of functional B cells results in an organism that is unable to produce antibodies. This failure to create antibodies prevents most SCID mice from rejecting non-self tissues. Some SCID mice are shown to reject skin grafts, so it has been proposed that this disease arises from a leaky mutation, meaning that some mice with SCIDs do in fact have a somewhat functional adaptive immune system.  Types  There are many types of SCID mice used by researchers at present. Some examples include SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice, which are given human fetal thymus and liver cells, hu-SRC-SCID mice, which are implanted with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and hu-PBL-SCID mice, in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been injected. Each line of mouse has different functional and nonfunctional cells, making each suited for different experiments. In particular, it has been observed that SCID mice with an added mutation for interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RŒ≥) are better able to accept transplantation of human HSC and create human B and T cells. Studies such as those conducted by Ito et al. have found that non- obese diabetic (NOD) SCID IL2RŒ≥ mice are even better suited as models for tissue transplants from non-self organisms due to their lower rate of rejection of human cells. NOD/SCID IL2RŒ≥ mice have also been used to study human melanoma.  Use in research  SCID mice can serve many functions in research, particularly in the study of human physiology and disease. The study of human physiology in human models is often made impossible due to ethical limitations, high financial expense, and low availability of model environments. Furthermore, results gleaned from the study of human cells ex vivo may not be indicative of their functions in vivo. Due to their immunodeficient state, SCID mice are able to accept human hematopoietic stem cells harvested from human bone marrow or thymus. This can lead to the development of human adaptive immune cells, such as B and T lymphocytes, within SCID mice, and for subsequent study of human cells in vivo. SCID mice have allowed for increased research on a wide range of topics, including the development and pluripotency of human HSC, human-specific diseases and their interactions with the human immune system, vaccination, and cancer. SCID mice with human immune cells are able to respond to pathogens such as viruses and create antibodies against them, which has helped scientists better understand how the human immune system protects against pathogen infection. For example, they have been used to study Dengue virus and malaria, as well as to assess the efficacy of drugs that target these diseases. It is important to note that the use of SCID mice has been questioned as a model for studying the human immune system. Some studies have suggested that after a period of time, human T cells in the immunocompromised mice become anergic, meaning that they no longer respond to stimuli. Thus, these mice may be able to host a human immune system, but one that may not be functioning properly.  SCID Mice and HIV  Immune compromised mice have become of particular interest for studying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), how it interacts with the host in human lymphoid organs, as well as how treatments work in vivo. While HIV normally cannot infect mice, SCID mice have been used to study HIV. Prior to the use of humanized SCID mice, ape models were used to study HIV due to their genetic similarity to humans. However, due to the endangered status of chimps, the cost of maintaining them, and the slight differences between human and chimp interactions with HIV, humanized mice have been accepted as a more effective model organism for the study of this disease. NOD/SCID mice can be transplanted with human fetal liver, bone, thymus, and lymphoid cells from blood transplants, leading to the formation of human immune cells, such as B and T cells, within the mice. These mice are then infected with the virus and researchers are able to study how HIV attacks the human lymphocytes and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) over time. Furthermore, humanized mouse models can also be used to test potential therapies for this disease, including gene-based therapies.

This was the first season in which they competed for the Swiss championship. The club's chairman was Charlie Volderauer, who was chairman between 1896 and 1900. He was the third chairman in the club's history, following Roland Geldner (1893‚Äì1896) and Emanuel Schiess (1896). FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof, in the Quarter Kleinbasel.  Overview  Although the first national championship in Switzerland took place in 1897‚Äì98 it is considered as unofficial because it was not organized by the Swiss Football Association (SFA; founded in 1895). FC Basel did not participate in this first championship, but did in the second edition during the season 1898‚Äì99. The club did not compete in the following season either, but have participated in every season since 1900‚Äì01. The 1898‚Äì99 championship was played as a knock out competition, divided into three regional groups, East (region Z√ºrich) Central (regional north-west Switzerland) and West (Romandy). The winners of each group played the finals in a Round-robin tournament. Basel played in the central group against Old Boys. Because the game ended was drawn it required a replay, which was also drawn, despite an agreed two times 20 minutes extra time. Because the Old Boys complained that one of the two FCB goals had been scored by hand and protested, the SFA had to deal with the matter. Subsequently, the protest was approved - and the disputed goal simply deducted from the final result.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The Ai J. White Duplex stands just west of the main downtown area of Newport, on the south side of Main Street roughly midway between 3rd Street and Governor Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a cross-gabled roof and an exterior clad in a combination of wooden clapboards and decorative cut shingles. Its front facade is roughly in three bays, with the right bay consisting of a two-story projecting polygonal window bay, and the left bay consisting of an angled rectangular bay with a picture window on the ground floor and a pair of sash windows on the second. The center bay has a single sash window on the ground floor, and none on the second. Entrance porches are on either side, with turned posts and balusters. The left porch is two stories high, with a spindled valance on the second floor. The house was built about 1897 by Ai J. White, a French Canadian immigrant. White owned a shop at the back of the property where he manufactured window sashes and blinds, and apparently built this duplex as an income-producing property. Most of its documented occupants have been working-class laborers, but it was also occupied early in the 20th century by Leon Colodny, a German-Russian immigrant who owned one of Newport's downtown commercial blocks. It was sold out of the White family in 1943.

The site consists of a wide parking area and scenic overlook projecting out into the lake, plus landscaped parkland along the shore in both directions. It was built from 1936 to 1939 as the centerpiece of the Mille Lacs Highway Development Plan, a major New Deal project to create a scenic parkway along the lakeshore. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 for having state-level significance in the themes of landscape architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for being the premiere structure of the most extensive roadside development project undertaken by the Minnesota Highway Department and the Civilian Conservation Corps, and for its blend of formalism and National Park Service rustic design. Description The Garrison Concourse's central monument The Garrison Concourse stands on the northwest shore of Mille Lacs Lake, a major destination for recreational fishing. It was built on U.S. Route 169‚Äîwhich runs between Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul and the Iron Range cities‚Äîat its junction with Minnesota State Highway 18, leading toward Brainerd and several other major fishing lakes. The principal feature is the overlook, a D-shaped platform with a paved driveway and parking area surrounding a central island, and a curving stone walkway around the periphery. The platform measures north to south and east to west, and projects into the lake. The overlook wall consists of large blocks of granite, roughly finished and laid in a random pattern. The walls are thick and rise above the inner walkway. stone piers are spaced at intervals. The inner walkway widens in three places to provide space for sightseers to congregate. A bay is centered on the lakeward side of the platform, while bays stand at both landward corners. The central island was designed with formal plantings delineated by a grid of walkways. A flagstone plaza in the center surrounds a stone monument, which serves as a mount for an interpretive plaque and the base of a flagpole. stone curbing once defined much of the grounds. The only surviving original sections, however, are around the central island and a stretch along the highway shoulder south of the overlook. Native trees and shrubs pepper the open space on either side of the overlook. The National Register listing is broken down into four contributing properties: one site (the designed landscape itself) and three structures (the overlook wall, the monument, and the granite curbing). Two elements built in more recent times are considered noncontributing properties: a fiberglass statue of a giant walleye erected around 1980 and a small visitor information booth built around 1990. Origin Mille Lacs Lake arose as a popular visitor destination in the early 20th century, first through rail access but then by automobile as a scenic highway was designated along its western shore in 1917 and as cars became affordable for middle-class families. It was the first large lake encountered by motorists traveling north out of Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul. By the 1920s the highway along Mille Lacs Lake was the state's most traveled, providing access to a growing number of tourist amenities nearby as well as destinations just beyond it in the directions of Brainerd and Aitkin. The road became U.S. Route 169 in 1931. In the 1930s the Minnesota Highway Department began an ambitious series of improvement projects to realign roadways and establish scenic waysides, taking advantage of federal funds and labor provided by the New Deal to combat the Great Depression. The work was intended to improve highway aesthetics, increase safety, and aid the nascent automobile tourism industry by providing scenic areas for motorists to relax, eat, and use restrooms in the years before gas stations and convenience stores became commonplace. The Garrison Concourse was designed on a large scale, both to accommodate the number of visitors it would see and to match the scale of Mille Lacs Lake. It is the third largest of more than 50 overlooks built by the Minnesota Highway Department during the New Deal, and the only one to project into a body of water. Construction The Mille Lacs Lake Highway Wayside Camp, or SP-15, was established just outside the small town of Garrison. It housed a rotating population of 200 men employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The camp was operated by the U.S. Army, while the work projects were directed by the National Park Service and the Minnesota Highway Department. Of the 120 Civilian Conservation Corps camps established in Minnesota, only four were attached to the Minnesota Highway Department. SP-15 was the longest lived of the four‚Äîactive for four and a half years‚Äîand produced the most extensive accomplishments. The camp laborers were initially 18‚Äì25-year-olds, but later it hosted a company of older men who were veterans of World War I. Work on the Garrison Concourse began in spring 1936. First they relocated to the north a small monument to William Tauer, a local hotelier who had drowned while trying to save boaters in distress during a June 1927 storm. During the summer of 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees built a cofferdam to hold back the lakewater and laid the footings of the overlook wall. Extreme heat and a reassignment to help fight forest fires up north slowed progress, but the following year the overlook wall was mostly completed. The overlook plaza was built up with gravel, clay, and stone fill. The men also created a sandy beach north of the overlook to complement the natural beach on the south side. From 1938 to 1939, the workers completed the central plaza and its monument, stonework, benches, landscaping, and planting. In addition to the Garrison Concourse, Camp SP-15 widened the highway from two lanes to four for , realigned a section, constructed two other wayside rests and four stone-faced bridges, and landscaped the right-of- way. This fell far short of the original hope to develop a scenic highway all the way around the lake, but it was still Minnesota's most extensive highway development project of the New Deal era. Camp SP-15's other projects in the area include the Kenney Lake Overlook, Bridge 5265, and Bridge 3355, and the St. Alban's Bay Culvert, each of which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Restoration Garrison's giant walleye statue stood here in the middle of the plaza from 1980 to 2013 The Garrison Concourse was extensively restored beginning in 2011. Ice and wave action had taken a toll on the overlook wall, and the plaza had deteriorated. The Preservation Alliance of Minnesota had placed it on their 2010 \\"10 most endangered historic places\\" list. The state highway department‚Äînow renamed the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT)‚Äîperformed the work to meet federal standards for historic properties. Loose stones were reset and missing stones replaced with similar material. Several stones knocked out of the overlook wall were recovered from the lakebed and fitted back into place. Repairs were made to the plaza and flagpole monument. The walleye statue and information booth, which had been placed in the middle of the plaza in the late 20th century, were moved a short distance to be less visually obtrusive.

It is one of the largest genera in the subfamily, containing over 200 species, and it is known from both North and South America. A number of species from this genus are considered to be pests, such as the grape colaspis (Colaspis brunnea). Some species are known from the fossil record from the Eocene of Colorado in the United States. Taxonomy In some publications for the Neotropical realm, Colaspis is also known as Maecolaspis. This alternative name was created by the Czech entomologist Jan Bechyn√© in 1950, due to an error relating to the type species of Colaspis: Bechyn√© incorrectly considered Colaspis testacea to be the type species of Colaspis, rather than Chrysomela flavicornis. As a result, Metaxyonycha, which shared the same type species, was synonymised with Colaspis. The species of Colaspis in the Junk-Schenkling catalog were then placed under Bechyn√©'s new name, \\"Maecolaspis\\", with Chrysomela flavicornis as the type species. These errors were corrected by W. J. Brown in 1961, who synonymized Maecolaspis with Colaspis. Despite this, Maecolaspis continued to be used as valid by some authors, and in addition Doris Holmes Blake did not mention Bechyn√©'s use of the genus in her papers on Colaspis. These factors have resulted in some confusion regarding Colaspis itself, since this meant Colaspis could either mean Bechyn√©'s \\"Maecolaspis\\" or Metaxyonycha depending on the system being followed. A number of species originally placed in Colaspis have been split off into several smaller genera, such as Allocolaspis, Callicolaspis, Percolaspis, Nodocolaspis and Zenocolaspis. The genus requires further subdivision.

It was the first building for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. It was designed by Cass Gilbert, architect of the Minnesota State Capitol building. It is located at 510 Marquette Avenue, at the corner of Marquette Avenue and 5th Street South in Minneapolis, right next to the Nicollet Mall station of the METRO Blue and Green light rail lines, and across from the Soo Line Building. History The building was completed and opened its doors on January 1, 1925.https://www.cassgilbertsociety.org/works/mpls- fed-reserve/ The original structure was built as a 4-story building with sub- basement to house the Ninth District Federal Reserve Bank, which occupied the building for approximately 50 years. The building was unusual in that there were no windows on the lower walls close to the street--from the start, large bricks filled in the spaces where windows would be expected. Only up at the top was anyone able to look out from the building. An additional nine stories were added in 1956 with the completion of floors 5 through 13. The modern superstructure clashed with the granite Roman columns on the building's facade. After the Fed moved to its second building in 1973, the new owner, a partnership of New York developers, Peter V. Tishman and Jay Marc Schwamm, had the lower portion covered with something that was a better match to the skyscraper \\"hat\\" on top. The , windowless, lower floors were stripped of the granite and replaced with a \\"bird cage\\" limestone facade (designed by Minneapolis architect Robert Cerny) and a totally artificially sustained natural garden of ficus trees and pools of water (designed by San Francisco landscape architectural firm of Lawrence Halprin). At the time it was the largest totally artificially sustained garden within an office building in the United States. It had been modeled after the Ford Foundation Building in New York City, which has a larger garden, but also one that relies to some extent on outside natural light. There was also the need to remove the interior, independently supported five-story vault so that the building could be connected to the adjacent F&M; Bank Building, and also become part of the second floor, Minneapolis Skyway System. After a three-year development, the National City Bank of Minneapolis (now part of M&I; Bank) moved into the building as its principal tenant. After the renovation, the building received the Minneapolis Committee on the Urban Environment award for contributing the most to Minneapolis's urban environment. The building was listed for sale in 2011. It was owned by Hart Advisers Inc. of Simsbury, Connecticut who bought it in December 1998 for $20.6 million. In 2011, its largest tenant was RBC Wealth Management which was shifting to nearby RBC Plaza.Black, Sam - 510 Marquette in Minneapolis for sale.

The third was issued in September 2015 to commemorate Elizabeth II becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Canada. In 2017, the Bank of Canada released a commemorative $10 banknote for Canada's sesquicentennial, which was available by Canada Day. Silver jubilee of the accession of George V to the throne obverse of the English-language version of the $25 banknote. The portraits are of George V on the left and Mary of Teck on the right. The first commemorative banknote issued by the Bank of Canada was a $25 banknote in the 1935 Series to commemorate the silver jubilee of the accession of George V to the throne of the United Kingdom. The royal purple banknote was issued on 6 May 1935, and is the only $25 banknote issued by the Bank of Canada. On the obverse are the portraits of George V and Mary of Teck from an engraving by Will Ford and master engraver Edwin Gunn of the American Bank Note Company (ABN). The scene on the reverse depicts Windsor Castle, the official residence of the UK royal family, from an engraving by Louis Delmoce of ABN. The banknote includes the signatures of Graham Towers, the governor of the Bank of Canada, and J.A.C. Osborne, the deputy governor. Centennial $1 banknote On 3 January 1967, a $1 note commemorating the centennial of Canadian Confederation was introduced into circulation. The Bank of Canada stopped issuing the commemorative note in 1968. The frames of both the obverse and reverse were based on the original $1 banknote of the 1954 Series, modified to include the texts \\"Le centenaire de la confederation Canadienne\\" and \\"Centennial of Canadian Confederation\\", with English text at the top of the obverse and bottom of the reverse, and French text at the bottom of the obverse and top of the reverse. On the left side of the obverse is a monochrome green adaptation of the stylised maple leaf used as the Canadian Centennial logo, marked with the years 1867 and 1967. The portrait is of an engraving of Elizabeth II adapted from a 1951 photograph by photographer Yousuf Karsh, but with the tiara she was wearing removed. The reverse depicts the original Centre Block of the parliament buildings, which were destroyed by fire in 1916, derived from the same engraving used for a Dominion of Canada banknote designed and printed in the 19th century. There are two variants of the banknote printed. The first includes the serial number below the top of the frame on the obverse, whereas the more common second variant substitutes the years 1867 and 1967 for the serial numbers. The version without the serial number was \\"intended to appeal to note collectors\\". 2015 commemorative $20 banknote On 9 September 2015, the Bank of Canada released a banknote to commemorate Elizabeth II becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Canada. The banknote was revealed at a ceremony at Rideau Hall by David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada. It is part of the Frontier Series of polymer banknotes, and is a modified version of the standard $20 banknote of that issue. On the commemorative banknote, the images on the metallic foil are a portrait of Elizabeth II adapted from a 1951 photograph by photographer Yousuf Karsh at the top, and the royal cypher of Elizabeth II at the bottom. This is the same portrait used for all 1954 Series banknotes and the centennial $1 banknote, but it retains the tiara, making this banknote the first Canadian banknote to depict Elizabeth II wearing a tiara. 2017 commemorative $10 banknote A commemorative 10 dollar banknote, with a circulation of 40 million, was issued for Canada's 150th anniversary on 1 June 2017. It is of the same polymer material and purple colour of the standard Frontier Series $10 banknote, but contains a unique design that includes four portraits of important historical Canadian figures. The obverse features four portraits: John A. Macdonald, George-√âtienne Cartier , Agnes Macphail, and James Gladstone, and the 'Canada 150' logo at upper right.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bank-of-canada-unveils-new-10-banknote- for-canada-150-celebrations-1.4060501 The reverse has five landscapes: The Lions and Capilano Lake; fields of Prairie wheat; the Canadian Shield in Quebec; the Atlantic coast at Cape Bonavista; and northern lights in Wood Buffalo National Park.

Recent censuses of North Korea have been conducted by CBS. It has also published statistics about electricity. Very little is known about the bureau or its staff, and even its ability to compose accurate statistics is in dispute. Their accuracy has been disputed by various United Nations organizations and foreign observers. History The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) was founded in 1952 under the State Planning Commission of North Korea, but the relationship between these two organizations today is not known. CBS held the first North Korean census in 1989. Before that, the most up-to-date population figures were available from 1963. Usually, statistical affairs in North Korea are run by the Bureau, but some statistics such as those pertaining to the total population and mortality, are done by a separate organization called the Population Division, which was founded in 1993 in time for the 1993 census. Before the census, the CBS tallied the population based on numbers in the \\"population registration system\\" maintained by local administrative levels. The newest North Korean census in 2008 was carried out by the CBS, and the next one was scheduled for 2018. It also makes statistics about the country's energy. Organization CBS is the national statistical office of North Korea. It is headquartered in Inhung-Dong of Moranbong District of the capital, Pyongyang. It has branches in all provinces. Its Director General since 2014 is Ri Sung-ho. He was preceded by Kim Chang-su, who was formerly the Director of the Bureau since March 1990 before becoming its Director General in March 1996. Before him, Shin Gyeon-sik was the Director General since May 1990. The Bureau is part of the state planning apparatus by reporting directly to the Administrative Council. The Bureau is directly under the Cabinet of North Korea. Criticism The abilities of the Bureau to compile accurate statistics are \\"an open question\\". Although the Bureau was founded to collect data for the purposes of administration and economic control, it is unclear if it has access to information about all sectors of the North Korean economy today. Nothing is known about the number and training of its staff. Since the late 1960s, the Bureau has published a mere two reports. Kim Il-sung himself asserted that statistics compiled by the Bureau are subject to national security considerations and, as such, are not inherently public. Nicholas Eberstadt illustrates the Bureau's problem with low-quality statistics based on his exchange with its officials in 1990: \\"In trying to ascertain the definition of an 'urban area' in the DPRK, it soon became clear that there was, in fact, no standard specification demarcating 'urban' and 'rural' communities\\". Instead, populated places are classified as rural or urban on an ad hoc basis. According to Eberstadt, while CBS officials recognized the shortcomings of their methods, one official resorted to joking about his organization being tasked with mere \\"rubber statistics\\". In 1989 it sent population data to the United Nations Population Fund to secure help in organizing the first national census since independence in 1948. These figures might have been purposely distorted. In 1997, North Korea sent GNP per capita statistics compiled by the Bureau to the UN Budget and Finance Committee in the hopes of lowering its United Nations membership fee. Just a year later, the Bureau reported very different statistics to secure funding from two other UN agencies, the United Nations Development Programme and the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, it sent data about the nutrition of infants and mothers to UNICEF and WFP. These figures, though excluding some large populated areas, showed such remarkable improvement in nutrition that they were doubted in the UN organizations. In spite of the controversy, the figures were eventually accepted.

Born in Brooklyn, Herreshoff was the only child of a prominent Rhode Island family; at her mother's death when she was four she was taken in by her aunts in Providence to be raised. At the age of six she began art classes with Mary C. Wheeler while attending the Lincoln School, from which she graduated in 1890. Wheeler was famous for taking her students to Europe for summer study, and on one of these visits, in 1895, Herreshoff met Rapha√´l Collin at Fontenay-aux-Roses. He would become her teacher for the next two summers. In 1898 she moved permanently to France to study with Collin, taking the time while there to make sketching and painting visits elsewhere around the continent. In 1899 she enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian, where she was taught by Jean-Paul Laurens ‚Äì whose use of color came to have a strong influence on her own style ‚Äì and by Benjamin Constant. Her 1899 painting Le Repos was accepted into the 1900 Paris Salon, and that same year An Interior was shown at the National Academy of Design. Herreshoff returned to the United States in 1903, in which year she showed paintings at the Rhode Island School of Design. Until 1910 she split her time between Providence and New York, summering along the New England coast. In the latter year she married an employee of General Electric, Charles Eaton, and moved to Schenectady, New York with him, but after three months they separated and she returned to Providence to live with her mother's sister, Elizabeth Dyer, whom she considered a surrogate mother. Between 1921 and 1925 she continued exhibiting, showing at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Watercolor Club, the North Shore Art Association in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and the Providence Art Club. Her style has been described as Fauvist. Herreshoff's aunt died in 1927, and it was this event that apparently caused her to cease painting; she spent the next forty years collecting porcelain, and packed her paintings away in the attic of her Providence home. At sixty-six, in 1941, she married the thirty-eight-year-old Euchlin D. Reeves, a graduate of Washington and Lee University School of Law whom she had met at a meeting of a ceramic collectors' club. The pairing, which at least one writer has suggested was based on a shared love of collecting rather than any romantic attachment, was described as \\"a fragile union\\"; so great was the couple's love of acquisition that eventually they filled an entire house with furniture and porcelain, and purchased another next door into which they could expand. This house, too, was eventually filled. The two remained married until Euchlin's death in January 1967. Herreshoff followed later that year, and bequeathed the collection, now numbering over 2,000 pieces of Chinese export porcelain as well as British and Continental European examples, to Washington and Lee University. The movers who came to take the porcelain were surprised by the paintings, and only saved them for use of the frames. The Reeves Collection has since grown to encompass work from Asia, Europe, and the Americas, and today contains over four thousand objects. In 1976 Herreshoff's work was shown in an exhibition co-sponsored by the university and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, bringing it to a wider public. One of her pieces, Poppies of c. 1920, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987. The story of Herreshoff and Reeves is the subject of the book A Fragile Union: The Story of Louise Herreshoff by James W. Whitehead, the curator who helped to bring their art collection to Washington and Lee. Its foreword was written by Tom Wolfe, who has also discussed her paintings. Herreshoff and Reeves are buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts.

The bog covers about 30 hectares of which a sizable portion is used as meadows for grazing cattle. Other parts are cultivated but as the area is low-lying it is more or less flooded during winter. The bog has some waterholes and old peat pits which are now mostly concealed by thickets of primarily downy birch and grey willow. Geding-Kasted Bog is one of the most important catchment areas for the water supply in Aarhus Municipality and the city of Aarhus.  Flora and fauna  Geding-Kasted Bog has a major biodiversity with many different plant and animal species. Especially downy birch and grey willow dominate but on the meadows there is also globeflower, branched bur-reed, western marsh orchid, saw-wort and Irish fleabane. Insects are important pollinators for the flowers in bog and as prey for toads, reptiles and birds. Due to the location between the nesting grounds Eg√• Engs√∏ and Brabrand Lake there's an especially varied population of birds including thrush nightingale eurasian penduline tit, water rail, western marsh harrier, common kestrel and grey heron. The bog was used for grazing cattle for many years which was maintained by a local group of volunteers. In the 2010s the bog will undergo a rewilding project that will introduce Galloway cattle and later possibly water buffalo and wild horses.  Environmental conditions  Pollution with heavy metals was discovered by coincidence in 1966. Botanists found a species of liverwort which at the time was not known from other places in Denmark. Further examinations of the plant led to the discovery of a connection between this particular species and heavy metals or sulphur in the ground. Excavation revealed buried industry waste consisting of, among other things, copper from a former production of sulphuric acid. The bog has received polluted water through the stream of Mose√•en between 1870 and the 1970s, mostly heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, and a smaller amount of cadmium, but also copper and zinc. The pollution originated from a fertilizer factory in Mundelstrup Stationsby at Tilst. The factory closed in the 1970s, the emissions stopped, and a major cleanup project was undertaken around the factory in 1991-1993.

Standing (left to right): Jen≈ë Heltai, Jen≈ë Faludi, N√°ndor Er√©nyi and Mikl√≥s Faludi. Budapest, 1905. Mikl√≥s Faludi (3 February 1870 ‚Äì 1 February 1942) was the artistic director of the Comedy Theatre of Budapest and the founder of the Hunnia Biograph Company through which he financed and oversaw the development of the first purpose-built film studio in Hungary.  Biography  Tombstone of theatre manager Mikl√≥s Faludi (1870-1942) and his wife Marie Combe (1868-1921) at Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest Mikl√≥s Faludi was born Mikl√≥s M√≥zes Waltersdorf in Devecser, Hungary, on 3 February 1870. His parents were G√°bor Faludi, a successful businessman who founded the famous Comedy Theatre of Budapest in 1896, and Josefin L≈ëvy. After completing his secondary school studies, Mikl√≥s worked as a bank clerk in London, England after which he moved to France, where he met his wife Marie Combe. In 1896 he returned to Budapest and became the secretary of the N√©psz√≠nh√°z (Folk Theatre). In 1901, he joined his father G√°bor and brothers Jen≈ë and S√°ndor in the management of the Comedy Theatre as the artistic director and dramaturge, a role which he would retain until 1921. Faludi's experiences in Western Europe as a young man, along with his ability to speak English, French, and German, allowed him to translate and stage popular plays from across the continent including David Belasco's Madame Butterfly. In 1911, Faludi founded the Hunnia Biograph Company and personally oversaw the construction of the first film studio in Budapest, located in Pannonia Street. The company produced a number of films until it ceased operations in 1913. In his later years, he worked as an artistic director at the Belv√°rosi Theatre until his retirement in 1939. Faludi died in Budapest on 1 February 1942 and was buried at Kerepesi Cemetery.

It is important to note that this technique is different from ribosome profiling. Both techniques have been reviewed and both are used in analysis of the translatome, but the data they generate are at very different levels of specificity. When employed by experts, the technique is remarkably reproducible: the 3 profiles in the first image are from 3 different experiments. The procedure The procedure begins by making a cell lysate of the cells of interest. This lysate contains polysomes, monosomes (composed of one ribosome residing on an mRNA), the small (40S in eukaryotes) and large (60S in eukaryotes) ribosomal subunits, \\"free\\" mRNA and a host of other soluble cellular components. The procedure continues by making a continuous sucrose gradient of continuously-variable density in a centrifuge tube. At the concentrations used (15-45% in the example), sucrose does not disrupt the association of ribosomes and mRNA. The 15% portion of the gradient is at the top of the tube, while the 45% portion is at the bottom because of their different density. A specific amount (as measured by optical density) of the lysate is then layered gently on top of the gradient in the tube. The lysate, even though it contains a large amount of soluble material, is much less dense than 15% sucrose, and so it can be kept as a separate layer at the top of the tube if this is done gently. In order to separate the components of the lysate, the preparation is subjected to centrifugation. This accelerates the components of the lysate with many times the force of gravity and thus propels them through the gradient based upon how \\"big\\" the individual components are. The small (40S) subunits travel less far into the gradient than the large (60S) subunits. The 80S ribsomes on an mRNA travel further (note that the contribution of the size of the mRNA to the distance traveled is not significant). Polysomes composed of 2 ribosomes travel further, polysomes with 3 ribsomes travel further still, and on and on. The \\"size\\" of the components is designated by S, the svedberg unit. Note that one S = 10‚àí13 seconds, and that the concept of \\"big\\" is actually an oversimplification. sucrose gradient and immunoblot After centrifugation, the contents of the tube are collected as fractions from the top (smaller, slower traveling) to bottom (bigger, faster traveling) and the optical density of the fractions is determined. The first fractions removed have a large amount of relatively small molecules, such as tRNAs, individual proteins, etc. Applications It is possible to use this technique to study the overall degree of translation in cells (for examples), but it can be used much more specifically to study individual proteins and their mRNAs. As an example shown in the lower portion of the figure, a protein that composes part of the small subunit can first be detected in the 40S fraction, then nearly disappears from the 60S fraction (the separations on these gradients are not absolute), then reappears in the 80S and polysome fractions. This indicates that there is at most very little of the protein found in the cell that is not part of the small subunit. In contrast, in the upper row of the immunoblot figure, a soluble protein appears in the soluble fractions and associated with ribosomes and polysomes. The particular protein is a chaperone protein, which (in brief) helps to fold the nascent peptide as it is being extruded from the ribosome. As other work in the paper showed, there is a direct association of the chaperone with the ribosome. The technique can also be used to study the degree of translation of a particular mRNA In these experiments, 5' and 3' sequences of an mRNA were investigated for their effects on amount of mRNA produced and how well the mRNAs were translated. As shown, not all mRNA isoforms are translated with the same efficiency even though their coding sequences are the same.

Shown at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, the exhibit opened November 4, 2016 and ran through September 10, 2017. A year later, on October 19, 2018, the exhibition opened at the Fralin Museum of Art on the grounds of the University of Virginia, where it remained on display until January 27, 2019. The works reflect her early development as an abstract artist, influenced by design principles of Arthur Wesley Dow. Through her exploration and growth as an artist, she helped to establish the American modernism movement and has been called the \\"Mother of American modernism\\". Background Untitled, Law Building, 1912‚Äì1914, Georgia O'Keeffe Museum In 1908, O'Keeffe had become discouraged about creating representative works of art, her mother's poor health, her father's bankruptcy, and, later, her parents' separation. Losing interest in pursuing a career as an artist and unable to fund her education, she took a job as a graphic artist and then became a teacher. For a four-year period, she did not paint. Untitled, The Rotunda, 1912‚Äì1914, Georgia O'Keeffe Museum In the summer of 1912, she enrolled in an art class at the University of Virginia, the only time of year that women could attend the school. Alon Bemet, a Columbia University Teachers College faculty member, led the class that introduced innovative ideas of Arthur Wesley Dow that were based upon Japanese art design and composition principles. That summer she began to experiment with abstract compositions. O'Keeffe then taught during the school year, and returned for two more summers to take and teach classes at the university. During that time she stayed in her mother's boarding house in Charlottesville. She studied with Dow in the spring of 1914 at Teachers College of Columbia University. Overview Untitled, The Rotunda, 1912‚Äì1914, Georgia O'Keeffe Museum O'Keeffe mastered painting with the watercolors, using hand-ground pigments. She experimented with design, like using trees and shrubs to frame a painting. One of the exercises from Dow's book, Composition, is to create \\"a landscape, reduced to its main lines, all detail being omitted\\", like the way O'Keeffe excluded doors from some of the compositions. In her works, she simplified forms, experimented with composition, with the goal of creating a harmonious design and expressing her interpretation of the natural world. \\"The compositions are simple and refined, with flattened shapes, minus the frills and minute details of representationalism,\\" according to Kathaleen Roberts of the Albuquerque Journal. The watercolors, made on 11 7/8 x 9 inch (30.2 x 22.9 cm) paper, were held by O'Keeffe until her death and are now in the collection of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. Dow's influence In 1915, O'Keefe had an epiphany that changed the way she created art from that time forward, based upon what she had learned from Dow: Rather than representing what she saw, O'Keeffe developed radical charcoal drawings, with just a few lines, that led to greater development of total abstraction. In watercolor, she explored circular shapes and beginning in 1916, she created abstract landscapes of \\"bold and ethereal horizontal bands of color.\\" References Further reading * 1914 paintings 1912 paintings 1913 paintings University of Virginia Paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe ","title":"O'Keeffe at the University of Virginia, 1912‚Äì1914"},{"id":"52873802","text":"The FC Basel 1900‚Äì01 season was their eighth season since the club's foundation on 15 November 1893.

She was the first woman to become a professor at the newly created University College of the West Indies (UCWI) and first professor of West Indian studies in the UCWI History Department. Her seminal work, Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands at the End of the Eighteenth Century (1965), was a pioneering study of the institution of slavery and the first to put forth the concept of a \\"slave society\\" encompassing not just the slaves but the entire community. She was one of the pioneers of historical research on slavery and the Caribbean and is considered the \\"premier social historian\\" from the 1960s to her death. Early life Elsa Vesta Goveia was born on 12 April 1925 in British Guiana to middle-class, ethnically mixed Portuguese and Afro-Guyanese family. One of two daughters, she was educated in a time when education was rare for even males in British Guiana. After winning a scholarship, she attended St. Joseph High School at the Convent of Mercy in Georgetown and graduated with her certificate. In 1944, she won the national British Guiana Scholarship and continued her education, studying history at University College London. She won the Pollard Prize for English history in 1947, becoming the first West Indian to win the scholarship, graduating with First Class Honors for her degree in 1948. Furthering her studies, Goveia attended the Institute of Historical Research in London under the tutelage of Eveline Martin until 1950, when she returned to the Caribbean and accepted a post at the newly created University College of the West Indies, as an assistant lecturer. Continuing her research during 1950 and 1951, Goveia prepared her thesis Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands 1780-1800, submitted it the following year and earned her PhD in 1952. Career Upon receipt of her degree, Goveia became a Lecturer and taught in the History Department of UCWI. Her courses focused on topics which had been elucidated in her doctoral thesis. Prior to Goveia, history of the Caribbean had focused on the economics of slavery and its political implications, following a chronological sequence without regard to the larger context. Goveia, instead, analyzed the sociological impact of the slaves, free blacks, and other elements of society and how they functioned both as separate communities and as part of the whole. She recognized that the entire culture was built upon a \\"slave society\\" wherein relationships were defined not only by color but by maintaining a structure based upon superiority and inferiority; the interdependency of the group produced coherency in the society. She did not advocate remaining silent and shamed about past slavery, instead arguing that only by acknowledging and confronting the past could \\"human beings change what human beings made\\". At a time when historians mainly focused on the achievement and development the colonizers brought to the colonies, Goveia as an insider, approached history from the perspective of the colonized. It was an innovation to scholarship that forced scholars to consider the social history and a more interdisciplinary approach to analysis, questioning the historiography of the region. Beginning in 1952 at the request of the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History, Goveia undertook a study that was to become one of her most important works, Study on the Historiography of the British West Indies. She researched and wrote parts of the project over a two-year period for the Pan-American Institute, which published it in 1956. In the years since its publication, the study has been called one of the two seminal works on historiography published in the 1960s; one of the most influential works; a serious contribution to scholarship; and a catalyst which caused other historians to \\"probe the inner dynamics of West Indian societies, economies, and polities‚Ä¶\\". She published other essays and analyses, such as \\"The West Indian Slave Laws of the Eighteenth Century\\", which appeared in a series published by UCWI called Chapters in West Indian History, which were perceptive and insightful. In 1958, Goveia was made a Senior Lecturer and then in 1961 was appointed as a professor in West Indian History. The appointment was historic, as she simultaneously became the first (and only) female professor at UCWI, as well as the first Caribbean-born professor of West Indian History. In 1965, her thesis was published under the title of Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands at the End of the Eighteenth Century. Like her Study on Historiography the book became widely influential, being one of the first works to define the term \\"slave society\\" and its inner-workings. Rather than a \\"colonial society\\", which effectively left out slaves and free blacks, Goveia's focus was on the whole society and did not merely examine how slavery effected the state, but rather how the people involved were effected by the institution itself. Pointedly, she noted that rivalries between the various islands in the Caribbean were a result of the broader system, which simultaneously united and divided them. Because the \\"system\\" required that they support the hierarchy, individual islands communicated with their colonizers, rather than among themselves and competed for status rather than overall improvement of the citizenry. From 1961, Goveia had health issues which curtailed her publishing output to an extent, but she continued teaching until her untimely death at age fifty-five. Death and legacy Goveia died at her home in Hope Mews Kingston, Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica on 18 March 1980. In 1985, a lecture series named the Elsa Goveia Memorial Lectures was inaugurated and continues to highlight scholarship on the history of the Caribbean. In 1989, the reading room at the library on the Mona Campus to the University of the West Indies was renamed in Goveia honor. Since 1995, the Association of Caribbean Historians has awarded the Elsa Goveia Prize to scholars who have exhibited excellence in the study of Caribbean history.

Fremont's third expedition to the Great Basin and California. He is best known as a frequent companion and close friend of Kit Carson. The Owens Valley, Owens River, and Owens Lake in eastern California were all named after him by Fremont, even though Owings apparently never visited any of them. Biography Owings was born in Owings Mills, Maryland, and grew up near Zanesville, Ohio before going west in 1834 with Caleb Wilkins. His adventures with Carson and Fremont took place in the years between then and 1850. Around 1850 he returned to his family near Marion, Indiana, and in 1854 married Emily Miller. He moved to Iowa during the Civil War and then to Circleville, Kansas in 1872, living there until he died in 1902. He and Emily had four sons, three of whom survived him. In 1839 Owings spent three months trapping beaver with Carson in South Dakota. The two became close friends and were frequent companions over the following decade. Carson and other \\"mountain men\\" invariably called Owings by the name \\"Dick Owens\\". Carson and Owings both spent most of the early 1840s living near Taos, New Mexico, and in March 1845 the two started a joint farming venture fifty miles away in Rayado. When they learned, however, that Fremont was preparing a third expedition to the Great Basin and California, they sold everything at a loss and moved to join Fremont's company. (Carson had served Fremont as a guide on his earlier expeditions and was highly trusted by him.) The expedition traveled across the Utah desert to Oregon and spent some time there before moving south along the eastern flank of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada. In the vicinity of Truckee a small group broke off, including Fremont, Carson, and Owens, and crossed the Sierra Nevada range, arriving eventually in Sacramento. Meanwhile, the majority of the group continued southward, traveling through the area that Fremont would later name Owens Valley, not crossing the mountains until they reached Walker Pass. Thus Owings did not actually see the river, valley, and lake that Fremont would later name after him.

He was Latvia's first classical composer, having composed instrumental pieces and cantatas. JurjƒÅns also studied and collected more than 6000 pieces of Latvian folklore, among them 3000 songs, which he compiled in six books, called Latvju tautas m≈´zikas materiƒÅli (Materials of Latvian Folk Music).  Biography  Andrejs JurjƒÅns was born in 1856 in ƒírgƒºi. Active is music from a young age, JurjƒÅns decides to become a musician after participating as a choir singer in the First Latvian Song Festival in 1873. In 1875, he studied music at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, attending composition, organ and French horn classes with Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov and German organists Louis Homilius and Friedrich Homilius. In 1877, he published his first composition. From 1882 to 1916 JurjƒÅns taught music in the Russian Imperial Music Society Conservatory in Kharkiv, Ukraine. At the same time, he took an active part in Latvian musical life as a collector, researcher and arranger of national folk songs. His five-volume work, \\"Materials of the Latvian Folk Music\\" encompasses about 2,000 tunes. JurjƒÅns laid the foundation for further research in this area. Together with his brothers and musicians Juris, PƒÅvuls and Pƒìteris he regularly took part in the Latvian Song Festival as the JurjƒÅns' French horn quartet. Around 1910 JurjƒÅns' hearing became weaker and in 1916 he retires from his teaching career. Seriously ill, in 1920 he returns to Latvia, where he dies in 1922. After the death of JurjƒÅns, the 6th part of his work was published posthumously by his brother PƒÅvuls.  Compositions  JurjƒÅns composed 15 symphonic works, 5 vocal and instrumental works, as well as many solo songs, choir and folk songs. He is the first person to detail the Latvian folk song characteristics, thus attempting to turn the public's attention to common features in Latvian and Russian folklore. JurjƒÅns often used folk song intonations and fragments in his compositions. JurjƒÅns called on the new generation of Latvian composers to learn from Russian classical music, namely, from the work of composer Mikhail Glinka.

The reef is situated around eight small rock islands: Best Rock, Long Brown Rock, Unnamed Rock, Square White Rock, Seal Rock, Conical White Rock, West Conical Rock, and Arch Rock. The reef includes forests of bull kelp up to long, which provide protective habitat for numerous animals, including the bat ray, big skate, broadnose sevengill shark, cabezon, kelp bass, leopard shark, spiny dogfish, kelp greenling, plumose anemone, and numerous species of rockfish. The reef also supports more than 39,000 seabirds, including 5% of the common murre nesting population in Oregon. The Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon contains a simulated version of Orford Reef in its Passages of the Deep exhibit.  Common species in the reef   Spiny dogfish shark  A grey or brown shark with white spots scattering it's back and just like regular sharks, spiny dogfish don't have an anal fin, but they are one of their many kinds to have a venomous spine.  Yellowtail rockfish  Yellowtail are greenish to yellowish on their back side while their bottom side lays pale. These large, heavy body fishes can be founded from Unalaska Island in Alaska to San Diego, California. You can find them usually swimming in reefs, banks, and along the coastlines.  Plumose anemone  Also known as the white-plumed anemone are broad oral disc covered with short, slender, tapering tentacles and when they extend they become tall and slender. Plumose anemone are colored from a white, cream, tan, orange, or brown shade. Usually can be found on pilings, floats, or breakwaters in bays and harbors in Southern Alaska to Southern California.  Copper rockfish  Copper rockfish vary in color to a dark brown or olive to pink or an orange- red with patches of copper pink or yellow. They are typically solitary swimmers yet they sometimes gather in small groups. These copper rockfishes can scatter from Southwest Alaska to Baja California, but can also be found from British Columbia to Southern California.

He was born in Paris, the youngest of five sons of Edward Greathed and Mary Elizabeth Glyn of Uddens House, Wimborne, Dorset. One of his brothers was General Sir Edward Harris Greathed. He entered the Addiscombe military college of the East India Company in February 1843, and received a commission on 9 December 1844. In 1846, he went to India, and was attached to the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Meerut. The following year he was appointed to the irrigation department of the North-west Provinces, but on the outbreak of the Second Sikh War in 1848, he was sent to join the field force at the Siege of Multan. He was the first officer through the breach in the final assault. He was also present at the Battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849. After two years leave in England he was appointed executive engineer in the public works department at Barrackpore and in 1855 was sent to Allahabad as government consulting engineer in connection with the extension of the East India Railway to the upper provinces. In 1857, when mutiny broke out in Meerut and Delhi was seized, he was summoned to Agra by Lieutenant-Governor Colvin and ordered to carry despatches to the general at Meerut, which he succeeded in doing. Two months later he was asked to repeat the feat, reached Meerut and joined Sir Henry Barnard beyond the Jumna river, later taking a major part in the Battle of Badli-ki-Serai on 8 June 1857. In July he was severely wounded in a sortie from Delhi commanded by his brother Edward. After recovering from his wounds he joined a column as the field engineer under Colonel Seaton and took part in the engagements of Gungeree, Pattialee, and Mynpoory. He was then directing engineer of the attack on Lucknow under Colonel Robert Napier (afterwards first Lord Napier of Magdala). On the capture of Lucknow, he returned to his railway duties and was rewarded for his services in the mutiny by a brevet majority and the award of CB in the 1860 Birthday Honours. In 1860 he accompanied Sir Robert Napier to China as an aide-de-camp and was present at the battle of Senho, at the capture of the Taku forts by the Hai River, and in the campaign to capture Peking, after which he was sent home with despatches. On arrival in England, he was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel for his service in China and spent the next four years as assistant military secretary at the Horse Guards. In 1867 he was back in India as head of the irrigation department in the North- west Provinces. In 1872, when at home on leave, he read a paper before the Institute of Civil Engineers on The Irrigation Works of the North-West Provinces, for which he received a Telford Medal. On his return to India, he completed his irrigation projects which included the Agra Canal from the Jumna and the Lower Ganges canal. By 1875 he was ill and left India for good in July 1876. He was an invalid until he died on 29 December 1878, during which time he was promoted Major-general. After his death, he was buried at Hampreston, Wiltshire.

Seal RTP 736 The existence of Hairan was established by the discovery of a lead seal (code named RTP 736). The seal bears the images of two priests, one on each side. On one of the sides, the name of Odaenathus' son and successor Vaballathus was engraved under the image as a legend, while the name of Hairan was engraved on the other side. The name of Odaenathus was engraved on both sides. No name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated. King Herodianus and Hairan II King Septimius Herodianus Odaenathus had another son, Hairan I, who appeared in different inscriptions dated from 251 AD onward. On a lead seal, the name of Septimius Herodianus, king of kings, appears; scholars argue whether Septimius Herodianus was Hairan I or II. The Augustan History mentions that Odaenathus had many sons, including one named Herodes (from an earlier marriage) and another named Herennianus. According to Henri Arnold Seyrig, Hairan II must be identical with Herennianus and he was an older brother of Vaballathus and did not reign. Seyrig distinguishes Hairan I from the Hairan on seal RTP 736. Andreas Alf√∂ldi also suggested that Septimius Herodianus is Herennianus; another seal associated with the seal of Septimius Herodianus represented a woman crowned with laurel leaf who, according to Alf√∂ldi, can only be Zenobia. Hence, Septimius Herodianus is the son of Zenobia and Odaenathus. In the view of Alf√∂ldi, Odaenathus's eldest son, Herodes of the Augustan History, would not have been called King of Kings during his father's lifetime and Septimius Herodianus briefly succeeded his father. Udo Hartmann argues that Septimius Herodianus is the same as Hairan I and that Herodianus is the Greek version of Hairan and that \\"Herodes\\" is a corruption of Hairan. David S. Potter disagrees and believes that Septimius Herodianus is Zenobia's son, identical with Hairan II and different from Hairan I.

The sign was installed in 1940 and updated with Citgo's present logo in 1965. The sign has become a landmark of Boston through its appearance in the background of Boston Red Sox games at Fenway Park. Description The Citgo sign is a two-sided, , square, white sign with the Citgo logo, called the trimark, and the word mark CITGO. The sign advertises the oil company Citgo, which is a subsidiary of Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. The sign features thousands of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that turn off every night at midnight. The current sign was unveiled in March 2005 after a six-month restoration project. LEDs were selected for their durability, energy efficiency, intensity, and ease of maintenance. On October 15, 2008, a small electrical fire inside the sign caused approximately $5,000 worth of damage, partially melting the plastic and leaving visible smoke damage. The Citgo sign was shut down for several months beginning in July 2010 to replace the LEDs with a newer version hopefully more capable of withstanding the winds and temperature extremes that affect the sign. Earlier versions featured neon lighting; the pre-2005 sign contained 5,878 glass tubes with a total length of more than . Profile view revealing inner steel skeleton The Citgo sign is known nationally for appearing above the Green Monster during televised games of the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park. The sign has been nicknamed \\"See It Go,\\" especially when a home run is hit during a game. This visibility has led to the installation of replica signs. History The first sign, featuring the Cities Service green-and-white trefoil logo, was built in 1940. That sign was replaced with the trimark in 1965. Although there was, originally, a Cities Service station on the ground floor of the building, there is no associated Citgo gas station, so the sign is now a historical landmark. In 1979, Governor Edward J. King ordered the sign turned off as a symbol of energy conservation. Four years later, Citgo attempted to disassemble the weather-beaten sign and was surprised to be met with widespread public affection for the sign and protest at its threatened removal. The Boston Landmarks Commission ordered its disassembly postponed while the issue was debated. The sign was refurbished and relit by Citgo in 1983, an event that drew a cheering crowd of 1,000 fans of the sign, and has remained in operation ever since. In September 2006, Jerry McDermott, a Boston city councillor, proposed that the sign be removed in response to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez's insults toward U.S. President George W. Bush. McDermott also suggested draping an American flag or Boston Red Sox banner over the sign until Ch√°vez was out of office. In July 2016, the Boston Landmarks Commission voted to grant preliminary landmark status to the sign. The preliminary status prevented the sign from being removed from the building until the commission conducted a three-month study, to be followed by a vote on permanent landmark status in October 2016. In October 2016, The Boston Globe reported that local developer Related Beal purchased the building on which the sign sits as part of a $140 million, nine-building deal. Under former owner Boston University, Citgo paid a below market rate of $250,000 a year for the sign. Beal agreed on March 15, 2017, to retain the sign for \\"decades to come.\\" On November 13, 2018, the Boston Landmarks Commission voted unanimously to designate the sign as an official Boston Landmark. That action was subsequently vetoed in late November by Mayor of Boston Marty Walsh. Walsh's veto was coincident with an agreement between Citgo and Beal on a lease that will allow the sign to remain in place for another 30 years. On August 10, 2020, members of the global environmental movement Extinction Rebellion hoisted a 42 foot by 42 foot banner over the front of the sign that read \\"CLIMATE JUSTICE NOW\\" to help draw attention to environmental issues as a result of the fossil fuel industry. A total of ten participants from Boston, New York, and Vermont chapters of the group were arrested on charges of trespassing and disturbing the peace after the banner was brought down. Replicas Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros, has a replica of the sign behind left field. Replicas of the sign also appear in two minor league baseball ballparks. Hadlock Field, home of the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs in Portland, Maine, has a replica of the Citgo sign above its replica of the Green Monster, the Maine Monster. The Double-A Astros affiliate Corpus Christi Hooks have a square replica of the sign at their ballpark, Whataburger Field. The association with Fenway Park and the Red Sox is so strong that some local Little League fields often are decorated with replicas of the Citgo sign. The sign was highlighted in the 1968 short film Go, Go Citgo, a 1983 Life Magazine photograph feature, and the 1989 feature film Field of Dreams. The sign is caricatured in Neal Stephenson's 1984 book The Big U as \\"the Big Wheel sign,\\" which is worshipped by members of a fictional American Megaversity fraternity.

It was created by a law of 9 September 1948 defining the status of political deportees and internees declaring in its opening article ‚ÄúThe Republic, grateful to those who contributed to the salvation of the country, bowed before them and before their families, determined the status of political deportees and internees, proclaim their rights and those of their successors‚Äù. Possession of the Political deportee or Political internee card, issued by the National Office for Veterans Affairs, established the right to wear the medal, the insignia being common to either status, but hanging from different ribbons sometimes also bearing distinctive clasps. Award statute  Political deportee The Title of political deportee giving the right to wear the Political deportation and internment medal with political deportee ribbon is bestowed to French citizens living in France or abroad, who were, apart from being interned for common or criminal offences and for a period of at least three months: # either transferred by the enemy from the national territory and then incarcerated or interned in a prison or concentration camp; # either incarcerated or interned by the enemy in the camps or prisons of Bas- Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle; # either incarcerated or interned by the enemy in any other territories exclusively administered by the enemy, in particular Indochina, provided that such incarceration or detention meets the conditions laid down by the public administrative regulation provided of the Minister for overseas territories. # the three-month minimum period is waived for persons having successfully escaped or that contracted an illness or infirmity during their internment arising in particular from torture, which may give rise to an entitlement to a State pension; # foreign nationals residing in France prior to September 1, 1939 and meeting the aforementioned criteria are eligible for this award.  Political internee The Title of political internee giving the right to wear the Political deportation and internment medal with political internee ribbon is bestowed to French citizens living in France or abroad, interned by the enemy or the Vichy government, for any reason other than for common or criminal offences, who were: # after June 16, 1940, interned for a legitimate act accomplished for the cause of the liberation of France; # before 16 June 1940, for an administrative or judicial measure resulting in deprivation of freedom beyond the length of the original sentence because of the danger the release of the said person might have caused the enemy based on that person's previous activities; # the internment length must be for a period of at least three months after June 16, 1940 or after the previously set release date from internment; # the three-month minimum period is waived for persons having successfully escaped or that contracted an illness or infirmity during their internment arising in particular from torture, which may give rise to an entitlement to a State pension. # French citizens living in France or abroad, who were executed by the enemy for any reason other than for common or criminal offences automatically receive the Title of political internee; # foreign nationals residing in France prior to September 1, 1939 and meeting the aforementioned criteria are eligible for this award.  1914-1918 Political deportees and internees  A decree of January 6, 1955 modified articles A.186-2 and A.186-3 of the Code of military invalidity pensions and victims of war to include political internees and deportees of the First World War and introduced a ‚Äú1914-1918‚Äù clasp to the medal in both its variants. Award description The Political deportation and internment medal, a design of French artist engraver Arthus Bertrand, is a 30 mm in diameter circular medal struck from bronze or gilt bronze. Its obverse bears the relief image of four vertical chain links protruding from the medal circumference with the upper one forming the ribbon suspension loop. Within the chain link at the center of the medal, a small relief image of the map of France with six rays of light protruding out to the medal's outer edges. Above the upper most rays, the relief semi-circular inscription along the medal circumference () (FRENCH REPUBLIC). The reverse bears the same chain links but without the map of France or the rays, instead, at its center can be found the years in relief ‚Äú1940‚Äù and ‚Äú1945‚Äù on two lines, with the relief inscription along the medal circumference () (POLITICAL DEPORTATION AND INTERNMENT MEDAL).

Ranging from tall vases to tiles, the work features original designs, simplified shapes, and experimental glazes and painting techniques. Stylistically, most of this work is affiliated with the modernizing Arts and Crafts (1880-1910), Art Nouveau (1890‚Äì1910), or Art Deco (1920s) movements, and also European art pottery. Art pottery was made by some 200 studios and small factories across the country, with especially strong centers of production in Ohio (the Cowan, Lonhuda, Owens, Roseville, Rookwood, and Weller potteries) and Massachusetts (the Dedham, Grueby, Marblehead, and Paul Revere potteries). Most of the potteries were forced out of business by the economic pressures of competition from commercial mass-production companies as well as the advent of World War I followed a decade later by the Great Depression.

History The American art pottery movement is a development from a tradition of individual potters making utilitarian earthenware and stoneware vessels for local use that dates back to the Colonial period. It was shaped to differing degrees in different geographical locations by the potters' appreciation for Native American pottery traditions, the Japonism vogue, and modernist aesthetics. Influential figures in American art pottery include Frederick Hurten Rhead, who worked with several different art potteries, and Maria Longworth Nichols, whose Rookwood Pottery produced what is today considered some of the very best American art pottery. The earliest examples of American art pottery often follow a Victorian aesthetic and feature highly detailed representational subjects such as portraits of Native Americans painted across a muted background. Later types are more likely to feature designs that are graphic, linear, and abstract, in line with the aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, and Art Deco movements. Flowers and animals like Rookwood's eponymous rook remained popular subjects for decorations throughout the period. Some pieces have three-dimensional features, such as designs that are incised into the surface rather than painted on top, or raised elements like slip-trailed patterns or low-relief sculptures. While many of the key figures in the movement founded or were affiliated with specific potteries, a few remained essentially independent throughout their careers. Notable in this group are John Bennett, who worked in New York and New Jersey, and Adela√Øde Alsop Robineau, whose Scarab Vase is considered one of the finest examples of American art pottery. Many American museums hold collections of American art pottery. Especially large collections are at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the Cincinnati Art Museum, which has an entire wing dedicated to Rookwood wares. Notable makers of American art pottery Arequipa Arequipa pottery was produced at a tuberculosis sanatorium in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1911 to 1918. For two years (1910-1912) master potter Frederick Rhead taught there; later the potter Albert Solon taught there. Thrown and molded pots were produced, usually with a matte finish. Cowan Pottery The Cowan Pottery was founded in Lakewood, Ohio, in 1912 by R. Guy Cowan. It later moved to Rocky River, where it remained until driven into bankruptcy by the Great Depression. Cowan Pottery produced work in a wide range of styles influenced by the Arts and Crafts and Art Deco movements as well as by Chinese ceramics. Many Cleveland School artists worked there at one time or another, including Arthur Eugene Baggs (founder of the Marblehead Pottery) and ceramics sculptor Waylande Gregory. Dedham Pottery The Dedham Pottery, which operated in Dedham, Massachusetts, between 1896 and 1943, was founded by ceramicist Hugh C. Robertson, who had previously worked with his father and brothers at another pottery. Robertson was deeply interested in glazes, and he developed both an oxblood glaze (inspired by the Chinese glaze) and a fine crackle glaze, the latter of which became Dedham's signature, along with its frequent use of a crouching rabbit motif. Dryden Pottery Dryden Pottery was founded in Ellsworth, Kansas in 1946 by Alan James Dryden Jr. There he developed a Volcanic Ash Glaze, he created a popular pottery business with the imaginative slogan, \\"A Melody in Glaze.\\"Dryden made ceramics that were considered art pottery, but also advertising materials and tourist wares. Pieces imprinted with special logos and marks were commissioned by businesses and organizations around the country. The company's signature piece is a Grecian pitcher (still being produced today), the mold form was sold to Van Briggle along with a Black Volcanic Ash glaze he developed, to supplement the company's move to Hot Springs, Arkansas in 1956. The business grew and was successful in its new location. It grew into a large factory production and was sold all over the U.S. Sheer dedication has sustained the Dryden Pottery through the boom and bust cycles that affect any industry. Currently third generation original family operated. New pieces are still created daily and new glazes are still being developed. JKDryden and Zack Dryden are currently producing many experimental one-of-a-kind Art Pottery pieces, thrown and molded wares, and utilizing the signature developed glazes and application techniques. Grueby Faience Company Founded in Revere, Massachusetts in 1894, the Grueby Faience Company produced vases and glazed architectural terra cotta and faience tiles. Grueby vases were notable for their simple shapes and a hallmark matte cucumber-green glaze. New York City's Astor Place subway stop is decorated with large Grueby tiles featuring a beaver, in honor of the fact that John Jacob Astor's fortune derived from trade in beaver pelts. The company ran into financial difficulties in the early 1900s and went out of business in 1920. Lonhuda Pottery Company The Lonhuda Pottery Company was founded in Steubenville, Ohio, in 1892 by William Long and closed in 1896. It became known for brown underglazes and slip decoration. The ceramicist Laura Anne Fry worked for Lonhuda in 1892‚Äì93. Marblehead Pottery The Marblehead Pottery was founded in Marblehead, Massachusetts in 1904 as a therapeutic program by a doctor, Herbert Hall, and taken over the following year by Arthur Eugene Baggs. The pottery's vessels are notable for simple forms and muted glazes in tones ranging from earth colors to yellow-greens and gray-blues. It closed in 1936. Muncie Pottery Muncie Pottery was founded in Muncie, Indiana in 1918 by the Gill brothers. They began producing arts and crafts style art pottery in 1922. Reuben Haley designed three art deco lines for the company beginning in 1926. The Rombic line utilized cubist designs, the Figural line used low relief designs, and the Spanish line used flowing organic forms. Operations ended in 1939. Newcomb Pottery The Newcomb Pottery, also known as the Newcomb College Pottery, was located at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College in New Orleans, Louisiana, between 1895 and 1940. Vessels of various types were produced for the pottery by the college's students, who were all women. Typically these were vases with floral decorations in a strongly Art Nouveau style, often incised as well as painted and glazed. Niloak Pottery The Niloak Pottery was founded in Benton, Arkansas, in 1909 by potter Charles Dean Hyten as the art pottery branch of the family's Eagle Pottery Company, which produced utilitarian wares. The name is the reverse spelling of the word kaolin, an important component of the local clay. Niloak became known for its \\"Mission Swirl,\\" a multicolored pattern resembling marbled paper made by mixing colored clays together. Typically the Mission Swirl displays a mix of tan, red-brown, and blue-gray colors. Potter Arthur Dovey, who worked at Niloak, is often credited with inventing this swirl, but it may have been invented earlier in a different pottery altogether. There is no question that Niloak popularized the style, however, and apart from a three-year hiatus in the late 1910s, Niloak was successful until the Great Depression put sales into a slump. It struggled on for some years and went out of business in 1947. Owens Pottery The J. B. Owens Pottery Company was founded in Roseville, Ohio, in 1885 by J. B. Owens. After moving to Zanesville, it produced art pottery from 1896 to around 1910, after which Owens concentrated on manufacturing tiles instead. Owens Pottery produced around four dozen different lines, mainly of vase, bowls, and pitchers. Distinctive lines include Utopian (brown glazed, often with botanical decoration), Matte Green (featuring stylized designs under a matte green glaze), and Mission (featuring Spanish missions). Paul Revere Pottery The Paul Revere Pottery was founded in Boston in 1908 by Helen Storrow, Edith Guerrier, and Edith Brown to provide employment and skills to young women. It grew in part out of a reading group formed by Guerrier, the Saturday Evening Girls club, and it was managed entirely by the club members. For this reason the Paul Revere Pottery is sometimes referred to as the Saturday Girls. It lasted up to World War I. The pottery produced vessels with floral and animal motifs in a highly simplified graphic style, with matte or low-luster glazes predominantly in tones of green, blue, ochre, and brown. Pewabic Pottery Pewabic Pottery was founded in Detroit in 1903 by Mary Chase Perry Stratton and Horace James Caulkins. The pair began the company by creating objects for every day use that also utilized interesting glazes, which Perry Stratton developed. The company became well-known for iridescent glazes, which were developed in 1906. Later, the pottery would go on to produce tile installations for notable buildings in Detroit such as the Guardian Building, The Detroit Institute of Arts, and the Detroit Public Library. The pottery has never ceased operations and is still a functioning studio and gallery. Rookwood Pottery Company The Rookwood Pottery Company was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1880 by Maria Longworth Nichols Storer, who was influenced by Japanese and French ceramics. Rookwood was known for experimenting with glazes and for the exceptionally high quality of the painted and incised work. Among the potters and ceramic painters who worked there were Kitaro Shirayamadani, Clara Chipman Newton, Laura Anne Fry, and Arthur Dovey (who moved on to work at Niloak Pottery). The company was badly affected by the Great Depression and declared bankruptcy in 1941. It reopened in 1959 in Mississippi and struggled through various ownerships for several decades. In the early 2000s it moved back to Cincinnati, where it now operates. Roseville Pottery The Roseville Pottery was founded in Roseville, Ohio, in 1890 and moved to Zanesville eight years later. It began by making housewares and only began making art pottery around 1900. Frederick Rhead was Roseville's art director for five years (1904‚Äì09). Many Roseville pots carry floral decoration, frequently in low relief. Roseville ceased producing original art pottery in 1953. Teco Pottery The Teco Pottery was founded in Terra Cotta, Illinois, in 1899 by William Day Gates, as a specialty branch of his American Terra Cotta Tile and Ceramic Company, which made architectural terra cotta items like drain tiles and chimney tops. Gates's experiments with glazes and forms led him to found Teco (an acronym for TErra COtta) to create art pottery, especially vases. Teco became known for its distinctive architecturally styled wares with little to no surface decoration and for a medium-green matte glaze. Most designs were the work of Gates himself, but a few Chicago-based Prairie School architects also made works for Teco. Gates's ceramics business closed as a result of the stock market crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression, taking Teco Pottery down with it. Van Briggle Pottery The Van Briggle Pottery was founded in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1901 by Artus and Anne Van Briggle. The pottery favored the Art Nouveau style. It is still operating today, making it the oldest continuously operating art pottery in the United States. Weller Pottery Potter Samuel A. Weller founded the Weller Pottery in Fultonham, Ohio, in 1872. The company turned out both art pottery and mass-produced work, becoming the largest pottery in the country by 1905. Many different potters worked at Weller over the years, including Frederick Rhead, who was there in 1903‚Äì04. For this reason, it has less of a signature style than some of the smaller art potteries. It closed in 1948. References Further reading *American Art Pottery: The Robert A.

Description Caladenia denticulata subsp. albicans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. One or two flowers are borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide at the base, linear to lance-shaped, dull white or cream-coloured and has a drooping, dark brown, thread-like glandular tip. The arching lateral sepals and petals are similar in size, shape and colour to the dorsal sepal although the petals are slightly narrower and shorter. The labellum is white with red markings, and curves forward with white to pale red teeth along its margins, the teeth decreasing in size towards the tip. There are up to 13 pairs of anvil-shaped, cream-coloured calli in two rows along about half the length of the labellum and decreasing in size towards the tip. Flowering occurs from August to early September. The dull white colour of the petals and sepals distinguish this from the other subspecies of Caladenia denticulata, but the petals and sepals are also more drooping. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia denticulata was first formally described by John Lindley in 1840 and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 2015, Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman described three subspecies, including subspecies albicans and the descriptions were published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (albicans) is derived from the Latin word albus and means \\"becoming white\\", referring to the dull white flowers. Distribution and habitat Alabaster spider orchid is only found near Arrowsmith in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region growing in moist calcareous or sandy soil under Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Acacia saligna trees. Conservation Caladenia denticulata subsp. albicans is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

The series features fictional, anthropomorphic, cephalopodic characters known as Inklings and Octolings, based on squids and octopus respectively, that transform between humanoid and cephalopod forms at will. They frequently engage in turf wars with each other and use a variety of weapons that produce and shoot colored ink while in humanoid form, or swim and hide in surfaces covered in their own colored ink while in cephalopodic form. The first game in the series, Splatoon, was released for the Wii U in May 2015. A sequel, Splatoon 2, was released for the Nintendo Switch in July 2017, followed by an expansion pack, Octo Expansion, in June 2018. The series has received positive reviews for its style, gameplay mechanics and soundtrack, with both games in the series having been nominated and awarded several year- end accolades from various gaming publications. The series has sold over 15 million copies. Splatoon has spawned numerous collaborations with third-party companies and established its own esports tournament circuit in 2018. It has spawned a manga series as well as music concerts in Japan. Games Splatoon Splatoon was developed for the Wii U by a team at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development in 2013. It originally consisted of a four-versus-four ink-based territory control game set in a featureless arena. The game was subsequently developed to incorporate squid-like creatures, now called Inklings, which could switch between humanoid and squid forms in order to be able to hold weapons as a human, while being able to hide or swim through ink as a squid. In 2014, Splatoon was revealed during a Nintendo Direct video presentation at E3 2014, and a playable demo version was made available on the show floor. Subsequently, a time-limited multiplayer demo, the \\"Global Testfire\\", was made available on 8, 9 and 23 May 2015. The full game was released globally between 28 and 30 May 2015, and includes a single- player story campaign mode and an online multiplayer mode. Splatoon 2 Splatoon 2 was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development for the Nintendo Switch, and was announced in January 2017. It takes place approximately two years after the events of the final Splatfest in Splatoon, an in-game festival event where players voted for one of the two protagonists, the Squid Sisters, and fought it out by playing a series of turf war matches. It was later revealed that the results of the Splatfest directly influenced the story of Splatoon 2. Splatoon 2 features a redesigned user interface due to the lack of a gamepad, and includes new maps, weapons and abilities. A new player versus environment mode known as \\"Salmon Run\\" was introduced along with a new competitive multiplayer mode called \\"Clam Blitz\\". In March 2017, a \\"Splatoon 2 Global Testfire\\" event was made available. A second demo which featured the in-game festival Splatfest was released on 15 July 2017. The full game was subsequently released on 21 July 2017. SplatNet 2, a service contained within the Nintendo Switch Online mobile app was released which allow players to view their in-game statistics and communicate with other players through voice chat. During a Nintendo Direct in March 2018, Nintendo announced Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion, a paid downloadable content (DLC) expansion, which features a new, more difficult single-player campaign and a new playable race of cephalopod known as Octolings. The DLC was made available globally on 13 June 2018. Splatfests \\"Splatfests\\" were special, monthly recurring in-game festival events that took place in the games, where players are asked a binary question and take sides based on the answer that they chose. For example, players could be asked to pick between mayonnaise or ketchup, or if they prefer using a fork or a spoon. Players then play a series of turf war matches and contribute scores to the side they picked. A scoring system decides the winning side based on the overall score of those who played. Although all Splatfests ended in the Splatoon 2 game in July of 2019, Nintendo is repeating Splatfests to satisfy fans. Due to the polarizing nature of the choices offered during Splatfests, the themes themselves tend to be the subject of media attention. The themes range from preference questionnaires (e.g. cats vs. dogs, arts vs. sciences), to paradoxes (e.g. chicken or the egg), or sometimes be part of a real-life corporate partnership or sponsorship with Nintendo (such as a Transformers-themed Splatfest with Hasbro, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob SquarePants-themed ones with Nickelodeon, or one with McDonald's). In most Splatfests, the outcome tends to only affect the player's level of in-game reward at the end of the event and typically have no impact on the overall playability of the game. However, the exception to this is the last Splatfest of each game, which has marked the end of developer support for the game. It was revealed that the outcome of the last Splatfest in Splatoon affected the story of Splatoon 2, in which the losing protagonist Callie became an antagonist in the next game. On 24 December 2019, 'Splatoon 3' became trending on Twitter following the release of an artwork that excluded the protagonist Marina, as she was believed to be missing in the same way as Callie in Splatoon following her loss in the final Splatfest of Splatoon 2. Other media Print media Between January 2016 and March 2017, two webcomic series based on Splatoon appeared in Enterbrain's Weekly Famitsu magazine: \\"Honobono Ika 4koma\\" illustrated by Kino Takahashi, and \\"Play Manga\\" by various doujin writers. The comics were published by Kadokawa Future Publishing on 15 June 2017. A Splatoon manga series illustrated by Sankichi Hinodeya began serialization in Shogakukan's CoroCoro Comic magazine on February 2016, following a one-shot published in CoroCoro in May 2015. The licensing rights to publish the manga in North America was later acquired by Viz Media in 2017. In July 2017, a motion comic adaptation of the manga was announced and then released on CoroCoros YouTube channel the following month. As of February 2018, the manga has over 800,000 copies in print and the series is currently ongoing. In April 2017, a manga series illustrated by titled \\"Splatoon: Squid Kids Comedy Show\\" was published in Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic. It was also later acquired by Viz Media and is slated for publication in North America in 2020. Music In universe of Splatoon, the game's protagonists, the Squid Sisters and Off The Hook are fictional popstars which create and perform the music as heard within the games. As a result, a series of real-life virtual concerts featuring holograms of the game's protagonists have been held at various locations. In 2016, a concert tour known as \\"Squid Sisters Live\\" was held commemorating the sale of 1 million copies of Splatoon. The concerts have taken place at Niconico Tokaigi, Chokaigi and Niconico Cho Party in Japan, and the Japan Expo in Paris. Similarly, concert tours featuring Splatoon 2s Off the Hook was held months after the game's release since 2018. Recordings from the concerts have been made into albums. Esports Due to the availability of competitive game modes in Splatoon, competitive Esports tournaments with sponsored prizing have been held as early as 2016 in Japan. With the release of Splatoon 2, Nintendo established the Splatoon 2 World Championships and began hosting competitive tournaments in 2018. Teams of four compete in a series of online qualifiers or live tournaments to earn invitations to play at the World Championships, which are played at the Nintendo World Championships alongside other Nintendo games such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The event is typically held during Nintendo's E3 event and livestreamed. Reception Games in the Splatoon series have been generally well-received and it has been credited as a successful reinvention of the third-person shooter genre. Both games in the series have been nominated and won numerous year-end awards from various gaming publications. Legacy Characters from Splatoon such as the Inklings have appeared in other Nintendo games, such as Super Mario Maker on the Wii U and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate additionally features a playable stage, Moray Towers, 26 music tracks, and an Assist Trophy based on the Squid Sisters. A crossover event between Splatoon 2 and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp occurred in September 2018. In July 2019, a Splatoon 2 theme was made available in Tetris 99 to commemorate Splatoon 2s final Splatfest on 18 July 2019. The NES Zapper, which appears in the games as a usable weapon, has become a popular collectible item following its inclusion. Water guns modeled after the weapons that appear in the games have been sold as toys.

This is the most common variation of the Side Pawn opening. Development The moves preceding this variation follow the standard modern Side Pawn opening with White's eighth file pawn trade ‚Äì namely, for instance, 1. P-77 P-34, 2. P-24 P-84, 3. P-25 P-85, 4. G-78 G-32, 5. P-24 Px24, 6. Rx24 P-86, 7. Px86 Rx86, 8. Rx34. The moves here are the first 15 moves up until Black's capture of White's side pawn by the rook which results in the rook being positioned on the 34 square as shown in the adjacent diagram. (See Side Pawn Capture for explication.) 8... B-33. White moves their bishop up to the third file preventing Black from trading the bishops. White must stop Black's bishop trade to avoid a trap. (This may be done also by blocking with a knight (N-33) or by White initiating the bishop trade from their side.) From here, starts the Aerial Fight (Á©∫‰∏≠Êà¶ kuuchuusen) opening strategies, which are also known as the Naito opening, which is named after professional player Kunio Nait≈ç. The aerial term refers to the way both players' rooks are positioned above their camps on the middle ranks 4, 5 and 6. Castles Common castles include Central House and Nakahara. Retreating Black's rook 9\\\\. R-36. The most common move has been for Black to retreat their rook back to rank 6 protecting their side pawn on 76 from being captured by White's rook. After this move, there are numerous variations. ‚òñR-84 9...R-84. The ‚òñR-84 opening frequently starts by moving the rook back immediately. However, it is also possible to postpone this move and instead first move the left silver to the 22 square, which is a needed move anyway. Postponing the rook retreat allows White to wait and see whether Black will next drop a pawn to the 87 square. If Black does do this pawn drop, then White will have the option of playing ‚òñR-84 but also the ‚òñR-85 option as well. As a result of this flexibility, 9...S-22 has become the more common move in professional games compared with 9...R-84 and is, thus, less revealing of White's strategy. Nonetheless, 9...R-84, 10. R-26 S-22, 11. P*87 is the older move order and can be transposed as 9...S-22, 10. P*87 R-84, 11. R-26. (The 9...S-22, 10. P*87 sequence is shown below with the middle rank rook position in ¬ß‚òñR-85 variation.) =‚òñR-84 ‚òñK-52= ‚òñR-84 ‚òñK-52 ‚òóK-58 ‚òñR-84 ‚òñK-52 ‚òóK-68 =‚òñR-84 ‚òñK-41 Nakahara castle= Ch≈´za's Rook (‚òñR-85) variation The Ch≈´za's Rook variation starts with R-85 (instead of the older R-84 move). It is named after Makoto Ch≈´za. =‚òñ K-41 variation= This move gives an indication that White will form a Nakahara castle. Black has a choice of moving their king straight up to defend the line of pawns broadly as well as moving their king off of the 95‚Äì59 diagonal which is susceptible to bishop drop attacks on 95, or moving their king up and leftwards to protect their left gold in case White initiates a bishop trade. Aono variation Aono Side Pawn (ÈùíÈáéÊµÅ aono-ry≈´) is one of the Side Pawn Capture variants. It is named after professional Teruichi Aono. (This not to be confused with Aono's Fortress and Bishop Exchange variations.) 9\\\\. K-58. Instead of retreating their rook to rank 6 (see ¬ß Retreating Black's rook above), Black keeps their rook positioned on the 34 square and moves their king straight up to rank 8 protecting the line of pawns above it. By not moving their rook to the 36 square as in the most common variations, Black's third file pawn can be advanced allowing for their right knight to develop early to the 37 square. One common positioning of White's king is on the 42 square. Y≈´ki variation Y≈´ki Side Pawn (ÂãáÊ∞óÊµÅ y≈´ki-ry≈´) is another Side Pawn Capture variant, developed by professional player Y≈´ki Sasaki. The variation was created by Sasaki as he did his research on his playstyle on the shogi board he inherited from Nobuyuki ≈åuchi who died in 2017. Sasaki was awarded the K≈çz≈ç Masuda Award for this development in 2018, along with Aono. 9\\\\. K-68. This variation is characterized by the 9. K-68 move (instead of 9. K-58 in the Aono variation), which puts the king next to the left gold. Just like in Aono variation, the aim is to attack by moving P-36, and N-37. Unlike the Aono variation, when White captures the side pawn with Rx76, Black can move the knight to N-37 regardless of it. In the Aono variation, following Rx76 White will aim at a bishop exchange with Bx88, which will be followed by Sx88 leaving the left gold unprotected and easily captured by the rook, hence Black needs to play something else before N-37. This is not a problem in the Y≈´ki variation as the king at 68 defends the gold, so White can play N-37 without any problem. Takebe ‚òóRx33+ variation Professional shogi player, Sayuri Takebe, has played an aggressive variation where instead of pulling back the rook as usual, the rook is traded for a bishop (6. Rx33+). This allows the bishop in hand to be dropped to the 77 square attacking White's rook on 86. White's response is to trade their rook for Black's bishop on 88.

SFIDA is a follow-up of the movement \\"Ne, Tirana\\" which supported Gjergj Bojaxhi during local elections in 2015 where he ran as an independent candidate for Tirana's city hall. The party does not have a traditional leader. Instead this role is split between an administrative chairman (held by Hektor Ruci) and a political representative, Gjergj Bojaxhi. History In June 2015, Bojaxhi ran as an independent candidate in the local elections for the city hall of Tirana. This candidacy was supported by an organized civil movement called \\"Ne, Tirana\\". The elections were won by Erion Veliaj, however Bojaxhi won over 16,000 votes.

Biography Eliseo Rodriguez was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1915, exposed to the artists on Canyon Road. As a boy he worked odds jobs for the Cinco Pintores, the five young painters who formed the state's first modernist-leaning artist collective. Rodriguez's career began when writer T. T. Flynn funded a scholarship for him to enroll in the Santa Fe Art School as the first and only Hispano painting student. In 1936, Rodriguez found work through the federally funded programs known as the Works Progress Administration. He was one of several artists to paint murals for the Texas Centennial. Regional director Russell Vernon Hunter encouraged Rodriguez to revive the Spanish colonial art technique known as \\"straw appliqu√©\\". To this day, art historians credit him for reviving the form and his works are highly sought after by museums and private collectors. Together with his wife Paula, he was the first to exhibit straw appliqu√© works at Santa Fe's annual Spanish Market. In 1940 he won a prize at the New Mexico State Fair for his painting on glass. In 2001 Rodriguez finally got a solo exhibition, Eliseo Rodriguez : el sexto pintor, held at the New Mexico Museum of Art. Rodriguez died in 2009 and is buried in the Santa Fe National Cemetery for his service in the US Army during World War II. Eliseo created the bronze plaques that are set in the sidewalk in front of the Fine Art Museum in Santa Fe, at a corner of the Plaza, and he is included along with the Cinco Pintores and other master painters. Legacy In 1980 Rodriguez was honored with a New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts. In 1985 he was one of a select few artists honored by the city with a plaque on West Palace Ave in Santa Fe. Eliseo and Paula received the National Heritage Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts for their work in the traditional arts in 2004. Rodriguez's works are in the public collections of the Albuquerque Museum, Millicent Rogers Museum, Folk Art Museum (Berlin, Germany), Museum of Spanish Colonial Art, Museum of International Folk Art, American Museum in Britain, Smithsonian Museum of American History, and the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center.

It was created as an alternative to Christian-based after school groups, like the Good News Club. The Satanic Temple does not worship or believe in a literal Satan, or in anything supernatural, rather, they use Satan as a symbol of freedom from the rules of right-hand path religions. There are After School Satan clubs in cities across the United States, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Pensacola, Washington, D.C., Tucson, Springfield, Seattle and Portland. History The Supreme Court decision Good News Club v. Milford Central School held that when a government operates a \\"limited public forum\\" it may not discriminate against speech that takes place within that forum on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses. The \\"limited public forum\\" in the case was referring to after school programs, that the schools provided space for, but was not run by the school. After School Satan was created by The Satanic Temple in July 2016 to ensure that equal representation for all religions is upheld in public schools, and religious freedom and plurality is respected. Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that religious groups are permitted to establish clubs to proselytize after hours using public school classrooms, the Christian-based Good News Club has established thousands of such clubs. In response, The Satanic Temple began a campaign to establish its own clubs across the United States. According to one organizer, Lilith Starr, \\"Whenever religion enters the public sphere, like the Good News Club at public schools, we take action to ensure that more than one religious voice is represented, and that is our intent with the After School Satan Club.\\" Chalice Blythe, former National Director for The Satanic Temple‚Äôs After School Satan Club explained, ‚Äú...The After School Satan Club curriculum was only offered in school districts where local chapters of The Satanic Temple could manage and maintain them.‚Äù The clubs follow a standard syllabus, and strive to provide students with the critical thinking skills necessary to be able to make important life decisions for themselves. They emphasize a scientific and rationalist, non-superstitious world view, and oppose \\"indoctrination\\" into other-worldly belief systems. According to The Satanic Temple and After School Satan's co-founder and spokesperson, Lucien Greaves: and adds One \\"well attended\\" club in Seattle had to pause their activities during the 2017-2018 school year due to lack of funds and, or volunteers. Activities After School Satan Clubs \\"incorporate games, projects, and thinking exercises that help children understand how we know what we know about our world and our universe.\\" Satanic Temple spokesman Finn Rezz said the club \\"would focus on science and rational thinking,\\" promoting \\"benevolence and empathy for everybody\\" ‚Äì while providing an alternative voice to the Bible-centred \\"Good News Club\\". After School Satan Clubs do not teach children to believe in supernatural beings named Satan or perform Satanic rituals. Reception A group of Christian pastors and other religious leaders met in Tacoma, Washington to discuss the proposition that the After School Satan program would be allowed at a local school. One pastor remarked, \\"We want to cut this off and defeat it before it ever gets a chance to take root.\\" Another pastor commented, \\"We are the taxpayers here and we ought to stand up and let them know they are not welcome, they don't pay taxes here.\\"Tacoma pastors speak out against Satanic Temple after-school club ; KIRO7 News; Henry Rosoff; Oct 18, 2016 See also * Freedom From Religion Foundation * Separation of Church and State * Proselytizing References External links Skeptic organizations in the United States Educational charities based in the United States Scientific skepticism Satanism 2016 establishments in the United States ","title":"After School Satan"},{"id":"52875082","text":"Oftedal is a surname.

The stream Eg√• and the Eg√• river valley begins here. The lake is bounded by the Aarhus-Randers Rail Line to the west. Geding Lake is also known under the older name Gjeding S√∏. The lake is connected to a myth and folk story stating that Geding Lake, Brabrand Lake and Lading Lake was created during a battle between two giants that lived in the hills Hasle H√∏j and Borum Esh√∏j.Se ¬ß108 fra Evald Tang Kristensen: Danske Sagn, Silkeborg Bogtrykkeri (1895). Until 1997, the hills on the eastern side of the lake were used for skiing including a ski lift provided by Aarhus SKi Club, but due to lack of snow for years these activities have stopped.  Environmental conditions  Geding Lake is rich in calcium. The ecosystem of the Lake has experienced problems with heightened levels of chlorophyll some 3 times higher than the targeted levels. The catchment area is fairly small at just a few square kilometers so the inflow of phosphorus and nitrogen is relatively small compared to other lakes in Denmark but is still deemed too high and the surrounding agricultural areas would have to decrease runoff to the lake by some two kilograms annually to reach environmental targets. Over time it may be necessary to undertake a restoration project to return the lake to its natural condition. The neighboring Mundelstrup Stationsby has experienced a major pollution event from the fertilizer factory Mundelstrup G√∏dningsfabrik which was active in the area from 1870 to 1904 when it burned. The factory caused major pollution with heavy metals in Geding Lake, Geding- Kasted Bog and the river Eg√•, in particularly with arsenic. The factory has closed, the migration of heavy metals to waterbodies in the area has stopped and it is expected that the levels of arsenic will now decrease over time. However, the lake sediment still contains high levels of the poison and Geding Lake is under continued observation for this reason.

Cheddar broadcasts live daily from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, the Flatiron Building in New York City, and the White House lawn and briefing room in Washington, D.C. covering new products, technologies, and services. Cheddar targets millennials by streaming one to two hours of live content from the NYSE trading floor daily, streaming live audio on iHeartRadio, and distributing the videos on video platforms such as Amazon Prime, the Cheddar app, Facebook live, Sling TV, Pluto TV, and YouTube. According to Steinberg, Cheddar received 148 million views in August 2017 across all of its platforms. On Facebook, 60 percent of Cheddar's viewers are under the age of 35. Accordingly, the daily live shows have been described as \\"quasi-CNBC for millennials\\". Reportage focuses on stocks and technology. The channel is ad-free; expected revenue comes from carriage agreements with streaming services. Advertising comprises either program underwriting or semi-weekly brand integration. Brand integration advertising costs $100,000 per year. Cheddar has two feeds, a paid-for and a free version. The paid feed broadcasts eight hours of programming a day, six of them live, and is available via Amazon Prime, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and the Cheddar app. The free feed broadcasts three hours of new content daily and archived content is available through Facebook and over the air via its affiliated stations. In April 2017, the channel had 100,000 viewers. On April 30, 2019, it was announced that Cheddar agreed to be bought by the cable company Altice USA for $200 million in cash. History Formation Jon Steinberg, formerly president of BuzzFeed and CEO of Daily Mail North America, conceived the concept after leaving the latter in 2015. He considered naming the company \\"Ticker\\" until Bustles founder, Bryan Goldberg, came up with the name Cheddar. Steinberg founded Cheddar in early 2016 and hired Peter Gorenstein, a senior producer at Yahoo, as the channel's chief content officer in January 2016. In September 2017, Cheddar hired Anjali Kumar, former Warby Parker executive and Google lawyer, as its first general counsel and chief people officer. In the company's first financing round in January 2016, it raised nearly $3 million, primarily from Snapchat and Lightspeed's Jeremy Liew, and additional funds from WGI Group, Homebrew, Jerry Speyer, and David Fiszel. Operating Cheddar began streaming on April 11, 2016, on Facebook Live with one hour of programming at 9:30 am. Cheddar initially streamed all videos for free, but in May 2016, the company launched a subscription video-on-demand service. Smaller clips continue to be released, but full-length videos are exclusive to subscribers. On May 23, 2016, SirusXM began carrying Cheddar. Cheddar raised $10 million in funding on September 6, 2016, all of which was an equity deal from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Comcast Ventures, and Ribbit Capital. Cheddar used the investments to increase programming and set up a new studio in Santa Monica, California, becoming the company's fifth studio. The channel teamed with Bustle to launch its afternoon show Extra Sharp on May 18, 2016. Melissa Rosenthal, a former BuzzFeed executive, was hired in May 2016 as creative development and partnership executive. Five half-hour shows (Wheels - automobiles, Points on Point - smart spending, Your Future Home - real estate, Your Cheddar - personal finance, and Cheddar Trading - roundtable discussion on trading) were developed by November 2016, when they were shopped to find underwriting. In September 2016, Twitter made a deal with Cheddar to broadcast its daily coverage, with the stated purpose of giving the Twitter community a platform to watch and discuss the news live. In January 2017, Vanity Fair's Hive business news and Cond√© Nast Entertainment partnered with Cheddar to create a live weekly series called VF Hive on Cheddar. Graydon Carter, a Vanity Fair editor, called the series a \\"representation of how people are consuming more voraciously than ever.\\" Propagate Content in March 2017 partnered with Cheddar to produce a weekly 45-minute show for international markets. Propagate also became Cheddar's international sales representative. The company purchased StockStream, a Twitch hosted crowd-sourcing investment decision website, from the creator Mike Roberts in July 2017. Also in 2017, Cheddar purchased Need2Know newsletter. On August 5, 2017, Cheddar opened its second New York studio at the Flatiron Building in Manhattan. The Flatiron studio was built for its Cheddar Life series. In April 2017, Cheddar began broadcasting on digital UHF stations in five markets and rents the broadcast spectrum from DTV America. Dunkin' Donuts, a Cheddar advertiser, gave free digital antennas at events in the stations' markets to publicize the over the air launch. Cheddar announced $19 million in its third round of financing in May 2017, which was led by Raine Ventures along with investors: AT&T;, Amazon, Altice USA, NYSE, Lorne Michael's Broadway Video, and some existing investors. To date, the company has raised $32.1 million and has a valuation of $85 million as of June 2017. Cheddar also hired Ross Cooperman, former head of engineering at Knowme Systems, as its chief technology officer. Cheddar partnered with Univision's Fusion Media Group in June 2017 to air two hours on the latter's Fusion TV cable television network every weekday afternoon, with the programminavailable for cable users on DISH, DirecTV, AT&T; U-Verse, Verizon Fios, and Charter Communications. Cheddar reports it is on 60 percent of smart TVs throughout the U.S. In July 2017, Cheddar partnered with Seeking Alpha to produce an \\"Idea of the Month\\" segment. The partnership was extended in early 2018. KXTV aired segments from Cheddar on July 27, 2017, during its morning and afternoon news programs as a test for a planned rollout throughout the Tegna TV station group. These segments were rolled out by August to seven News 12 Network cable channels, owned by Altice, then to a handful of additional Tegna stations and Tribune's WPIX. These segments are featured under the \\"Cheddar Local\\" banner. On July 27, 2017, the channel was added to the Haystack TV news aggregator app, which is on mobile and OTT platforms. In September 2017, Cheddar announced its deal with Layer3 TV, an IP-based MVPD, and plans to open a broadcast studio in the UK by 2018. Cheddar in January 2017 launched a 24-hour linear feed on Twitch, the gaming and video platform owned by Amazon. Cheddar was one of two news channels on Philo OTT Internet TV MVPD at its November 14, 2017, launch. In January 2018, Cheddar partnered with MightyHive to extend select client ad campaigns programmatically. In January 2020, TiVo announced the addition of Cheddar to its new channel lineup.https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/tivo-announces-a-49-99-device-that- combines-streaming-and-live-tv/ Multichannel company In March 2018, the company announced its plan to expand internationally and launch two channels, Cheddar Big News (CBN) and a channel on Snapchat Discover after securing its fourth investment round, raising $22 million. The funding round was led by Raine Ventures along with Liberty Global, Goldman Sachs, Antenna Group, 7 Global Capital, Dentsu Ventures, Jeffrey Sprecher, and Kelly Loeffler. As of this investment round, the company is valued at $160 million. Big Cheddar News is a general news streaming channel which launched on April 17. The Snapchat Discover channel, also targeted for an April debut, is a general and business news channel. In April 2018, Cheddar announced its plan to air its live linear network on Hulu. The move comes after Cheddar's deal to bring its news channels to YouTube TV and a month after launching its Snapchat channel. In May 2018, Cheddar acquired Viacom's MTV Networks on Campus to air CheddarU, which streams content from its flagship financial-news streaming service and segments from Cheddar Big News to 9 million students on more than 600 campuses. Qualifying universities can receive the service for free. CheddarU is part of the ChedNet division, which focuses on installing more screens and broadcasting its service in gyms, hotels, airport lounges, restaurants, bars, among others. In June 2018, Cheddar added another distribution outlet via a carriage deal with virtual MVPD fuboTV, an OTT TV service focused on sports programming. GSTV, Gas Station TV, began running 20 second Cheddar segments in September 2018. Cheddar bought RateMyProfessors.com and its app in October 2018 from Viacom. The same month, the company announced its programming will air for 30 minutes every weeknight on CUNY TV, the independent station by the City University of New York. In January 2019, Cheddar renamed their two channels to Cheddar Business and Cheddar News and were hiring for a news room. On February 4, 2019, Cheddar launched the \\"Cheddar Nights\\" programming block, which airs acquired shows, including game show Out of Tune, Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch and Nathan for You. On April 30, 2019, Cheddar announced an agreement to be bought by cable company Altice USA for $200 million in cash; the purchase was made to bolster the latter's news output. The acquisition was completed on June 6, with Jon Steinberg becoming Altice News president overseeing Cheddar, News 12 Networks and i24 News.

The content of the book is about the discovery and importance of DNA, examining the impact of DNA research on society and discussing its significance in history and for the future of life on Earth. The book, according to its authors, \\"combines humor, scientific depth, and philosophical and historical insights.\\" in the hope that, \\"it will interest a wide range of readers.\\" Publication History This volume was the first in the For Beginners series to published simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom. According to Van Loon, the title's illustrator, preparation of the book took fourteen months. Originally published by Writers & Readers Publishing in 1983 and republished, with an alternate cover, the following year, the subsequent publication history of the book has been described by Van Loon as chequered. The book was marketed as an ideal supplement to a previous volume in the series, Darwin for Beginners, written by Jonathan Miller and illustrated by Borin Van Loon. After it went out-of-print, Icon Books, the UK based publishers of the series commissioned Genetics for Beginners, written by Steve Jones and illustrated by Van Loon, to fulfil this role from 1993. Jim Jordan, director of Columbia University Press, commissioned an updated version of the long out-of-print volume from the authors, which was published in 2011. Reception A New York Times reviewer, Harold M. Schmeck Jr., stated that, \\"all the main points are here,\\" and described it as, \\"a painless way of catching up on the basics.\\" A reviewer in The Harvard Crimson described the book as, \\"thoroughly researched, simply written, beautifully laid out,\\" and claims it, \\"more serious than most popular science writing.\\" Stanley Shostack, writing in The European Legacy, while generally positive, concluded that, due to the ambiguity, the revised edition is, \\"probably not a stand-alone introduction for interested non-students.\\" Schmeck described the text as \\"wry, terse and easy to understand\\" and that, \\"it conveys a remarkable amount of information.\\" The Harvard Crimson reviewer confirmed that the authors \\"provide precision with an English brevity of expression,\\" and that \\"the text can remain simple and straightforward and avoid the eye-catching exaggeration all too common in science journalism.\\" Schmeck compared the cartoons, which he described as \\"imaginative, often outrageous,\\" to the work of surrealist comedy group Monty Python. The Harvard Crimson reviewer described the illustrations as, \\"clever and exhaustive,\\" and stated that they should be, \\"the required text for anyone who wants to design educational graphics.\\" Shostack, however, found it regrettable that, \\"illustrations rise to the level of humour at the expense of precision.\\" Cian O'Luanaigh, writing in New Scientist, conversely claimed the book, \\"reads more like an abridged textbook,\\" where \\"text dominate[s] at the expense of images,\\" and concluded that, \\"comic-book fans should seek their biology elsewhere.\\" Legacy Van Loon's illustrations from this book provided the inspiration for his Health Matters Gallery mural at the Science Museum, London, which was opened on 9 June 1994 by Professor James Watson, and were featured in the special exhibition, Representations of DNA, at the Whipple Museum of the History of Science in Cambridge in 2003.

She immigrated from South Africa to Israel in 1975 and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After teaching high school chemistry for a few years, she switched careers and began working for Intel as a lithography engineer in 1983. She spent the next 33 years in key positions in that company, including factory manager, plant manager, and general manager (CEO) of Intel Israel. She retired in December 2016. She was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2009 and was named one of the \\"10 most powerful women in tech\\" by CNN in 2010. Early life and education Born in Johannesburg, Fassberg initially immigrated to Israel with her family in the 1960s and lived in the country for about seven years before they returned to South Africa. Although she studied in an ulpan in Petah Tikva, she found it difficult to acclimate to Israeli society. She completed high school in South Africa and, in 1975, immigrated to Israel once again. She pursued higher education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning her B.Sc. in physics and applied chemistry in 1977, her diploma of education in 1978, and her M.Sc. in organic chemistry in 1979. Career Teaching After earning her bachelor's degree, Fassberg began teaching high school chemistry at ORT Israel and Alliance Fran√ßaise high schools in Jerusalem. She also trained chemistry teachers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. When her application for a school principal position was rejected, she decided to switch career tracks. Intel Intel fabrication plant in Kiryat Gat, c. 2008 In 1982 Intel launched a recruitment drive to staff its new Fab8 plant ‚Äì its first factory built outside the United States. Fassberg applied and was hired in 1983 to work as a lithography engineer at Fab8. After completing a one-year factory training program in Arizona, she returned to Israel to work as a Manufacturing Area Engineer from 1986 to 1987 and a Fab8 Group Leader from 1988 to 1990 and 1992 to 1993. She was a polyimide engineer in the Portland Technology Development division from 1991 to 1992. In 1995 Fassberg became part of the start-up team for the company's Fab18 factory in Kiryat Gat, first as public relations manager and then as manager of the engineering division. She oversaw the startup of the 45 nm chip plant, and subsequent upgrading of the plant to produce 28 nm and 22 nm chips. She was promoted to Fab18 factory manager in 2000, a position she co-held with Alex Kornhauser until 2004, when she was named Fab18 plant manager. She was appointed vice president of Intel's worldwide technology and marketing group in 2004. In January 2006 she was appointed manager of the company's second factory in Israel, Fab28, also in Kiryat Gat. In June 2007 she was named general manager (CEO) of Intel Israel, with responsibility for developing the Intel Israel Site and the Fab28 factory. Under her leadership, exports increased from $1.54 billion in 2007 to $2.7 billion in 2010. In 2011 she was overseeing 7,300 employees. Intel credited Fassberg's leadership for creating thousands of new jobs. She also encouraged women, Arabs, Druze, and Haredi Jews to enter the high-tech sector. By 2016, approximately 40% of the management positions at the Kiryat Gat plant were held by women, compared to 33% at other Intel factories in Israel. Fassberg herself often experienced prejudice and stereotyping as a woman in senior management. When she co-managed the Fab18 factory with Kornhauser, she says, people thought she was Kornhauser's secretary. Even when she was CEO, men addressed correspondence to her as Maxim, not Maxine. Memberships Fassberg is a member of the Supervisory Council and Audit Committee of the Bank of Israel, the board of directors of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the board of the Bloomfield Science Museum. She was a member of the Prime Minister's Round Table from 2008 to 2011 and the Advisory Committee to the National Economic Council in the Prime Minister's Office from 2009 to 2011. Awards and honors Fassberg received the Industry Award of the Manufacturers Association of Israel in 2011, and the Hugo Ramniceanu Prize in Economics in 2012. She also received two Intel Achievement Awards for her contribution to the \\"inter-die electric material problem resolution\\". She was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2009. In April 2012, CNN named her one of the \\"10 most powerful women in tech\\". In 2014 she was honored as one of the 14 women torch-lighters at the official Israel Independence Day ceremony. Fassberg received an honorary doctorate from Ben- Gurion University in 2013. Personal life She is married to Joseph Fassberg, a physician, with whom she has one son and one daughter. The couple resides in Har Adar.

Pellegrin further developed his interest for the challenges given by the space, pre-existing energies, and history creating site-specific works also in historical museums, churches, palaces, and gardens throughout the world. The images of many of these site-specific works are collected in the books Maurizio Pellegrin - Reflection and Intention (1999)Caldura, Riccardo...et al., Maurizio Pellegrin: Reflection and Intentions, Arsenale Editrice, Venice, June 1999. and Maurizio Pellegrin by Alice Rubbini (2005).Rubbini, Alice.

It is red-pied, usually with white legs, stomach and face. It is one of three regional breeds in the area, the others being the Valdostana Castana and the Valdostana Pezzata Nera. Like them, it derives from inter-breeding of various local breeds and types of cattle. The most important of these were Swiss Simmental cattle, which came into the Valle d'Aosta over the Great St. Bernard Pass. The Valdostana Pezzata Rossa is a dual-purpose breed, raised mainly for milk, but also for meat. Management is normally transhumant: the cattle are stabled only in winter, and spend the summer months on the mountain pastures of the Alps.  History  Like the other cattle breeds of the Valle d'Aosta, the Valdostana Castana and the Valdostana Pezzata Nera, the Valdostana Pezzata Rossa derives from inter-breeding of various local breeds and types of cattle. The most important influence on the development and morphology of the Pezzata Rossa came from Swiss Simmental cattle, which came into the region over the Great St. Bernard Pass. In the twentieth century, attempts were made to increase size and productive qualities by cross-breeding with imported stock, including Abondance and Montb√©liarde stock from France, and various European strains of Simmental. The resulting increase in size reduced the adaptation of the animals to life on the high mountain pastures, and the experiment was quickly abandoned. A breeders' association, the Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Bovini Razza Valdostana, was started in 1937, and a herd-book was established in 1958. In 1946 it was thought that were about head. In 1983 the population was estimated at , and in 2014 it was reported as The Valdostana Pezzata Rossa is among the eleven breeds which together form the F√©d√©ration Europ√©enne des Races Bovines de l'Arc Alpin, the others being: the Pinzgauer and Tiroler Grauvieh from Austria; the Abondance, Tarentaise and Vosgienne from France; the Hinterw√§lder and Vordelw√§lder from Germany; the Rendena from Italy; and the H√©rens from Switzerland.  Characteristics  The Valdostana Pezzata Rossa is red-pied. The lower legs, stomach and face are usually white, and the ears red. The muzzle and the mucosa are pink, and the horns short and yellowish. The hooves are particularly hard. It is robust, long-lived and hardy, and well able to exploit high mountain pasture at and above. Management is transhumant: the cattle are stabled only in winter, and spend the summer months on the mountain pastures of the Alps, moving higher as the season progresses.  Use  The Valdostana Pezzata Rossa is raised both for milk and for meat. Milk yield averages per lactation; the milk has 3.55% fat and is high in Œ∫-casein, making it suitable for cheese-making. The milk is used to make Fontina, but also in less well-known local cheeses such as Fromadzo, Reblec, Salignum, Ser√†s and Toma di Gressoney.

In 1867, the distillery was purchased by the Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an amalgamation of five cork distilleries. Two years later, in 1869, as the smallest CDC distillery, Daly's Distillery ceased operations. In the years that followed its closure, some of the buildings became part of Shaw's Flour Mill, and Murphy's Brewery, with others continuing to be used as warehouses by Cork Distilleries Company for several years (though information is difficult to come by, their continued existence is mentioned in Alfred Barnard's 1887 account of the distilleries of the United Kingdom).  History  In 1798, the firm of James Daly & Co. was established as a rectifying distillery and wine merchants at a premises on Blarney St., Cork. In 1820, this was relocated to 32 John Street. As some sources state that the John distillery was established in 1807, and it is known that a William Lyons ran a distillery on John Street in the early 1800s, it is possible that Daly purchased an existing distillery on John Street. In 1822, James Daly's nephew John Murray joined the partnership. In 1828, the distillery is reported to have an output of 87,874 gallons of spirit. However, in 1833, output of only 39,000 gallons per annum was reported, which was low compared with some of the Irish distillers of the era; for instance, at that time Murphy's Distillery in nearby Midleton, had an output of over 400,000 gallons per annum. On James Daly's death, in 1850, the partnership, which at that point had consisted of James Daly, Maurice Murray (John Murray's son) and George Waters, was dissolved, with Maurice Murray taking sole ownership of the distillery, which continued to trade as James Daly & Co. After leaving the partnership, George Waters went on to purchase and run the nearby Green distillery. In 1853, Murray rebuilt and significantly extended the distillery, expanding onto neighbouring streets. By the late 1860s, the distillery had grown to occupy 3 acres, consisting of a brewhouse, distillery and maltings on John Street; granaries on Leitrim Street; and eight bonded warehouses scattered across John Street, Leitrim Street and Watercourse Road. According to accounts from the time, whiskey from the distillery, some of which was aged for seven years or more, was mainly exported \\"to the colonies\\". In particular, it was said that in Australia the whiskey sold at a premium to other whiskeys. A well respected member of the Irish distilling industry at the time, the distillery's owner Maurice Murray, conducted significant correspondence with William Ewart Gladstone, the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, on behalf of the Irish distillers, with regard to the duties placed on Irish whiskey. In 1867, Daly's Distillery, was absorbed into Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an amalgamation of five Cork distilleries. As the smallest of the five distilleries, Daly's closed soon after the amalgamation, in 1869. Following its closure, Maurice Murray is known to have continued to work for the CDC at the North Mall Distillery, along with his son Daly Murray. The main distillery buildings later became part of Shaw's Flour Mill, while other buildings were incorporated into the nearby Murphy's Brewery, which was run by relatives of James Murphy of the Midleton Distillery, who was the driving force behind the establishment of the Cork Distilleries Company. One of the distillery buildings, now named \\"the Mill\\", is still visible on 32 Lower John Street, Cork.

Just prior to World War II, the alpine village had several hundred residents.

The aircraft, a Let L-410 Turbolet, was conducting a VFR approach to Maca√© Airport with 17 passengers and 2 crew on board when it hit the top of Pico da Pedra Bonita in Brazil. Everyone on board was killed in the crash. Brazilian investigative team CENIPA concluded that the VFR approach was inadequate, stating that the visibility at the time was not good enough for a VFR approach. Flight TEAM Linhas A√©reas Flight 6865 was operated by TEAM Linhas A√©reas, a domestic airline based in Rio de Janeiro. It was a daily scheduled domestic flight from Maca√© in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro to the city of the same name. The Let L-410 bore the Brazilian registration of PT-FSE and was carrying 19 people, consisting of 2 crew and 17 passengers. The flight took off from Maca√© at 17:19 local time. At the time, it was operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) with an estimated time of arrival at 18:02. After taking off from Maca√©, the crew stated their intention to cancel their IFR flight plan and added that they wanted to continue the flight under visual flight rules (VFR). This cancellation was approved by an air traffic controller. As bad weather approached, the crew descended to 2,000 ft. The crew had banked the aircraft to the left when it struck tree tops and slammed into the top of Pico da Pedra Bonita, near the municipality of Rio Bonito. The impact killed everyone on board. Investigation Brazilian investigation team CENIPA was involved in the investigation and conducted a 12-month-long investigation into the crash. The final report was released on 19 March 2007, concluding that the crash was categorized as Controlled Flight Into Terrain and was caused by pilot error. The condition of the weather in the area at the time was bad, and it was impossible to make a VFR flight, according to CENIPA. However, the crew of Flight 6865 intentionally changed from IFR to VFR while the visibility was limited. Before the flight, the crew didn't know the weather ahead of them. CENIPA also blamed the crew's poor decision-making, stating that there was inadequate assessment which caused them to fly at a lower altitude than a safe limit.

He is an author and editor of several books on the subject of fascism and totalitarianism, including Genocide and Fascism: The Eliminationist Drive in Fascist Europe (2009). His 2005 book, Nazi Propaganda and the Second World War, deals with the subjects of Nazi propaganda and the Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops. Education and career Kallis has taught history at the University of Edinburgh, University of Bristol and Lancaster University. In 2016, he was appointed as a professor of history at Keele University. He is a contributor to the seminal series Germany and the Second World War from the Military History Research Office (MGFA), where he covers the mobilisation of the German home front and Nazi propaganda. Genocide and Fascism: The Eliminationist Drive in Fascist Europe Kallis's Genocide and Fascism: The Eliminationist Drive in Fascist Europe focuses on National Socialism as the key driver of the most radical outcome, that transformed the \\"eliminationist\\" policies into genocide in the service of the desired homogeneous nation-state. A review at H-Net finds, that although the author still sees parallels between fascism and Nazism, > Kallis concedes Nazism's unique synthesis, which joined the obsession with > racial purity, the desirability of internal cleansing and territorial > expansion to realize the \\"rebirth of the nation,\\" and, finally, the > radicalization of the technocratic social engineering of experts in fields > ranging from biomedicine to demographics.

Syrians are the largest immigrant group of Arabic origin in Venezuela. Migration history Syrian migration to Venezuela began towards the end of the nineteenth century, when thousands of Syrian Christians and Jews arrived escaping the downfall of the last years of existence of the Ottoman Empire. Since then, the flow of people between Syria and Venezuela has been constant. The huge Syrian migration to Venezuela took place during the oil boom of the 1950s. Almost every town and village which had missed having Syrian settlers from the earlier immigrations, which began in the late 1880s, now has at least one Syrian family. They have joined the approximately 500,000 prior immigrants and their descendants, reinforcing Arab culture amongst the older Syrian community which had been almost totally assimilated. Emigration Some Syrian-Venezuelans returned during the last decade to Syria, establishing themselves mainly in Aleppo, Tartus and Jaramana (in the outskirts of Damascus). The Syrian city of As-Suwayda; which is known also as Little Venezuela, stands out because of the mix of its streets between the Syrian and Venezuelan dialects, the presence of both languages in posters and advertisements, the restaurants and cafes where both gastronomy are merged and where Caribbean Salsa and the music of Umm Kulthum can be heard. More than 200,000 people from the Suwayda area carry Venezuelan citizenship and most are members of Syria's Druze community, who immigrated to Venezuela in the 20th century. Religion The majority of Syrian-Venezuelans are Druze,. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox. A few Syrian Muslims and Jews settled in Venezuela.

History  The name Gont√£es is of Germanic origin and the foundation of the village dates back to the end of 5th century, during the barbarian invasions. Despite its Germanic origin, there is evidence of Roman occupation. The Romans took advantage of the abundant iron in the region, due to its excellent quality.  Population  The population of Gont√£es is 180 people, most of which are elderly. A large section of the population of the village emigrated between the 60s‚Äô and 90s‚Äô, and since then there has been a decline in the population ‚Äì nowadays the number of inhabitants under the age of 30 is extremely low. However, these emigrants usually come back to visit the village either at Easter, Christmas or during the summer months.  Geography  Gont√£es is located in the municipality and district of Vila Real, in the region of Tr√°s-os-Montes at 800 meters above sea level. As is typical in this region, Gont√£es lies on a mountainous relief intersected by fertile valleys.

The exploitation of the mines in general is thought to date back to the Roman era. Wolfram, antimony, tin, lead and iron could be found in the Cando mines.  Culture   Weaving  Weaving Weaving was a local practice used to make towels, sheets, curtains and textiles, which were often decorated with crochet and embroidery. This is no longer a custom of the area. Nowadays, there is only one loom in Gont√£es.  Opas  The term ‚Äòopas‚Äô, is used in villages to refer to people who take part in a funeral procession, but it's actually the name of the cloaks that they wear. In other places, both adults and children can be ‚Äòopas‚Äô but in the village of Gont√£es only children can take part. In Gont√£es red cloaks are worn.  The Minhava family  Minhava family house The Minhava family was the most influential family in Gont√£es. The family provided a large part of the education that locals received, and taught many villagers to play musical instruments, as well as being very influential in the church.  Other places of interest  The main water fountain, which was the only source of drinking water in the village, was destroyed so that a road could be built. To substitute it, water fountains were built in several places in the village: in Largo da Fonte; in the middle of the village, on the road leading up to the chapel and next to the Santa Sofia Chapel. File:59. Fonte1.jpgWater fountain 1 File:60. Fonte2.jpgWater fountain 2 File:61. Fonte3.jpgWater fountain 3  Agriculture  Among the crops grown in the village are corn, potatoes, rye, beans, fava beans, peas, cabbage, onions, carrots, parsley and tomatoes. Hay, corn and straw were also produced to feed cattle. Fruit trees such as cherry trees, pear trees, apple trees, peach trees, walnut trees, fig trees and chestnut trees, can still be found, as well as the new addition of kiwis  References   External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20170118062917/http://uf-pena-quinta- vilacova.pt/index.php * http://www.cm- vilareal.pt/index.php/freguesias/item/56-uniao-das-freguesias-de-pena-quinta- e-vila-cova Villages in Portugal Vila Real, Portugal ","title":"Gont√£es"},{"id":"52876148","text":"√ìscar Adolfo Naranjo Trujillo (born 22 December 1956) is a Colombian politician and former National Police of Colombia general, who served as Vice President of Colombia from 30 March 2017 ‚Äì 7 August 2018 (under President Juan Manuel Santos).

(6 October 2006). Artisanal Defined. Food Crafters. CUESA (Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture). San Francisco, California. The foodstuff material from farmers and backyard growers can include fruit, grains and flours, milks for cheese, cured meats, fish, beverages, oils, and vinegars. The movement is focused on providing farm to fork type foods with locally sourced products that benefit the consumer, small scale growers and producers, and the local economy. Food artisans Food artisans produce foods and edible foodstuffs that are not mass produced, but rather made by hand. These include cheeses, breads and baked goods, charcuterie and other foods that involve preservation or fermentation, home preservation or canning processes, and fruit preserves, cured meats, beverages, oils, and vinegars. Fermentation or otherwise controlling the preservation environment for beneficial microorganisms can be utilized for vinegars, cheeses, cured meats, wine, oolong tea, kimchi and other examples. An artisan food item is usually developed and produced over a long period of time and consumed relatively close to where the food is created.Bell, Randy. (30 May 2013). Clearing up confusion about artisan food. Michigan State University Extension. www.msu.edu. Legislation In 2009, the Food Safety Enhancement Act was proposed and passed the House of Representatives, but did not pass. The measure was renegotiated and became known as the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). On 4 January 2011, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. Tester-Hagan Amendment Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) and Senator Kay Hagan (D-NC) introduced two amendments to the FSMA that removed local food growers and food processors from federal oversight. These growers and producers would remain under the jurisdiction of state and local health and sanitation laws, rules, and regulations.Editor. (2 June 2015). FDA Fires Direct Shot at Small, Local, Artisanal Food Producers. The Pulse of Natural Health Newsletter. Alliance for Natural Health USA. www.anh-usa.org. Controversy As of 2016, there was not a published official standard or definition for artisan foods. A good working definition can be gleaned from the Tester-Hagen Amendment that stated artisanal food producers are constrained to: \\"make less than $500,000 a year and sell greater than 50% of their products direct to consumers in the same state and within a 400-mile radius\\". The advertising and marketing industries have latched on to the trendy word \\"artisanal\\" and now have artisanal products on supermarket shelves and offerings from local fast food chains.Ozersky, Josh.

History  Simon & Schuster created the Gallery Books imprint in 2009 to unite the editorial teams of Pocket Books and Simon Spotlight Entertainment (or SSE), and Gallery Books launched its first list in 2010. Louise Burke was named executive vice-president and publisher while Jennifer Bergstrom, who had been publisher of SSE, would be editor-in-chief. Gallery‚Äôs initial mission was to focus on women's fiction, pop culture and entertainment. Simon & Schuster announced a reorganization in October 2012 that created four divisions, with the Gallery Publishing Group as one. When the reorganization was complete, Gallery Publishing Group consisted of Gallery Books, Pocket Books, Pocket Star, and Karen Hunter Books. In the years since, Pocket Star and Karen Hunter Books have been disbanded, while new imprints have been created. Pocket Books, which was founded in 1939 and was instrumental in introducing the pocket-size book to the American market, remains active and continues to publish mass-market editions. In 2015 the Gallery Publishing Group launched literary fiction imprint Scout Press with Ruth Ware‚Äôs debut, In a Dark, Dark Wood.

She became a Distinguished Fellow, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners FRNZCGP (Dist) in 2016. The award was made \\"for her services to fostering and contributing to research and academic teaching in general practice.\\"  Clinical appointments  In 1978 Goodyear-Smith was Ship's Surgeon to the 'Marco Polo' of Dominion Far East Line. In 1979 Goodyear-Smith traveled to Jamaica and held positions as Junior Registrar in Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Victoria Lying-In Hospital, Kingston; Medical Officer, Family Planning Clinics and Venereology Clinics, Kingston; Medical Officer, Red Hill Health Centre and Police Medical Officer, Kingston, Jamaica from 1979 to 1981. She also held concurrent positions as Assessment Visitor, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners 1998 to 2006; Locum Medical Officer, Auckland prisons 1990 to 2007; forensic physician with particular expertise in sexual assault cases 1979 to 2012; acted as a General Practice locum at Browns Bay Medical Centre and Calder Centre of the Auckland City Mission 1995 to 2012 and Certifying Consultant, Auckland Medical Aid Centre since 1983.  Academic appointments  Goodyear-Smith was founding Editor in Chief, Journal of Primary Health Care from 2009. Goodyear-Smith is Academic Head of Department, General Practice & Primary Health Care at the Faculty of Medical and Health Science University of Auckland.  Career  Goodyear-Smith is married to John Potter, son of Bert Potter who was the founder of Centrepoint Community in the 1970s. Bert, John and five other members of the community were convicted of sexual abuse and served sentences.  Termination of pregnancy  Goodyear-Smith has worked as a certifying consultant under New Zealand's abortion act since 1981 and has published papers on related topics such as termination of pregnancy and contraception.  Medical aspects of sexual abuse  Goodyear-Smith has published a number of papers around the medical aspects of incidents of sexual abuse and in 1987 she co-authored a guide for general practitioners undertaking sexual assault examinations, Sexual assault examinations ‚Äì a guide for medical practitioners, the first NZ text on medical examinations in this field. In 2006 Goodyear-Smith was asked to review an alleged sexual abuse case involving gonorrhea in an infant. This led to a review of the literature revealing both sexual and non-sexual possible means of transmission of gonorrhea in children. This review was contested by some practitioners. Goodyear-Smith was the medical adviser to the defence at the trial of George Gwaze who was twice charged and acquitted for the rape and murder of his ten year old niece. In 2015 she published a book about the trial and medical and forensic issues involved titled Murder that wasn't ‚Äì the case of George Gwaze. \\"The Gwaze family's story illustrates how a fixed mindset can emerge at the outset of an investigation and be perpetuated every step along the way. The hope is that understanding how mistakes were made in this case can serve as lessons for the future.\\"  False allegations of sexual abuse and recovered memories  During the 1990s Goodyear-Smith actively discussed and published concerning issues with the recovered memory movement in New Zealand. Her Masters thesis in General Practice at the University of Otago in 1997 was also concerned with this topic. In 1994 Goodyear-Smith published a book titled First Do No Harm: the Sexual Abuse Industry which looked at then current research internationally in the field of sexual abuse and challenged prevailing opinions on suggestibility in this area. Reaction to the book was divided, with responses from both the clinical and political fields. Goodyear-Smith was one of a number of professionals and others who formed Casualties Of Sexual Abuse (COSA) in 1994 in response to what they believed were \\" the increasing number of false allegations of sexual abuse being made in New Zealand, which follow trends established in other countries.\\" The national organisation closed in 1999, the Auckland branch in 2000.  Domestic violence and gender politics  In 1999 Goodyear-Smith jointly published a paper with TM Laidlaw researching gender imbalances in services provided to victims of domestic abuse. Goodyear-Smith has since researched and promoted support for male victims of domestic abuse and men's health in general.' In 2001 the New Zealand Ministry for Health issued a Family Violence Assessment and Intervention Guideline which proposed all female patients over 16 be routinely examined for sexual abuse. On the basis of a review of the evidence for this screening using international criteria Goodyear-Smith disagreed with the proposal and published several papers on the matter.(Comment in: )  Genetically modified foods  In 2000 Goodyear- Smith was commissioned by an organisation (unnamed) to conduct a review into the health and safety of genetically modified foods for submission to the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification in New Zealand. Her paper was not used by the commissioning organisation but the research and conclusions was published in a journal article and several book articles. The journal article stated \\"GM foods may be as safe as conventional foods but public distrust runs high. It is important that discussion is informed by science and that claims of both benefits and risks are evidence-based, to ensure that the process is driven neither by the vested interest of the bio-technical multinational companies on the one hand, nor ill-informed public fears on the other.\\"(p. 371)  Mandatory reporting  In 2011 the New Zealand Government released a discussion document requesting submissions suggesting policy changes and delivery of services to improve outcomes for vulnerable children including possible mandatory reporting of child abuse. Goodyear-Smith disagreed with the proposal for mandatory reporting and published several articles around this debate.  Work for the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC):1999‚Äì2007  Goodyear-Smith was commissioned by the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) to conduct a number of research projects between 1999 and 2007. This research ranged across topics such as arthroscopic knee surgery, management and referral of low back pain, management of carpal tunnel syndrome, effectiveness of corticosteroid injections, efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs for neuropathic pain management and sexual abuse counseling treatment rates by psychiatrists, psychologists and counselors under ACC funding. In 2009 some changes were made to the ACC sexual abuse clinical pathway which caused some contention in the counseling community, many of whom believed Goodyear-Smith had influenced these changes. Goodyear- Smith disputed any influence on the ACC clinical pathway.  eCHAT and YouthCHAT  Since 2002 Goodyear-Smith has been involved in developing and implementing an electronic Case-finding and Help Assessment Tool (eCHAT) for use by general practitioners and also a version tailored to youth - YouthCHAT. The program has been implemented in a number of general practice clinics in New Zealand and research is being undertaken in Canada, Hong Kong and Australia to utilise the program in these countries.  Primary care research and locum work  Goodyear-Smith is keen to encourage more medical graduates to work in general practice. Goodyear-Smith suggests that fifty percent of medical graduates should become general practitioners to satisfy the primary care needs in New Zealand. International Perspectives on Primary Care Research, released in April 2016, was jointly edited by Goodyear-Smith and Bob Mash with contributions from researchers in 20 countries that form part of the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA). Goodyear-Smith was appointed chair of the WONCA Working Party on Research in November 2016 and she also holds the chair of the North American Primary Care Research Group (NAPCRG) International Committee which supports primary care research and education globally. Goodyear-Smith believes that her work with \\"under served populations\\" has \\"taken [her] to some very interesting places\\" as part of her general practice. In 2016 Goodyear-Smith gave the Oration at RNZCGP Fellowship Ceremony which describes career in general practice.Oration at RNZCGP Fellowship Ceremony August 2016,  References   External links  * Personal website * Academic CV 1952 births Living people New Zealand general practitioners New Zealand women medical doctors New Zealand obstetricians New Zealand women academics New Zealand public servants People from Auckland University of Auckland alumni University of Auckland faculty Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians 20th-century New Zealand medical doctors 21st-century New Zealand medical doctors 20th-century women physicians 21st-century women physicians ","title":"Felicity Goodyear-Smith"},{"id":"52876266","text":"Nancy A.

The Court is the heir of institutions which monitored public finances before the Unification of Italy, such as the Chamber of Audit (Camera dei conti) of the Duchy of Savoy and then the kingdom of Sardinia, established in 1351 and replaced in 1859 by the Court of Audit (Corte dei conti) on which the Italian institution of 1862 was closely modelled. Other precursors include the Chamber of Audit (Camera dei conti) of the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia, established in 1771; the ' of the Kingdom of Naples, founded in 1444 and replaced by the Royal Court of Audit (Regia Corte dei Conti) in 1807. Auditing of accounts is also attested in Apostolic Camera of the Papal States as far back as the thirteenth century. In 1828 the Papal States instituted the Congregation for the Revision of Accounts and Affairs of Public Administration (Congregazione di revisione dei conti e degli affari di pubblica amministrazione) within the Apostolic Camera (which was subsequently replaced by the Council of State for Finance (Consulta di Stato per le Finanze) from 1850 until 1870), with the role of examining and reviewing the prospective and actual budgets of the state and providing opinions on financial matters. The regulations governing the Court of Audit are complex. Particularly important is the of royal decree no.1214 of 12 July 1934, which was integrated into decree law no.452 of 15 November 1993 (converted, with revisions, into Law no.19 of 14 January 1994), Law no.20 of 14 January 1994, and Law no.639 of 20 December 1996. Revisions were also made by Law no.205 of 2000. Organisation President Napolitano with Raffaele Squitieri, President of the Court of Audit. The Court of Audit has central and regional officies. The court as a whole is headed by the President of the Court of Audit.Art.11.7, Law no. 15 of 4 March 2009 The President chairs the Council of the President of the Court of Audit,Established by Art. 10 Law no.117, Law of 13 April 1988 (amended by Art. 1.1 of Decree Law no.62 of 7 February 2006), its functions were reduced by Art.11, Law no. 15 of 4 March 2009 which has little power, but is the equivalent for magistrates of the Court of Audit to the High Council of the Judiciary for the regular judiciary. The Council of the President of the Court of Audit is based in Rome. It consists of: * the President of the Court of Audit (who presides over it), * the Prosecutor-General of the Court of Audit, * the Adjunct-President of the Court of Audit (or the oldest Departmental President), * four elected citizens (two chosen by the Chamber of Deputies, two by the Senate by simple majority votes, who must be professors of jurisprudence or lawyers with twenty years of professional experience), * four magistrates (distributed among different groups in proportion to their numbers on 1 January of the year when the council is formed). The court is divided into jurisdictional and review divisions, both at the central and territorial levels. The divisions are not distributed uniformly over the national territory. Alongside the Court of Audit at the central level is the Office of the Prosecutor General for Audits, headed by the Prosecutor General and twenty Deputy Prosecutors General. Peculiarly, the Office of the Prosecutor General in Jurisdictional Appeal divisions for the Region of Sicily is treated as the Sicilian branch office of the central Office of the Prosecutor General for Audits. The Court of Audit has three central departments of jurisdictional appeal, based at Rome, near the Court of Audit, as well as the department of jurisdictional appeal for the Region of Sicily, which is based at Palermo. There are also the Joint divisions of the Court of Audit, which decide questions of principle and of jurisdictional conflicts. These are based in Rome, but there are three special divisions for Sardinia (based at Cagliari), for Sicily (based at Palermo), and for Trentino-Alto Adige (based at Rome). Regional divisions There are jurisdictional divisions and review divisions, as well as a regional prosector's office, for each of the sixteen jurisdictional territories of audit: Piedmont, Lombardy, Venetia, Liguria, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Latium, Marche, Umbria, Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Puglia, Basilicata, Calabria and Valle d'Aosta. There are other regions with a different arrangement. These are all regions with special status: *Trentino-Alto Adige has a subdivision for each of the two autonomous provinces (Trentino, ): **South Tyrol, with jurisdictional division, regional prosecutor's office, regional review division, and joint division, based in Rome, **Trento, with jurisdictional division, regional prosecutor's office, local review division, and joint division, based in Rome *Friuli-Venezia Giulia, with jurisdictional division, regional prosecutor's office, regional review division, and a branch office in Udine *Sardinia, with jurisdictional division, regional prosecutor's office, regional review division, and joint division, based in Cagliari *Sicily, with jurisdictional division, regional prosecutor's office, regional review division, jurisdictional appeal division and joint division, based in Palermo Composition for jurisdictional functions For its jurisdictional functions, the Court of Audit is divided into: *Regional jurisdictional divisions, which judge in the first instance; they have a court in the capital city of each region (as well as the autonomous province of South Tyrol). *Central jurisdictional divisions of appeal, which judge in the second instance; there are three of these, all based at the Court of Audit building in Rome (there is a separate jurisdictional division of appeal for Sicily, based in Palermo) * Joint divisions, which resolve jurisdictional conflicts between the various regional and central divisions, and are summoned to determine \\"questions of principle\\" (when there is doubt or interpretative \\"conflict\\" between the different divisions) by the President of the Court of Audit or the Prosecutor General of the Court of Audit. Alongside every regional jurisdictional division is a regional prosecutor's office, with the role of in cases of public administration. The state prosecutors are independent of and cannot be removed by the magistrates of the ordinary courts; their powers are defined by Art. 74 of the testo unico of Court of Audit and by Article 5.6 of Law 19/1994. The Prosecutor General and the Deputy Prosecutors General have the role of state prosecutors in the central divisions of appeal and in the joint divisions. The Prosecutor General also has the role of co-ordinating the regional prosecutor's offices. Composition for review functions The divisions of the Court of Audit for reviews are: *The State Review Division, which discharges its powers in accordance with Law no.20/1994 (modified by Law no.639/1996) and the criteria indicated by the Joint divisions, with two main principles: the review of legality and of economic efficiency/efficacy. This division is divided into four colleges: one for judgements on legislation, one for judgements on acquisition of revenue, and two for judgements on expenditures. *The Division for Reviews on State Entities, which operates under Law no.259/1958. Since the privatisations of the 1990s, it also regulates the activities of public and private entities which receive state funding, detecting inequity in state contracts, state aid, and competitions. *The Division for Reviews on Autonomy, which has control over territorial subdivisions and particularly over public works projects financed by the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, projects co-financed by the European Union, parking financed under law no.122/1989, and the direct or indirect administration of some local public services by local entities (fishing, etc.). The Audit Chamber for EU and International Affairs, newly established by Law no. 20/1994, which has power over national programmes which utilise EU funds. Since 2008, it has performed the role of \\"external auditor\\" for some international organisations (CERN, ITU, ICAO) and is a Member of UN External Auditor Panel and Technical Group. The Joint Divisions have the power to define the general criteria for each half-year and co-ordinating guidelines for the investigation of the next state budget. Functions  The Court of Audit is a multi-functional institutions. Particularly important is the jurisdictional function in the realm of public administration. The Court of Audit is the special administrative judge mentioned in Article 103 of the Constitution. In this role it has jurisdiction over matters of public accounts and matters governed by the law. The Court of Audit is called upon to make decisions in cases of controversy concerning public accounts and in particular on actions of the administration relating to public employees and public administrators, as well as administrators and officials of societies under public control and controversies about pensions. The Court of Audit makes preventative reviews of the legality of acts of the government and civil service, and a review of the final expenditures of the state, civil service, and entities to which the state contributes funds. The review functions of the Court extend to the administrative subdivisions of the state (regions, provinces, and comuni) in order to ensure internal stability within Italy and between Italy and the European Union. The Court also carries out preventative review of the legality of the acts of administrative subdivisions and their expenditures. These functions are carried out by the regional divisions of the court. The Court also has advisory functions, presenting opinions and reports when it is required to report directly to Parliament on the results of its reviews. The Court of Audit performs the role of a court of audit (strangely enough...) for the civil service. In the course of reviews, it can modify, suspend, and annul the orders of other organs of state for having insufficient financial cover or for sub-optimal use of public resources, with the force of an executive title.  Judgment of responsibility  In the execution of its jurisdictional powers, the Court of Audit does not face the limitations of the ordinary judiciary in administrative matters. On the contrary, the Court determines both facts and law in a full and exclusive manner, because it is as special court. The Court of Audit has competence to judge matters of public accounts and especially the administrative responsibilities of public officials who are summoned to account for their activities in the event of economic loss to the state as a result of malicious or culpable behaviour. This competence has been recently extended to include organisations whose capital is controlled by the state or by other public entities. Although the regulations are contained in special laws (R.D. 1038/1933), which belong to the Civil Procedure Rules, the procedure has many characteristics of a criminal process. Actions are initiated by a Prosecutor General and decisions are made by the jurisdictional division after a public hearing. Before the initiation of the action, the prosecutor must present an request for information (that is, to present documents or deductions within no less than 30 days) to the interested parties. The request for information has the characteristics of an investigation and grants on the right to a legal defence. After the period for the presentation of information has elapsed, the prosecutor has 120 days to take action (this period can be extended with the permission of the relevant division of the court). In this period, the prosecutor performs its investigative activities in order to determine wrongdoing. If the prosecutor decides to take action, it must submit a citation to the Court of Audit so that the president of the court can schedule a hearing. The act of citation must indicate the relevant facts and the foundation of the case. The Court gives judgment on whether the conduct of the audited agent has conformed to legal and conventional norms. The audited agent is the subject who manages public assets for a civil service account (e.g. treasurer, steward, co-signatory, collection agent)Article 74, R.D. 2440/1923 They must present the account of their conduct to their own office; their office must then submit the account to the Court. When the submission reaches the secretary of the court, the agent is automatically placed under judgment (referred to as \\"necessary judgment\\" (giudizio necessario). This is different from the so-called \\"administrative\\" account (amministrativo), for which it is enough to present the account for which the subject carried out the conduct (e.g. an official exercising delegated power) to the administration. The judgment follows an investigation, conducted by the relevant magistrate. If everything is found to be in order, then the magistrate produces a ruling proposing the discharge of the agent and if the prosecutor agrees with the magistrate's finding, then the president of the division of the Court publishes an order for discharge, which closes the case. If the magistrate finds in favour of the prosecution, then the judgment must be affirmed by the entire division and the reason is recorded. Pension judgments A pension judgment (giudizio pensionistico) is a judgment which has been proposed by an individual who claims that their pension (which must be a public pension) has not been allocated correctly by the relevant body in terms of amount/value or who wishes to challenge the refusal of a pension which they have requested. Such judgments can concern war pensions, civil pensions, or military pensions (both ordinary and exceptional). The right to a pension is a subjective right and is not prescribed, nor is the possibility of presenting recourse prescribed, but the individual accruals of the pension are subject to prescription. Unlike the judgment of responsibility, the prosecutor is not involved in this process. Cases are directed to the regional division after the organisation responsible for the pension has been notified. After this, the date of a hearing is established. The parties can present documents and testimony at any time up to ten days before the hearing.  Appeal  Any appeal must be filed within sixty days of the notification of the judgment or within a year of its publication. Thus the term within which the appeal must be made depends on the type of judgment. For pension judgments, notification must be made by the entity from which the pension is sought. In judgments of responsibility, the notification must be directed to the prosecutor general. Within thirty days of notification, the appeal must be submitted to the secretary of the central office of the Court of Audit, along with a copy of the decision which is being challenged. Against the decisions of the jurisdictional divisions it is possible to make appeal to the centreal divisions. Pension judgments can be appealed only on matters of law, not on matters of fact regarding the situation which led to the pension. Judgments of the central divisions of the Court of Audit can be appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation only if they concern matters of jurisdiction. According to Article 111 of the Constitution, the other possible recourse is request for repeal of the judgment, which can be made to both the central and regional divisions.

The ships, with hull optimised for Patagonic coastal service, were designed and built by the Argentine Pr√≠ncipe, Menghi y Penco shipyard, at Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the late 1970s and are denominated the Costa Sur class. Cabo de Hornos, the third ship in her class, was launched on 4 November 1978 as Bah√≠a Camarones, being renamed later. She was commissioned on 28 June 1979 and assigned to the Argentine Navy‚Äôs Naval Transport Service with the pennant number B-5. In addition to coastal and riverine activities in Argentina, Cabo de Hornos also operated overseas. In 1981‚Äì82 she transported from France to Argentina the then new Super √âtendard aircraft incorporated by the Argentine Naval Aviation. In 1989, Cabo de Hornos helped remove oil from the shipwreck of the polar transport , in an effort to reduce pollution in the Antarctic waters. In 1992 she transported to the Gulf of Fonseca, Honduras, the four Baradero-class patrol boats used under United Nations mandate ONUCA. Also in 1992, she transported troops, vehicles, and supplies of the Argentine Army to Yugoslavia, as part of the UNPROFOR peace mission. In mid-2012 her hull underwent maintenance.

Subordinated to the High Command of the (the '), its function was to produce and disseminate propaganda materials aimed at the German troops and the population. Planning and formation The planning for propaganda activities by the Wehrmacht began in 1938. Joseph Goebbels, the head of Ministry of Propaganda, sought to establish effective cooperation with the Wehrmacht to ensure a smooth flow of propaganda materials from the front. He deferred to the military in setting up and controlling the propaganda companies, but provided assistance in supplying personnel. Function and operation  The service was subordinated to the OKW Chief of Operation Staff, General Alfred Jodl. Commanded by General Hasso von Wedel, the department oversaw the numerous propaganda companies (Propagandakompanie or PK) of the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, attached to the fighting troops. At its peak in 1942, the propaganda troops included 15,000 men. The propaganda companies were the only news-reporting units in areas of military operation, as civilian news correspondents were prohibited from entering combat zones. The troops produced the written, audio and film materials from the front and sent them to a processing center in Germany, where they were reviewed by censors, mostly for security purposes. The filtered materials were then forwarded to the Ministry of Propaganda for immediate dissemination. Among the propaganda materials produced was the Wehrmachtbericht, the official news communiqu√© about the military situation of the Reich, and was intended for both domestic and foreign consumption.

The loop involves connections between the cortex, the basal ganglia, the thalamus, and back to the cortex. It is of particular relevance to hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, as well as to mental disorders of control, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD), and Tourette syndrome. The CBGTC loop primarily consists of modulatory dopaminergic projections from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area as well as excitatory glutamatergic projections from the cortex to the striatum, where these projections form synapses with excitatory and inhibitory pathways that relay back to the cortex. The loop was originally proposed as a part of a model of the basal ganglia called the parallel processing model, which has been criticized and modified into another model called the center surround model. Current organization schemes characterize cortico-basal ganglia interactions as segregated parallel processing, meaning there is little convergence of distinct cortical areas in the basal ganglia. This is thought to explain the topographically organized functionality of the striatum. The striatum is organized on a rostro-caudal axis, with the rostral putamen and caudate serving associative and cognitive functions and the caudal areas serving sensorimotor function. Sometimes when the striatum is the expressed target the loop is referred to as the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical loop. Neuroanatomy Indirect and direct pathways. Some neuroanatomy is excluded for simplicity. The two major input structures of the circuit are the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The striatum receives inputs from both the cortex and the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc), while the STN only receives cortical inputs. Two pathways emerge from the striatum. One pathway is called the indirect (or NoGo) pathway and is inhibitory. This projects to and inhibits the globus pallidus externus (GPe), resulting in the disinhibition of the globus pallidus internus (GPi), leading to inhibition of the thalamus. This pathway also, as a result of inhibiting the GPe, disinhibits the subthalamic nucleus, which results in excitation of the GPi, and therefore inhibition of the thalamus. The second pathway, is called the direct (or Go) pathway and is excitatory. This pathway inhibits the GPi, resulting in the disinhibition of the thalamus. The direct pathway mostly consists of monosynaptic connections driven by dopamine receptor D1, adenosine A1 receptor, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4, while the indirect pathway relies on connections driven by dopamine receptor D2, adenosine A2A receptor, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1. The parallel CBGTC loops have been segregated according to the functions of associated cortical regions. One scheme involves the division into limbic and motor loops, with the motor loops containing indirect and direct pathways, which are in turn interconnected with the limbic loop that projects into the ventral striatum. The loop has also been divided into limbic, associative, oculomotor, and motor circuits to explain the role of dopamine in the basal ganglia on motivational states. A five loop division based on primary cortical targets has been described as follows: *A motor circuit originating in the supplementary motor area, motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex, which in turn projects to the putamen, which projects to the ventrolateral GPi and caudolateral SNr, before returning to the cortex via the ventralis lateralis pars oralis and ventralis lateralis pars medialis. *An oculomotor circuit originating in the frontal eye fields projecting to the body of the caudate, and returning via the caudal dorsomedial GPi/ventromedial SNr, and then the lateral ventralis anterior pars magnocellularis and medialis dorsalis pars paralarnellaris. *A dorsolateral prefrontal circuit involving projections from the dlPFC and posterior parietal cortex, that projects to the dorsolateral head of the caudate, which in turn projects to the lateral dorsomedial GPi/rostrolateral SNr, which projects to the ventralis anterior pars parvocellularis and medialis dorsalis pars parvocellularis. *A lateral orbitofrontal circuit projecting to the ventromedial caudate head, which projects through the medial dorsomedial GPi/rostromedial SNr to the medial ventralis medialis pars magnocellularis/medialis dorsalis pars magnocellularis. *An anterior cingulate circuit that involves projections from the ACC to the ventral striatum, through the rostolateral GPi/VP/rostrodorsal SNr, which returns via the posteromedial medialis dorsalis. A problem identified with the current anatomy of the circuit is that the time delay between the direct and indirect pathways should result in this circuit not working. To overcome this, the center surround hypothesis posits a hyperdirect pathway from the cortex would inhibit other inputs besides one focused cortical input. However, the timing of basal ganglia activity and limb moment, as well as lesion studies do not support this hypothesis Function Two models have been proposed to explain how actions are selected in the basal ganglia. The actor-critic model suggests that actions are generated and evaluated by a \\"critic\\" in the ventral striatum, while the actions are carried out by an \\"actor\\" in the dorsal striatum. Another model proposes the basal ganglia acts as a selection mechanism, where actions are generated in the cortex and are selected based on context by the basal ganglia. The CBGTC loop is also involved in reward discounting, with firing increasing with an unexpected or greater than expected reward. One review supported the idea that the cortex was involved in learning actions regardless of their outcome, while the basal ganglia was involved in selecting appropriate actions based on associative reward based trial and error learning. Role in disease The CBGTC loop has been implicated in many diseases. For example, in Parkinson's disease, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leading to decreased activity of the excitatory pathway is thought to result in hypokinesia, and in Huntington's disease, degeneration of GABAergic neurons driving the inhibitory pathway is thought to result in the jerky body movements. The co-degeneration of limbic projections along with motor projections may result in many of the psychiatric symptoms of these primarily motor illnesses. In OCD, the loop may be dysfunctional, with an imbalance between the indirect and direct pathways resulting in unwanted thoughts, getting \\"stuck\\". In ADHD, decreased tonic dopaminergic signaling resulting in excessive discounting of delayed rewards is thought to result in decreased attention. Research The CBGTC loop has been studied in relation to consciousness, action selection, in relation to other circuits and in the context of memory and cognition. The CBGTC loop model has been criticized as oversimplified and too rigidly applied, given evidence of anatomical and functional overlap and interactions between the direct and indirect pathways. The loop has also been researched in the context of deep brain stimulation. As of 2013 there was intense debate with regards to division of the circuit, pathway interactions, number of pathways and general anatomy.

Bak was the recipient of the 1957 Esso Foundation's prize for outstanding technical scientific research, and was elected a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences in 1958. Biography Bak received his bachelor's degree at the University of Copenhagen in mathematics, physics, chemistry and astronomy, specializing in organic chemistry. Immediately following his graduation, Bak served as a research assistant in the University's Department of Chemistry where he worked closely with the renowned organic chemist Einar Biilmann and spectroscopist Alex Langseth; and just the union of spectroscopy and synthetic organic chemistry formed the basis for Bak's later scientific work. Bak's contribution to the field began early with his prize winning submission to the University of Copenhagen's call for papers on the subject of organic chemical elements that won him the Gold Medal.B√∏rge, Bak, Der √∏nskes en Oversigt over de kendte Metoder til Fremstilling af Tartronsyre og en eksperimentel Gennempr√∏vning af et Udvalg af disse, samt, om muligt, Angivelse af en forbedret eller ny og fordelagtigere Fremgangsmaade. 1937 Bak continued to build upon this work in his doctoral thesis \\"The Internal Molecular Potential\\" which served as the forerunner of numerous treatises on molecular dynamics, the theoretical basis for the understanding of the molecular vibration and rotational spectra. He was awarded the D.Phil. in 1943. Shortly after the Second World War, Bak traveled to Berkeley, California (1946‚Äì47) where he in collaboration with W. D. Gwinn built the first microwave spectrograph, an instrument that could be realized thanks to components developed originally for use in advanced war- time radar systems (Klystron oscillator).Gwinn, W.D., Phase Stabilized Klystron System and Its Application to Microwave Spectroscopy and Microwave Frequency Standards, Review of Scientific Instruments, Volume 33, Issue 1, p.79-82 This work involved a considerable amount of vacuum-tube electronics and the handling of microwave radiation. At first they tried to detect the absorption in long lengths of waveguide, but shortly thereafter Stark modulation was developed and special waveguides containing an electrode allowed for the transmission of microwaves. Bak was able to repeat this pioneering achievement upon his return to Copenhagen where he established a world-renowned laboratory at the University of Copenhagen's H.C. √òrsted Institute.B. Bak, L. Hansen-Nygaard, and J. Rastrup- Andersen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 2, 361 (1958); B. Bak, D. Christensen, and J. Rastrup- Andersen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 7, 58 (1961); B. Bak, D. Christensen, W. B. Dixon, L. Hansen- Nygaard, J. Rastrup-Andersen, and M. Schottlander, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 9, 124 (1962). Over the following years, Bak's students and colleagues produced over 300 papers and publications containing precise determinations of molecular geometry from microwave spectra based on infrared spectroscopy, Raman- spectroscopy, microwave-spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic radiation spectroscopy.Rao, K N. Molecular spectroscopy : modern research. Place of publication not identified: Academic Press, 1985. These early measurements and results were supplemented by Bak's work with quantum chemistry calculations of small molecular structures. Combined, this work formed the foundation for much of our understanding of the field today.Nygaard, Lise.

Kbh.: [K√∏benavns Universitet], 1984. Most unusually within the field of spectroscopy, Bak's research branch encouraged - as one of the first in chemistry - the interaction between experts from disciplines as diverse as quantum chemistry, chemical physics, apparatus construction and electronics. In addition to his core research interests, Bak also published and continued to investigate related subjects such as infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (where he was Danish pioneer) and the spectra of volatile pyrolysis products which later proved to be of particular importance for chemistry and astro-chemistry. Reputation The Danish Chemist and Jorck Prize winner Kjeld Rasmussen described his view of Bak in his farewell remarks from the University of Copenhagen: \\"My occupation with infrared spectroscopy lead to teaching Molecular Spectroscopy. It was done in collaboration with this subject's Nestor in Denmark, B√∏rge Bak, who was professor at the University of Copenhagen and external lecturer at Polyteknisk L√¶reanstalt which is the old name of the Technical University. B√∏rge Bak was stepping down, being ill, and I soon took over the teaching, in the beginning with Bak as censor. A tough one, both to me and to the students.\\" Wartime Activities B√∏rge Bak was an active member of the Danish Resistance, working overtly as a volunteer firefighter in order to gather secret documents and material after organized bombings.

As of September 2018, the game has grossed over outside China. Arena of Valor was one of six Esports video games featured at the 2018 Asian Games, 2019 Southeast Asian Games, and 2021 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games as part of the demonstration sport. Gameplay Arena of Valor is a 3D, third-person, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game for mobile. The game has multiple modes, with the main three being Grand Battle, Valley Skirmish and Abyssal Clash. Players compete in these matches which on average last for around 12 ‚Äì 18 minutes. Players aim to destroy enemy turrets on the map, with the victory condition being to destroy the enemy core. The overall gameplay of Arena of Valor highly resembles a game called League of Legends, a MOBA game developed and published by Riot Games, which is a subsidiary of Tencent. Players control characters, referred to as heroes, and each of these heroes have a unique set of abilities. Heroes start the game at a low level, and can earn gold and experience (XP) in various ways: Killing non-player creatures such as minions or monsters, defeating other players, destroying structures, passively through time and through special items that can be purchased through the shop. Earning experience unlocks and augments abilities, making the hero more powerful. Items purchased in the shop do not carry over matches, and therefore all players are on equal footing at the start of every match. Matches give players rewards, such as gold, which can then be used to buy a variety of heroes or arcana. In addition to this, players can play a 'Ranked' match type, which allows them to be matched with players who are at their skill level and be assessed through in-game 'ranks'. Stars are earnt for a victory, and lost when the player loses.  Game modes  There are various game modes, with 5v5, also known as Grand Battle or Ranked, being the most popular. Valley Skirmish is a 3v3 game mode using a much smaller map. In this version of the game, there is only one turret and a core base for both team. These games are designed to be much quicker, and typically last for 4 ‚Äì 6 minutes. Abyssal Clash is a 5v5 game mode where players are given randomly selected heroes. Players may choose to re-roll once and receive a different hero. The game map, Abyss Canyon, only has one lane, with two turrets and a core base connected at either end of the lane. There are certain restrictions which do not appear in the default 5v5 mode: Items may only be purchased before leaving the base or upon death and hero healing at the team base is disabled. There are health regeneration runes that appear next to each turret, which provide heroes with a small regeneration effect. Hook Wars is one of the party/entertainment game modes that is available to play every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The game map, Treasure Bay, is made up of two large connected vessels. There are no minions, turrets or bases in this mode. Each player is able to use a Hook as a special ability, which can grab an enemy on the opposite boat or from long distances. Players aim to capture the Control Zone, located at the center of the map, and hold the zone for a certain duration (until the counter reaches 100%). The capture rate increases with the number of players standing within the zone.  Hero types  There are 103 heroes in Arena of Valor as of September 3, 2020. Arena of Valor divides the heroes into numerous categories that each play different roles. The most notable difference is the type of damage a hero deals - some heroes deal physical damage, which can be countered by the armor stat, whilst other heroes deal mainly magic damage, which is countered by the magic resistance stat. Some heroes deal both types of damage, and some deal 'true' damage, which cannot be countered by either armor or magic resistance. All heroes are classified as one of six categories, with some heroes overlapping multiple categories. * Marksman: Also known as \\"AD Carry/ADC\\", marksmen are ranged heroes that usually deal physical damage mostly through their auto attack. This hero type deals sustained damage, and therefore are useful in teamfights in order to reduce opponent's health. They are also very efficient in taking objectives such as turrets. However, they are often fragile and vulnerable. Examples of marksmen are Tel'Annas, Valhein, and Yorn. * Mage: Mages are sometimes known as \\"AP Carry/APC\\". These heroes deal high amount of burst magic damage. Some mages are fragile while some mages are more durable depending on the respective itemization. Mages are a mix of ranged heroes, which deal damage from afar, or melee heroes, which deal damage from close distances. Examples of mages are Lauriel, Liliana, and Tulen. * Assassin: These are heroes that are designed to deal large amounts of damage quickly, and often do not have much health. Assassins often search for the enemy marksman or mage as well as any other fragile heroes to eliminate quickly. They are also responsible for shutting down enemies that are on a killing spree. They have high mobility and burst damage for focusing valuable enemy targets. Examples of assassins are Murad, Nakroth, and Zill. * Tank: Tanks are heroes that have large amounts of HP and usually build completely defensive to be able to soak damage for the team. As a result, they often deal little damage. However, they often have abilities known as 'crowd control' that allow them to inhibit the movement of the enemy team. In addition to this, they can use these abilities to initiate a teamfight, or to prevent the enemy team from attacking high priority targets such as an ally marksman or mage. Examples of tanks are Xeniel, Thane, and Toro. * Warrior: Heroes that blend the attributes of damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. Warriors usually have a balanced amount of health, defense, and attack damage, which is a common designation for close-range melee duelist. Thus, they able to survive long periods of fighting and excel in doing continuous sustain damage. Warriors are all-rounded and tend to be extremely strong in 1v1 scenarios. Examples of warriors are Florentino, Rourke, and Omen. * Support: Heroes whose abilities aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies (such as movement speed buffs), debuffing the enemy team (such as stunning), or a combination of the above. Support heroes are often paired with the marksman in the early laning phase of the game where the support doesn't kill minions but instead focuses on aiding their partner and harassing the enemy heroes. Support heroes usually aid ally marksman as they are often weaker during the early phase of the game and need assistance in order to survive. Example of supports are Alice, Annette, and Krizzix. Players can purchase items, which make a large impact on the hero stats and playstyle. An example of this is Zephys, a dual warrior/assassin class. He has a passive ability that increases damage reduction against incoming damage based on a proportion of health lost. If only offensive items are bought, he will deal a lot of damage but will have a low amount of health and defense, which impact survivability. If Zephys purchases a mix of offensive and defensive items, he can take damage for the team while still dealing a noticeable amount of damage. If Zephys buys only defensive items, he can boost his damage reduction passive to its maximum potential, being literally almost impossible to die in most circumstances like a Tank class character, but will deal drastically lower amounts of damage. This kind of playstyle can be applied to all heroes, allowing tanks to act as warriors, mages to act as supports, and vice versa. Development Arena of Valor (formerly Strike of Kings) is an international adaptation of Honor of Kings for markets outside mainland China. In 2015, Tencent approached Riot Games and asked them to turn their multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game League of Legends into a mobile title. However, Riot Games declined and claimed that the gameplay of League of Legends could not be replicated on smartphones. Tencent proceeded to create their own mobile MOBA game, Wangzhe Rongyao, roughly translated to English as Honor of Kings, and was released on November 26, 2015. Nevertheless, several Riot Games employees deemed that the design of characters and abilities in Honor of Kings were \\"blatantly ripping off the intellectual property of League of Legends\\", and reportedly brought these concerns to Tencent. Tencent responded that they would change its own game enough to sell as a standalone product with no relation to League of Legends. Despite this, Honor of Kings already gained massive popularity in China at this point. Tencent felt that it was too late to make huge changes to the game, so they decided that Honor of Kings will only go through small necessary changes, while the international release of the game outside mainland China will be the one that features different content, hence leading to the creation of Arena of Valor. Arena of Valor is developed by TiMi Studios with the same engine and user interface design as Honor of Kings and published by Tencent Games for the western market. Garena joined the development team as they helped to westernize the atmosphere of the game. The in-game characters have been swapped from characters inspired by Chinese folklore and Chinese mythology, to characters inspired by European folklore and several mythologies from other nations, with blending a variety of elements including Lovecraftian horror, steampunk, high fantasy, and sword and sorcery to appeal audiences outside mainland China. The appearance of in-game characters mostly recycled and revamped designs of characters from Heroes of Newerth, a MOBA game that Garena had acquired from S2 Games. Arena of Valor included several characters such as Butterfly, Violet, and Mina from Age of Gunslingers (), a third-person shooter that was developed by Tencent and TiMi Studios. These characters have different lore than the game where they originated. Additionally, Arena of Valor has multiple collaborations with other franchises, including crossover with DC Universe, Contra, and Wiro Sableng. The game also collaborated with KFC and Sword Art Online to advertize the game, with the mascot of the respective franchises made their appearance in the game as skin. Tencent originally intended to feature characters from Marvel Comics during the earliest development stage of Arena of Valor before they collaborated with DC Comics, with the closed Beta test (of the game under the name of Marvel Super Heroes MOBA (). The initial game featured some characters from Tencent's intellectual property such as Butterfly, Violet, Mina, Valhein, and Zanis crossovers with Marvel's characters. However, Marvel took back their license, forcing Tencent to shut down the game. Subsequently, TiMi Studios had to restart the development from scratch and redesign the game, creating the current appearance of Arena of Valor. Tencent approached DC Comics to include its characters as a replacement. The soundtrack for Arena of Valor was composed by American music artist Matthew Carl Earl, creating a different atmosphere compared to the original score with Chinese music instruments in Honor of Kings. Arena of Valor has a wide variety of publishers for different regions. Arena of Valor was first launched in Taiwan on October 14, 2016 by Garena, following a two-week closed beta testing period. On October 17, 2017, Garena launched Arena of Valor in Malaysia, Singapore, and Philippines, where a majority of the gaming community plays mobile games. Garena decided to combine these three countries in one server. In South Korea, the game was published by Netmarble on April 26, 2017. The game was released in European markets by Tencent on August 10, 2017, and was released in North and Latin American mobile app stores on December 19, 2017. On June 28, 2018, Tencent implemented \\"Asia server\\" unannounced. This server included Australia, New Zealand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Brunei. In Japan, DeNA cooperated with Tencent to launch Arena of Valor on November 30, 2018. The game was announced to be released for the Nintendo Switch console during the September 2017 Nintendo Direct presentation. A closed beta became available for the platform between June and July 2018, and participants received an exclusive in-game skin for one of the characters. The game is confirmed to launch on the platform on September 25, 2018. Speaking to Engadget, Tencent Games revealed the Nintendo Switch port of the game is enhanced and optimized for the platform, taking advantage of the console's processing power and hardware features to implement various changes to the game, such as improved graphics and animations, better lighting, smoother lines, and additional minute details like butterflies. Additionally, several adjustments were made to the game to be playable on a bigger screen with traditional controls, and stats for characters have been reconfigured. Because of these changes, cross-play between the Nintendo Switch and mobile versions of the game is not possible. Tencent Games have plans for competitive events based on the Nintendo Switch version. Riot Games implied that their relationship with Tencent is still strong, and the conflict between them and their games is only \\"a bump in the road\\". In July 2017, Riot Games filed a lawsuit against Moonton, the developer of the rival game Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, for copyright infringement, citing similarities between Mobile Legends and League of Legends. Riot Games complained that the name title of Mobile Legends sounds confusingly similar to League of Legends. The case was initially dismissed in Central District Court of California in United States on account of forum non conveniens. Tencent, as Riot's parent company, filed a new, separate lawsuit on behalf of Riot Games, directly targeting Moonton's CEO, Watson Xu Zhenhua in Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court, which ruled in Tencent's favor in July 2018, awarding Tencent a settlement of (RMB19.4 million). The case was generally renowned as \\"LoL vs MLBB\\", which is to cause major public relation damage to the Mobile Legendss brand as a whole through word of mouth to make the game well known that it has ripped-off League of Legends illegally. With both Honor of Kings and Arena of Valor still continuously increasing in popularity, playerbase, and have a huge esports scene, Riot Games then realized and acknowledged the potential of the mobile market for the MOBA genre. Riot Games eventually announced their own mobile MOBA game, League of Legends: Wild Rift on October 16, 2019, which is the 10th anniversary of League of Legends. Esports International competition Arena of Valor tournaments have been held in numerous regions, with each region having their own local leagues such as Garena Challenger Series Pro League (GCS) in Taiwan, Realm of Valor Pro League (RPL) in Thailand, Arena of Glory - ƒê·∫•u tr∆∞·ªùng danh v·ªçng (AOG) in Vietnam, Arena of Valor Star League (ASL) in Indonesia, Arena of Valor: Valor Cup (AVC) in Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines, Arena of Valor: Valor Series (AVS) in Europe, North America, and Latin America, and Arena of Valor Japan League (AJL) in Japan.

A total of nine regions competed for the grand prize, which includes Taiwan - Hong Kong - Macau, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia - Singapore - Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, North America, Latin America and Europe. Additionally, the tournament host selected three Wildcard teams to participate in AWC. The second AWC tournament was held in Danang, Vietnam, from June 27 to July 14, 2019, with the same total prize pool of $500,000.

The vertical succession of rounded forms create a feeling of slight vibration of the volume of the building as it rises upward. Elevations of the short sides are fully glazed and show the mechanical series of six panoramic lifts going up and down to the various floors of the building.

Early life  Byrne was born into a successful family of journalists from Dublin. Cared for by servants, from a young age Byrne felt like she wasn‚Äôt loved as much as the other children in the family. She was the middle child with two brothers and two sisters. The eldest sister was named Olive, followed by Michael, Byrne, Brian, and Esther. Frankie attended boarding school in Rathfarnham. Byrne had a limited relationship with her parents. Her father was a racing journalist and broadcaster who lived in the Gresham Hotel on O‚ÄôConnell street where his job at Radio √âireann was located. Frankie became addicted to nicotine and alcohol. Other family members also struggled with addictions: her siblings Olive and Mick died from alcoholism, and Brian also had a drinking problem.  Career  In the late 1940s, Frankie Byrne worked at the Brazilian embassy in Dublin. She was a pioneer in Irish radio and her program the ‚ÄúAgony Aunt‚Äù led to public confessionals on the radio. She wrote an Agony Aunt column for the Evening Press during the same period. She was best known for her 22 years of the radio program ‚ÄòDear Frankie‚Äô. On the show she gave relationship advice to listener requests. Dear Frankie sponsored by Jacobs paved the way for the contemporary radio programs such as The Gerry Ryan Show and RTE‚Äôs Liveline with Joe Duffy. . Dear Frankie was broadcast from 1963 to 1985. Dear Frankie opened with the words, ‚ÄòWelcome to a Woman‚Äôs Page, a program for and about you‚Äô The program began as a 15-minute question and answer format on household issues but soon became a radio program that allowed people to share confidences and seek advice . Frankie shared household problems with her listeners ranging from jealous husband to lovelorn teenagers. Frankie claimed she knew nothing about domestic science but that she did know about love. Byrne advised on domestic relationships while living a life of turmoil. The most unique feature of Dear Frankie was that the program set people to talking, and helped begin a national conversation on the lonely struggles of generations of Irish women.  Personal life  Byrne never married but had a 30-year relationship with Frank Hall the legendary satirist and columnist for the Evening Herald. Hall was married to Aideen Kierney at the time. Byrne and Hall had met as colleagues at Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann. Their relationship has been disputed by family members and friends, who denied they had a child together and that the couple were just good friends. However, Byrne became pregnant in the 50s presumably by Frank Hall. She gave birth to her daughter Valerie on the 12th of July 1956. Byrne wanted to keep the baby but ultimately gave her up to St Clare's Orphanage in Stamullen. She frequently visited her daughter until she eventually put her up for adoption. Frank Hall left Byrne in the mid-50s at the time she endured severe post-natal depression. She was prescribed Valium and was addicted to the drug for 10 years.  Later life and death  Byrne and her daughter were reunited a decade before Byrne's death. ‚ÄúMy mother ‚Äì my real mother ‚Äì was very supportive‚Äù, Byrne's daughter said.‚ÄúShe had some information that helped, but she didn‚Äôt give it to me until just before I was married, when I was 20, and I just kept that information that I had and tracked her down about seven years later.‚Äù Byrne died at the age of 71 from Alzheimer's disease in St Vincent's hospital, Dublin, on 14 December 1993. Tributes were paid by colleagues and friends including the RTE assistant Director-General, Mr Bobby Gahan, who described the late Mrs Byrne's voice as \\"one of the greatest sounds of radio\\". Others who paid public tribute to her include fellow broadcasters Larry Gogan and Gay Byrne.  Legacy  Frankie Byrne is remembered as an influential force during the time of her radio show, and it has been said that ‚Äòwhole generation‚Äô can ‚Äòhum the signature tune to Frankie Byrne‚Äôs radio program‚Äô. When Frankie Byrne passed away in 1993 there was an outburst of support. Gay Byrne described her as having been ‚ÄúA national institution who had been loved by everyone‚Äù. Dear Frankie, is often credited as the first 'agony aunt‚Äô radio show program format in Ireland. Frankie‚Äôs talk show and life inspired numerous pieces of literature including a stage production in 2012 by the Five Lamps Theater Company, which told the story of her ‚Äòtragic and secretive life‚Äô. She was also the subject of a book published in 1998, which compiled the advice which she gave on Dear Frankie. In 2005, RT√â aired a documentary on Frankie Byrne, in which they explored her life following the show, and included interviews with Frankie‚Äôs family and friends, including her daughter. Frankie Byrne is also famous for having been the first woman to found a public relations company in 1963, that worked almost exclusively in promoting Jacob‚Äôs.

Among its members are two Catholic saints, three bishops, and five generals. Because his marriage with Victorine-Antoinette de Pontev√®s was childless, he named as his heirs the two nephews of his wife: Edouard and L√©onide de Pontev√®s- Barg√®me, in whose favor a royal ordinance of 1828, and 1829 letters-patent, autorised the transmission of the title of Duke of Sabran. The name de Sabran has since been carried by the de Pontev√®s family, through the adoption in 1832  Origin  The name stemmed from the barony of Sabran near Bagnols sur C√®ze in the north of the d√©partement of Gard. The barony also possessed in Provence significant assets in the town of Beaucaire, as well as a portion of the city of Uz√®s, which fell to it as a result of the marriage around 1156 of Rostaing II to Roscie du Caylar, granddaughter of Elz√©art d'Uz√®s. The ancient old, former lords of Sabran styled themselves by the grace of God, constables of the counts ofToulouse. The family was very proud to count two Catholic saints among its members : Elz√©ar de Sabran, canonized in 1369, and his wife Dauphine or Delphine, proclaimed bienheureuse, for their mystic love and their love for the humble. Procession is still made for them every September in Ansouis, whose lordly domain has belonged to their family since the 10th century, then belonged to it again from 1836 to 2008. Several of its members were knights of the order of Malta, marshalls of the kingdom of Naples or officers of high rank in the royal navy (Marine royale) in France. They were also counts of Ariano, sovereign counts of Forcalquier, counts of Sabran, then of Sabran- Pontev√®s, baron of Ansouis, peers of France et dukes.

It is believed to be one of the palaces or residences of a minister of Cankili, king of Jaffna, before the fall of the Jaffna kingdom to the Portuguese. The building is surrounded by other historical remains of the Jaffna kingdom such as the Sattanathar temple, which was one the city temples of the kingdom; Yamuna Eri and Cankilian Thoppu are also located nearby. However, much of the architectural style belongs to the post-Jaffna kingdom era.  The different theories  Embedded letters on porch indicates built 1890 There are a number of contradictory theories about the origin of the building. Some historians say that it could have been built during the Dutch period, referring to the building materials used (bricks, lime plaster, wood and tiles), the structure and ornamental work. Alternatively, the ornamental work on pillars, capitals and the arched porch appear to belong to the Jaffna kingdom's era. After the fall of Nallur, the Portuguese shifted their capital to Jaffna, but they made use of existing structures. Also, the Dutch used pre-existing buildings and they constructed new buildings as well. According to the historians' view, the Mantri Manai could have been renovated or newly constructed by the Dutch. Another source says that the building has no connection with the Jaffna kingdom, but is a 19th-century choultry (guesthouse).  Style  A wood carving in capital The Mantri Manai is built in a mixture of European and Dravidian architecture styles. The entrance has an ornamental gateway, a large arched porch and a tower. It is a two-storey structure with wooden carvings decorating the interior walls. It has a well and a wash basin, a cellar, and a staircase leading down to underground rooms and secret tunnels.

History Genale was created in 1924 by a group of settlers from the Italian city of Torino, with the supervision of the Italian governor of the colony. Near the Genale of the colonists and separated by the Shebelle river, soon grew a bigger city populated by Somalis (working as cheap labor force in the plantations): the actual Janaale. After WW2 remained only Janaale, while Genale disappeared when the defeated Italians moved away from Somalia. In 1924 indeed it was started the Italian colonization of the area of Genale, in southern Somalia, forming a group of small and medium-sized farms. Most settlers consisted of old fascist militants of Turin who had followed in this Italian colony the new governor of Somalia, Cesare Maria De Vecchi. The first informal association between farmers, however, arose only in 1928.Italian emigration in Somalia; pag. 11 (in Italian) The main crop of the area was cotton and was done by small farms owned by those Italian settlers: about one hundred with an area varying between 75 and 600 hectares (with an average that oscillated about 200) with a total area of about 20,000 hectares. At least until 1931 the cotton was the main crop, later replaced by the banana production,Banana harvest in Genale whose harvest was sold to the Italian State, that did the marketing in Italy as a monopoly. During the Italian colonial period Genale was the center of a vast area of agricultural concessions of 20,000 hectares for the cultivation of banana, cotton and other subsidiaries. The bananas were marketed by the Royal Company Monopoly Bananas (abbreviated RAMB) that had, in fact, a monopoly of the export to Italy granted in order to safeguard banana production in Somalia on the Italian market. Consequently, until the 1950s all the bananas consumed in Italy came from the area of Genale.Photo of Genale farms The cultivation was made possible by a large dam Photo of the Genale Dam in the river Shebelle, and by a vast network of canals built between 1924 and 1926. Given the importance of the area it was created, from the administrative point of view, the Vicecommissariato di Genale with \\"Vittorio di Africa\\" as capital (currently \\"Scialambod\\"), where industrial activities were focused also for the processing of agricultural products. It is noteworthy to pinpoint that in 1939 Italian Somalia nearly all the development was concentrated in the triangle \\"Genale-Villabruzzi-Mogadiscio\\". Indeed the Italians -settling in huge numbers after WW1- italianised the capital Mogadiscio (that in 1940 was called the \\"White Pearl of Indian Ocean\\" and was practically a fully Italianised city with over 40% of inhabitants being Italians or descendants of italians) and the 3 main cities in the Shebelle river farm area (Villabruzzi with 3000 colonists, Genale with 700 and Vittorio with 400). But little communities of Italian colonists existed also in the Benadir cities of Merca (250 Italians), Brava (150), Chisimaio (120), Baidora (300) and Itala (50), where they lived in small areas that were the only fully modern & developed sections of these little cities. The center of Genale is a few kilometers inland from the city of Merca which is its port (being Janaale landlocked). During the period dell'A.F.I.S. (Trust Territory of Somalia) in the years 1950-60, the \\"Consortium of farmer-dealers\\" was reinforced, but in the late 1970s started to lose importance and in the 1990s disappeared. The late Aden Abdullah Osman Daar (Adan Cadde), Somalia's first president, had a farm in the town. Demographics In the Italian Genale there were in 1940 nearly 500 Italian Somalis, but after WWII nearly all of them moved away and since the 1980s no one has remained. The city actually has 8000 inhabitants (of whom nearly one thousand are descendants from Italians and Somalian girls) and is predominantly inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, with the DirBiimaal Clanwell-represented.

Research Branas is known for studying human geography, public health, emergency medical care, and multiple aspects of gun violence, which he first became interested when he saw its effects firsthand while working as a paramedic. A 2004 study of his showed that rural US residents were at greater risk of gun suicide than urban residents were of gun homicide, and was subsequently cited by the US Supreme Court. In 2009, he published the first study to show that individuals in possession of firearms were more than four times as likely to be shot than those not in possession. Also that year, he published a study showing that heavy drinkers were 2.67 more likely to be shot during an assault than people who did not drink at all. The study found that this association was largely because the drinkers spent so much time near liquor stores that sold alcohol to-go. In 2018, he led the first series of citywide randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing that greening vacant lots, as well as requiring homeowners to put glass in their windows, resulted in significantly fewer gun assaults, shootings, and self-reported fear and depression among residents. His work has shown that approximately 15% of the spaces in US cities is vacant or abandoned, a total area about the size of Switzerland, making low-cost citywide interventions like these of high value to urban planners and policymakers.

It was the first heavy bomber in the 8th Air Force to complete twenty-five missions in Europe in World War II and the aircraft which crashed while carrying Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews. Combat history Hot Stuff was part of the 8th Air Force out of Hardwick, Station 104, England, and part of the 93rd Bomb Group, 330th Bomb Squadron. Hot Stuff flew its 25th mission on February 7, 1943, against long odds at a time when many planes were being shot down. Hot Stuff became the first heavy bomber in the 8th Air Force to complete twenty-five missions in Europe in World War II and reached its 25th mission three-and-a-half months before the widely celebrated Memphis Belle. After Hot Stuff completed thirty-one missions, it was selected to return to the United States on May 3, 1943, to tour the country and help sell war bonds. Crash in Iceland In early 1943 Lt. Gen. Frank M. Andrews needed to get back to Washington, D.C. He was Commander of the European Theater of Operations and known as the father of the Air Force. General Andrews knew Hot Stuff's pilot Capt. \\"Shine\\" Shannon and chose to fly back to the United States with him. The pilot, Capt. Shannon stated before the flight that he was \\"assigned to take Andrews home via Iceland.\\" PFC Carroll Stewart, Gen. Andrews' aide and 93rd Bomb Group historian stated that \\"Captain Robert H. (Shine) Shannon of The Circus would have been going south, too, (to participate in Operation Tidalwave, the ploesti Raid) except his plane and crew were tabbed by Frank M. Andrews, gray- thatched European Theater Commander, for a hurried trip to the Pentagon.\\" It was well known that General Andrews was in line for promotion and may have been going back to Washington, D.C., to be promoted to four star general and/or possibly assigned to lead the assault across the English Channel. Hot Stuff had a scheduled refueling stop in Iceland but crashed into Mount Fagradalsfjall near Grindavik, Iceland, in bad weather on May 3, 1943. Fourteen on board were killed. Only the tail gunner, George Eisel, survived.\\"Toll in Iceland Accident Now 14; Storm Warning Went Unheeded,\\" Washington Post, May 6, 1943. Because of Gen.

Additionally, because Hot Stuff was destroyed in the crash, the War Department chose to send the Memphis Belle home and celebrate it as the first bomber to reach 25 missions.

Although long-serving incumbent President Yahya Jammeh initially accepted the surprising victory of Adama Barrow, he rejected the election results eight days later. Jammeh called for the election to be annulled and appealed to the Supreme Court. Troops were subsequently deployed in the capital Banjul and Serekunda. After ECOWAS delegates failed to persuade Jammeh to step down, a coalition of military forces from Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana invaded the Gambia on 19 January 2017 to compel him to relinquish power. Two days later, Jammeh surrendered presidential duties in favour of Barrow and left the country to exile in Equatorial Guinea.  Initial reactions  Following the announcement of the results of the elections, opposition supporters widely celebrated the surprise victory and were stunned by Jammeh's concession of defeat. Thousands of people celebrated in the streets of Banjul. However, some expressed caution about what Jammeh might do next ‚Äì suggesting that he could still try to retain power despite what had happened. A businessman said \\"I will only believe it when I see him leaving state house. He still controls the army, and his family are the top brass.\\" A few days after the election, 19 opposition prisoners were released, including Ousainou Darboe, the leader of Barrow's United Democratic Party. Darboe had been arrested in April 2016 and sentenced to three years in prison, and his arrest had led to Barrow's candidacy. Interviewed shortly after the election, Barrow thanked the Gambian people, including those in the diaspora outside of the country, and appealed to them to put aside their differences and work together for the development of their country. He said, \\"I know Gambians are in hurry but not everything is going to be achieved in one day. I would therefore appeal to all Gambians and friends of the Gambia to join us and help move this great country forward. I don't want this change of regime to be a mere change. I want it to be felt and seen in the wellbeing of the country and all Gambians. So we are calling on all Gambians and friends of the Gambia to help us make the Gambia great again.\\" Barrow said his early priorities include helping the agriculture sector. He said \\"We don't have minerals here. The backbone of this country is agriculture. ... Under President Yahya's government, all those farming centres collapsed completely, and they no longer exist.\\" Asked about his plans for judicial reform, he said \\"We want a free and independent judiciary whereby nobody can influence the judiciary. We will put laws in place to protect those people running the judiciary. They will have that job security, they will have that independence. We will reduce the powers of the president.\\"  Jammeh rejects results  On 9 December 2016, Jammeh appeared on Gambian state television to announce that he had \\"decided to reject the outcome of the recent election\\" due to \\"serious and unacceptable abnormalities ... during the electoral process\\". He said that a new election should be held under \\"a god-fearing and independent electoral commission\\". The announcement came after Fatoumata Jallow-Tambajang, the chair of the opposition coalition, called for Jammeh's prosecution within a year of the handing over of power in January 2017 and said \\"We are going to have a national commission for asset recovery\\" to obtain the return of money and property from Jammeh and his family. By 10 December, the military of the Gambia was deployed in key locations in Banjul, the capital, and set up sandbagged positions with machine guns, although they were just waving the citizenry through the checkpoints. Troops were also deployed in Serekunda, the Gambia's largest city. The Guardians African correspondent speculated that the prospect of prosecution under a new government might have led security and military leaders to back Jammeh. An attempt by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) chair and President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to negotiate a resolution to the dispute failed when Sirleaf's plane was not allowed to enter the country. Jammeh's party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), said it would follow up Jammeh's statement by petitioning the Supreme Court to invalidate the election results, meeting a 10-day deadline established by law for contesting an election. There is currently a Chief Justice of the Gambia, but there has not been an active Supreme Court in the country for a year and a half (since May 2015), and it was thought that at least four additional judges would have to be appointed in order for the Supreme Court to convene to hear the case. According to human rights groups interviewed by Reuters, Jammeh wields considerable influence over the courts. Of the three Chief Justices between 2013 and 2015, one was jailed, another was dismissed, while the third fled the country after acquitting someone whom Jammeh had wanted to be convicted. Alieu Momarr Njai, the head of the elections commission, said that if it went to court, they would be able to show that the final tally was correct. On 13 December security forces took over the offices of the election commission and prevented the chief of the commission and its staff entering the building. The APRC submitted its appeal seeking the invalidation of the results. Meanwhile, the four regional leaders sent by ECOWAS met with Jammeh but left without an agreement. The military ceased its occupation of the electoral commission's offices in late December and the government said that its staff was free to return to work. It said that the occupation was intended to prevent an attack on the building. It also called for calm and said that daily life should continue as usual. In his 2017 New Year address, Jammeh furiously criticized the position taken by ECOWAS, saying that \\"it is totally illegal as it violates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of member states\\" and \\"is in effect a declaration of war and an insult to our constitution\\". He vowed that he was \\"ready to defend this country against any aggression and there will be no compromise for that\\".  Domestic reactions  Some of the more than 26,000 refugees who have fled across the border into Senegal since Jammeh's refusal to step down, 18 January. On the same day as Jammeh's rejection of the results, Barrow said that Jammeh did not have the constitutional authority to nullify the vote and call for new elections, arguing that only the Independent Electoral Commission could do that. Barrow said he had moved to a safe house for protection. According to supporters protecting Barrow's residence, the police and military of the Gambia had declined to protect the president-elect. The third candidate in the election, Mamma Kandeh, also called on Jammeh to step down, saying \\"Your swift decision earlier to concede defeat and your subsequent move to call Adama Barrow to congratulate him was lauded throughout the world. We therefore prevail on you to reconsider your decision.\\" On 12 December, the Gambia bar association held an emergency meeting. They called Jammeh's rejection of the election results \\"tantamount to treason\\" and passed a unanimous resolution calling for the resignation of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Nigerian judge Emmanuel Oluwasegun Fagbenle, for gross misconduct, saying he had shown a lack of independence and impartiality by campaigning for Jammeh and inappropriately interfering with decisions made by judicial officials. The Gambia teachers' union called Jammeh's action \\"a recipe for chaos and disorder which undoubtedly endangers the lives of all Gambians particularly our children\\". The Gambia Press Union, the University of the Gambia, and the country's medical association and Supreme Islamic Council also supported the view that Jammeh should step aside and allow Barrow to assume the presidency. On 20 December, twelve serving Gambian ambassadors sent a congratulatory letter to Barrow and called on Jammeh to step down. In response, Jammeh's new Information Minister, Seedy Njie said on 10 January 2017 that the twelve ambassadors had been fired. On 13 January, Barrow said that Jammeh should not seek asylum in Nigeria, which had been suggested by some MPs in the Nigerian Parliament. President Buhari of Nigeria continued trying to negotiate a peaceful end to the impasse. Barrow also stated that he would still be inaugurated on 19 January, despite the dispute. Talks aimed at ending the crisis ended without agreement on 14 January, prompting the African Union (AU) to state that it would no longer recognise Jammeh as president of The Gambia after 19 January. Barrow was instead invited to a regional summit in Mali to further discuss the transition of power. Barrow himself went to Senegal in the days before his inauguration, due to concerns for his safety. He also suffered a personal tragedy during this period when his 8-year-old son died after being bitten by dogs. Barrow missed the boy's funeral on 16 January 2017, as he did not feel safe to return to The Gambia to attend.  International reactions  Jammeh's action was condemned by the governments of the US and Senegal. The AU also declared that Jammeh's actions were \\"null and void\\". After Senegal called for an emergency United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting, the UNSC declared in a unanimous statement that Jammeh must peacefully hand over power. It was announced that a delegation of four West African heads of state planned to go to The Gambia on 13 December to try to persuade Jammeh to accept the results of the election and step down. These included the President of Liberia and chair of ECOWAS Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari, the (outgoing) President of Ghana John Mahama, and the President of Sierra Leone Ernest Bai Koroma. The African Union said it also planned to send a negotiating delegation to The Gambia, led by President of Chad and chair of the AU Idriss D√©by. Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, issued a statement saying that the European Union requested Jammeh to respect the outcome of the election and step down, and that \\"Any attempt to reverse carries the risk of serious consequences.\\" Samantha Power, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, said \\"It is a very dangerous moment.\\" On 14 December, United Nations officials said that Jammeh would not be allowed to remain head of state and would face strong sanctions if he continues to try to do so after his current term expires. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the United Nations Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel said \\"For Mr. Jammeh, the end is here and under no circumstances can he continue to be president. By that time (18 Jan.), his mandate is up and he will be required to hand over to Mr. Barrow.\\" Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the refusal to accept the election result was an \\"outrageous act of disrespect of the will of the Gambian people\\". When asked whether the U.N. would consider military action to force Jammeh's departure, Chambas did not rule out the possibility ‚Äì saying only \\"It may not be necessary. Let's cross that bridge when we get there.\\" On 16 December, ECOWAS issued a statement saying that Barrow \\"must be sworn in\\" in order to \\"respect the will of the Gambian people\\", and that \\"The authority [ECOWAS] shall undertake all necessary actions to enforce the result of the election.\\" ECOWAS appointed Muhammadu Buhari as its chief mediator for the dispute, and appointed John Mahama as co- mediator. On 19 December, the AU expressed its full support of the position taken by ECOWAS. Idriss D√©by, chair of the AU, called ECOWAS's position a \\"principled stand with regards to the situation in The Gambia\\". Despite pressure from regional leaders, Jammeh, speaking on television on the evening of 20 December, said that he would not leave office at the end of his term in January unless the Supreme Court of the Gambia upheld the results. He again insisted that a new election was necessary: \\"I will not cheat but I will not be cheated. Justice must be done and the only way justice can be done is to reorganise the election so that every Gambian votes. That's the only way we can resolve the matter peacefully and fairly.\\" Striking a defiant tone, he rejected any foreign interference and declared that he was prepared to fight. On 23 December, ECOWAS announced that they would send in troops if Jammeh failed to step down. The president of the ECOWAS Commission, Marcel Alain de Souza, said \\"The deadline is January 19 when the mandate of Jammeh ends.\\" The military intervention would be led by Senegal. De Souza said \\"If he doesn't go, we have a force that is already on alert, and this force will intervene to restore the will of the people.\\" Speaking on 7 January, Johnson Sirleaf emphasized the importance of peaceful resolution, saying that ECOWAS was \\"committed to a peaceful mediation and a peaceful transfer of power in The Gambia. We will continue to pursue that for now\\".Ismail Akwei, \\"ECOWAS pursues peaceful mediation over military intervention in Gambia\\", Africanews, 8 January 2017.  Supreme Court consideration  Six additional appointments to the Supreme Court (five‚ÄîHabeeb A. O. Abiru, Abubakar Datti Yahaya, Abubakar Tijani, Obande Festus and Akomaye Angim‚Äîfrom Nigeria, and one‚ÄîNicholas Colin Brown‚Äîfrom Sierra Leone) were reported to have been made in secret, starting in October 2016, with the cooperation of Chief Justice Fagbenle. One of the newly appointed justices, Akomaye Angim, is a former Chief Justice of The Gambia. However, it was not clear whether the new justices had all accepted their appointments ‚Äì especially in the case of Abiru, who was reported to be planning to reject his appointment and to meet with other appointees who may do the same. Fagbenle said on 21 December that a Supreme Court hearing to consider the APRC's appeal would be held on 10 January 2017, with the newly appointed judges. On 10 January, the date on which the Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the APRC's appeal of the election results, Chief Justice Emmanuel Fagbenle said the foreign judges that had been appointed to hear the case would only be available in May or November, so the hearing of the case needed to be delayed for several months. Fagbenle said \\"We can only hear this matter when we have a full bench of the Supreme Court\\", and officially adjourned the session until 16 January. Onogeme Uduma, a Nigerian who was intended to act as the president of the court, was reported to be unavailable until May. It was also reported that one of Jammeh's top ministers, Sherriff Bojang, had resigned in protest over Jammeh's refusal to accept defeat, although state television reported that Bojang had been sacked. Fagbenle suggested that mediation would be the best way forward to resolve the impasse. However, Jammeh appeared on state television and declared that he will stay in office \\"to ensure the rule of law is upheld\\" until the Supreme Court makes a decision on his appeal, which is not expected until at least May 2017. He slammed the stances of the United Nations, the African Union, and ECOWAS as \\"foreign interference\\" in The Gambia's affairs. Jammeh filed a new request for an injunction to try to prevent Chief Justice Fagbenle from swearing in Barrow as president. However, Fagbenle said he would not consider the new case, saying \\"Given that the injunction affects me in my capacity as the chief justice, I will recuse myself from hearing it.\\" A lawyer for Jammeh's party conceded that obtaining an injunction to prevent Barrow from being sworn in was not possible at this stage.  Media crackdown and state of emergency  On 1 and 2 January 2017, three private radio stations, Taranga FM, Hilltop Radio, and Afri Radio, were shut down under orders from the National Intelligence Agency. On 3 January, it was reported that Alieu Momar Njai, the head of the electoral commission, had left the country or gone into hiding due to concerns about his safety. In a New Year message, Chief of Defence Staff Ousman Bargie affirmed that Jammeh had \\"the unflinching loyalty and support of The Gambia Armed Forces\\".\\"Army chief renews forces' loyalty, support to President Jammeh\\" , Daily Observer, 4 January 2017. On 17 January, a day before the end of his presidential mandate, Jammeh announced a 90-day state of emergency. In a televised declaration, Jammeh justified the move by citing \\"the unprecedented and extraordinary amount of foreign interference\\" during and preceding the December 2016 vote. Opposition parties accused Jammeh of using the measure to retain the presidency and feared that it could be used to void the election result. The National Assembly approved the state of emergency along with a resolution denouncing foreign interference and an extension of its own term, due to end in April, by three months (to 11 July 2017).\\"Yahya Jammeh declares three-month state of emergency in Gambia\\", Africanews, 17 January 2017. It then approved an extension of Jammeh's term for three months.\\"Gambia's parliament extends defeated president's office by 3 months\\", Reuters, 18 January 2017.  Inauguration of Adama Barrow and ECOWAS intervention  The ECOWAS military intervention in the Gambia ‚Äì code-named \\"Operation Restore Democracy\\" ‚Äì is a military intervention in 2017 by several West African countries to resolve a breakdown of internal order in the government of the Gambia due to a constitutional crisis in a dispute over the country's presidency. Its brief period of conflict was precipitated by the refusal to step down from power of Yahya Jammeh, the long-standing President of the Gambia, after he disputed the victory of Adama Barrow in the 2016 presidential election. As a result of the intervention, Jammeh was forced to step down and go into exile two days after the initial military incursion. Following his departure, 4,000 ECOWAS troops remained in the Gambia to maintain order in preparation for Barrow to return and consolidate his presidency. Five days later, Barrow returned to the Gambia while requesting the ECOWAS troops (now numbering about 2,500) to stay for at least six months to help him firmly establish order. Although there were a few reports of isolated minor clashes during the first few hours of the military incursion, there have been no reports of casualties. Invasion Some of the 45,000 refugees had fled across the border into Senegal after Jammeh's refusal to step down, 18 January. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) decided to intervene militarily in the Gambian constitutional crisis that occurred as a result of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh refusing to step down after losing the December 2016 presidential election, and set 19 January 2017 as the date the troops would move into the Gambia if Jammeh continued to refuse to step down. The operation was codenamed \\"Operation Restore Democracy\\". ECOWAS forces were amassed around the borders of the Gambia, and Marcel Alain de Souza, the president of ECOWAS, said, \\"By land, sea and air, Gambia is surrounded. A total of 7,000 men will participate in the mission to re-establish democracy in Gambia.\\" In contrast, the entire armed forces of the Gambia numbered only about 2,500 troops. On 19 January, Adama Barrow, who had been staying in Senegal due to fear for his safety in the Gambia, was sworn in as President in the Gambian embassy in Dakar, Senegal. Just after Barrow was sworn in, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) unanimously approved UNSC Resolution 2337 on the same day, which expressed support for ECOWAS efforts to negotiate the transition of the presidency, but requested the use of \\"political means first\\" without endorsing military action. Despite the lack of endorsement of military action by the UNSC, Senegalese armed forces entered the Gambia on the same day, along with some forces from Ghana, with air and sea support from the Air Force and Navy of Nigeria. Gambia was placed under a naval blockade. In the early hours of the offensive, clashes took place near the border village of Kanilai, the home town of Yahya Jammeh, between Senegalese and pro-Jammeh MFDC forces, and Senegal reportedly took control of the village. Senegal halted its offensive in order to provide a final chance to mediate the crisis, with the invasion planned to proceed at noon on 20 January if Jammeh still refused to relinquish power. According to a statement given by the United Nations Refugee Agency on 20 January based on estimates provided by the government of Senegal, around 45,000 people had been displaced and had fled to Senegal, and at least 800 more people had fled to Guinea- Bissau. More than 75% of the displaced people arriving in Senegal were children, with the remainder being mostly women. Jammeh, however, refused to step down even after the deadline passed. The deadline was extended to 16:00 GMT which too he missed. Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, President of Guinea Alpha Cond√© and United Nations' regional chief Mohammed Ibn Chambas tried to persuade him to step down. Gambia's army chief General Ousman Badjie meanwhile pledged allegiance to Barrow and stated that the Gambian Army would not fight ECOWAS. Barrow and a Senegalese official later stated that Jammeh had agreed to step down. Diplomats meanwhile stated that Senegalese troops would remain deployed at the border in case he reneged on the deal. A deal was later announced for him to leave the country for exile, and a short time later he announced on state television that he was stepping down. After he went into exile on 21 January (initially going to Guinea and then to Equatorial Guinea), ECOWAS announced that about 4,000 of its troops would remain stationed in the country for ensuring security. On 26 January, Barrow returned to the Gambia, while about 2,500 ECOWAS troops remained in the country to stabilise it. He requested the troops to remain in the country for an additional six months. Participating forces The intervention force was composed of Senegalese, Ghanaian, Malian, Togolese and Nigerian forces. Nigeria provided aircraft and naval assets. The Gambian army chief declared that the army would not involve itself in a political dispute, while the navy chose to declare its support for Barrow. However, some paramilitaries and mercenaries led by Benjamin Yeaten stayed loyal to Jammeh. The Senegalese rebel group Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance reportedly joined pro- Jammeh forces and there were reported clashes on the border with Senegal.  International response  United States Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs John Kirby announced that the United States was supportive of the intervention. United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson called on Jammeh to step down and praised \\"African organisations which are working to ensure the democratic wishes of the Gambian people will be respected\\", adding that the presidential elections had been free and fair. The UN Security Council voted unanimously on 19 January to pass United Nations Security Council Resolution 2337 requesting a peaceful transition of power. The resolution did not endorse the use of military force. It instead requested ECOWAS to pursue \\"political means first\\".

O'Keeffe developed radical charcoal drawings, with just a few lines, that led to greater development of total abstraction. This series of works was completed following three summers of instruction at the University of Virginia on Arthur Wesley Dow's design philosophies, which were highly influential in her development as an abstract artist. Early the following year, photographer and art dealer, Alfred Stieglitz exhibited some of the drawings at his 291 art gallery. Background Georgia O'Keeffe, Second, Out of My Head, charcoal on Fabriano laid paper, 61 x 47 cm (24 x 18 1/2 in.), 1915, National Gallery of Art While teaching at Columbia College in South Carolina, O'Keeffe completed a series of highly innovative charcoal abstractions in 1915, which were unique in their form. Other earlier creators of abstract art used Cubist shapes, but she used the rhythms and shapes that she found in nature to conceptualize her subconscious feelings, which she called the \\"unknown\\", to dictate her compositions. Overview Georgia O'Keeffe, Drawing XIII, 1915, charcoal on paper, 24 3/8 x 18 1/2 in. (61.9 x 47 cm), Metropolitan Museum of Art Drawing XIII is an example of how O'Keeffe began to develop her own sense of design and composition. A rising flame or flowing river are suggested by the curved line on the right side of the drawing. On the left is a jagged line that seems to represent a lightning strike or mountains. In between the two are four rounded images that appear to be trees or a rolling hillside. Exhibit O'Keeffe mailed the drawings to friend and former classmate, Anita Pollitzer, who took them to Alfred Stieglitz at his 291 gallery early in 1916. Stieglitz found them to be the \\"purest, finest, sincerest things that had entered 291 in a long while\\", and in April, Stieglitz exhibited ten of her drawings at 291. O'Keeffe was surprised that Stieglitz had not communicated when her work would be shown. She confronted him, but agreed to let exhibit continue.

Description Binhai Park is around 500 metres by 500 metres with the front entrance on Binhai road. It is situated directly east of the south end of Haikou Century Bridge. There is a small lake in the centre of the park with a community centre and building and courtyard at the east shore. The park contains numerous paths and a small hill. During the final renovation, the park incorporated an area of forest at the southwest corner. This previously unmaintained area was cleaned up and had brick paths and lighting installed. However, since 2018, that corner has fallen into disrepair. In 2018, the Haikou Citizen Tourism Center was built by the northwest shore of the lake. It is the largest building with wooden roof in China. Usage Apart from being a visitor attraction for tourists, the park is used by local residents.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Jerram, to the southeast. History The mountain was named in honor of Sir Charles Rodney Blane (1879‚Äì1916), Royal Navy commander of the battlecruiser HMS Queen Mary. He was killed during the Battle of Jutland when his ship exploded and sank. The mountain's name was made official in 1922 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1955 by P.J.B. Duffy, G. Hohnson, D. Kennedy, and F. Koch. Koch perished during the descent. Geology Mount Blane is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Blane is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather, June through September are the best months to climb Mount Blane.

Born in Inukjuak, Quebec, Qumaluk and her husband, Josie Qumaluk, moved to Puvirnituq in 1954. She began her career as a carver before experimenting with stoneblock printing in 1960. She would go on to author at least ninety-five prints during her career, printing most of them herself as well; most of these were stonecuts. She also printed hundreds of editions for other artists, holding a regular job in a print shop to make the output possible. Early prints were dominated by mythological themes or demons conjured up by her own imagination; these were later replaced with quieter subjects such as animals or depictions of traditional life. By the late 1970s her output had diminished, and in 1985 she retired. Her style is different from that of other Puvirnituq artists in that she did not use the border of the uncut block to frame her images.

Meerane station is the only station in the town of Meerane in the German state of Saxony. The station is now served by Regionalbahn and Regional-Express services on the Mid-Germany Connection (Mitte-Deutschland-Verbindung). Freight transport facilities no longer exist.  History Meerane station has existed since the opening of the line on 15 November 1858. The station building was completely rebuilt in 1940/41. The historicised facade decoration was replaced by smooth plaster surfaces. Deutsche Reichsbahn's electrification program reached Meerane station in May 1984. Only a single track was electrified as an economy. After German reunification in 1990, Meerane station was also stop for express, D and InterRegio trains for a short time. In the 1993/94 timetable, the long-distance train pairs, D 2058/59 (Chemnitz‚ÄìErfurt/Weimar‚ÄìChemnitz) and IR 2550/51 (Chemnitz‚ÄìAachen and return) stopped in Meerane.Saxon regional timetable 1993/94, with effect from 23 May 1993 There was, however, a sharp drop in freight traffic. After 2000, the equipment for handling freight and the tracks that were no longer needed were closed and the tracks were dismantled. After the InterRegio connections were discontinued, only Regionalbahn and Regional-Express services operated by DB Regio stopped at Meerane. It was now connected to the west (Erfurt, Jena, Gera), north (Altenburg, Leipzig) and east (Glauchau, Chemnitz, Dresden). In 2011, Meerane station was fundamentally rebuilt and a modern public transport system was created during the renewal of the Glauchau‚ÄìG√∂√ünitz railway. The line was completely blockaded for nine months. A \\"house\\" platform (next to the station building) and an island platform were built and access to the island platform is protected by a passenger security system. The historic entrance building, which was vacated, was demolished despite intense discussions regarding the preservation of its portico. The entrance building was not a protected monument because of its reconstruction in 1940/41. The through track was built to accommodate 140 km/h and tilting technology during the course of the track upgrade. The control of the signals and points since then have been operated through a local electronic interlocking, which is controlled from the Leipzig operations centre. Scheduled services recommenced on 11 December 2011.  Description The historic entrance building was built in the 19th century in a typical, historicist style. Similar station buildings with identical facade elements were built in Saxony, among others in Freiberg, Hohenstein-Ernstthal and Zittau. After a reconstruction carried out in 1940/41, the character of the building changed completely. It was adapted to the architecture of the time. All the historical facade elements were removed. The entrance area was overlaid with a so-called portico, which was later decorated with a wall painting (two workers, a weaver and a mechanical engineer). This was characteristic of the station in the 1970s and shaped its appearance for travellers. Typical of the Nazi period was a large heraldic eagle on the front sides of the building, which was removed in 1945. Its former location could easily be seen from the colour and form of the much darker plaster until the building was demolished in 2010. The historic entrance building was demolished in 2011 to allow barrier-free access and replaced by a simple functional building with a ticket machine, store for travel necessities, toilets and bicycle parking. Two stops were set up for regional bus services. There are many parking spaces for cars.

Martinson's case received international attention. Martinson was later convicted of second-degree intentional homicide and sentenced to 23 years in prison. Background Martinson maintained a horror blog titled \\"Nightmare,\\" using the screen name \\"Vampchick\\" and often wrote about murder and torture. She remained estranged from her biological father and lived with her mother, stepfather, two stepsisters and a half sister. She had moved to Rhinelander, Wisconsin with her family at age sixteen. Martinson was allegedly verbally abused by Thomas \\"Tony\\" Ayers, in the events leading up to his murder. He had also verbally and physically abused both his wife and his biological daughters in the household. These details were confirmed by her younger siblings. Martinson also claimed she had been physically abused and raped for a period of two years by a former boyfriend of her mother's. During her interviews, experts believed she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Thomas Ayers had previous convictions of kidnapping, sexual assault, domestic abuse and various other charges. Although he was forbidden from owning firearms, he owned a variety, which were kept loaded, and reportedly easily accessible in the home. Crime The night before the murder, Martinson got into an argument with her mother and stepfather after they discovered she was in a relationship with a 22-year-old man, Ryan Sisco. They had sent messages to Sisco and threatened to seek legal consequences against him. Her car and phone privileges were revoked after the argument. The night the disturbance occurred, she wrote on her Facebook page \\"He's gonna kill her if she doesn't leave soon [...] I want to kill him so fucking bad, take one of his guns and blow his fucking brains out.\\" Police acknowledged that the murder may not have been premeditated, as that morning she had witnessed Ayers beating her mother. On March 7, 2015 at their residence in Piehl, Wisconsin, a town near the city of Rhinelander, Martinson shot and killed her stepfather with a shotgun. Her mother Jennifer Ayers came to investigate the gunshots. During this confrontation Martinson killed her mother with a knife. After the killings, Martinson had locked her younger siblings in a closet with a supply of food. One of the children had seen Thomas' body and doubted Martinson's denial that she had killed him. When first interviewed, Martinson claimed it was not her, but her mother, who had killed Thomas Ayers and she was attacked upon finding her mother standing over the corpse of her stepfather and killed her mother in self-defense. Her younger sibling's statements to police disputed these claims. Martinson later said she had taken the gun to commit suicide, but was interrupted by Thomas Ayers. Martinson claimed she had taken one of Ayers' guns to her room after the argument with the intention of killing herself. He began knocking on her door and she feared the consequences of him finding her with it. She then made the decision to kill him, as she felt he \\"deserved to die more,\\" and began firing, striking him in the neck. She then shot him in the head, killing him. Police were called to the scene on March 8 by the oldest stepsister of Martinson and they immediately suspected Martinson was responsible, due to the fact that she had fled the scene. After police announced the details of the crime and their vehicle information, she and Sisco were captured in Boone County, Indiana. It is believed the pair were actually planning to meet relatives of Sisco in Tennessee. Sisco was never considered a suspect in the case, but was charged for a parole violation. Martinson \\"fought\\" extradition from Indiana to Wisconsin, but was eventually brought back to the state. Trial and conviction Martinson was originally charged, as an adult, with two accounts of first-degree intentional homicide and false imprisonment. She later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. She later accepted a plea deal of second-degree murder in March 2016 and was sentenced to twenty-three years in prison along with seventeen years of supervision in June. The prosecutors pursued a forty-year sentence, where her defense argued for eight, citing her mother's negligence of subjecting the family to the abuse of Thomas Ayers. Judge Michael Bloom stated he felt Martinson's history was not enough to justify murder and her life was not in danger at the time. Martinson is detained at Taycheedah Correctional Institution, located in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Since her imprisonment, she states she feels \\"happy\\" and \\"safe.\\" She also received her high school diploma. In June 2017, Martinson argued for a reduced sentence with the aid of her lawyer, who cited the defendant was incapable of making a rational choice due to her living conditions. The motion was denied by judge Michael Bloom in September. She was sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2016. In 2019 an appeals court denied her a new trial.

It was founded in April 2016 as the political wing of the anti-immigration group Gƒßaqda Patrijotti Maltin. The party has been described as far-right for its opposition to immigration and Islam in Malta. The party's founder Henry Battistino remains a major influence on the party's agenda, it is an anti- establishment party that opposes multiculturalism. History The MPM was founded on the 8 April 2016 and immediately announced its application to the Electoral Commission as a new political party under the Financing of Political Parties Act. In the 2017 Maltese general election, the party failed to elect any candidate in parliament. Positions MPM opposes the integration of migrants with culturally different backgrounds into the Maltese society, calling for European Union funds allocated to Malta for the purpose be instead allocated for the benefit of Maltese people and for Malta to no longer be a member of the Schengen Area. Additionally, the party has opposed the presence of Islam in Malta. At an October 2016 protest led by the party against the possible opening of a Muslim prayer room in Buƒ°ibba, leader Henry Battistino called for a national registry of Muslims and compared Muslim immigrants to rabbits breeding excessively. Stephen Florian, an MPM party official, also spoke at the protest and stated that any religion other than Roman Catholicism should only have one place of worship in the country. Florian later caused controversy when he outed a counter-protester from the Buƒ°ibba protest as transgender. MPM is frequently hostile toward media and the Maltese establishment, with Battistino referring to the media as traitors that are trying to \\"force [integration] down everyone's throats\\". The party's sister organisation, Gƒßaqda Patrijotti Maltin, was the subject of a complaint from the Institute of Maltese Journalists for protesters obstructing reporters from doing their job.

It is a ground orchid with a single, hairy leaf and a single, variably-coloured, usually dark red flower on a thin, wiry stem high. Description Caladenia dienema is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows singly or in small, loose groups. It has a single, hairy, narrow lance- shaped leaf, long and wide. The leaf is dull green and has purple blotches near its base. One or two flowers, across, are borne on a thin, wiry, hairy spike high. The flowers are variably coloured, usually dark red but may be almost white, yellow or from pale to deep red, and usually have darker red lines. The dorsal sepal is linear to oblong, long, wide but tapers to a thin, blackish glandular tip. The lateral sepals and petals are a similar size and shape to the dorsal sepal and end with a similar tip, although the petals are slightly narrower. The lateral sepals and petals spread widely and are turned downwards to drooping. The labellum is broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped when flattened and is coiled forward at the tip, long and wide. There are 13 to 18 pairs of narrow, linear teeth up to along the edges of the labellum. There are four to six rows of erect, hockey stick-shaped calli along the centre of the labellum. The column is long, about wide and yellow and has broad wings. Flowering occurs in October and November and is followed by the fruit which is a reddish capsule long. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia dienema was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1998 and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. Jones derived the specific epithet (dienema) from the Latin word dienemus, meaning \\"bleak or windswept\\", referring to the nature of this orchid's habitat. Dienemos is a Greek word meaning \\"windswept\\". Distribution and habitat Elegant caladenia grows in windswept, low heath and in rocky areas in heathy woodland. It occurs in areas near the coast of Tasmania, north of the Pieman River, especially near Temma and Marrawah, although it was previously recorded on the north-west coast near Stanley. Conservation Caladenia dienema is classified as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The main threats to the species are land clearing, agricultural practices, recreational activities and inappropriate fire regimes.

Wright was mayor on June 8, 1966, when an F5 tornado devastated Topeka, killing 16 people, left 4,500 residents homeless, and caused an estimated $100 million in property damage. He led the cleanup and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the tornado to rebuild the city and Washburn University. Wright's son, Doug Wright, also served as Mayor of Topeka from 1983 to 1989. Biography Early life Chuck Wright was born on August 17, 1919, at Christ's Hospital (present-day Stormont Vail Health) as one of three children of Charles W. and Mary Kanode Wright. His mother was a public health nurse, while his father had been employed in the passenger department of the Santa Fe Railway. Wright graduated from Topeka High School in 1937 and received his bachelor's degree in 1941 from the University of Kansas. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1941 following the country's entry into World War II and trained at the Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. He served as a naval hospital corpsman in the Pacific theater. He retired with the rank of Captain after the war and married his wife, the former Alice Clare Brownfield, at a ceremony on September 2, 1944, in Washington, D.C. The couple had three children, Charles, Douglas and Catherine. Career Following the end of the war, Wright returned to Kansas where he initially took a job with the Kansas Industrial Development Commission. He was then hired for an advertising and public relations position at Standard Oil of Indiana. Wright then worked as an assistant advertising manager for a Chicago-based company from 1951 until 1954. He moved back to Kansas to partner with his cousin, Duane Patterson, to form the Patterson-Wright Advertising Agency; their partnership ended in 1960. Political career In 1961, Wright defeated incumbent Topeka city street commissioner Bill Mallory, who was seeking re- election. According to Wright, he thought Mallory, who was 72-years old at the time, was a \\"a fine old gentleman\\", but didn't think he or the streets department were accomplishing anything. Wright served as the city's street commissioner from 1961 until 1965. Upon taking office, Wright soon realized the Topeka city government had no written minimum street standards. He hired his predecessor, Bill Mallory, to supervise street upgrades in the city's Highland Park neighborhood and convened a panel of private sector engineers new minimum street standards in writing. Wright also realized that the city's street crews were testing the strength of street subsurface by applying pressure with the heel of their boots. To correct this, and scientifically justify the cost of any street resurfacing projects to officials, Wright ordered new $300 densometers to measure the strength of the surface instead. Mayor of Topeka Chuck Wright was elected Mayor of Topeka in 1965. He faced the first major disaster of his tenure when the Melan Arch Bridge collapsed in July 1965, just three months after he took office. The bridge collapse had been unexpected, as the new North Kansas Avenue Bridge had been under construction nearby at the time. An investigation later concluded that the construction of the new structure had contributed to the collapse, which Wright explained in 2000 saying that the new construction had \\"caused the riverbed to shift away support from the old bridge...It was a disaster. No one expected the riverbed to shift. It was just one of those things that did happen.\\" On June 8, 1966, a much larger natural disaster struck Topeka when an F5 tornado cut a swath across the city and destroyed much of Washburn University. The tornado first touched down near the intersection of S.W. 29th and Gage Street and moved northeast across the city for 27 miles. 16 people were killed by the June 1966 tornado, which also left approximately 4,500 residents homeless and caused an estimated $100 million in damage. Wright proposed a new crosstown thruway to be built essentially along the southwest- to-northeast path of the tornado. The new road was never constructed, but the proposal did lead to several thoroughfares which were built decades later. He also created the first Topeka chapter of the Better Business Bureau in the aftermath of the 1966 tornado in response to a number of scams which preyed on the victims of the disaster. Wright won re-election to a second term in 1967, but declined to seek re-election 1969. Wright would later state that one of his greatest accomplishments as mayor was the passing of the city's first fair housing ordinance. Post-political career Soon after leaving political office, Wright and his wife moved to a home on 70 acres of land near Lecompton, Kansas, which had belonged to the Wright family since 1856. Wright started his own advertising and public relations agency. He also began selling cancer insurance, a moved that proved so successful that his insurance company promoted him to manager for the entire state of Missouri. He retired from the insurance industry in 1987. Wright and his wife, Alice Claire, also established a Christmas tree farm, called Edgewood Tree Farm, on their land in Lecompton. The pick-your-own Christmas tree business lasted from the late 1960s until the 1990s, when many of their trees were killed by pine wilt disease, also known as bursaphelenchus xylophilus. In the 1970s, the Wrights purchased Christmas Trees Magazine, a trade magazine with subscribers throughout the U.S. and Canada, which they continued to publish after the closure of their tree farm in the 1990s. In 2002, the National Christmas Tree Association awarded Wright its inaugural Outstanding Service to the Christmas Tree Industry Award. In June 2016, Wright was honored on the 50th anniversary of the 1966 Topeka tornado. His efforts to rebuild the city were recognized in Twist of Fate, a commemorative piece produced by The Topeka Capital-Journal. Chuck Wright died on December 27, 2016, at the age of 97 following a short illness. His wife, Alice Clare, whom he married in 1944, died in 2008.

By 1935, the federation had affiliates in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and Yugoslavia. The federation held regular sectional conferences for the chemical industry. Following the collapse of the International Federation of Glass Workers, it added a glass industry section, with its first conference in 1938. Similarly, the International Federation of Pottery Workers dissolved before World War II, and in 1947, the federation held the first conference of its new pottery industry section. In 1954, it held a conference for the rubber industry.

Formed in Fiji in late 1940, it saw service in the Pacific against the Japanese. The 34th Battalion was initially used for garrison duties on Fiji and New Caledonia before being committed to the fighting in the Solomon Islands, briefly seeing combat against the Japanese in the Treasury Islands in late 1943. Returned to New Zealand in mid-1944 and was disbanded later that year as part of a partial demobilisation of New Zealand forces. Many of its personnel returned to civilian employment while others were sent to Italy as reinforcements for the New Zealand 2nd Division. The battalion was awarded three battle honours for its service during the war. History Formation Anticipating the entry of the Japanese Empire into the Second World War, in September 1940 the New Zealand Military Forces raised the 8th Infantry Brigade Group for garrison duty in Fiji. Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, it had been considered by the British Overseas Defence Committee that New Zealand would assume responsibility for the defence of Fiji, which was incapable of defending itself, in the event of war. The brigade group, made up of the 29th and 30th Battalions, arrived in Fiji in early November 1940. Shortly after the brigade group landed in Fiji, a further contingent of reinforcements arrived on 22 November 1940. It was intended that these would be distributed amongst the existing battalions. However, on arrival at Suva, Brigadier William Cunningham, the brigade commander, directed that a new battalion be formed from the reinforcements. This was to be the basis of the 34th Battalion. Originally designated simply as Training Battalion, it was under the command of Major Francis Voelcker. The battalion was based at Samambula Camp where it would undergo training for the next several months. In May 1941, the bulk of the battalion's personnel returned to New Zealand and onwards to the Middle East to join the 2nd New Zealand Division. Fourteen soldiers volunteered for duty as coast watchers in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and consequently left the battalion. Some others, including Voelcker who had been promoted to lieutenant colonel, remained in Fiji to form the cadre around which the battalion was to be reformed with newly arrived personnel. The battalion, now known as Reserve Battalion, resumed training and garrison duty. Many personnel had only received minimal military training in New Zealand before being shipped to Fiji and much time had to be spent on the basics of warfare and tactics. Towards the end of 1941 the likelihood of hostilities commencing in the Pacific increased, so the battalion began work on defence emplacements in their sector along the coast. Coincidentally manning their defence emplacements on a training exercise when news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour reached Fiji, extra supplies of ammunition were immediately handed out and the battalion remained on action stations for three days before being stood down. Training was stepped up in preparation for action against the Japanese and in late December 1941, the battalion was formally designated 34th Battalion. By now it was up to full strength having received a draft of reinforcements from New Zealand. To supplement the defences of Fiji, the brigade group was reinforced from New Zealand with the 14th Brigade. The 34th Battalion continued performing garrison duties and carrying out training exercises until, with the United States now taking responsibility for the defence of Fiji, it was relieved by American forces in July 1942. At this time, the 34th Battalion returned to New Zealand on board the SS President Coolidge. It arrived in Auckland on 6 July and its personnel went on leave before reassembling at Manurewa in early August. By this stage of the war, the New Zealand Government had authorised the raising of the 3rd Division for service in the Pacific against the Japanese. To be formed in New Zealand, the division was based around the recently returned 8th and 14th Brigades, and the battalions making up these formations, and commanded by Major General Harold Barrowclough. Barrowclough set about organising the new division and implemented training programs to prepare his new command for fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. However, at the request of Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area of Operations, the 34th Battalion was selected in October 1942 to garrison Tonga. The move was to replace American forces that had moved to Guadalcanal. The battalion was withdrawn from divisional exercises in the Waikato region of the North Island and shipped to Tonga's main island of Tongatapu aboard the SS President Jackson. Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Eyre, the battalion remained here under American control for a period of five months. Solomon Islands In the meantime, the rest of the 3rd Division had been progressively sent to New Caledonia where it underwent further combat training. The 34th Battalion, its duties on Tongatapu at an end, joined the division in March 1943. In July 1943, Barrowclough informed the New Zealand Government that it was ready for combat duties, so in early September 1943, it moved to Guadalcanal for a combat role as part of the Solomon Islands campaign. However along the way, the troops stopped briefly at Port Vila in the New Hebrides to carry practice amphibious operations with landing craft before continuing onto Guadalcanal. Arriving off their destination on 14 September, the battalion was landed the same day. Jungle training remained the focus of the battalion although they also took the opportunity to work with Valentine tanks. During the Battle of the Treasury Islands, the 34th Battalion was tasked with securing on Stirling Island, seen here in the distance, while the 29th and 36th Battalions landed on Mono Island, the southern coast of which is in the immediate foreground The following month, the 8th Brigade participated in the Battle of the Treasury Islands. This involved landings to secure the Treasury Islands from the Japanese in order to conduct future operations on Bougainville. It was to be the first opposed amphibious landing carried out by New Zealand troops since the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. The 34th Battalion was tasked with securing Stirling Island, which military intelligence believed to be unoccupied, while at around the same time the 29th and 36th Battalions would land on Mono Island to deal with the Japanese garrison. To assist the efforts on Mono Island, one company of 34th Battalion was detached to form part of Logan Force, commanded by Major Logan, formerly of 34th Battalion. This was a small battle group, which also included a section of machine gun troops, to provide security for American construction and technical personnel that would be landed at Soanotalu, on the north coast of Mono Island, to establish a radar station. Prior to the landing, the battalion's training intensity was stepped up, including more practice landings, and on 27 October, at 6:25 am, the 34th Battalion landed on Stirling Island at two beaches, designated Purple 2 and Purple 3. As expected, the landing was unopposed. The initial landing involved two companies, one at each beach. These secured the perimeter of landing zones before a third company landed and moved into the interior of the island to confirm the absence of Japanese. With the island secure, a platoon moved over to nearby Mono Island to assist 36th Battalion in manning the perimeter it had established on that island. In the meantime, while the Japanese were not physically on the island, they still carried out bombing raids at the landing zones. On 29 October, the battalion detached another company to assist 29th Battalion and two days later a further company was sent to Mono Island to replace one of the hard pressed 36th Battalion's which in turn took over that company's positions on Stirling Island for a rest. On Mono Island, the main landing along the south coast had been achieved with relative ease, with few casualties although they had to fend off some attacks that night. However, Logan Force which had landed as planned at Soanotalu, on the opposite side of the island to 29th and 36th Battalions, experienced some difficulty. Initially unopposed, a defensive perimeter had been established and the American technicians got to work. Over the next three days, some contact had been made with Japanese soldiers, which had evaded the New Zealanders to the south, looking to escape the island by seizing a barge. During the evening of 1 November, a party of 80 Japanese, began attacking Logan Force. A small group of six soldiers from 34th Battalion plus three Americans held a blockhouse throughout the night and by dawn, over 50 Japanese had been killed for the loss of five men. By early November, Japanese resistance had largely been overcome although patrols still made contact with small parties of Japanese and on 12 November, Mono Island was considered to be secure. By this stage, the battalion had reassembled on Mono Island. There were still isolated Japanese that needed to be captured or killed and patrols were ongoing well into January 1944. By this stage, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. Reidy, taking over from Eyre who was now too old for active service and had returned to New Zealand. A mortar squad trains with a 3-inch mortar on Mono Island Disbandment In early January 1944, in order to rectify a shortage of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, in consultation with the United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact. Accordingly, the 3rd Division received orders to begin repatriating personnel back to New Zealand in April 1944 and shortly afterwards a first group of 1,800 soldiers from the division left the Pacific Theatre of Operations. Returning to Noumea in May, the battalion spent time here. There was little training and drafts of personnel began shipping back to New Zealand the following month. At the time, it was understood that this was simply a furlough and most were expected to return to military service, if not 34th Battalion, in due course. However, by the time those soldiers returning from furlough had assembled at Papakura Military Camp, it had been officially announced that the 3rd Division was to be disbanded and the 34th Battalion ceased to exist on 20 October 1944. Of the 1,949 men who are listed on the battalion's nominal roll the 34th Battalion lost four men killed in action, one died of wounds received in action, while two others died on active service. Honours Two gallantry medals were awarded to personnel of the battalion; one officer received the American Legion of Merit while another soldier received the Military Medal, both for the operation with Logan Force on Mono Island during the Battle of the Treasury Islands. Four more personnel were mentioned in despatches. For its service in the war, the 34th Battalion received three battle honours: \\"Solomons\\", \\"Treasury Islands\\", and \\"South Pacific 1942‚Äì44\\". These honours were not perpetuated.

He has conducted pioneering research into the implementation of the Commissar Order by combat formations of the Wehrmacht and the attitudes of German soldiers based on the surreptitiously recorded conversations of prisoners of war held in Fort Hunt, Virginia, United States. Education and career  R√∂mer was born in 1978 in Hamburg, West Germany.Profile, the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz web site He studied history and literature at the University of Kiel and the University of Lyon. From 2004 to 2007, he worked on his doctoral thesis with funding from the . His research project focused on the Commissar Order and its implementation by formations of the Wehrmacht down to the divisional level during Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. He earned his PhD from the University of Kiel in 2007. From 2007 to 2012, R√∂mer worked as a research associate in the project headed by S√∂nke Neitzel of the History Department at the University of Mainz focused on war perception and collective biography. This project led to the publication of Soldaten: On Fighting, Killing and Dying: The Secret WWII Transcripts of German POWs by Neitzel and Harald Welzer in 2011. For this project R√∂mer compiled 100,000 pages of comprehensive documentary material from the interrogation camp at Fort Hunt, Virginia, where about 3,000 German POWs were both interviewed formally and surreptitiously recorded while held there from 1942 to 1945. Based on this research, R√∂mer published Kameraden ‚Äì Die Wehrmacht von innen. (Comrades: The Wehrmacht from Within) in 2012. From 2012 to 2019 R√∂mer was a researcher at the German Historical Institute London. Since 2019 he is working at the Humboldt University in Berlin. Research on the Commissar Order R√∂mer's book on the Commissar Order, published in 2008 in German as Der Kommissarbefehl. Wehrmacht und NS-Verbrechen an der Ostfront 1941/42 (The Commissar Order: The Wehrmacht and the Nazi Crimes on the Eastern Front, 1941‚Äì1942), was the first complete account of the implementation of the order by the combat formations of the Wehrmacht. R√∂mer's research shows that 116 out of 137 German divisions on the Eastern Front filed reports detailing the killing of the Red Army's political commissars. As a result of the order, by May 1942, a total of at least 3,430 and possibly as many as 4,000 Commissars were murdered by regular Wehrmacht soldiers after surrendering. R√∂mer finds that the records \\"prove that Hitler's generals had executed his murderous orders without scruples or hesitations\\", contrary to the myth of a \\"clean\\" Wehrmacht. Historian Wolfram Wette, reviewing the book, notes that the sporadic objections to the order were merely pragmatic and that its cancellation in 1942 was \\"not a return to morality, but an opportunistic course correction\\". Wette concludes: > The Commissar Order, which has always had a particularly strong influence on > the image of the Wehrmacht because of its obviously criminal character, has > finally been clarified. Once again the observation has confirmed itself: the > deeper the research penetrates into the military history, the gloomier the > picture becomes. Kameraden R√∂mer's 2012 book Kameraden was based on the surreptitiously recorded conversations of German prisoners of war held in Fort Hunt, United States. Like Soldaten by Neitzel and Welzer, R√∂mer's book finds that soldiers were not simply \\"ideological warriors\\" in the National Socialist mold. \\"But this does not mean that the soldiers had no opinions\\", R√∂mer states. The majority continued to support Hitler and the German war effort until the last year of the war. The book also finds that racism and anti-Semitism were widespread. The younger soldiers, those of the Hitler Youth generation who grew up during the Nazi regime, believed in a victory for longer than older soldiers who had grown up in the German Empire or the Weimar Republic. National Socialist socialization thus becomes apparent, according to R√∂mer's research. A small group of POWs, who R√∂mer identified as having a \\"fanatical worldview\\", even boasted of war crimes. The murder of the Jews was an \\"open secret\\" among the soldiers. While there were some supporters of the killing of Jews, the majority rejected this approach. For most of the soldiers there were apparently limits. The book finds these included violence against women and children or against defenseless Soviet POWs. But in the reality of the war, R√∂mer concludes, the group dynamics were often stronger than moral scruples. Selected works In English R√∂mer, Felix (2019). Comrades. The Wehrmacht from within.
