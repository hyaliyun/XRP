Started in 1957 by Chaim Schreiber to make furniture, Schreiber became an extremely successful brand in furniture from the 1960s to the early 1970s, challenging both Harris Lebus and Gomme for domination. In the 1970s it became vertically integrated by opening its own furniture centres. The company merged with GEC in the 1970s. Schreiber was later bought out by the MFI Group, and on MFI's bankruptcy in 2008, the brand rights were bought by the Home Retail Group in 2009. In 2016, the Home Retail Group was purchased by the UK retailer Sainsbury's, including the rights to the Schreiber brand. History Early years In 1957, Chaim Schreiber, a Polish refugee immigrant who made radio cabinets for Dansette and other larger electrical manufacturers, bought the bankrupt furniture business Lubetkin and re-branded it under his own name, Schreiber. Expansion Schreiber was hugely successful in the 1960s and 1970s, challenging Lebus and Gomme for domination. It was a major manufacturer of bedroom furniture in the 1960s at the value end of the market. It bought the more upmarket competitor Greaves and Thomas in 1967. Vertical integration In 1970, Schreiber's turnover overtook that of arch-rival Gomme, helped by the failure of its even bigger competitor Harris Lebus the previous year. Schreiber introduced both new upholstered furniture and bedroom furniture in 1973. It also started selling fitted kitchens, ensuring that it offered something for the whole house. Schreiber also opened Schreiber Furniture Centres, which were 3,500 sq ft in size stocking 4,000 products. It invited retail traders to bid for their shops to become its new centres, and 280 opened out of 800 applications.

Bailey (May 7, 1876 ‚Äì October 22, 1940) was a Vermont politician and educator. He served as Secretary of State of Vermont and president of the University of Vermont. Biography Guy Winfred Bailey was born in Hardwick, Vermont, on May 7, 1876. He was raised and educated in Essex Junction, where his father owned and operated the Bailey Granite Monument Company. Bailey graduated from Burlington High School in 1896, and the University of Vermont in 1900. While at UVM, Bailey joined the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He studied law at the Burlington office of Rufus E. Brown & Russell W. Taft, and was admitted to the bar in 1904. A Republican, he served as village president of Essex Junction from 1901 to 1904, and a member of the Vermont House of Representatives in 1904 and 1906. In 1908, Bailey was elected secretary of state. He was reelected four times, and served from October 1908 until resigning in August 1917. From 1912 to 1914, he served again as Essex Junction's village president. Bailey had been a trustee of the University of Vermont since 1914, and left the secretary of state's position to become UVM's comptroller. In August 1919, Bailey was appointed acting president of the university. In June 1920 he became president, and he held this position until his death. The study of eugenics flourished in Vermont during the first half of the twentieth century, and the Eugenics Survey of Vermont became the first privately funded research project at UVM. Bailey served on the Survey's Advisory Committee, and aided the effort by negotiating for and administering the sponsors' funding. During Bailey's presidency, the university undertook a large expansion and modernization program, including construction of several new buildings. He also worked to reduce expenses during the Great Depression, in addition to seeking scholarships and loans for students who needed them in order to remain in school during the economic downturn. After Bailey's death, university administrators discovered that the school had been operating with an annual budget deficit of more than $500,000, and he had used endowment funds to cover current expenses; as a result, his management of UVM's finances became the subject of negative press attention. Death and burial Bailey died in Boston, Massachusetts on October 22, 1940. He was buried at Essex Junction Village Cemetery. Family On December 22, 1904, Bailey married Mabel G. Brigham of Essex Junction. They were the parents of a son, Winthrop, who was born and died in 1905. Legacy Bailey received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Vermont, Middlebury College, and Norwich University. In the years after the Great Depression, UVM alumni sought to rehabilitate Bailey's reputation, which included the publication of a tribute book, Thank You, Guy Bailey. When the university trustees voted to construct a new library in 1961, they named it in Bailey's honor. This facility was expanded in 1980 and was known as the Bailey/Howe Library; David Howe was a 1914 graduate of UVM, and the longtime publisher of The Burlington Free Press. Historical view In February 2018 students and staff members protesting racism at the University of Vermont demanded that President Thomas Sullivan change the name of the Bailey/Howe Library because of Bailey's connection to eugenics. The University formed a study committee, which recommended dropping Bailey's name. The university's leadership agreed, and in October 2018, it was renamed the David W. Howe Memorial Library.

It established the Royal Jubilee Hospital as the leading surgical hospital in the province. The construction of the building to house the operating room was financed by a bequest left by Joseph Pemberton, and supplemented with additional funding by his widow Teresa Pemberton, who also partially funded the purchase of equipment. The funds were originally intended for the construction of a maternity ward, but were insufficient for such a project. Interior components were selected and designed to be easily cleaned and disinfected after each surgical procedure, including the mosaic tile floor, and it was connected to a sterilizing room. The design implemented anti-sepsis techniques developed by Joseph Lister, who visited the room in 1897 and was favourably impressed. It was used daily from its completion in 1896 until 1925, when the hospital expanded and built six new operating rooms. The Pemberton Memorial Operating Room was declared a municipal heritage site in 1995 and recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on 28 November 2005. Background John Chapman Davie Jr. began lobbying for a hospital in Victoria in the mid 1880s, planning for a single-level pavilion design of interconnected buildings. The Royal Jubilee Hospital was opened in May 1890, with three wards, an administrative block, residences, and a laboratory. The hospital's debt grew during the early 1890s, but as a result of addressing an 1893 smallpox epidemic, the city passed a bylaw allowing it to pay off the mortgage \\"as a show of appreciation\\". Joseph Pemberton, whose bequest allowed the construction of the operating room On 9 January 1894, F.B. Pemberton spoke to the hospital's board of directors, stating that a $2,000 bequest had been left to the hospital by his father Joseph Pemberton, who had died in 1893 as a result of a heart attack while horseback riding. Various proposals were made for its use, but the bequest stipulated that it was to be used for development of new property. The board elected to build a maternity ward, for which Joseph Pemberton's widow, Teresa Jane Pemberton donated an additional $1,500. However, the $3,500 was insufficient for such a project. The hospital's board of directors debated potential uses of the funds, and on 7 October 1895 settled on building an operating room favoured by Davie. It would implement the anti-sepsis techniques developed by Joseph Lister, which Davie had studied during a sabbatical in Europe in the 1880s. The winning design, \\"Plan 3\\" by John Teague, was selected on 20 March 1896, and the winning tender for its construction was submitted by Thomas Catterall for $3,614. Teresa Pemberton donated the additional $114. The cornerstone was installed on 15 May 1896 by Teresa Pemberton, in a ceremony during which she was presented with a silver trowel to \\"show appreciation for her generous support and flexibility towards the project\\". The trowel's handle was carved from an oak timber taken from the Beaver, the first steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America. The silver blade was made from silver mined at Bluebell mine, the base from matte obtained from Silver King mine, and the gold ferrule from matte obtained from Le Roi gold mine. Neither the cornerstone, nor the time capsule buried beneath it, has been discovered since then. Pemberton became the building's namesake for his posthumous bequest. By July 1896, nearing completion of construction, the board of directors was informed that $500 would be required to equip the operating room; this was provided by the Women‚Äôs Auxiliary and another donation by Teresa Pemberton. Upon completion, it \\"established the Jubilee as the leading surgical hospital\\" in British Columbia. Description The operating room, circa 1900. Above the door can be seen a marble slab with the words \\"Pemberton Memorial\\" carved into it, which was required per the agreement for funding. The foundation for the building was made of stone. The octagonal operating room is connected to a sterilizing room at its north end. Painted plaster covered the interior brick walls, and the concrete floor was overlain with a ceramic tile mosaic. Its features, including its large windows, were designed to be easily cleaned and disinfected after each surgical procedure. The original design included kerosene lamps, which were replaced in 1897 by electrical fixtures when the entire hospital was connected to the electricity grid. The building was connected to the hospital via a corridor. It had sufficient capacity only for the patient and surgical team. On 13 September 1897, Lister visited the facility and was \\"favourably impressed\\". He recommended the addition of a post-anesthesia recovery room, and the hospital built two the following year for $1,000, the first post-operative recovery rooms in Canada. A second sterilizing room was built as an addition to the building in 1918. The operating room was used daily until 1925, when six new operating rooms were built in the hospital's east wing expansion. It would be used as the home for the hospital's radiography department, then its cancer agency, and finally its medical records department. Heritage site In 1981, the Victoria Medical Society lobbied Victoria City Council to protect the Pemberton Memorial Operating Room under bylaw 173. The hospital's board of directors opposed heritage status for the building, as it would interfere with the hospital's development plans. In 1983, the Government of British Columbia cut its spending, including expenditures for health care capital projects, delaying the building's demolition. An excavation of the building's contents in 1991 found numerous artefacts employed \\"in the early days\\" of the building; these were preserved. In 1995, Victoria City Council designated the building, including the operating room and the sterilizing ante-chamber, a municipal heritage site. It was recognized as a National Historic Site on 28 November 2005, and was officially announced on 3 August 2006 along with the site of the Cypress Hills Massacre and the archaeological site Pointe-du-Buisson. It was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 10 July 2009. A commemorative plaque was installed, and unveiled by Gary Lunn and Ida Chong during a ceremony on 25 June 2010. Legacy In 1909, Teresa Pemberton also provided funding to build the Pemberton Chapel to commemorate her husband. The silver trowel presented to her is now held in the collections of the Royal British Columbia Museum. The building and operating room represented a \\"transitional moment in the history of hospital design\\", in which earlier designs separated the operating room from the hospital, and later designs restricting access to only the patient and surgical team. It also represented a transition in hospital governance, from one of primarily charitable scope \\"for the poor and destitute\\" to being managed as a scientific institution. In 2004, the Victoria Medical Society formed the Victoria Medical Heritage Society as a charity to fund restoration of the Pemberton Memorial Operating Room. It also plans to build a medical history museum adjacent to the building. The chapel and operating room have been connected by a walkway with a garden and courtyard.

The programme follows the story of self-made millionaire Mark Terry (Martin Kemp), whose life is turned upside down by the unexpected return of an old school friend, Stuart Milburn (Hugo Speer), who is determined to seek revenge for Terry's failure to acknowledge his part in the manslaughter of their schoolteacher, who collapsed and died after a schoolboy prank went horribly wrong. As Milburn sets up a chain of events to ensure Terry's downfall, he finds he is slowly running out of friends - or people to turn to, and his only hope is to go on the run. The programme was broadcast over two nights, with each part earning 5.81 and 4.56 million viewers respectively. Love Lies Bleeding was released on DVD in Australia on 3 September 2009 by Roadshow Entertainment. Plot One night, self made millionaire Mark Terry (Martin Kemp) is in the middle of a blazing row with his wife Zara (Claire Goose) when an old school friend, Stuart Milburn (Hugo Speer) turns up at his door. Stuart, now a Detective Inspector, informs Mark that he is back in town after transferring from Leeds following the death of his police partner at the hands of Thomas Jordic (Wayne Michaels), a high collar criminal whom he has never been able to nail. Having recently suffered the loss of his baby son to cot death, Zara is struggling to interact with Mark, leading to him spending more and more time with Stuart. One Friday night, Stuart takes Mark out to a local club and shows him surveillance pictures of a man supposedly kissing Zara. Mark is furious, and proclaims he is going to kill her. Stuart calms him down, and pairs him up with a date, whose flat he ends up returning to. The next morning, Mark awakens and begins to stumble home. Stuart approaches him, and says that he has a surprise. He drives Mark out to a deserted field close to a nearby motorway, where Mark notices that Zara's car is parked. As Mark walks up to the car, he is shocked to find Zara dead, having slit her wrists. Stuart, however, claims that he killed her at Mark's request. Stuart claims that during their time at the club, Mark became so inebriated that he offered him ¬£100,000 to kill Zara, in front of a number of witnesses. Distressed at his wife's death, Mark realises he has no choice but to play the situation, and Stuart convinces him to head to the police station earlier the next day to report Zara missing. Mark meets with one of Stuart's colleagues, DI Colin Dunne (Reece Dinsdale), who lists Zara as a missing person. Later that day, Stuart confronts Mark and says that it is time to repay the favour. Stuart asks Mark to confront and murder Jordic outside one of his strip clubs in the West End of London. Stuart drives Mark to Jordic's club, and provides him with a gun to shoot Jordic. However, during the attack, Mark bottles it and leaves Jordic beaten, but alive. Stuart disposes of the gun and tells Mark to inform the police that he and Jordic instigated the attack, in order to prevent Jordic from pressing charges against him. However, when he arrives at the police station, DI Dunne informs him that Jordic has in fact been murdered.

Although it initially flourished the society soon showed weaknesses in its organisation and ways of working. After a period of considerable financial difficulty it closed in 1845. Rise and fall The London Electrical SocietyInitially called ‚ÄúThe Electrical Society of London‚Äù was founded at a meeting held on 16 May 1837 at Edward M Clarke's ‚ÄúLaboratory of Science‚Äù in Lowther Arcade, near the Strand. The idea for the Society had arisen from discussions during a course of lectures on electricity delivered by William Sturgeon at the same venue. He was assisted in establishing the Society by operative chemist William Leithead; John Peter Gassiot, an amateur scientist with a particular interest in electricity; and Charles Vincent Walker, an electrical engineer. The London Electrical Society's aim was to provide a forum for amateur scientists and to foster their interest in the practical applications of electricity. It served to strengthen the informal links which many of the experimenters had already made. In ‚ÄúThe Uses of Experiment: Studies in the Natural Sciences‚Äù Secord notes that: > The bulk of its membership were 'amateur experimentalists', as founder and > first president Sturgeon admitted. Typical of the group were the instrument- > maker Edward M. Clarke, the young Manchester electrician James Prescott > Joule, and William Leithead, employed by the Gallery as a demonstrator. > Others, like Walter Hawkins, William G Lettsom, John Peter Gassiot and > [Andrew] Crosse were either successful men business or independently > wealthy. Conspicuously absent were the real controlling interests in the > London scientific world, men like John Herschel, William Grove and Faraday. Membership was made up of resident (living within 20 miles of London) and non- resident participants, with annual fees set at two guineas and one guinea respectively. Non-resident members were elsewhere in Great Britain (e.g. Bath and Shrewsbury), or abroad (e.g. Amsterdam and Marseille). At first, members styled themselves Mem. Elec. Soc., but later they used the post-nominal MES. In the early days the Society met in Clarke's Laboratory of Science, but at the first annual general meeting, on 7 October 1837 (with John P Gassiot, Treasurer, in the chair), it was announced that future meetings would be held at the nearby Adelaide Gallery on the Strand, to accommodate the growing membership. The gallery's proprietors generously made their electrical apparatus freely available for the use of the Society's members. The meetings, initially held on the first and third Saturdays of the month at 7:00pm, involved the reading and discussion of experimental papers by members and their guests. Roughly half of the first 120 papers had an emphasis on technology, typically describing an improvement in a technique, or of a piece of apparatus. An example is Charles V Walker's ‚ÄúAn Account of Experiments with a ‚ÄòConstant Voltaic Battery‚Äô‚Äù read in October 1838, in which he described the results of assembling and testing a 160-cell battery of zinc and copper electrodes immersed in saturated copper sulphate solution. Other papers were of a more theoretical nature, such as Thomas Pollock‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn the Connection between the Atomic Arrangement and the Conducting power of Bodies.‚Äù The London Electrical Society had decided early on that it would not prepare standing Rules and Regulations or formally elect Officers until the membership had reached 50. At the October AGM that threshold was raised to 100 resident members, a number which it never reached. Nonetheless, the Society flourished in the early days: membership grew and papers were published. Then signs began to appear that all was not well. There was a gap of about a year in which meetings did not take place. Membership fell, and the Society's debts began to grow. This was made worse by the decision to publish many extra copies of the Proceedings and distribute them widely to other organisations in the hope of attracting new members. These factors, and internal rows over ownership of experimental findings, and the departure of Sturgeon for Manchester, all contributed to the Society's downfall. The story is more fully explained by Morus in ‚ÄúCurrents from the Underworld\\".

Elm recounted how the religious hierarchy restrained such practises, condemning some of them as heresy. Doug Lee, writing in The Classical Review, praised the work as a \\"stimulating exposition which negotiates the complexities of the source material and subject matter with skill and assurance. ...one of the many strengths of the study is E's exploitation of little-known sources such as an anonymous treatise On Virginity (pp. 34‚Äì9 331‚Äì6) and Athanasius' Letter to the Virgins Who Went to Jerusalem (pp. 331‚Äì6).\\" Her book, Sons of Hellenism, Fathers of the Church was described by the Bryn Mawr Classical Review as 'a welcome and erudite study of Gregory of Nazianzus's intellectual engagement with the emperor Julian.' In 2013, the APA awarded her the Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit for the book. In a 2016 interview for Studies in Late Antiquity, a journal which she edits, she described her writing and research as 'an integrated approach that combines written sources from authors that are Christian and non-Christian with documentary and material sources.'

Can't Swim is a 1999 crime drama film directed by, written by, and starring, John-Luke Montias. It is the story of a small time drug-dealer in New York City. Plot Bobby G. (Bobby Grace) is a small-time cocaine dealer struggling to make a living. He lives in Hells Kitchen with his Puerto Rican girlfriend, Lucy, who works as a prostitute. Bobby has good friends, but he is repeatedly pestered by a pair of undercover cops. His girlfriend Lucy wants to go back to Puerto Rico to visit her mother, but Bobby says he won't come with her. Bobby is approached by a car with four young suburban men who are interested in buying a kilo of cocaine, and they ask him what the price would be. Bobby G sees this as his one chance to make a substantial sum of money, so he tries to set up a sale which would net him ten thousand dollars over the wholesale price of $30,000. Bobby tells the young men to give him the money first, so he can then go buy the cocaine from his dealer, but the young men eventually chicken out and insist that he show them the cocaine before they hand over the money. Bobby has to persuade the dealer to give him the cocaine without the money, a very risky proposition as the dealer will kill him if he fails to bring the money back. However, walking away with the drugs, Bobby is intercepted by the two plainclothes cops. He quickly hides the yellow plastic bag in a trash barrel and keeps walking. The cops drive off after a couple of blocks, but when Bobby runs back to the trash barrel, the yellow bag is missing. Bobby is desperate to pay the huge sum he owes to his dealer. He asks someone he knows, and is set up with a meeting with a mobster who needs a hitman. Bobby is to shoot a black guy in a white sedan parked by the river and do it without killing the guy's girlfriend. Bobby does as instructed, and throws the gun into the river, but when he runs back to get paid, the mobster and the car are long gone. Bobby is now completely at his wits end, having committed murder and still having no money to pay back his dealer, who will kill him. Bobby roams around in an agonized daze. He curls up crying on an old quilt outside the basement of a building, where a homeless black woman silently offers to share her food with him. Bobby G can't swim, and is scared to go near the water. However, having had enough agony, he runs down a pier and throws himself into the river, hoping to drown. He floats instead of sinking, and is rescued. Walking again, Bobby runs into his blind friend Popeet, who lives by selling stuff he finds on the street. Bobby is amazed to see that the yellow bag with the cocaine is one of the items Popeet has for sale for a dollar. Bobby takes the cocaine to the suburban men, who give him the money, from which he takes his cut and then pays off his dealer. Bobby gives both Popeet and the homeless black lady a stack of money, and then he runs home to tell Lucy that he will go to Puerto Rico with her after all. They attempt to catch a cab to the airport. Bobby walks around the corner into the side street to increase their chances of getting a cab. Here he is challenged by two young black men, and when they confirm he is indeed Bobby G, he is shot to death. Lucy flags down a cab and runs to tell Bobby that they are all set now.

The software focuses on non-seismic applications and operates only on the Windows operating system. It supports files standard to the industry, instrument native formats as well as files used by other software in the industry such as AutoCAD, Google Earth and Oasis montaj. There is a free version of EMIGMA called EMIGMA Basic developed to allow viewing of databases created by licensed users. It does not allow data simulation nor modeling nor data import. The software is utilized by geoscientists for exploration and delineating purposes in mining, oil and gas and groundwater as well as hydrologists, environmental engineers, archaeologists and academic institutions for research purposes. Principal contributors to the software are R. W. Groom, H. Wu, E. Vassilenko, R. Jia, C. Ottay and C. Alvarez. EMIGMA tools Forward simulation of geophysical models These applications were the initial motivation for the platform and are still given attention in new releases. Geological models can be simulated for a variety of geophysical measurement systems such as conventional dipole- dipole, , time domain electromagnetics(TEM), Magnetotellurics(MT), /, magnetic, gravity, resistivity and induced polarization systems. Surveys can be airborne, ground, down a hole, crosshole, underwater or on the water. A survey is defined by properties related to a transmitter, a receiver and other system properties. The system and survey parameters are stored with the input data allowing the user freedom from continually specifying these parameters for every model. Synthetic measurements at the receiver due to the model are what are calculated during a simulation. Early versions of EMIGMA could simulate the responses of 3d blocks, thin plates and the response of a many layered earth model. Simulation algorithms now include one for a sphere model, and alternate algorithms for thin plates and various algorithms for 3D prisms and polyhedra. Blocks and polyhedra components of a model are simulated by algorithms based on the LN approximation. When compared with a real world electromagnetic system, it has been found that simulation results for a thin plate tended to agree in some situations. One case study required other algorithms for initial analysis of data due to EMIGMA's complexity. EMIGMA was then used when the limitations of the other software was reached. EMIGMA is the only commercial EM modelling tool that can model a thick prism, a complex polyhedra as well as a thin plates. Another advantage is the ability to simulate the response of multiple types of targets on more than one profile. Inversion of geophysical data A model response can be simulated and compared to a measured response adjusted by the user and repeated. But another approach, which is often taken, is to make this process for forward simulation and model adjustment automatic. After enough iterations, a model can be found that has a response that matches the measured response within a limit specified by the user. This is termed inversion. Petros Eikon has been developing inversion processes for almost 2 decades. Initial inversion procedures provided one dimensional (1D)models for frequency domain electromagnetic data both controlled source and natural field for ground and airborne data. Later, capabilities for 3d inversion were added. 1D inversion determines the model for a single station. It is available for FEM, TEM, MT, CSAMT and Resistivity data. This process can be repeated for each station that exists to produce what is termed inversion sections. 3D inversion determines the properties of a model in the form of a network of 3d cells. This tool is available for magnetic, gravity, MT, CSEM, CSAMT and Resistivity data. Petros Eikon has moved from standard steepest descent inversion techniques to a Trust Region technique. 3D visualization The design of a survey, geological model and data can be displayed in 3D. The geometry and parameters of model structures can be edited in 3D space. Measured and synthetic data can be viewed in different formats including vectors, lines, surfaces and contours in association with the models. Results from inversion tools can be displayed as a volume. 2D plotter A plotter designed to analyze geophysical data. Data can be displayed on a 2D axis as a function of time, frequency, position or tx-rx separation. Measured data can be compared with simulated and inverted data by displaying multiple plots on the same axis or calculating a residual plot. Data can be converted to different properties such as apparent resistivity. Survey editor The design of a survey is displayed on a two dimensional X-Y (North/South)display including transmitters and data stations. Data stations and models can be interactively edited. Files from mapping software can be imported to display the survey overlaid on a map. Projections of models can also be displayed. The application allows export to GIS graphic formats. Gridding Multiple data can be interpolated into a multi- dimensional grid to allow viewing of maps of such things as multi-time windows or multi-transmitter receiver settings. Grid cells need not be square but may be rectangular to correspond to different spatial densities of stations and lines. Data can be interpolated to a defined grid and viewed in Grid Presentation and a 3D contour application. Grid Presentation also supports map overlays from other mapping software as well as export to all the common geophysical mapping software. Other tools The data spreadsheet displays survey data in a spreadsheet format. Data can be edited. PseudoShow displays data from a series of points as a cross section by assigning tx-rx separation, frequency or time values to depth. The tool calculates resistivity for frequency domain and helicopter data collected at different transmitter frequencies. Results can be displayed in the CDI viewer that also displays 1d inversion results. The poly generator creates synthetic topography and complex anomalies for modeling. Models can also be imported from CAD applications. FFT processing is available for gravity and magnetic data including derivative generation, windowing and upward/downward continuation. Other tools provide features such as digital and spatial data filtering as well as survey editing. Version history EMIGMA 1 Released in 1994. DOS application to simulate EM responses of a thin-sheet. EMIGMA 5 Released in 1997. WINDOWS 95/NT application. Simulation of geophysical models for various EM systems such as surface and borehole TDEM, airborne and ground FDEM, IP/Resistivity, Magnetotellurics, and CSAMT as a controlled source application. The earliest commercial example of a 3D modeling CSEM application. Application included plotting and visualization capabilities. EMIGMA 6 This version featured forward simulation, 2d and 3d plotting, contouring, a pseudosection tool, 1d inversion of FEM, MT and CSAMT data and 3d inversion of magnetic data. This design has since been renamed and is now sold as GeoTutor for educational purposes. GeoTutor is now in its 5th version as GeoTutor 5. EMIGMA 7 Released in 2000, EMIGMA 7 changed the manner in which data was stored. The basic stored data structure was changed from an ASCII text file structure in a full relational database. With a database structure it was now possible to add many associated tools such as a range of filtering and editing tools. New geophysical features added included source conductivity depth imaging, 1d TEM inversion, Euler deconvolution, FFT tools for magnetic and gravity data, 3d resistivity inversion and magnetization vector inversion. EMIGMA 8 Full compatibility with Windows Vista was added to EMIGMA with the April 2008 release of version 8. Support was added for new data collection instruments. Other new features include the freespace eikplate simulation algorithm, inversion tools for MT and CSAMT and more efficient inversion algorithms. EMIGMA 9 October 2015 was the release date of EMIGMA 9. A new Fortran compiler was used to rebuild the algorithm code for numerical algorithms such as 3D magnetic and gravity inversion, data interpolation and freespace plate simulation, increasing the scale of problems that could be processed and increasing speed by 5 times. New features were also added to the 1d TEM inversion tool and IP modeling. References Microsoft Windows Science software Proprietary software ","title":"Emigma"},{"id":"52960126","text":"Helene P.

She is notable for her work in the field of Patristics. Clark expanded the study of early Christianity, pioneering the application of modern theories such as feminist theory, social network theory, and literary criticism to ancient sources. Early life Clark was born in Port Chester, New York, in 1938. She moved to Delhi, New York, when she was nine. She attended high school there and subsequently described her education in history as 'dismal'. She received a state scholarship and attended Vassar College, where she received her BA in Religion in 1960. Clark was taught History by Mildred Campbell, Mary Martin McLaughlin, and J. B. Ross, and Religion by Jack Glasse. Clark received her MA and PhD from Columbia University in 1962 and 1965. As a graduate student, Clark studied Early Christianity alongside philosophy, including a course run by Paul Oskar Kristeller on Hellenic philosophy after Aristotle. Clark described Kristeller as 'the most learned scholar I have ever known'. Clark's doctoral thesis was The influence of Aristotelian thought on Clement of Alexandria: a study in philosophical transmission, written under the direction of the faculty of Union Theological Seminary. Career In 1964, Clark founded the Department of Religion at Mary Washington College (now part of the Department of Classics, Philosophy, and Religion at the University of Mary Washington) in Fredericksburg, Virginia.Clark, \\"Retrospective Self,\\" 6 She held the position of the Chair of the Department 1979-82. In 1982, Clark was appointed as a Professor of Religion at Duke University. She founded the Center for Late Ancient Studies (CLAS) at Duke in 1986. At the time of her appointment in the College of Arts and Sciences, the faculty numbered around 500; only four women held the rank of full professor. Clark held a fellowship at the National Humanities Center, North Carolina, 2001-02. Clark was awarded an honorary degree by Uppsala University in 2001. She was given the shell of the cannon that was fired during the ceremony as a memento. Clark received an honorary degree from Yale University in 2013. Clark has served on the boards of many academic journals, including Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. She helped to launch and co-edited the Journal of Early Christian Studies. Clark is a prolific writer, authoring or editing thirteen books and over seventy articles. Her research has focused on Augustine, John Chyrsostom, Origen, social networks, early ascetic practices, and women in the early church. Clark retired from Duke in 2014 as the John Carlisle Kilgo Professor. She remains on the board of the Center for Late Ancient Studies at Duke. Reflecting on her career, Clark observed that it was 'rather eclectic': 'I branched into byways as well as highways, stumbled into enterprises for which neither my background nor graduate school had prepared me.' Recognition and awards  Clark has served as president of the American Academy of Religion (1990), the American Society of Church History (1987), and the North American Patristics Society (1989). She was responsible for launching the Journal of Early Christian Studies, a flagship journal in the field of Patristics, early Christianity, and late ancient studies. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1988. She has been the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. In 2003, she received the Distinguished Career Award from the American Society of Church History. In 2006 she was awarded the Distinguished Service Award of the North American Patristic Society. Clark's critical influence is demonstrated in the Festschrift published in her honour, edited by Catherine Chin and Caroline Schroeder: Melania: Early Christianity through the Life of One Family (2017). In 2018, Duke University renamed the Center for Late Ancient Studies (CLAS) as the Elizabeth A. Clark Center for Late Ancient Studies, \\"in honor of Dr. Clark‚Äôs career and leadership in the field.\\" Clark has served as dissertation adviser for a number of leading scholars in the field. For her support of young scholars, especially her commitment to support to women and others who have not traditionally been represented in the academy, Clark was awarded the Dean's award for Excellence in Mentoring. Her most recent book, The Fathers Refounded, was described as 'a truly brilliant book, massively researched, beautifully written, often witty, and rich with insight'. Activism Clark was involved with the women's movement from the late 1960s, co-founding the Fredericksburg chapter of National Organization for Women (NOW).

A funeral parlor cremated his remains and flushed his ash in a toilet. Killing South Korean Jee Ick-Joo, a businessman, along with his house helper, was reportedly kidnapped by two unidentified men from Jee's residence in Friendship Plaza Subdivision, Angeles, Pampanga on October 18, 2016. After their arrest, the kidnappers‚Äîwho turned out to be members of the Philippine National Police (PNP)‚Äîaccused Jee of being involved in the illegal drug trade. Jee's wife, Choi Kyung-jin, made the statement that the kidnappers Patrick Joseph Banez demanded a ransom of , and she reportedly paid on October 30, 2016. She said she did not give the kidnappers the remaining when they failed to present proof that Jee was still alive. The house helper was released the day after she and Jee were kidnapped. Philippine authorities held an investigation into Jee's death, the result of which was relayed to South Korean authorities. The result of the investigation stated that Jee died due to strangulation, on the same day he was kidnapped, within the grounds of Camp Crame of the PNP. On January 17, 2017, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) went to a funeral parlor in Bagbaguin, Caloocan where the body of Jee Ick-Joo was believed to have been brought. His remains were cremated and his ashes were flushed down the toilet. Jee Ick-Joo's wife said that eight armed men, including SPO3 Ricky Santa Isabel, who is linked to the PNP Anti-Illegal Drugs Group, were involved in the kidnapping. She alleged that the group took their personal property, including jewelry and passports. Jee's househelper was also named as a suspect by the Angeles city police after she was found to have used a false name and been working at Jee's household for only two days. The house helper is the main witness in the case. On February 3, according to PNP Chief Ronald Dela Rosa, unscrupulous members of the PNP and NBI could be behind the killing of Jee. Dela Rosa told the reporters at Camp Crame that \\"the picture is getting clearer and hopefully, the truth will soon come out\\". The suspects of the kidnapping and killing, including Supt. Rafael Dumlao III, SPO4 Roy Villegas, Jerry Omlang, Gerardo Santiago SPO3 Ricky Sta. Isabel, were arrested in 2017. In a 29 January 2017 late evening press conference, Dumlao was named by Rodrigo Duterte to be the mastermind in the abduction and murder and was given 24 hours to surrender.https://www.rappler.com/nation/159904-duterte-rafael- dumlao-mastermind-korean-jee-ick-joo-murder Four of them, except Sta.

Presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella stated that Duterte did not accept the offer of resignation because he believed that dela Rosa can't be faulted for the killing since the suspected perpetrators are not part of his team, this while acknowledging that there is indeed corruption in the institution. At the time of the kidnapping, Dela Rosa was in Beijing with the President for the state visit. House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez called for the resignation of dela Rosa over the incident to spare the Duterte administration from further embarrassment but revoked the call after Duterte said dela Rosa did not need to resign. President Duterte apologized to South Korea for the incident, saying those responsible will be held accountable, additionally remarking that if imprisoned it would be best for them to escape, implying that he would have their heads sent to South Korea after being killed in prison. Members of South Korean community and sympathizers offered flowers and candles inside Camp Crame. South Korea The South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned officials of the Philippine Embassy in South Korea to convey their deep concern over the killing of Jee Ick-Joo; no diplomatic protest was filed, however. The South Korean government, through its ministry, also called for the quick resolution of the case so that the perpetrators can be held accountable and to increase measures to ensure the safety of South Korean nationals in the Philippines. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs are cooperating with their South Korean counterparts over the case. South Korea, through its ambassador to the Philippines Jae-Shin Kim, accepted an apology by President Duterte on January 26, 2017, but reiterated calls for the quick resolution of the case. The South Korean government expressed that they are making efforts to \\"control the damage\\" and \\"calm down the feeling of the people\\" following the incident.

The movement began with the online publication of a handbook written by Congressional staffers with suggestions for peacefully but effectively resisting the move to the right in the executive branch of the United States government under the Trump administration that was widely anticipated and feared by progressives. According to Peter Dreier, the goal of Indivisible is to \\"save American democracy\\" and \\"resume the project of creating a humane America that is more like social democracy than corporate plutocracy.\\" In 2019, Indivisible's Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin were included in Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2019.  Origin  The movement started with the online publication of a 23-page handbook, Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda. The authors of the document, most notably Ezra Levin, Jeremy Haile, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla, were former Congressional staffers. Greenberg worked as an aide to Democratic Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, while Levin, Greenberg's husband, worked as an aide to Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas. After the 2016 presidential election, in mid-December 2016, Levin and Greenberg began working on an online guide in the form of a Google Document on how to make contact with congressional aides as a way of grieving over Trump's victory. Angel Padilla, and Jeremy Haile, and dozens of other staffers for Democratic members of the United States Congress joined in the creation of the online publication. The authors modeled their document after the Tea Party movement, which focused on local activism and obstructing the Democratic Party's agenda following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008. They thought that similar action taken by the left could be effective against what they perceived as Trump's \\"bigoted and anti-democratic agenda\\". The purpose of the guide was to encourage resistance to Trump's presidency, most notably by targeting Republican elected members of Congress by attending town halls, calling congressional officials, visiting their offices, and showing up at public events. It was first published online on Google Docs on December 14, 2016, with Levin posting a link to it on his personal Twitter account. It soon went viral, with, among others, Robert Reich, Jonathan Chait, George Takei and Miranda July circulating it online.  History  Since the guide's publication, its authors have created a website with further resources on using the guide and organizing local movements. The guide is continuously updated and is available in English and Spanish. By February 4, 2017, less than two months from the publication of the Indivisible Guide, and about two weeks after Trump's inauguration, more than 3,800 local groups identifying as \\"Indivisibles\\" had formed and declared their support for the movement. In February, they organized as a 501(c) organization. Many groups attended town halls, demonstrated against nominees for Trump's Cabinet, and worked with organizers of the Women's March. John Kasich and Mo Brooks acknowledged that the protests would impact efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The movement was cited as a cause for the initial failure of Republicans to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017. In 2018, the group and its volunteers contributed money, endorsement and volunteer time to many House races, helping Democrats win back control of the chamber. In 2019, the group endorsed a series of events aimed at supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump.

Marizio de Giovanni  Biography  Maurizio de Giovanni was born in Naples in 1958; he has spent the majority of his life living and working there. In 2005 he decided to join a Porsche Italia competition reserved for giallo novelists, and that's where he came up with the character of Commissario Ricciardi, main protagonist of his first short story, ‚ÄúI vivi e I morti‚Äù. This was the start of his career as a writer. Subsequently, ‚ÄúI Vivi e i morti‚Äù served as an inspiration for ‚ÄúLe lacrime del pagliaccio‚Äù (later re- published as ‚ÄúI will have vengeance - The winter of commissario Ricciardi‚Äù), edited by Graus Editore. With the publishing of this very novel, the chronicles of Commissario Ricciardi had officially begun. In 2007 Fandango published ‚ÄúI will have vengeance - The winter of commissario Ricciardi‚Äù, his first work inspired to the 4 seasons of the year. Following this, in 2008,‚ÄùBlood curse - The springtime of commissario Ricciardi‚Äù was released. In 2009 it was time for ‚ÄúEveryone in their place - The summer of commissario Ricciardi‚Äù and finally, in 2010, ‚ÄúThe day of the dead - The autumn of commissario Ricciardi‚Äù made his appearance in the bookstores. He started to gain a wider audience and made a name for himself because of this series. In 2011 he had his first book published by Einaudi, ‚ÄúBy my hand - A commissario Ricciardi mystery‚Äù. In 2012 he went down the path of the noir genre and he managed to come up with a book titled ‚ÄúThe Crocodile‚Äù, that marked the first appearance on the scenes of the new main character of his novels, Ispettore Lojacono. In the same year, together with Einaudi, he published the pocket version of the seasons‚Äô novels and the brand new ‚ÄúViper - A commissario Ricciardi mystery‚Äù. In 2013 he's back on the scenes with ‚ÄúThe Bastards of Pizzofalcone‚Äù, inspired by the 87th Precinct series from Ed McBain. This marked his transition from the noir genre to the police procedural. Shortly after he wrote ‚ÄúDarkness for the Bastards of Pizzofalcone‚Äù. These novels will be transformed into a TV show. In the same month when he completed ‚ÄúDarkness‚Äù, his short story ‚ÄúUn giorno di Settembre a Natale‚Äù, contained in the anthology ‚ÄúRegalo di Natale‚Äù, was published by the editor Sellerio. 2014 was a very prolific year for Maurizio.

It is one of two major medical centers located in Dutchess County, New York, the other being MidHudson Regional Hospital, a member of the Westchester Medical Center Health Network, or WMCHealth. Vassar Hospital is a member of the Nuvance Health system. Vassar Brothers was incorporated in 1882 under the name Vassar Brothers Hospital, following contributions made by John Guy Vassar following the death of his brother, Mathew Vassar, Jr. The hospital opened its doors in 1887, and initially had 40 beds divided up into four wards, each containing ten beds. At the time the hospital opened it also contained a labor and delivery ward, a children's ward, a nursery, three private rooms, and two isolation rooms. Major renovations occurred in 1983, 1991, and 2001; adding critical care areas, a new operating and delivery wing, and a cancer care center, respectively. In 2002 Vassar Brothers Hospital officially became Vassar Brothers Medical Center. In September 2016, VBMC announced a new $500 million expansion which would almost double the number of available rooms. Construction on the expansion was expected to be completed in 2019. VBMC also operates a satellite medical center called Vassar Brother Medical Mall in the nearby town of Fishkill, New York. Located in the Westage Medical Mall, VBMC and their construction partner, Westage Companies, each own approximately half of the Medical Mall building. Services offered at the Mall include radiation oncology, same-day surgery, speech-language pathology, and women's imaging.  Main Campus  The Vassar Brothers Medical Center comprises several buildings on its central campus. The main structure, which is located adjacent to Route 9 on Reade Place, houses the main hospital, the emergency room, the NICU, the maternity center, the gift shop, and the cafeteria, as well as the Dyson Center for Cancer Care. The Westage Medical Building, which houses The Heart Center, as well as the visitor parking garage, are located across the street. Another building containing The center for Ambulance Services, the VBMC Foundation and patient parking for the Vassar Ambulatory Surgery Center are located nearby on Lincoln Avenue. The second floor of the Vassar Ambulatory Surgery Center houses the Dyson Breast Center, a center for breast disease, breast health, and breast cancer that opened in August 2015. Employee parking is located adjacent to the Ambulatory Surgery Center on Livingston Avenue.  Dyson Center for Cancer Care  The Dyson Center for Cancer Care is a full- service cancer treatment and support center, the only of its kind in the Mid- Hudson Valley. The Dyson Center at VBMC is affiliated with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and conducts clinical research with assistance from the National Cancer Institute and the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP). The radiotherapy suite on-site offers three types of radiation therapy: image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).  Dyson Breast Center  The Dyson Breast Center is a full service breast care center, first opened on August 3, 2015. The 11,746 square foot facility is housed on the second floor of the Vassar Ambulatory Surgery Center. The Dyson Foundation, the center's main benefactor, awarded $1 million for construction in 2014. Additional donations were made from the Friends of Vassar Brothers Medical Center. The total cost for the construction was $4.2 million. The Dyson Breast Center features two 3D mammography units for use in the Breast Center, separate from the Center for Cancer Care. Dr. Angela Keleher, the director of the Dyson Breast Center, says the new 3D units \\"[decrease] the need for calling patients back in for additional screenings and [increase] the cancer-detection rate.\\" The project was designed to provide women with a single place for all breast care needs, and features exam rooms, procedure rooms, offices for the staff, and waiting areas.

Education and early career  Harbinger received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Michigan. He later became a lawyer. Harbinger was kidnapped twice, once in Mexico and again in Serbia. He ran a tour company that took westerners to North Korea via China and has spent significant time in the country. Tours were supervised from beginning to end by North Korean minders and tour guides. In 2007 Harbinger worked on mortgage-backed securities for a Wall Street firm and was laid off after around a year due to the 2007 financial crisis.  Media career  While he was in law school, Harbinger started coaching other people how to date and network. He and co-host AJ Harbinger (who uses Jordan Harbinger's last name as a pseudonym) started The PickUp Podcast. When Harbinger graduated in 2006, he moved to New York. Around that time he formed a company called \\"The Art of Charm\\" to turn his coaching into a business. By that time his podcast had gained traction, and he started focusing full-time on the coaching business. In 2010 an app was launched, and by 2011 Harbinger had a radio talk show called \\"Game On\\" on both Sirius and XM Satellite that aired on Friday nights. The show was the first-ever podcast carried on satellite radio. By 2011, Harbinger had relocated to Los Angeles. By that time the company offered week-long \\"boot camps\\", and offered other options like coaching over the phone. In 2013 Harbinger demonstrated at DEF CON how easily a person can be manipulated into divulging information to someone who may not be what they claim to be, based on the Robin Sage experiment of 2010. By 2015, Harbinger was rebranding himself more as a more general self-help personality and was profiling celebrities in the podcasts. In early 2018, Harbinger split from his former partners, left The Art of Charm podcast, and started a new podcast under his own name.

During the course of his career, Estill has invested in 150 start-up companies and received international attention in 2015 for offering to sponsor the resettling of 50 Syrian refugee families in Canada. In recognition of his philanthropic efforts, Estill received the Order of Ontario in June 2017 and was named to the Order of Canada in July 2018. He also received an Everyday Heroes Award from the Global Hope Coalition in 2017. Education Estill studied engineering at the University of Waterloo, graduating in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Design Engineering. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Guelph in 2018. Business career 1980-1999 In his final year of university, he started his first company, EMJ Data Systems. Operating with very modest means, Estill sold computer equipment and software, soon transitioning into distribution. The business grew quickly, became publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and withstood that era's downturn in the IT industry. His accomplishments at such a young age were recognized in 1996 when Estill was added to the ranks of Canada's Top 40 under 40, the second person to receive this honor. That same year, Estill joined the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) and remains a member of the CNBC-YPO Chief Executive Network. Estill served as a founding board member of Research in Motion/BlackBerry in 1997, before the company went public. He subsequently stayed with that organization until 2010. 1997 also found him acting as one of the founding members of Communitech., an organization devoted to helping tech companies grow and find their place in the market. 2000-2009 In 2003, EMJ purchased the Canadian operations of DaisyTek Canada, doubling their distribution size to more than $350 million in consolidated revenue. At its height, EMJ had 350 employees and $350 million in annual sales. In June 2004, Synnex Canada purchased EMJ Data Systems for $56 million. As part of the deal, Estill took over as CEO of Synnex's Canadian division. During the five years that he ran Synnex from 2004‚Äì2009, sales for the company grew from $800 million to $2 billion. Estill entered the world of blogging in the spring of 2005 with CEO Blog‚ÄîTime Leadership, which documents his philosophies on leadership and time management, and which he continues to update with new posts on a regular basis. In 2008, Estill was granted patent number 8244567 for gamification in ERP systems. 2010-present In 2010, Estill published his first book, Time Leadership - Lessons from a CEO and followed that publication three years later with Zero to $2 Billion: The Marketing and Branding Story Behind the Growth. Estill also serves on the advisory board of OMERS Ventures, one of Canada's largest pension funds, which began operations in 2011. Estill spoke about his success in the business world for a TEDx Talk called \\"Zero to $2 Billion\\" in New York City in April 2013. In late 2014, Estill founded DDE Media, a Guelph, Ontario-based digital multimedia company. DDE merged two years later with TrafficSoda, a digital marketing firm, founded in 2013 by Jessica Chalk. Estill serves as chairman of the combined organization, with Chalk as President and CEO. While continuing on in this capacity, Estill came out of semi-retirement to assume the post of CEO at Guelph, Ontario-based Danby Products in 2015,. In 2017, Estill purchased Danby Products and its subsidiaries from John Wood and his family. Under his guidance, the company resumed manufacturing some of its products in Canada for the first time in a number of years. Seed Investor In addition to the businesses he started on his own, Estill also served as a seed investor for over 150 companies, including well.ca, Printeron, Miovision, Clearpath Robotics, Postrank, Touch Bistro, Spicer, Inex, and Border Networks. Philanthropy In 2015, Estill grew distressed by the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Frustrated by the Canadian government's slow response, Estill decided in November 2015 to sponsor the immigration of 50 Syrian families to Guelph, Ontario. This worked out to a personal cost of about $1.5 million Canadian. He rallied church groups and 800 volunteers across the city and worked closely with the Islamic community. Estill has now sponsored 87 families for resettlement. When asked why he decided to pursue this, Estill replied \\"Imagine going to work and discovering that your office isn't there anymore‚Ä¶Imagine going home from work and your home isn't there and you've heard that a cousin has been killed. People were living in fear and helping them come to Canada, a place of safety, was the right thing to do.\\" To achieve his ambitious goal, Estill decided to use the organizational skills he had developed over his long business career. After meeting with local clergy and related organizations, he budgeted that each Syrian family would need between $25,000-30,000 Canadian for life essentials over a one-year period. For assistance, Estill called upon the Lakeside Church, the Salvation Army, Guelph's Roman Catholic community, the Muslim Society of GuelphMuslim Society of Guelph,url=http://www.msofg.org/refugee-life-line.html and Welcome In Drop-in Centre, as well as friends and business associates. Arrangements were put in place to provide apartments, clothing, and English language instruction. Using his business network connections, Estill also helped arrange employment and career counselling. More than 800 local volunteers were registered and donated their time to the project. Although it was hoped that the Syrian families would begin arriving by the end of 2015, this stalled by February 2016 when the Canadian government met its announced quota of bringing 25,000 Syrian refugees into the country. This led to problems storing donated items as the spaces would soon become unavailable. By the end of June, only 13 of the 50 planned families had settled in Guelph. However, things soon improved and 47 families had relocated by the end of 2016. By that point, the total number of families Estill committed to help had also grown to 58 and totaled more than 200 people. In addition to his own project, Estill also contributed his finances to help a nine-year-old local boy realize his family's dream of sponsoring a Syrian family in Canada. In recognition of his philanthropic efforts, Estill received the Order of Ontario in June 2017. and was named to the Order of Canada in June 2018.

Later, the organization helped create the first birth control clinic in Chicago. The early birth control clinics run by IBCL often had staff members on hand who were fluent in several languages, in order to better serve immigrant communities. The IBCL also sponsored discussions about issues relating to family planning and birth control.  History  In 1916, Margaret Sanger visited Chicago to give a speech against Comstock laws and in support of birth control clinics. The speech drew around 1,200 people and \\"inspired the creation of the Illinois Birth Control League.\\" By 1919, the league had been set up and was advertised in the Birth Control Review. In 1923, the IBCL opened its first birth control clinic, which was directed by Rachelle Yarros. This clinic was the second of its kind in the United States. The clinics enabled women who could not afford a private physician to receive practical family planning advice. Originally, the clinics were meant to be free clinics, but the city would not grant them the necessary license from the health commissioner. Because of this, the IBCL charged a \\"nominal fee\\" to give out oral information about birth control. In 1924, the IBCL was again denied a permit for the clinic to operate as a public clinic where information could be given out for free. IBCL opened a second birth control office in 1925. By 1937, over 20,000 women had been seen by the several clinics run by IBCL. The IBCL and other women continued to fight against laws preventing the dissemination of information about birth control in Illinois during the late 1920s. In 1934, the IBCL, along with the Chicago Woman's Club, the Birth Control League and the Social Hygiene League of Chicago created a resolution, backed by three hundred women, to allow social workers to discuss family planning and to refer clients to birth control clinics. IBCL incorporated in April 1924 with the name, \\"Illinois Birth Control League\\" with the mission of philanthropic and educational work relating to family planning.The IBCL became the Planned Parenthood League of Illinois in 1946, and then later, the Planned Parenthood Association, Chicago Area in 1947. Peggy Carr was the last president of the IBCL and oversaw the transition to Planned Parenthood.

Early life and career  Alba's great grandmother was an oil painter and her grandmother trained as a concert pianist. Alba's mother, Marjorie, held a Master of Fine Arts degree in ceramics from Ohio State University, teaching at Ohio State University Academy. Alba's father, an engineer, was an inventor and CEO of Oasis (also known as Ebco), a Fortune 500 company. Art was an important topic in her childhood home. During high school, Alba artist attended classes at Columbus Cultural Arts Center, part of the Columbus Parks and Recreation Department. Alba also studied at Penland School of Arts and Crafts summer program attending lithography and silk screening classes. After high school, Alba traveled a summer with her Mother to Europe, where they visited museums and architectural sites in Germany and Italy. Alba then began her studies at Kent State University, with a focus on English literature. While there she witnessed the shootings at Kent State, and soon after left the University and her studies to live in Berkeley, California. Six years later Alba enrolled in University of Michigan, earning a Bachelor of Psychology. During this period she began working in studio on a daily basis, starting as an abstract painter. Alba regularly organized artist groups for figure drawing sessions for years, along with a consciousness raising feminist group. She organized group exhibitions and began entering juried shows. In 1984 Alba moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area to immerse herself in the rich mixture of cultures. Major painting series Alba's earliest interest was in printmaking ‚Äì linocuts, lithography, and etching. Painting as her primary focus started while attending University of Michigan as a Psychology major. Exploring abstraction and color fields her work then moved to symbolism; a trend that continued for decades. Later on, Alba shifted to landscapes, with increasing focus on the sky as subject. Her work over these four decades can be categorized into several major bodies of work: :Old and New World (1980s) ‚Äì A series of paintings and prints that speaks to the intermingling ‚Äì rather than homogenization ‚Äì of US cultures, including an awareness of Native American rights, and the importance of Native American thoughts and beliefs regarding North America as well as feminism :Alaska Journey (2000s) ‚Äì Landscapes sourced from a drive trip through Canada to Alaska. This series marks the artist's shift from symbolism to landscape as an exclusive topic. The series includes paintings and prints. :Beauty, Thy Name is Night (installation, 2007 ‚Äì 2010) ‚Äì Oil paintings depicting night often exhibited in near total darkness. Quotes by notable authors and philosophers describing night above and below were written in white chalk on flat black painted drops installed on walls. Imagery included tree silhouettes and the moon in various stages of its monthly cycle. Viewers were supplied with flashlights to seek out the quotes. :American Storms (2010 ‚Äì current) ‚Äì These are oil paintings of extreme winter storm weather experienced by the artist while delivering solo shows cross-country. Painted on canvas or paper, a few are large format of 10 to 14 feet wide.  Later career  Upon her move to California, Alba joined Apprentice Alliance, as Master teacher/artist in the San Francisco-based organization training apprentices for more than three decades. Alba frequently donated workshops on photographing artworks for art groups. Alba has sponsored poetry readings and musical events at her art exhibitions in museum and gallery solo shows. A decades-long collaboration between poetess Cynthia Harris and Alba included presentations together at Cody's Books in Berkeley, Jack London Square's Barnes & Noble Bookstore in Oakland, CA, as well as Alba's museum solo in Minnesota's North County Museum of Arts. For over 20 years, she hosted over two dozen guest artists as part of PRO ARTS East Bay Open Studios, an annual citywide public art event. Alba has presented as a lecturer, served as guest speaker, and juried multiple exhibits throughout her career. She also serves on the boards of several art-related organizations. Following her move to California, she joined the local branch of the Women's Caucus for the Arts. After being juried into The California Society of Printmakers, Alba rose from artist member to board member and finally served as President 2003 - 2006. In 2010, the Oakland City Crafts and Cultural Arts Gallery held a retrospective of Alba's works. This made visible many of the artistic influences over Alba's career ‚Äì including works influenced by abstraction, symbolism, psychology, anthropology, archaeology, surrealism, and feminism. Alba remains active, with solo exhibitions, teaching apprentices, public speaking, jurying exhibitions and judging awards, as well as serving as guest speaker.  Exhibitions  Alba's first group show was in Ohio at the Columbus Cultural Arts Center in 1980. Her first solo exhibition was the following year in the Loft Gallery at the same venue. Her first solo in California was in the Canessa Gallery in San Francisco. She has had over 100 solo exhibitions throughout the Commonwealth Club of California since then and participated in over 300 group shows in the US. Selected solo exhibitions include: Hoyt Institute of Fine Art, New York Las Vegas Art Museum, Las Vegas, Nevada Maturango Museum, Ridgecrest, California Oakland City Crafts and Cultural Arts Gallery, Oakland, California Sedona Art Center, Sedona, Arizona University of Mary, Welder Library, Bismarck, North Dakota Valley Art Center, Clarkson, Washington Western Wyoming Community College, Rock Springs, Wyoming Alba's paintings and prints are held in public art collections, beginning with the acquisition of ‚ÄúLost Blood: Ghost Dance‚Äù by the National Museum of Women in the Arts.

It was built by Len Beadell for the Weapons Research Establishment of Salisbury, South Australia in 1955. Background Following two successful atomic bomb tests at Emu in October 1953, a new site with better access for men and equipment was needed. Beadell had selected and surveyed the sites for Woomera and Emu, so he was asked once again to locate a more suitable site for further nuclear tests. He carried out a solo reconnaissance in the southern Great Victoria Desert, locating a suitable site north north-east of Watson siding on the Trans- Australian Railway. Beadell spent most of 1954 and the first half of 1955 carrying out survey work for the establishment of the township of what was to become Maralinga. When the work was completed, it was necessary to link the old bomb testing field and the new one by road, so Beadell carried out a survey north to Emu in early August 1955, naming Observatory Hill on the way. Once back at Maralinga, he assembled a team with a bulldozer and grader and they began building a road to Emu, beginning on 19 August 1955. The team was later dubbed the Gunbarrel Road Construction Party by Beadell as a joke, but the name stuck and passed into folklore. When the road was within of Emu, the bulldozer was recalled to Maralinga. Another had been left at Emu following the bomb test two years earlier, so it was obtained to complete the road to Emu which occurred on 17 September 1955. Footnote After construction of a road from Mabel Creek to Emu in early 1953 (see Anne Beadell Highway), this road was effectively the second road built by Beadell. He had, however, bulldozed a track from the centreline of the firing range to intercept the Mabel Creek to Emu road in late 1953. The builder of the section from Watson siding to Maralinga is not documented in references used, and is additional to the length built by Beadell.

After having danced more than thirty years in the Hip Hop world, Bintou Demb√©l√© is the artistic director of her own dance compagny Rualit√© since 2002. Her work explores the issue of the memory of the body through the prisms of the colonial and post-colonial French history.  Beginnings  Bintou Demb√©l√© was born the 30th of March 1975 in the suburbs of Paris to a family who emigrated to France after Sub Saharan Africa's decolonization. Bintou started dancing with her brothers when she was not even ten years old; her interest in Hip Hop dance was in part influenced by the show H.I.P. H.O.P. on the French TV channel TF1. Around 1985, Bintou Demb√©l√© and her friends G√©rard L√©al et Anselme Terezo created the dance group Boogie Breakers and started dancing collectively in their neighborhood's public spaces. In 1989, she joined the group Concept of Art, in which was born several collectives of rappers and dancers. While in middle school, Bintou Demb√©l√© also joined the dance groups Aktuel Force (in 1993 and 1997) and Mission Impossible (1994-1996) in which she diversified her Hip Hop dancing by learning House Dance, New Style, Break Dancing... etc. She progressively acquired her dance technique and street credibility through collective trainings. She practiced in emblematic parisian spots for the French street dances as in Ch√¢telet les Halles, the Place du Trocad√©ro-et-du-11-Novembre, the : fr : Place Georges-Pompidou and La D√©fense. In addition to her participation to different collectif trainings in Paris, she gets involved in street shows, festivals, battles and national scale Hip Hop competitions. She also takes part in different shows in nightclubs in Belgium, at Le Palace (Paris), le Bataclan or Le Divan du Monde.  Professional career  Demb√©l√©'s professional career began in 1996 when she was recruited by the Th√©√¢tre Contemporain de la Danse de Paris (TCD) as a dancer and choreographer. In 1997, she joined the dance group the Collectif Mouv‚Äô where she created her first show entitled Et si‚Ä¶! (What if...!) with the break dancer Rabah Mahfoufi. While dancing for the Collectif Mouv', Demb√©l√© also collaborated with the French Jazz saxophonist Julien Lourau and with the musical organization the Groove Gang to create a show entitled Come fly with us. At the same time she also co-founded the dance group Ykanji and the female group dance Ladyside. Her participation in French popular TV shows such as : fr : Graines de stars or Hit Machine enabled Demb√©l√© to meet French rappers and dancers such as MC Solaar and : fr : Bambi Cruz. In 1998, she danced for MC Solaar's concert in l'Olympia (Paris) in a show choreographed by Max-Laure Bourjolly and Bambi Cruz. In 2002, as an interpreter for the dance company : fr : K√§fig, Demb√©l√© performed at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan during the New York New Europe '99 Festival. The same year, she also created her own dance compagny, named Rualit√©. In 2004 Demb√©l√© created and performed her third show entitled L'Assise (The Foundation), which recounted the creative journey of individuals who explored the Hip Hop culture in France. In 2010, she created her first solo show entitled Mon appart' en dit long (My apartment tells a lot about it), in which she explored the notion of femininity, spatiality and daughter-mother relationship. In 2011, she choreographed the music video of the song Rom√©o kiffe Juliette of the French slam singer Grand Corps Malade. In 2013, she created and performed in Z.H. (an abbreviation for 'zoo humains', which means in English human zoos). Z.H, which is one of Demb√©l√©'s major creations, was created for six dancers and explored the notions of memory, imperial gaze and voyeurism, racism and the dehumanization of people of color. In 2016, she created and performed in S/T/R/A/T/E/S - Quartet et le duo (S/T/R/A/T/U/M - Duo quartet), a dancing and musical performance for two duos mixing improvisation, dance theater, gimmick and 'corporeal poetry' to interrogate the notions of the transmission of traumatic memory, of feminism and of post-colonial identities. As a recognized dancer with both a street and professional background, Demb√©l√© participates as a judge in various battles and other Hip Hop dance competitions and trains dancers as interprets for live performances all over the world. Bintou and the dancers of her dance compagny Rualit√© have performed their shows in France and internationally (in Sweden, in Burma, in Chile, in Macedonia, in French Guiana and in Mali).  Commitments  Rualit√© 's aim is to explore new forms of political engagements and representations by gathering diverse artists and researchers. The photograph and video maker : fr : Denis Darzacq and the anthropologist of colonial representations Sylvie Chalaye are one of the personalities linked to Rualit√©. Organized around the ideas of creation, transmission and research, Rualit√© not only produces dance shows but also works for enhancing the access to culture and to cultural activities both in the French metropole (and especially in its most marginalized communities) and in its overseas territories (and more especially in French Guiana). In the context of her company, Bintou Demb√©l√© frequently animates pedagogical and/or exploratory workshops aiming to gather people from different backgrounds and orientations in order to produce new insights on what being a committed artist means. Bintou Demb√©l√©'s engagements led her to work with students and scholars in schools and universities, with musicians and dancers from different backgrounds as well as with some of the Parisian suburbs' carceral population. Bintou Demb√©l√©'s commitment to the development of the Hip Hop culture and to the recognition and legitimacy of its actors in the French public spaces and common discourse led her to integrate the SeFeA laboratory organized by Universit√© Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris 3 in 2014. In September 2016, she is hosted by the Gender and Women studies department of the University of California, Berkeley in a conference to talk about the video documentary of her performance Z.H. In the French and francophone contexts, Bintou Demb√©l√©'s work can be related to the one of Maboula Soumahoro, Alice Diop or Isabelle Boni-Claverie. Bintou Dem√©l√© is one of the spokesperson of the scholars Mame- Fatou Niang and Kaytie Nielsen recent documentary Mariannes Noires (Black Mariannes) whose aim is to give voice and make visible Afro-French female identities.

Clockwise from upper left: Mayor Mary D. Lawson and Councilwomen Carrie Johnson, Sadie E. Balsley, Mittie Josephine Golden, Emma K. Hamilton, and Hanna P. Morse. Mary D. (McGaha) Lowman (January 27, 1842 ‚Äì June 12, 1912) was a schoolteacher and the mayor of Oskaloosa, Kansas, in the late 1880s. She was the first woman in Kansas to be elected mayor with a city council composed entirely of women. Biography Mary D. McGaha was born on a farm in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. She became a schoolteacher and in 1866 married a man named George W. Lowman, with whom she had two children. They moved to Kansas and settle in the small town of Oskaloosa, where she became a teacher of recently emancipated black students. In 1885, she became the city's deputy county clerk and deputy register of deeds. In 1888, the women of Oskaloosa, dissatisfied with poor city management, decided to run an entire slate of women for municipal office. (Although American women did not yet have a national right to vote, Kansas women had been given the right to vote in some municipal elections one year earlier.) The \\"Oskaloosa Improvement Ticket\\" won by a two-to-one margin, making Lowman the first woman in Kansas to serve as mayor with a city council composed entirely of women. Newspapers across the country covered the unusual election of an all-women municipal administration. Lowman was elected only a year after Susanna M. Salter became the nation's first woman mayor. When Lowman and her council took office, the city treasury was empty and the city in debt. Lowman and her 5-member council were re- elected after their first year in office, with two members of the council being replaced by other women. After two years in office, Lowman and her council left the city with a replenished treasury. Lowman died in 1912 of burns received when her clothing caught fire at a cookstove.

On January 14, 1915, the company was acquired by Chatham-Phenix National and Alliance Trust in New York. History Formation At the end of April 1902, H. M. Humphreys resigned from his positions as superintendent of the Coffee Exchange to become vice president of the newly formed Mutual Alliance Trust Company. On May 1, 1902, the New York Times reported the details of the newly formed Mutual Alliance Trust Company. It was organized by Cornelius Vanderbilt, William Rockefeller, and \\"a dozen more well-known men\\" with $1,000,000 in capital. Its initial place of business was an office at Orchard and Grand Streets in New York City. Kalman Haas was founding president, and Henry M. Humphrey vice president. It opened for business on the Tuesday after June 29, 1902 as a general trust company on the east side of Manhattan. There were 13 directors upon its founding. Acquisition of National Reserve Bank On January 27, 1914, the National Reserve Bank was taken over by the Mutual Alliance Trust Company, which was then based at 35 Wall Street. The two companies had previously been affiliated and had shared directors. Deposits of the merged institutions was about $12,000,000. The National Reserve was liquidated, and its stockholders received the value \\"of the assets exceeding the amount of the deposits and a substantial payment for the good will of the institution.\\" James H. Parker was appointed president of the combined institution. Those of the National Bank Reserve were about $4,352,561 on January 13, 1914. At the time of the merge, the New York Times wrote that \\"both institutions have a large number of country bank accounts, chiefly in the West and Southwest, and handle much cotton exchange business.\\" For a time, the office of the National Bank Reserve at 165 was continued as the Reserve Branch of the trust company. Liquidation In January 1915, there were negotiations for Chatham and Phenix National to buy and liquidate the Mutual Alliance Trust Company in its entirety. The merger was completed on January 14, 1915. Directors When it opened for business on the Tuesday after June 29, 1902, there were 13 directors, including: *Kalman Haas *Henry H. Rogers (H. H.

Jallow-Tambajang (born 22 October 1949) is a Gambian politician and activist who served as Vice-President of the Gambia and Minister of Women's Affairs from February 2017 to June 2018, under President Adama Barrow. Early in her career she had been the chair of the Gambia National Women's Council and an advisor to Dawda Jawara, the first President of the Gambia as a nation independent from the colonial rule of the British Empire. After the military coup d'√©tat in July 1994 that deposed the Jawara government, she held the post of Secretary of State for Health and Social Welfare from 1994 to 1995 in the cabinet of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council. She was appointed as Vice-President by Barrow in January 2017, but was found ineligible due to constitutional age restrictions. She was instead made Minister of Women's Affairs overseeing the office of Vice- President, until the constitution was changed and she was formally sworn in as Vice-President in November 2017. Prior to her appointment, she had served as chair of Coalition 2016, the alliance of opposition political parties that had supported Barrow's candidacy in the 2016 presidential election. Early life and education Tambajang was born in Brikama, the Gambia. She was educated in the Gambia, Dakar and France. She completed a BA in French at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis.  Political career  Tambajang was an advisor to Dawda Jawara, the first President of the Gambia, on women's issues and children's affairs. She chaired the Gambia National Women's Council and represented it in the Gambia National Economic and Social Council for six years. Tambajang served as the Secretary of State for Health and Social Welfare from 1994 to 1995 in the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council cabinet. She was one of two female ministers in the cabinet, alongside Susan Waffa-Ogoo. She addressed the International Conference on Population and Development in September 1994 on behalf of the Gambia. She then went on to work for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and in the field of development, including 5 years in war-torn Mano River. In 2001, whilst working in the African Great Lakes, she was the victim of a rebel hostage situation. Tambajang joined the United Democratic Party (UDP) in April 2015, during the Fass stand-off with security forces. Tambajang was a senior member of Coalition 2016, the alliance of political opposition parties that supported Barrow in the 2016 presidential election, and she also served as its chair. Following President Yahya Jammeh's defeat in the election, Tambajang declared that Jammeh would be prosecuted within a year. She also announced the creation of a national commission for asset recovery in order to reclaim what had allegedly been lost through corruption during Jammeh's tenure. On Jammeh, she told The Guardian that \\"He can't leave. If he leaves, he's going to escape us.\\" Process of appointment to the Vice-Presidency  Following Barrow's inauguration on 19 January 2017, on 23 January it was announced that Tambajang would serve as his Vice-President. However, after her selection, it was suggested that she was constitutionally ineligible to take on the role. This was because section 62(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Gambia states that the Vice-President must meet the same age requirement as the President, establishing a maximum age of 65 at the time of entering the office ‚Äì whereas Tambajang was reported to be 67 at the time of her selection. Following the reports, she was not sworn in immediately to the post, although she disputed the reported age ‚Äì saying she was only 64 years old. Barrow challenged the public to show proof that she was above age 65. In February, she was appointed as Minister of Women's Affairs, with oversight of the vice-president's office. On 28 February 2017, the National Assembly tried to approve a change to the constitution to eliminate the age limit. However, Halifa Sallah, the spokesman for the transitional government and an advisor to President Barrow, said that the proper procedure had not been followed for amending the constitution, and that the action needed to be revisited and such a change would take an additional several months to properly accomplish (according to section 226 of the constitution). Section 62 was amended by National Assembly of the Gambia on 25 July with the presidential age-limit being removed. Her appointment as Vice-President was confirmed by the President on 8 September and after finalization of her appointment, she was expected to be sworn-in. President Barrow announced officially appointing her as Vice-President on 9 November.  Vice-Presidency  Tambajang was awarded 'New African Woman of the Year Award' by New African Woman Magazine in April 2017. In March 2017, Tambajang joined the Crans Montana African Women's Forum Honorary Committee. During a cabinet reshuffle on 29 June 2018, Tambajang was redeployed to the foreign service.  Personal life  Tambajang is from the Fula ethnic group and resides in Kanifing District. She is the mother of eight children.

The album's concept revolves philosophically and structurally on how technology that can be used meaningfully is often used less usefully for commerce and, as a result, how the technology may eventually end up subverting humanness. The record landed at number seven on Tiny Mix Tapes' year-end list of the best albums of 2016. Composition and concept Human Story 3 conceptually and, by its ambiguous narrative, revolves around a \\"smart planet\\" where service robots, performed by text-to-speech voices, attempt to cognitively interpret the world around them but are at the same time musically shown as still performing repetitive tasks. The aim and moral of the record is that while technology can do a lot of commands that are beneficial, it ends up only being used less usefully for commerce and, as a result, the technology may eventually end up subverting humanness.Gaca, Anna (August 18, 2016). \\"A Conversation With James Ferraro, Critical Futurist\\". Spin. SpinMedia. Retrieved January 22, 2017. The word salads in the titles of cuts such as \\"Immanent Cloud,\\" \\"Security Broker,\\" or \\"Plastic Ocean\\" cause the meaning of symbols to be changed, much like how marketers alter the meaning of some objects to create what Ferraro described as strange and \\"contradictory\\" products.Grunenberg, Robert. \\"James Ferraro and Mall Aesthetics\\". SSense. Retrieved January 23, 2017. The text-to-speech voices often display slight mispronunciations, which give the album a surrealistic feel regarding how technology sometimes fails to replicate human cognition. As Ferraro said, \\"Certain newer apps tend to bring people together ‚Äì in a mechanical, artificial way ‚Äì in shared space. I think that‚Äôs probably the trend, post- this hyper-individual era. So it‚Äôs obviously going to be unnatural if it‚Äôs being manipulated through a third party like that‚Äîa bit alien.\\" Human Story 3 follows several text-to-speech characters, male and female voices, that repeat brand names, buzzwords and phrases like \\"IKEA,\\" \\"GPS,\\" \\"Starbucks,\\" \\"market crash,\\" \\"mobile payments,\\" \\"FedEx,\\" \\"smart car\\" and \\"latte\\" at musical swells and crescendos, along with detailed speeches.

Pitchfork. Conde Nast. Retrieved January 23, 2017. The name of Human Story 3 is a play on the title of the Pixar film Toy Story 3 (2010). Ferraro named the album, given that the company's works were the \\"mimesis of our reality.\\" He said, \\"we aggressively celebrate Pixar's cloud-like performance of human emotion, building emotional relationships with CGI characters and accepting them as powerful vehicles of meaningfulness. I personally see them as a marker of the hyper-individualistic age we live in.\\" The instrumental backing often moves into separated moods, repetitive structures and pauses throughout each song, along with abrupt key changes which signify dissonance.Cook-Wilson, Winston (August 17, 2016). \\"James Ferraro‚Äôs Neo-Classical, GPS-Obsessed Americana\\". Bandcamp Daily. Retrieved January 23, 2017. Musically, Human Story 3 is a modern classical album that returns to the commercial-like, overloaded vaporwave style of Ferraro's Far Side Virtual (2011), only sounding more 'clean' and less focused on pop structures. Most of the digitally made textures and clanging synthesizer sounds on the album blend in with organic instruments such as strings, woodwinds, pianos and professionally recorded real-life choirs. The choral vocals were performed by the Trojans choir of the University of Southern California. Ferraro's biggest reference point for Human Story 3 was 20th century American composer Aaron Copland. Ferraro described Copland as \\"the purest musical spirit,\\" reasoning that \\"his music wasn‚Äôt just appealing to the common denominator‚Äîit‚Äôs pandering toward their higher mind. He does that really well: just bringing in all of humanity. It represented something really, really virtuous for me.\\" Ferraro was also influenced by the works of Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie and Charles Ives in composing Human Story 3. Anna Gaca of Spin magazine compared Human Story 3's feel to that of the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner (1982), where the record's futuristic mood comes from how some of its parts are exaggerated or emotionally amplified. Release and promotion Human Story 3 was announced on May 18, 2016, with a trailer and Ferraro summarizing the album on Twitter as \\"a musing on hyper individualism and the marketability of neotenous plastics.\\"Bowe, Miles (May 18, 2016). \\"James Ferraro announces new album Human Story 3\\".

The Syrian National Coalition uses the Pan- Arab colors of a five-pointed star with the words in Arabic on the bottom: National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces.

History Since the declaration of the Syrian Republic on 14 May 1930, Syria has had several coats of arms, albeit fairly consistent in composition - a supporter (often the Hawk of Quraish) bearing a shield, with the official Arabic name of the territory on a scroll beneath. During Syria's union with Egypt in the United Arab Republic (UAR) between 1958 and 1961, the pan-Arab Eagle of Saladin was used as the basis of the coat of arms. Though Syria withdrew from the union in 1961, Egypt continued to use the official name, flag, and coat of arms of the UAR until 1971. Syria reverted to the coat of arms used before the UAR, inverting the colours of the mullets and the orle two years later. During the period of the Federation of Arab Republics between 1972 and 1977, a loose association of Egypt, Libya, and Syria, the Hawk of Quraish was used as the coat of arms. After the end of the union, all three former member states retained the Hawk of Quraish. Egypt finally reverted to the Eagle of Saladin in 1984, which had served as the coat of arms of both Egypt and Libya prior to the abortive union, and which still serves as the basis of the arms of Egypt, Iraq, and Palestine. Syria continued to use the Hawk of Quraish, as did Libya under Gaddafi (although the Libyan version faced to the dexter rather than to the sinister, as in the Syrian version).

His position survived the French Revolution.  Life  He was born at Versailles (Seine-et-Oise) on 9 February 1762. He was a high official in the war office before the Revolution, and under the Republic he eventually became secretary-general for foreign affairs. That he was not denounced under the Reign of Terror was due to the fact that he was indispensable in his department. In 1795 he was sent as French envoy to Florence, then to Rome, and on his return to Florence received orders to proceed to Corsica, which, after its evacuation by the British, was in a state of anarchy. In Corsica he allied himself with Joseph Bonaparte, and after pacifying the island returned to Italy. Recalled by the Directory in 1798 because of his refusal to foment insurrection in Italy, he spent some time in retirement, but he was in the diplomatic service in the Netherlands at the revolution of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799). Under the Consulate he was secretary-general at the ministry of war, and a member of the council of state, and was sent on a second mission (1801‚Äì1802) for the pacification of Corsica. In 1806 he joined Joseph Bonaparte in Naples as minister of the interior, afterwards following him to Spain as Comptroller of the household, but he returned to France in the retreat of 1813. Next year he was created comte de M√©lito, and during the Hundred Days he served as Commissary extraordinary with the XII. Army division. He took no part in politics after Waterloo, where his son-in-law, General J. B. Jamin, was killed, and his own son mortally wounded. He visited Joseph Bonaparte in America in 1825, and then spent some years in Germany with his daughter, whose second husband, General von Fleischmann, represented the king of W√ºrttemberg in Paris in 1831. He was admitted in 1835 to the French Academy on the merits of his translations of Herodotus (Paris, 1822) and Diodorus (Paris, 1835-1838). He died in Paris on 5 January 1841. Miot de M√©lito had kept a diary, arranged for publication by his son-in-law, General von Fleischmann, which covers the years from 1788 to 1815, and is of interest for the history of the Bonaparte family and of Joseph's dominion in Spain. Published in France in 1858, it was translated into English by Mrs C. Hoey and J. Lillie (2 vols., 1881); and also into German (Stuttgart, 1866-1867) (see Albert Gaudin, Les Arr√©t√©s Miot; Ajaccio, 1896).

Early life  Bornstein- Lazar was born and grew up in Ein Ganim, studied at Ahad HaAm High School in Petah Tikva, and later studied at the Teachers' College in Givat HaShlosha. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, she served in a military band and was a teacher at Gordon School in Petah Tikva.  Career  In 1950, Bornstein-Lazar began a literary career. From that year on, she published hundreds of stories for infants for the majority of children's newspapers in Israel, which were later compiled into numerous books. In 1955, Bornstein-Lazar won the Yatziv Award for her literary work. Additionally, she began publishing a series of story compilations about the Jewish holiday periods. Bornstein-Lazar's first story was published in Davar LiLadim on February 2, 1951.

In 1957, Bornstein- Lazar began publishing her famous books about Kofiko and Chipopo, following the adventures of the two monkeys (Kofiko in Israel, Chipopo abroad). Both series have spanned dozens of books and were hugely successful in Israel. The books were met with negative reception from certain educators and literary critics due to what they referred to as \\"low-level writing\\". Since 1965, she wrote another children's book series about an American child named Charlie Letch and his adventures in Israel. In 1969, she began writing a series titled The Adventures of Suliman and Danny, about two friends (Danny a Jew, Suliman an Arab). Bornstein-Lazar was married to Shlomo (Shlomke) and had three daughters: Noga and the twins Odelia and Zahara. The names of her family members are also those of the characters in the Kofiko book series. She wrote one adult book under the pen name \\"B. L.

Since 2010, he has covered a variety of issues and topics in four different continents, leading him to focus his work on the humanitarian cost of conflicts, economics and war. He is known for documenting the war in Syria, the military coup in Egypt, the war in Yemen, and for being the first to bring international audiences proof in pictures of human trafficking and slavery in Libya. Narciso's work has been exhibited in galleries, museums and photo festivals in Europe, Asia, the USA and Mexico. At the Saatchi Gallery in London his exhibition ‚ÄúLibya: a human marketplace\\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/art/narciso_contreras.php ranked the most visited exhibition in photojournalism in the world in 2017, and 3rd in Photography category with more than 520,000 visitors.\\"The Art Newspaper‚Äôs ranking of worldwide exhibitions attendance in 2017\\"  Biography  Narciso Contreras was born on July 1, 1975 in Mexico City. His father, a professor in philosophy, started teaching him from childhood at the age of eight, driving him to study philosophy at a later time at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM ‚ÄìUniversidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico). His interest in documentary cinema lead him to apply to study cinematography, but he was rejected from entering the two most prestigious schools in Mexico after failing the photography test during the selection process of applicants. He went on to study photography at the Active School of Photography (EAF ‚Äì Escuela Activa de Fotografia)https://www.escuelactivadefotografia.net/contact and simultaneously visual anthropology at the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH ‚ÄìEscuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia) in Mexico City. After graduating from photography he began doing non-paid assignments for local newspapers and started publishing his first reports. While studying Hinduism at university, he came into contact with Gaudiya Vaishnava monks. This encounter brought about change in his life with him moving to live in a monastery in Vrindavan, India to continue his studies. While there he photographed spiritual communities in the north and the influence of Maoism on the religious society of Nepal combining both of his most profound interests: photography and philosophy. In 2010, after closing this period and motivated by unfolding events in the region he decided to move to Thailand to the border with Myanmar where he started working on documenting the ethnic war along the tribal areas in the country‚Äôs Karen and Kachin States. This was the beginning of his career as professional photographer. The ethnic war in Myanmar and the separatist strife in the Kashmir region controlled by India were the first stories of conflict he documented. He first joined Zuma Press agency, and then moved to the New York based agency, Polaris Images. In July 2012, Contreras makes his first incursion into the Middle East, covering the war in Syria. His pictures depicting the horrors of the war and the carnage over the civilian population were significant, and in some cases, unforgettable. When covering the war in Syria he started collaborating as stringer with the AP agency, a partnership that ended a year later after a controversy over a doctored photograph was made public. In July 2013, he was assigned to cover the military coup in Egypt for The New York Times among other assignments for different media outlets in the term of the next two years, counting in his records the political upheavals in Istanbul in 2013, the war in Gaza in 2014, and the tribal conflict in Libya in the same year. Aside from photographing some of the major events in the Middle East he also aimed to document under reported yet crucial affairs in the region lifting his camera to photograph in July 2015 one of the most controversial unfolding wars in the region‚Äôs recent history, the entangled war in Yemen. He succeeded to contribute to the documentation of the humanitarian catastrophe in the Arab country being one among a few foreign correspondents to enter since the war started. With support from the Fondation Carmignac, after winning the Carmignac Photojournalism Award in November 2015, Contreras brought to light ‚ÄúLibya: a human marketplace‚Äù, A report that narrates his thoughts and observations as he travelled through the complex tribal society of post-Gaddafi Libya from February to June 2016, photographing the brutal reality of human trafficking. It was the dawn of a long-term project documenting a modern-day slavery issue framed on the trafficking of human beings along the network that stretches from the Niger border with Libya, to the main rescue zone in the Mediterranean Sea, off the Libyan shoreline. It became a cornerstone of his current work focused on migration as part of a life project of photographic documentation based on the world conceived phenomenon of ‚Äúmassive human displacement‚Äù. Contreras works on self-assigned projects as freelance photographer as from the beginning of his career, initially more focused on news stories but more recently veering towards in-depth feature story and documentary-type projects. He received the recognition title of HIPGiverhttps://hiponline.org/teetering- between-advocacy-and-imagery-narciso-contreras/ in 2017 from Hispanics in Philanthropy for his contribution in photography.  Incident with Associated Press  Contreas was sacked by the Associated Press in 2014 for digitally manipulating an image in violation of the AP's rules. He had shared a Pulitzer prize the previous year for his work for the AP in the Syrian conflict. He had digitally altered an image to remove a video camera from the corner of the frame. Contreas said \\"I made a horrible mistake and I accept full responsibility for it.\\" He insisted that he had not altered any other images, and a review by the AP of the nearly 500 photographs he had submitted to them did not reveal any other examples. Contreras brought back in 2016, with the help of the Carmignac Photojournalism Award, a photojournalism grant which supports each year the production of an investigative photographic report on a region of the world where fundamental rights are threatened, the first proofs of slavery in Libya.

In September 2016, President Barack Obama acknowledged Channapha‚Äôs advocacy efforts in Laos, when he became the first U.S. President to visit the country.  Early life  Khamvongsa was born in the Laotian capital of Vientiane. However, as a result of the Laotian Civil War, in 1979, six-year-old Khamvongsa and her family were forced to flee due to political and economic uncertainty. A boat took her family of eight across the Mekong River in pairs, with Khamvongsa and her father waiting until her mother contacted them to confirm that they successfully crossed the border into Thailand. When they did not hear from her mother, Khamvongsa's father decided to have a stranger smuggle Khamvongsa across the border alone. Khamvongsa later found the rest of her family in a refugee camp. Fearing detection by the Thai border patrol, her father attempted to swim across the river. Despite crossing the river, the Thai border patrol detained him and placed him in a holding cell. By chance, a family friend recognized him as he was crossing the river and sent word to Khamvongsa's family of his situation. The friend also knew a supervisor from the refugee camp and after sending someone with money to pay for his release, the eight of them were reunited. In 1980, after a year in the refugee camp, Khamvongsa and her family left for Falls Creek, Virginia. As a child, Khamvongsa knew very little about the Secret War in Laos. For her parents' generation, the trauma they had endured led many to ignore or simply forget their past experiences. Through her own research later in life, Khamvongsa was able to discover her homeland's violent past and how this past was affecting the present.  Education  Khamvongsa received her Bachelor's of Science Degree in Public Administration from George Mason University in 1996. In 2002 she received a master's degree in Public Policy from Georgetown University.  Career   Prior work experience  Before founding Legacies of War, Khamvongsa worked at the Ford Foundation in the Peace and Social Justice Unit, the Center for Public and Nonprofit Leadership at Georgetown University, the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, the Bill and Melinda Gates Millennium Scholars Program, the National Asian Pacific Center on Aging, and at NEO Philanthropy. In 2003, while at the Ford Foundation, she came into contact with John Cavanagh, who had worked closely with Fred Branfman and his book Voices from the Plain of Jars. After discussing their shared connection to Laos, he gave her a binder filled with drawings made by survivors of the bombings in Laos. The drawings, along with personal narratives, had been collected by an American educational adviser and his Laotian colleague in Vientiane refugee camps in 1970 and 1971. The images, made with pencils, pens, markers, and crayons, depicted the horrific experiences of the survivors that shaped their reality. It was through this interaction that Khamvongsa was motivated to start an organization dedicated to advocating for the removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Laos.  Legacies of War  In 2004, Khamvongsa founded Legacies of War, a nonprofit organization fiscally sponsored by NEO Philanthropy, dedicated to bringing attention to UXO awareness, education, and removal in Laos. In 2010, Khamvongsa spoke in front of the House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment, within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, addressing the need for increased funding for the removal of UXO in Laos. In September 2016, Khamvongsa and Legacies of War's efforts were directly acknowledged by President Obama during a visit to Laos, the first such visit by a US President. During a speech at the Lao National Cultural Hall, Obama remarked that \\"for years, she urged the United States to do more to help remove unexploded bombs here in Laos. 'There are many, many problems in this world that might not be able to be solved in a lifetime,' she's said, but this is one we can fix. So, Channapha, we thank you for working to fix this problem.\\" Through Legacies of War's efforts, annual U.S. funding for the removal of UXO in Laos has increased dramatically from $2.7 million to a $30 million commitment for 2016 to 2018. Khamvongsa's efforts through Legacies of War was covered by multiple news sources, such as the New York Times, PBS, and CBS. Legacies of War continues to draw attention to the UXO issue in Laos and ensure that the UXO sector in Laos gets the funding needed to make Laos safe again from millions of leftover bomblets. The goal is to reduce the annual number of casualties of UXO in Laos to zero.  Honors and awards  Recipient of the Georgetown McCourt Distinguished Alumni Award, recognizing a record of outstanding accomplishments within their chosen profession or demonstrated service to the McCourt and GPPI community. Channapha was the Keynote speaker at 2017 Laotian American Scholarship Foundation, the 2016 Lao-American Writer's Summit, and at the 2016 Laotian American Society.

She was convicted at age 20 of murder in the second degree and two counts of kidnapping in the first degree for her role in the kidnapping, rape, torture, and murder of New York businessman Thomas Vigliarolo in 1985. Sentenced to 25 years to life, Hylton was paroled in 2012 after serving more than 26 years. Following her time in prison, Hylton earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in behavioral science and a master‚Äôs degree in English from Mercy College, and now works as an activist, public speaker, and community health advocate for Mt. Sinai St. Luke‚Äôs. She is the author of the memoir A Little Piece of Light. Biography Early life In her memoir, A Little Piece of Light (2018), Hylton characterized the first 20 years of her life as \\"adult hands harming me instead of protecting me.\\" During early childhood, Donna Patricia Walden lived in her birthplace of Port Antonio, Jamaica, with her mother, a devotee of Obeah, a spiritual practice of the West Indies. Hylton felt that her mother, who may have been bipolar, used her as a \\"real-life voodoo doll,\\" and recalled, \\"It was routine for her to burn me with fire and cut me with a knife.\\" In June 1972, four months before Hylton's eighth birthday, her mother exchanged her for \\"a handful of money\\" from a childless couple, Roy and Daphne Hylton, who took the girl to live with them in New York City, where she acquired her adoptive surname. Two years later, when she was 9, Donna claims Roy Hylton began to sexually abuse her on a regular basis. During the summer of 1979, at age 14, she was allegedly sexually abused by her math tutor, a married man. Later that summer, she ran away to Philadelphia with a man who lived in an upstairs apartment with his mother. Ten years older than Hylton, she claimed he raped her in a motel room. \\"Whatever part of me wasn't broken,\\" she recollects, \\"is broken now.\\" They remained together in Philadelphia for five months. \\"Sometimes, after he rapes me, he sits against the wall and orders me to crawl around the apartment on my hands and knees, like a dog. He stands up and urinates on my skin; he pushes the glowing tip of a cigarette against my bare leg.\\" When he beat her, he said: \\"I'm a man, and I do what I want.\\" In January 1980, they returned to New York, where Hylton discovered she was pregnant. Stunned at the news, Hylton claims the man responded, \\"No wonder you're pregnant, you're a whore!\\" She then claims he knocked her down and raped her. In February 1981, at age 16, Hylton gave birth to a daughter. In the summer of 1981, Hylton claimed she was abducted by an older man whose previous advances she had rebuffed. She claimed he locked her inside a bedroom closet, after which he was joined by another man. When they pulled her out of the closet, Hylton recognized the second man as a minister at a nearby church. The two men allegedly took turns raping her, then shoved her back in the closet, where she remained for three days. Once released, Hylton reported the crime to the police. She claims one of the responding detectives drove her to an unfamiliar location and raped her. In 1982, at age 18, Hylton married a 19-year-old rapper. When she learned that she was pregnant again, the rapper and his mother talked her into terminating the pregnancy. Following her abortion, he asked for a divorce. In 1984, Hylton went to work at a hotel gift shop in Times Square. In January 1985, a recently hired coworker introduced Hylton to the coworker's godfather, a man named Louis Miranda. In March 1985, Miranda enlisted Hylton in a scheme to recover money he believed had been swindled from him by a business partner. Murder of Thomas Vigliarolo On March 20, 1985, Donna Hylton and three female accomplices drugged and kidnapped 62-year-old Long Island real estate broker Thomas Vigliarolo at the behest of Louis Miranda, who thought Vigliarolo had cheated him out of $139,000 on a mutual con in which the two allegedly sold shares in New York City condos and pocketed the money. The kidnappers held Vigliarolo prisoner for 15‚Äì20 days. During that time, three men and four women, including Hylton, starved, burned, beat, sexually assaulted/raped, and tortured him. On April 5, 1985, with Hylton asleep in the next room, Vigliarolo died of asphyxiation. Three days later, his body was found locked in a trunk in a Manhattan apartment. Trial Delivering a ransom note and tape to a friend of Vigliarolo, who got a partial license plate number of the car she was driving, led to Hylton's capture by police. At her trial, which began in February 1986, Hylton's legal defense was duress and coercion, arguing that she had been put into a position with imminent threat and participated only due to that threat. She said that Louis Miranda threatened to kill her then 4-year-old daughter if Hylton did not cooperate. On March 12, 1986, a jury convicted Hylton of second degree murder and two counts of first- degree kidnapping. Hylton was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate prison terms of 25 years to life. Appeals In January 1991, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division rejected Hylton's challenges relating to duress and found her other arguments \\"unpersuasive and meritless,\\" noting that she had made an \\"elaborate confession, which was corroborated by ample evidence.\\" In April 2007, Hylton appealed to federal court to vacate her conviction because (1) her Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated, (2) she received ineffective assistance of counsel in both the trial and state appellate proceedings, and (3) judicial impropriety and bias deprived her of her constitutional right to a fair trial. In November, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Hylton's petition for habeas corpus was untimely on its face, having been filed ten years after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 imposing a one-year statute of limitations. Consequently, the court dismissed her case without addressing Hylton's claims of judicial impropriety and bias and ineffectiveness of trial and appellate counsel. Prison Hylton's involvement in the high-profile case was the subject of a 1995 article in Psychology Today magazine written by Jill Neimark. While an inmate, Hylton earned a bachelor of science degree in the behavioral sciences from Mercy College (1994) and a master's degree in women's studies and English literature from Marymount Manhattan College (2003). In 2011, she was ordained as a Christian minister. On January 17, 2012, after serving nearly 27 years in Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, Hylton was paroled.  Post- prison  Following her release, Hylton has advocated for the \\"humanitarian\\" release of aging prisoners. In 2016 it was announced that Rosario Dawson was attached to a movie version of Hylton's life story, A Little Piece of Light. The film is in development, in search of a screenwriter and director. In January 2017, Hylton was a featured speaker at the Women's March on Washington. During the speech, she refers to herself as ‚Äúinmate #86G0206,‚Äù and spoke about issues facing women who are in prison. In her memoir, A Little Piece of Light: A Memoir of Hope, Prison, and a Life Unbound, published in June 2018, Hylton expressed sympathy for her victim, a husband and father. \\"Even now,\\" she writes, \\"half a decade after leaving prison, not a day goes by that I don't think about Mr. Vigliarolo. Not a day goes by that I don't think of his family, the fear they must have felt as they imagined him in fear, wondering where he was for eleven nights and worried for what he might have been experiencing.‚Äù On August 20, 2020, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) included Hylton in a list of 22 of \\"America's most impactful community leaders\\" who participated in a video reading of the Preamble to the Constitution during a televised portion of the convention.\\" References External links * 1964 births Living people Jamaican emigrants to the United States American people convicted of murder American feminists Mercy College (New York) alumni American female murderers American kidnappers People convicted of murder by New York (state) People from Port Antonio ","title":"Donna Hylton"},{"id":"52962294","text":"Grant Roden (born 29 February 1980) is an Australian cricketer.

It is estimated that 5,000 Croats live in Venezuela. History Croatian immigration to Venezuela dates back to the late nineteenth century, and was characterized by the individual arrival of merchant seamen. Until World War I, a few number of Croats settle in Venezuela, nevertheless it is in the period of the World War II when the Croatian families that escaped from the government of Tito begin to settle in the country. Most of these immigrants came from present-day Croatian territory, particularly from the coastal and inland areas of Dalmatia. Others came from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Included are Istro- Romanians, who became adjusted to Venezuelan society because of the linguistic similarities between Istro-Romanian and Spanish, as well as Latin identity of Istro-Romanians. Status of Croats in Venezuela In 1949 came the initiative to create the Asociaci√≥n Croata Venezolana (Croatian Association of Venezuela), entity that was transformed in 1972 in the Centro Croata Venezolano (Venezuelan Croatian Center). The Comit√© Croata de Venezuela (Croatian Committee of Venezuela) had been operating in Caracas since 1958. Its purpose was to support the transformation of Croatia into an independent and democratic state. The installation of the Hogar Croata (Croatian Home) in 1962 at its headquarters in Chacao was of major importance. Celebration of cultural and social events and the organization of sporting events. La Sociedad de Damas Croatas (Croatian Women Society) was established in 1968 and the Venezuela-Croatia Economic Chamber (Camara Venezolano ‚Äì Croata de Industria y Comercio ‚Äì Cavecro) established in 1997. The majority of the members of the Croatian community settled in Caracas and Valencia and, to a lesser extent, in other cities of the interior: Maracay, Maracaibo, M√©rida and in localities of the Yaracuy state, where some joined the work in the sugar industry. Also, several forest technicians arrived that later contributed to the establishment of the School of Forestry Engineering at the University of the Andes. A large percentage of the Croatians were artisans, who later became small entrepreneurs, and many were professionals, especially engineers and technicians, who had outstanding performance in Venezuela.http://www.venmundo.com/venezolanos-en-croacia-alzan-la-voz-por- venezuela/ Notable Croatian Venezuelans * Augustin Augustinoviƒá, Franciscan missioner, writer. * Branko Benzon, physician, diplomat and politician. * Andras Jos√© Kalnay- relativistic physicist. * Tatiana Blatnik, Princess of Greece and Denmark. * Laura Furƒçiƒá, journalist and TV Host. * Gabriela Elena ≈†paniƒá, actress known for her roles in several Latin telenovelas. * Dani ≈†paniƒá, model, actress and TV Host. * Milka Chulina, actress, model and Miss Venezuela 1992 winner, second runner-up at Miss Universe 1993 and Top 15 semifinalist at Miss International 1994. * Luis Luk≈°iƒá, Bolivian poet and painter. *Zdenko Moroviƒá, footballer. * Maja Poljak, Jewish social activist and photographer. * Tomislav Juriƒá, painter. * Seka Severin de Tudja, sculptor. * Miguel ≈†oƒçoloviƒá, major league baseball player. * Du≈°an ≈Ωanko, writer and the intendant of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb from 1941 to 1943. * Slavko ≈Ωupƒçiƒá, psychiatrist and writer. * Ernesto Villegas, journalist, politician, and writer. * Vladimir Villegas, journalist and politician, and news director of Globovisi√≥n.

The bridge carried Route 66 over Canyon Diablo. The ghost town of Two Guns, once a prosperous tourist stop, is near the east end of the bridge. History and design Deteriorating condition of Canyon Diablo Bridge in 2018 As white settlers populated the area in the mid-1800s, the Two Guns location was recognized as a favorable place to cross the formidable Canyon Diablo; first by wagon, then later by vehicle. Travelers would follow paths which zig-zagged the canyon's embankments, and then cross the usually-dry riverbed. In 1914, Canyon Padre Bridge was opened west of Two Guns. That same year, Arizona State engineer Lamar Cobb selected and surveyed the Two Guns location for the construction of a bridge across Canyon Diablo. Plans and specifications were purchased for $500 from the Topeka Bridge & Iron Co., who designed a standard Luten arch bridge with a cantilevered roadway, similar in design to the bridge across Canyon Padre. Water occasionally flowed through Canyon Diablo, and the volatile nature of those flows was reflected in the design of the bridge's concrete parapet walls; the upstream wall was solid to protect the roadway from floodwaters, while the downstream wall was pierced with slots. The construction contract was awarded late in 1914 to the lowest bidder for $9000, Thomas Haddock of Williams, Arizona, who used concrete and reinforcing steel supplied by the state to erect the bridge that winter. On March 17, 1915, Canyon Diablo Bridge opened. The bridge was at first part of the National Old Trails Road (known as the Santa Fe Highway in Arizona), which in 1926 became part of U.S. Route 66. The bridge was used until a new bridge was erected just north of Canyon Diablo Bridge in 1938, after which Route 66 followed Interstate 40 at the Two Guns location. The Canyon Diablo Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

Trump complaint Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Trump is a case pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), hotel and restaurant owner Eric Goode, an association of restaurants known as ROC United, and an Embassy Row hotel event booker named Jill Phaneuf allege that the defendant, President Donald Trump, is in violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause, a constitutional provision that bars the president or any other federal official from taking gifts or payments from foreign governments. CREW filed its complaint on January 23, 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated as president. An amended complaint, adding the hotel and restaurant industry plaintiffs, was filed on April 18, 2017. A second amended complaint was filed on May 10, 2017.

Two other Emolument Clause lawsuits against Trump are pending in other judicial districts. Background Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington stated that because Trump-owned buildings take in rent, room rentals and other payments from foreign governments, the president has breached the Foreign Emoluments Clause. The Constitution says that \\"no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under the United States, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\\" The case also includes a claim under the Domestic Emoluments Clause. An Emoluments Clause lawsuit directed at a sitting President has never been tested in court, and there is little judicial precedent in this area of constitutional law. The Clause is, however, the subject of a considerable body of precedent from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and the Office of the Comptroller General. The plaintiffs are asking for an injunction and declaratory judgment directed at President Trump requiring that he cease violations of the Emoluments Clauses. On January 23, 2017, after the action was filed in U.S. District Court, Trump rejected the arguments underlying the lawsuit as \\"Without merit,\\" and \\"Totally without merit\\" during his morning press conference at the White House. CREW is represented in the suit by \\"a group former White House ethics lawyers, constitutional scholars, and Supreme Court litigators,\\" including constitutional law professor Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School; Supreme Court litigator Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler PLLC; Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law; Richard Painter, law professor at the University of Minnesota and chief ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration; and Zephyr Teachout of Fordham Law School. The United States Department of Justice represents Trump. Quotes from second amended complaint District court proceedings President Trump filed a motion to dismiss on June 9, 2017. on the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right to sue and that the described conduct was not illegal. A response to the motion to dismiss was filed on August 4, 2017, with a DOJ reply due by September 22, 2017. A full answer from DOJ lawyers to the facts alleged in the complaint was due on August 11, 2017. Oral arguments were expected October 18, 2017. On December 21, 2017, the motion to dismiss was granted; Judge George B. Daniels held that plaintiffs lacked standing.

The present building was built between 1820 and 1824 by Wilhelm von Humboldt to designs by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. It still belongs to the Heinz family, descendants of Wilhelm. It houses the private Humboldt-Museum, open to guided tours during the summer.Humboldt-Museum im Schloss Tegel  History  Originally built as a Renaissance mansion in 1558, it was converted to a hunting lodge by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. As part of the Tegel estate, it passed to the Humboldt family by marriage in 1766 and became their family seat - Alexander and Wilhelm lived there several years. After their mother Marie-Elisabeth von Humboldt's death, Wilhelm took over the estate in 1797 and had the schloss rebuilt in the classical style between 1820 and 1824 by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Wilhelm's daughter Gabriele later inherited it - she married the Prussian foreign minister Heinrich von B√ºlow and after her death it passed to their daughter Constanze von Heinz, whose descendants still own it. Schloss Tegel between 1857 and 1883 The park was originally designed between 1777 and 1789 by Gottlob Johann Christian Kunth, the Humboldts' tutor. From 1802 it was further developed by Wilhelm to designs by Peter Joseph Lenn√©. The park was listed as a 'Denkmalschutz' (monument treasure) in 1983. On its western side, near Lake Tegel, is the 'Dicke Marie', an oak named after their cook by the Humboldts - it is sometimes dated at 800 years old. There are also 7.8 m deep lakes near the house itself.https://www.monumentale-eichen.de/berlin/tegel/ The park also contains Wilhelm's wife's tomb monument in the park in 1829, on a site chosen by her - it consists of a high granite column topped by a statue of the Roman goddess Spes by Bertel Thorvaldsen, favoured by Caroline and bought by Wilhelm after her death. Wilhelm and Alexander were also buried nearby, as were Caroline and Wilhelm's children and descendants up to the present day, beneath uniformly designed unornamented tombstones and rows of flat grave mounds. The column is framed from behind by a stone bench or exedra, simpler than Schinkel's usual style.

The meat of this crab is toxic, even if cooked, and consumption often results in death. Description Atergatis floridus has an oval, relatively narrow carapace which has a smooth surface and smooth margins. The carapace is greenish or greenish-blue-brown and is marked with a pattern which resembles lace and is made up of a fine network of fine white or yellow lines white, resembling a shawl. It has large claws which are equal sizes and which are smooth with black spoon-shaped tips and which may be larger in males than females. The pereiopods are squarish in shape and quite thick with lilac edges and lack hair. The width of the carapace is 8‚Äì10 cm. The carapace is approximately 1.4 times broader than it is long. Distribution Atergatis floridus occurs in the eastern Indian Ocean from south east Asia, south to Australia where it reaches Rottnest Island in Western Australia and possibly Sydney in the east, its range extends eastwards across the western pacific as far as Hawaii. Biology Atergatis floridus is an inhabitant of the neritic zone and prefers coral and rubble. It is largely nocturnal. A. floridus is host to the isopod Gigantione hainanensis and the rhizocephalan barnacles Loxothylacus aristatus, Loxothylacus corculum, Sacculina gordonae, Sacculina robusta, Sacculina spinosa and Sacculina weberi. Toxicity The meat of Atergatis floridus, like that of many related crab species from the family Xanthidae is toxic. The toxins are synthesised by bacteria of the genus Vibrio which live in symbiosis with the crab and the poisons are one similar to those found in puffer fish, i.e. tetrodotoxin, and also saxitoxin which is the primary toxin involved in paralytic shellfish poisoning. Taxonomy Atergatis floridus was considered to have a wide Indo-Pacific distribution but some authorities consider that the western Indian Ocean specimens belong to a different species, Atergatis ocryoe, which was considered a junior synonym of A. floridus. A. floridus sensu stricto is found in the eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.

Evolutionary developmental biology is the study of the evolution of developmental processes across different organisms. It is utilized within multiple disciplines, primarily evolutionary biology and anthropology. Groundwork for the theory that \\"evolutionary modifications in primate development might have led to ‚Ä¶ modern humans\\" was laid by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Ernst Haeckel, Louis Bolk, and Adolph Schultz. Evolutionary developmental biology is primarily concerned with the ways in which evolution affects development, and seeks to unravel the causes of evolutionary innovations. The approach is relatively new, but has roots in Schultz's The physical distinctions of man, from the 1940s. Shultz urged broad comparative studies to identify uniquely human traits.  History  Brian Hall traces the roots of evolutionary developmental biology in his 2012 paper on its past present and future. He begins with Darwinian evolution and Mendel's genetics, noting the tendency of the followers of both men in the early 20th century to follow separate paths and to set aside and ignore apparently inexplicable problems. Greater understanding of genotypic and phenotypic structures from the 1940s enabled the unification of evolution and genetics in the modern synthesis. Molecular biology then enabled researchers to explore the mechanisms and evolution of embryonic development in molecular detail, including in humans.  Human and primate development  Many of the human evolutionary developmental biology studies have been modeled after primate studies and consider the two together in a comparative model. Brain ontogeny and human life history evolution were looked at by Leigh, in a 2006 paper. He compares brain growth patterns for Homo erectus and Homo sapiens to get at the evolution of brain size and weight. Leigh found three different patterns, all of which pointed to the growth rate of H. erectus either matching or exceeding H. erectus. He makes the case that this finding had wide application and relevance t the overall study of human evolution. It is pertinent specifically to the connections between energy expenditure and brain development. These finding are of specific utility in studies on maternal energy expenditure. Comparative study of nonhuman primates, fossils and modern humans to study patterns of brain growth to correlate human life history and brain growth. Jeremy De Silva and Julie Lesnik examined chimpanzee neonatal brain size to identify implications for brain growth in Homo erectus. This changed the understanding of differences and similarities of post-natal brain growth in humans and chimpanzees. The study found that there was a distinction necessary between growth time and growth rate.The times of growth were strikingly similar, but the rates were not. The paper further advocates the use of fossils to assess brain size in general and in relation to cranial capacity. Utilization of endocranial volume as a measure for brain size has been a popular methodology with the fossil record since Darwin in the mid 1800s. This measure has been used to access the metabolic requirements for brain growth and the subsequent trade-offs.  Neoteny  Some of the work on human evolutionary developmental biology has centered around the neotenous features that present in humans, but are not shared across the primate spectrum. Steven J. Gould discussed the presentation of neoteny with \\"terminal additions\\" in humans. Neoteny is defined as the delayed or slowed development in humans when compared with their non-human primate counterparts. The \\"terminal additions\\" were extensions or reductions in the rate and scope of stages of development and growth. Gould hypothesized that this process and production of neoteny in humans might be the key feature that ultimately lead to the emotional and communicative nature of humans. He credits this factor as an integral facet of human evolution. However, there have also been cautions against the application of this aspect to group ranking during it inappropriate as a measure of evolutionary achievement.  Fossil record  Early comparative and human studies examined the fossil record to measure features like cranial sizes and capacities so as to infer brain size, growth rate, total growth and potential implications for energy expenditure. Helpful as this is, the static nature of individual fossils presents its own challenge. The phylogenic fossil line is itself a hypothesis, so anything based upon it is equally hypothetical. Using the fossil record of Neanderthals, modern humans, and chimpanzees, Gunz et al. examined that patterns of endocranial development. They found that there are common features shared between the three, and that modern humans diverge from these common patterns in the first year of life. They concluded that even though much of the developmental results are similar insofar as brain size, the trajectories by which they arrived are not shared. Most of the differences between the two arise post-natally, in the first year, with cognitive development. There have been a number of studies that not only take incomplete fossil records into consideration, but have attempt to specifically identify the barriers presented by this condition. For example, Kieran McNulty covers the potential utilities and constraints of using incomplete fossil taxa to examine longitudinal development in Australopithecus africanis. Many studies on development have been human-specific. In his 2011 paper, Bernard Crespi focused on adaptation and genomic conflict in childhood diseases. He considers the evolution of childhood diseases and their risk levels, and finds that both risk and disease have evolved. Hotchberg and Belsky incorporate a life-history perspective, looking at adolescence. Substantial variation in phenotypic paths and presentations suggest significant environmental influence. They focus on plasticity between stages of development and the factors that shape it. Rate of maturation, fecundity, and fertility were all impacted by environmental circumstances. They argue that early maturation can be positive, reflecting opportunistic actions within specific conditions.  Genetic and epigenetic basis  Technological advances that have allowed better and better access to the growth of the human form in utero have proven particularly formative in studies involving focus on genetic and epigenetic development. Bakker et al. look at the interconnected nature of developmental processes and attempt to use fetal vertebral abnormalities as an indicator for other malformations. They found that the origin of the cells was not nearly as highly correlated as the observed developmental signals. In utero development and malformations were correlated in severity. Freiston and Galis look at the development of ribs, digits, and mammalian asymmetry. They argue that this construction is relevant for the study of disease, the consistency in evolution of body plans, and understanding of developmental constraints. Sexual dimorphism in prenatal digit ratio was found as early as 14 weeks and was maintained whether or not the fleshy finger part was included.  Language and cognitive studies  Languages and cognitive function have also been subjects of evolutionary studies. Insofar as language and evolutionary developmental biology, there is tension from the gate. Much of this contention has centered around whether to view and study language as an adaptation in and of its self, or as a by- product of other adaptations. Jackendoff and Pinker have argued for language as an adaptation owing to the interdependent social nature of humans. To support these claims, he points to things like the bi-directionality in language usage and comprehension. This is a counter to the claims by theorists like Noam Chomsky, who argued against language as a human specific adaptation. Adaptation and adaptive theory has been argued even separate from its utility in the study of language. Gould and Lewontin engage with what they saw as flaws in adaptive theory using the analogy of the spandrels of San Marco. Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially. This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition. This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way. Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of \\"neutral computation and mammalian brain development\\". It may be more useful to consider specific components of neural computation and development, what has been selected for, and to what end. Ploeger and Galis tackled modular evolvability and developmental constraints in human and other primate evolutionary trajectories. They argue that these should be treated with an interdisciplinary approach across the cognitive sciences.

Each cargo tank is kept full at all times so oil floating on water will be pressed against the top of the tank. A cargo tank initially filled with water is loaded with the desired quantity of oil by pumping oil into the top of the tank displacing water which overflows through an opening at the bottom of the tank. The cargo tank is unloaded by removing oil from the top of the tank as water is admitted at the bottom. Theory Hydraulic tanker design bases:Morrell (1931) p. 305 * Oil is lighter than water. * Oil and water will not mix in a full tank. * Water is an inexpensively available hydraulic fluid. * Absence of air space prevents formation of explosive gas mixtures. Advantages Oil pumps located on an upper deck avoid dangerous volatile hydrocarbon accumulations in pump rooms near the bottom of a ship. Ship stability is improved by eliminating free surface in partially filled tanks.Manning (1930) pp. 47‚Äì49 Ship structural stresses are reduced by eliminating dynamic loading caused by sloshing of fluids in partially filled tanks. Avoiding exposure to atmospheric oxygen reduces corrosion within the tank, and reduces hardening of residual crude oil deposits remaining after unloading.Morrell (1931) p. 306 Disadvantages The hydraulic system is ineffective with heavy or viscous oils and not recommended for greater than 15-degree Baum√©. Heating coils must be placed near the top of tanks, where they are less efficient.Morrell (1931) p. 337 An hydraulic tanker requires a larger volume of void space for buoyancy than conventionally loaded tanks, because the empty, or ballasted, condition of tanks filled with water is heavier than the loaded condition of tanks filled with oil. A heavier ballasted condition may also increase round trip fuel consumption.Morrell (1931) pp. 307‚Äì312 Many petroleum compounds have limited solubility in water. Low solubility is typically of negligible concern with respect to product loss, but toxic petroleum products may be regarded as pollution in the water displaced as a tank is loaded with petroleum. The latter disadvantage may be insignificant where navigable waters contain elevated background levels of petroleum products; and the advantages make hydraulic tankers useful oil spill recovery ships when their storage tanks may act as oil‚Äìwater separators.

Such warfare may be part of economic warfare and cyberwarfare. In fiction In the science fiction genre of cyberpunk corporations guard their data and hire individuals to break into computer systems of their competitors. In the genre pioneered by William Gibson, power is largely in the hands of megacorporations which often maintain their own private armies and security forces and wage corporate warfare against each other. Cyber According to Schwartau in corporate information warfare companies are targeted, typically by their competitors. Such warfare may include methods of industrial espionage, spreading disinformation, leaking confidential information and damaging a company's information systems. Chris Rouland of the cybersecurity & cyberarms company Endgame, Inc. controversially advocated that private companies should be allowed to \\"hack back\\" against nations or criminals trying to steal their data. After a wave of high-profile attacks against US companies and government databases a panel of experts assembled by the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security said policies should be eased to allow \\"active defense\\" measures to deter hackers and did not recommend hacking back \\"because [they] don't want the cure to be worse than the disease\\". Relevantly on the February 2017 RSA Conference Microsoft President Brad Smith stated that technology companies need to preserve trust and stability online by pledging neutrality in cyber conflict. The dramatic increase in the use of the Internet for business purposes has exposed private entities to greater risks for cyber-attacks. Garcia and Horowitz propose a game theoretic approach which considers economic motivations for investment in Internet security and investigate a scenario in which firms plan for long-term security investment by considering the likelihood of cyber-attacks. Botnets may be used to knock business competitors off line. They can be hired by corporations to disrupt the operation of competitors on the networks. Low-grade corporate warfare is constantly being waged between technology giants by \\"patent trolls, insider blogs and corporate talking points\\". Supply chain attacks in corporate warfare can be called supply chain interdiction. The term may also refer to the privatization of warfare mainly by the involvement of private military companies. It has been speculated that the concept of \\"non-international armed conflict within the meaning of Article 3 GC I to IV\\" of the Fourth Geneva Convention would be wide enough to allow for covering \\"a renaissance of corporate warfare\\". Art In 2016 a digital illustration series by the German Foreal design studio called \\"Corporate Warfare\\" visualized the power and impact of big brand corporations by branded torpedoes and atomic bombs.

Early life Growing up in a musical family in the small village of Enyan Denkyira, near Cape Coast, Ghana, Paa Kow began playing and performing music at the tender age of 5. His uncle and mother were both singers in a touring concert band called the Enidado Professional Band. It was with this band that Paa Kow first began performing, first playing cowbell and congas and then eventually moving to the drum set by age 7. Due to the cost and lack of access to instruments, he would fashion his own drums out of metal cans, wire, and a fertilizer bag as a bass drum, which he used to practice for hours every day. He also had to build his own drum pedal using an old sandal, a door hinge and some string. While touring the country with his uncle's band, other band leaders began to take notice of the prodigious young drummer and Paa Kow was soon playing with other known groups eventually catching the eye of Highlife legend Amakye Dede. At age 14, Paa Kow was invited to Accra to join Dede's group. After some years in Accra playing with Amakye, his talent became widely recognized and Paa Kow was invited to play with other major Highlife artists in the country including Kojo Antwi, George Darko and Nat Brew taking him on tours to Switzerland, Scotland, Belgium, Amsterdam, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Togo, Egypt, and Nigeria. Career In 2007, Paa Kow was invited to Boulder, CO USA as a guest artist of the University of Colorado music school to perform with West African Highlife Ensemble directed by Dr. Kwasi Ampene. After, he returned to Ghana for a short time and then emigrated to the US later that year following an invitation from musicians he had met while at the University. Since moving to the US, Paa Kow was no longer just a session drummer and began to compose his own music. His debut album Hand Go Hand Come was released in 2012 followed by Ask in 2014. His third album Cookpot was released in October 2017. Notable artists he has performed with in the US include Victor Wooten, Michael Kang, Brad Goode and John Gunther.

Gabriele von B√ºlow, ca. 1880 Gabriele von B√ºlow (28 May 1802, Berlin - 16 April 1887, Berlin) was a German noblewoman  Life  The third daughter of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Caroline von Dacher√∂den, she had seven sisters and spent her early years in Rome at her father's ambassadorial residence, remaining there even after his return to Berlin - in 1809 her portrait was painted in Rome by Gottlieb Schick. In 1810 the children and Caroline moved to Vienna, where Wilhelm acted as ambassador until 1814. The family then moved to Berlin for two years then to Frankfurt am Main. On 30 October 1816 Gabriele became engaged to her father's secretary Heinrich von B√ºlow, though the marriage only occurred years later. Gabriele spent two more years in Rome and in 1819 she returned to Berlin. B√ºlow returned from London in 1820 and they married on 10 January 1821. As a successful diplomat, B√ºlow spent most of his life in London - he was appointed ambassador in 1827. Gabriele spent 1828 to 1836 in London with her husband, where her portrait was painted by August Grahl in 1831. She also spent long periods back home around the deaths of her parents in 1829 and 1835, especially the several years she spent caring for her father at Schloss Tegel. B√ºlow became Prussia's foreign minister in 1842 but died in 1846. Gabriele moved to Potsdam then to Rome, looking after her children and grandchildren. Although she was the last surviving heir of her father, particularly to his estates in Tegel and Burg√∂rner, she lived a very modest life, in contrast to her mother, though still in contact with major figures of her time - for example, she acted as chief lady in waiting to William I's consort Augusta at William's coronation. Her 81st birthday in 1883 was chosen as the occasion for unveiling the two Humboldt monuments in front of the University of Berlin. She was also a patron to the writer and salon-leader Marie von Olfers, whilst the Gabriele von B√ºlow Oberschule in Berlin was named after her in 1938.

In September 2018 the developers announced that the Town Square Module, an Early Access version of the game with limited features, would be available to those who pledged on the game's Kickstarter campaign or paid a set fee before the Town Square's release. It was released on Steam on November 30, 2018.  Controversy  Identity developers maintained it's fan base for several years by promising progress to their backers and late pledges, despite showing little progress during their infrequent updates. In 2019 they sent out an official newsletter in which they claimed their obligations toward their backers were filled and they were unable to fund anymore development, thus rendering further progress either slow or impossible. The released gameplay footage and play testing of Asylum Entertainment, Inc.'s Identity reveals an empty shell of 3D game assets with bare bones intractability, becoming one of many video game Kickstarter campaigns that failed to release the advertised product.

Later investigations revealed that Asylum Entertainment, Inc. Director John VanderZwet occupies Phony Games Inc. Director's position as well. There has been concern that Furballs will follow in the same footsteps Identity did, with backers questioning if Asylum Entertainment, Inc. is a legitimate company or not.

History The name Gold Ochsen is first mentioned in Ulm in 1499. In 1597, the innkeeper Gabriel Mayer founded the brewery and inn Zum Goldenen Ochsen in the historic center of Ulm. Over the following years, the firm had a number of changes in ownership. In 1812, the brewery was purchased by brewer and guild leader Jakob Wieland. In 1867, his son sold the brewery to the Leibinger family, who retain ownership to this day. The brewery was relocated into a new building at the northern edge of the city. As a result of the Bombing of Ulm in World War II, the brewery only received light damage, although 81% of the city center was destroyed. In 1966, the brewery received a contract to bottle products for PepsiCo, and has been offering soft drinks since then. For this purpose, a separate distribution company was established, the Ulmer Getr√§nke Vertrieb GmbH, UGV. Gold Ochsen and its subsidiary UGV are still the largest beverage distribution companies in the Donau-Iller region. In 1991, Ulrike Freund became the fifth generation of her family to run the brewery, replacing her father August Leibinger, the previous managing director. Since 2012, the brewery has operated two bottling lines, that can each fill more than 40,000 bottles per hour. In 2013, PepsiCo announced a new production partnership with Radeberger Group, ending their longstanding business relationship with Gold Ochsen, effective at the end of 2016. To replace much of this volume, Gold Ochsen has entered into a production and distribution relationship with Afri- Cola and Bluna.

Kirkpatrick was born in Cumberland County, Virginia to John Kirkpatrick and his wife Jane Maria Jellis. On March 3, 1852 Thomas Kirkpatrick married Fortunata Sydnor. Her parents were Fortunatus Sydnor and Elizabeth Royall, who was descended from patriot Benjamin Watkins of Chesterfield County. They had several children, of whom at least Elizabeth Sydnor Kirkpatrick (b.1858), Sydnor F. Kirkpatrick (b.1862) and Thomas J. Kirkpatrick Jr. (b.1868) survived to adulthood. By 1880, Thomas Jr. and daughter Susan were away at boarding school, and Thomas Sr and his wife lived with three daughters and a young son, along with two servants and two boarders.1880 U.S. Census for Lynchburg Career By 1850, Kirkpatrick had begun his legal practice in Lynchburg, where he lived with his widowed mother and four sisters.1850 U.S. Census for Lynchburg In 1855, he became the first president of the local YMCA, and he would lead the First Presbyterian Sunday School for five decades.W. Asbury Christian, Lynchburg and its people (Lynchburg: J.P. Bell 1900), pp. 172, 426 By 1860, Kirkpatrick was a trustee of Washington College in Lexington, and continued to serve on that board until 1870. In February 1861, Kirkpatrick ran for the Virginia Secession Convention as a Disunion candidate from Lynchburg alongside John Goggin, but voters instead elected Unionists John M. Speed and Charles R. Slaughter, perhaps acceding to the constant pleas of The Virginian newspaper.George Morris and Susan Foutz, Lynchburg in the Civil War: The City, the People, the Battle (Lynchburg, H.E. Howard, Inc. 1984) p. 6Christian pp. 190-193 After Virginia declared its secession in April and joined the American Civil War, Kirkpatrick organized a company called the \\"Amherst Light Artillery\\" on July 24, 1861, and became its captain. In 1862, he notified Lynchburg that Brig. General Samuel Garland, Jr. had been killed in battle in Boonsboro, Maryland.Morris and Fouts, p. 25 Capt. Kirkpatrick was promoted to full major on February 18, 1865. His wife and Narcissa Owen (whose husband Kirkpatrick would succeed in the state Senate), both active in St. Paul's Church, led about 500 Lynchburg women in sewing uniforms and otherwise helping Confederate troops.Kilcup (ed.), Memoirs of Narcissa Owen After war ended, Kirkpatrick resumed his legal practice, as well as became Lynchburg's superintendent of schools, operating four white and two Negro schools.Christian, p. 243Philip Lightfoot Scruggs, The History of Lynchburg, Virginia, (Lynchburg, J.P. Bell 1978) p. 115 A Catholic school and two private schools to teach boys and girls, respectively, were also founded at the time. In December 1871, Kirkpatrick succeeded Robert L. Owen Sr., who had bought a plantation near Norfolk, in representing Campbell County in the Virginia State Senate. Kirkpatrick was not re-elected, but succeeded on December 1, 1875 by fellow Confederate veteran and Conservative Democrat John W. Daniel. By 1891, Kirkpatrick was a trustee of Howard University in Washington, D.C., with his status changing to honorary by 1894.

He joined the Prussian Army in 1802, leaving it in 1810 only to return in 1813 as a staff officer of the Silesian uhlans. After the battle of Bautzen he became adjutant to Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher. On 16 June 1815, towards the end of the battle of Ligny, Nostitz stood guard over Bl√ºcher after Bl√ºcher fell stunned under his horse and after the French Cuirassiers had passed attracted the attention of counter charging Prussian troopers who then remounted the dazed Bl√ºcher on Sergeant Schneider's horse and escorted him from the battlefield. Nostitz became a major general in 1825 and served on Nicholas I of Russia's general staff during the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829).

He died of dysentery on 5 November 1758 in Schweidnitz. Military and administrative career The son of an aristocratic family, Retzow was educated at the cavalry academy in Brandenburg. He entered the regiment \\"von Schlabrendorff\\" at the age of 17 as a cadet. In 1745 he became commander-in- chief of the battalion Grenadier-Garde, which was stationed in Potsdam. Two years later, he became the head of the authority providing food and provisions for the army, as well as some important state-owned enterprises, such as the Great Military House and the Gold and Silver Manufactory in Berlin. When Frederick II called for the construction of a Bohemian weaver colony near Potsdam in the spring of 1751, he commissioned Retzow with its establishment.Bernhard von Poten, Retzow, Wolf Friedrich von, ADB, vol. 28, pp 277-278. The new colony was built in the immediate vicinity of Neuendorf. Retzow remained closely connected with his colony until his death. He was not only their first commander but also the first distributor of the textiles they produced. When, from 1756 onward, other distributors took up the work, Colonel Retzow was judge and intermediary between the weavers and the new manufacturers. Because of his special merit in the Battle of Leuthen during the Seven Years' War, Retzow was still appointed Lieutenant-General on the battlefield by Frederick the Great. Prior to the Battle of Hochkirch, Frederick dispatched an entire Prussian corps to the hills east of Hochkirch in late September; by early October, Retzow's corps was within of the Austrians; Frederick ordered Retzow to take the hill that commanded the area, called Strohmberg. When Retzow arrived there, he discovered that the Austrians already had laid possession with a strong force.David T. Zabecki, Germany at War. Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History (2014 2015), Vol. I‚àíIV, ABC-CLIO, pp 612-614. He refused the order to storm the position. Disgraced, Retzow surrendered his sword; Frederick also had him arrested. Retzow was already suffering from dysentery and was transferred to Schweidnitz, where he died. Retzow was married to Charlotte Louise von R√∂seler (* 1706; ‚Ä† 7 May 1779), daughter of General Friedrich August von R√∂seler. The couple had several children: * Friedrich August (13.

His parents were the Prussian colonel Johann Georg (Hans J√ºrgen) von Schwerin (* 3 May 1668: ‚Ä† 5 June 1712) and Maria Esther von Dockum. His mother was the daughter of Martin Arnd von Dockum from the Duchy of Geldern and the Magdalena Esther of Lo√´ of Oldenpiel. His brother Frederick Leopold (1699-1750) was also a Prussian general. Military career Schwerin's grave As a 13-year-old boy (1714), he entered the Prussian military service on the horse guard \\"Crown Prince\\". At the beginning of the First Silesian War Schwerin was already Lieutenant- Colonel and Commander of the \\"Markgr√§flich Bayreutschen Dragoonsregiment\\". Both his regiment and himself, however, did not gain any laurels in the battles at Mollwitz in 1741 and Chotusitz in 1742: the latter was particularly painful, when his regiment was dispersed by the enemy cavalry before the advance. In addition, he was seriously wounded and captured by the Austrians. Frederick the Great then decreed the royal disgrace of his cavalry. Returning to his garrison town Pasewalk after the peace, Schwerin devoted himself with zeal to the intense training of his regiment. Frederick II was very satisfied with his work and ordered the commanders of the three East Prussian Dragoon regiments to go to Pasewalk and learn from Schwerin. Schwerin's fame came on 4 June 1745, in the Battle of Hohenfriedberg, by the famous charge of his regiment Bayreuth under Gessler and his leadership. After the battle Frederick the Great said to him, \\"Schwerin, such a deed as this day is not to be found in all the Roman history,\\" and rewarded Schwerin with the promotion to major general and the award of the Order Pour le M√©rite. Later, Schwerin also got the main administrative teams to Stettin and Fischhausen, which earned 10,000 thaler annual income. With King Schwerin's peace, King Friedrich was less satisfied, for the general soon became acquainted with his officers, and Frederick exhorted him \\"to drink from drinking,\\" but without success. In 1755, during the autumn maneuver at Stargard, Schwerin received such a sharp reprimand from the king, \\"A mischief that pulls him once more.\\" He then withdrew to his estates in Pomerania and asked for leave, which however was not granted. After a year, the Seven Years' War broke out and Frederick urged Schwerin to resume the command of his regiment, which the General did. In 1756, Schwerin was promoted to lieutenant-general, and distinguished himself again in the battle of Lobositz (October 1, 1756), but he took leave in 1757. On account of his conflict with Frederick II, he was never raised to the rank of count, and a simple Herr von Schwerin remained. 1701 births 1777 deaths People from Halberstadt Lieutenant generals of Prussia Prussian military personnel of the Seven Years' War ","title":"Otto Magnus von Schwerin"},{"id":"52963228","text":"The Syrian Republic was a period in the history of Syria which lasted from 1930 to 1963.

Under President Barack Obama, Campoverdi was the first White House Deputy Director of Hispanic Media. Early life and education Born in Los Angeles, Campoverdi was raised by a single mother and her grandmother who immigrated to the United States from Mexico. Campoverdi's mother initially worked in a factory that manufactured car floor mats before later becoming a kindergarten teacher at a school in inner-city Los Angeles. Campoverdi spent her childhood sharing a cramped apartment with her mother, grandmother, and several aunts and uncles. There were periods when her family was on welfare, WIC and Medi-Cal, California‚Äôs public health insurance program. Campoverdi attended Saint Monica Catholic High School on financial assistance and with the support of non-profits and pipeline programs. She graduated cum laude from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. Campoverdi worked as a part-time actress and model during her time at USC to pay for her education. She later received her Master of Public Policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Campoverdi pointed to the vote for 1994 California Proposition 187 and the 1992 Los Angeles riots as events that shaped her worldview and served as a political awakening. Career After working for the Agricultural Worker Health Initiative at The California Endowment, a health-focused foundation that expands access to quality and affordable healthcare to underserved communities in California, and following her master's degree, Campoverdi was hired by then-Senator Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, to work in the Chicago headquarters. She lived off her credit cards, had no health insurance and stayed in supporter housing. Campoverdi's focus during the campaign was outreach to various constituent groups, including the Latino community. Alejandra Campoverdi briefs President Obama in the Oval Office Following Obama's victory, Campoverdi was appointed to work in the West Wing of the White House as Special Assistant to the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Mona Sutphen. She later became the first ever White House Deputy Director of Hispanic Media. In the latter role, Campoverdi developed and implemented the White House‚Äôs communications strategy directed towards the Hispanic community and briefed President Obama in preparation for interviews with Hispanic media. Campoverdi also worked on White House communications around a broad range of issues, including the Affordable Care Act and its effects on the Latino community. In 2012, Campoverdi left the White House and joined Univision as Senior Advisor for Innovation and Communications Strategy. Campoverdi subsequently served as Managing Editor of #EmergingUS at the Los Angeles Times, a multimedia venture founded by Jose Antonio Vargas that explores race, immigration and the emerging American identity. In December 2016, Campoverdi announced that she would seek the nomination of the Democratic Party in the 34th congressional district special election, to replace Xavier Becerra, who has been appointed to succeed Kamala Harris as Attorney General of California. Campoverdi cited the election of Donald Trump and the potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act as her motivation to run. In the April 4, 2017 primary election, Campoverdi did not make the run-off, and former California Assembly member Jimmy Gomez was elected.  Boards  Campoverdi serves on the Boards of Harvard‚Äôs Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, the California Community Foundation, the Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy, UCLA's Center for Diverse Leadership in Science, and is a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy. In 2017, Campoverdi was appointed to serve as a Commissioner for the California Children and Families Commission, also known as First 5 California. The Commission is a statewide body that is dedicated to improving the lives of California‚Äôs youngest citizens and their families through a multi-faceted approach that includes education, health services, childcare, and other vital programs. She is a volunteer teacher for InsideOUT Writers, through which she teaches a weekly creative writing class to incarcerated youth in Los Angeles‚Äô Central Juvenile Hall. Women's health advocacy In March 2017, Campoverdi revealed in a profile by The Washington Post that she has inherited the BRCA2 gene mutation, giving her an 85% risk of developing breast cancer, and that she planned to have a preventive double mastectomy. Campoverdi lost both her great-grandmother and grandmother to breast cancer, and her mother and two aunts have also battled the disease. Campoverdi made the protection of access to affordable healthcare and the Affordable Care Act a focus of her congressional campaign, choosing to speak publicly about her personal health in an effort to bring attention to the stakes of limited access to healthcare. Two days after she went public with her diagnosis, she released a television ad saying, \\"If Donald Trump wants to have a conversation about women's bodies, let's start with mine.\\" In 2017, Campoverdi was awarded Penn Medicine's Basser Center for BRCA's inaugural YLC Distinguished Advocacy Award for her advocacy around BRCA-related cancers. In October 2018, Campoverdi underwent a preventive double mastectomy to lower her risk of developing breast cancer. Routine testing of the removed tissue subsequently revealed she had unknowingly had Stage 0, non-invasive breast cancer, which every previous mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI had not detected. Because of her recent preventive surgery, Campoverdi did not need to do any additional treatment. Campoverdi said, \\"I beat breast cancer before I even knew I had it.\\" Campoverdi speaks often about the importance of being your own best health advocate and her decision to be \\"CEO of her own body.\\" She is the founder of The Well Woman Coalition, an initiative aiming to empower women of color to have agency over their own health and healing through awareness, education, and advocacy. Campoverdi also founded LATINX & BRCA in partnership with Penn Medicine's Basser Center for BRCA. LATINX & BRCA is the first awareness campaign on the BRCA gene mutation that targets Latinos and offers Spanish-language educational materials. In an op-ed for Cosmopolitan, Campoverdi wrote, \\"Now more than ever, we must recognize and accept the complexity of real women, and celebrate them in their quest for leadership roles. Whole, multidimensional women. Please throw your name in the arena, whichever one you‚Äôre in ‚Äî because it only gets better every time one of us tries.\\"  References  Further reading Living people Women in California politics John F.

The Leprosy Act gave responsibility to the Minister of Agriculture for the management of the lazarettos, apprehension and confinement of the ill, capture of escaped inmates, and punishment of those found to be harbouring or concealing a person afflicted with leprosy. Background Canada‚Äôs first documented case of leprosy was in 1815 in New Brunswick, when Ursula and Joseph Benedict contracted the disease and later died after two Norwegian sailors covered in sores spent the winter in their home. The first lazaretto in Canada was established in 1844 at Sheldrake Island, New Brunswick and operated until 1848 when the lazaretto at Tracadie, New Brunswick was opened. The Canadian government took over the responsibility for the lazaretto from New Brunswick at the time of Confederation. A lazaretto was established in British Columbia at D'Arcy Island in 1891 to house Chinese immigrants with the disease and its operation was taken over by the Canadian government with the passing of the Leprosy Act. An important figure in the history of leprosy in Canada and in the passing of the Leprosy Act was Dr. Alfred Corbett Smith. First in his capacity as the Inspector of Leprosy for the government of Canada from 1889 until 1899, then as the Medical Superintendent for the Tracadie lazaretto, Dr. Smith was optimistic that there was a cure for leprosy and believed that compulsory segregation was essential in order to keep the wider population disease-free. Dr. Smith undertook \\"tours of inspection\\" across New Brunswick where he visited households, lobster canneries, and fish packing plants looking for cases of leprosy. He also travelled to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Victoria, British Columbia, and Winnipeg, Manitoba to investigate suspected cases of leprosy. Throughout his career Dr. Smith lobbied for more stringent legislation for the apprehension, detention, and medical supervision of leprous people in Canada, an objective that was realized in the 1906 Leprosy Act. In 1902 it was reported that there were eleven men and seven women incarcerated at the Tracadie, New Brunswick lazaretto. Throughout the province of New Brunswick and Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, there were three or four cases of leprosy that were being treated in isolation and under the supervision of the Tracadie lazaretto. Along with the lazaretto at Tracadie, New Brunswick, there was a provincially supported lazaretto at D‚ÄôArcy Island, British Columbia for Chinese immigrants. There were also reports of instances of leprosy found among the Western provinces and Icelanders living in Manitoba. The Act In 1906 the federal government passed the Leprosy Act and it was enacted on January 31, 1907. The federal government took over responsibility of the lazaretto on D‚ÄôArcy Island from the province of British Columbia and hired a guardian and interpreter and established weekly supplies of fresh meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables for the lazaretto. Soon after assuming care of the lazaretto the Canadian government deported all the inmates to a hospital in China. The Act also established that the Director General of Public Health was required to undertake yearly examinations of every lazaretto. The Leprosy Act enabled the federal government, through the Minister of Agriculture, to establish a lazaretto where and when it was deemed necessary and to appoint a medical superintendent, officers, and servants for the proper management and care of the facility and its inmates. The Minister of Agriculture was also responsible for creating rules and regulations regarding diet, bedding, maintenance, employment, classification, instruction, and discipline of inmates. The Leprosy Act stated that every person afflicted with leprosy was subject to confinement in a lazaretto. If the Minister of Agriculture suspected a person of having leprosy they were to be examined by a medical officer and admitted to a lazaretto. If the person afflicted refused they were to be apprehended and forcibly confined and every inmate was required to be incarcerated until it was certified that it was safe for them to be discharged and to be at large. Confinement could be avoided if the medical officer reported that the disease was not in the contagious stage and that proper isolation and treatment could be carried out. If an inmate of a lazaretto escaped, the Leprosy Act enabled any constable or peace officer to retake and return them. If any person was found to be harbouring or concealing a person afflicted with leprosy with the intention of preventing them from being examined, the Leprosy Act established that they were guilty of a criminal offence and subject to a penalty of a fine between $10 and $100 or to an imprisonment period of one to six months, with or without hard labor, or both. The Leprosy Act also established that a justice of the peace could authorize any person to enter into a property where there was information given that a leper was concealed inside and apprehend the ill person and bring them before a justice of the peace to be committed for examination. The lazaretto at Tracadie, New Brunswick had been in operation for one hundred and seventeen years when it closed in 1965. The lazaretto at D‚ÄôArcy Island, British Columbia was moved to Bentinck Island, British Columbia in 1924 and operated until 1957.

Henneberg based on Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters. It was the composer's first large-scale opera. The premiere at the Op√©ra National de Lyon, directed by Ushio Amagatsu, was conducted by Kent Nagano, who had commissioned the work. The production was then also shown in Paris, Brussels, and at the Wiener Festwochen festival in 2002. It became an opera played at several European opera houses including the Vienna State Opera in 2016 and the Oper Frankfurt in 2018.  History  P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s was commissioned by Kent Nagano to write an opera for the Op√©ra National de Lyon. It was to become his first large-scale opera. The composer chose Chekhov's 1901 Russian play Three Sisters as the basis. Together with Claus H. Henneberg, he wrote the libretto in German. It was then re-translated to Russian by Krzysztof Wiernicki. The librettists took episodes from the play and arranged them in so-called sequences, each devoted to one character: the youngest sister Irina, the brother Andrei, and the second sister Masha, while the oldest sister Olga and Andrei's wife Natasha are other major roles. The composer wrote the major female characters with the voice of a counter-tenor in mind. The main figures are characterized by solo instruments: flute for Olga, oboe and also English horn for Irina, clarinet for Masha, bass clarinet for Kulygin, bassoon for Andrei, soprano saxophone for Natasha, French horn for Tuzenbach, flugelhorn and also trumpet for Vershinin, trombone for the doctor, percussion for Solyony, viola for the three sisters, and double bass for Anfisa.

It is a straggly shrub with wiry branches, warty, three-part leaves and clusters of up to about twenty small white flowers, each with four petals and four stamens, in the leaf axils. Description Zieria distans is an open, straggly shrub which grows to a height of and has warty, wiry branches with dense, woolly hairs on the youngest branches. The leaves have a petiole long with a central leaflet which is narrow elliptic in shape, long, wide with the other two leaflets about the same size. The upper surface of the leaflets and the raised midvein on the lower surface are warty due to the presence of glands. The flowers are white and are arranged in groups of between about 12 and 20 in leaf axils on a warty, hairy stalk long, the groups shorter than the leaves. The sepals are warty and about long and the four petals are elliptic in shape, long, wide and covered with star-like hairs. The four stamens are about long. Flowering occurs between May and September and is followed by fruit which is a glabrous capsule, about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Zieria distans was first formally described in 2007 by Marco Duretto and Paul Forster from a specimen collected in the Walla Range near Coalstoun Lakes in Queensland. The description was published in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (distans) is a Latin word meaning \\"being apart\\" or \\"well separated\\" and refers to the location of this species on well separated mountain tops and ridges. Distribution and habitat This zieria grows in rocky places on mountain tops and ridges in woodland and shrubland in the South East Queensland biogeographic region. There are disjunct populations on the Walla Range, Coongara Rock, Kroombit Tops, Westwood Range and Mount Roberts. Conservation Zieria distans is listed as \\"least concern\\" under the Queensland Nature Conservation Act 1992.

Screw Style follows of the story of an unnamed boy who goes around several places in war-torn Japan in order to find a doctor who can fix his pierced artery. The manga was first published in the manga anthology magazine Garo in 1968 to popularity among Japanese youth. The manga has been adapted into a video game and a live action film.  Plot  A boy arriving ashore in war-torn Japan is bitten by a jellyfish that pierces his artery. He enters a nearby village and goes around looking for a doctor, but finds none. The boy then proceeds to follow a road of railway tracks in hope that it will lead him to the next village, only to get onto a train that brings him back to the village he first entered. He then decides to search the village again, this time properly and encounters an old woman who tells him that the doctor he desires is in a nearby factory, but the boy goes to a female gynecologist who resides in a bunker instead. He has sex with the gynecologist before getting his pierced artery fixed with a safety valve and wrench. The manga ends with the boy sailing away in a motorboat.  Style and themes  Screw Style does not have a conventional plot, and like many of Tsuge's works for Garo, it has a surreal, ambiguous quality in the progress of the narrative and the artwork. All characters except the main character are drawn as if they are static. There have been various interpretations of the themes of the manga, with various critics arguing the manga is about birth and death, or existential nihilism.  Release  It was published in the June 1968 issue of Garo magazine and gained cult status among Japanese youth at the time. It was subsequently translated into English by Bill Randall for the American magazine The Comics Journal for its February 2003 issue.  Adaptations  The manga was adapted into a game for the Japanese PC-9800 and Sharp X68000 platforms in 1989. In 1998 Japanese film director Teruo Ishii adapted the manga into a live action film (also known as Wind-Up Type) starring Tadanobu Asano and Miki Fujitani.

Life  Her parents, who lived in a small town Hroznƒõt√≠n near Karlovy Vary, moved to Strakonice in South Bohemia soon after her birth. She grew up there as the oldest of three children and enrolled at the local grammar school. Soon after completing studies she left home, seeking independence. She experienced hardship in a variety of low-paid jobs (shop-fitter, labourer, railway level crossing gate operator, confectioner, cleaning lady, draughtswoman of the Architects¬¥ Cooperative, Conservationists¬¥ archive-keeper, employee of a public education organisation, waitress). In early 1970s she moved to Prague, married young scientist and gave birth to two sons. Before 1989, she attended correspondence class at the Secondary Pedagogical School and then worked at nursery school and as a night governess in a student dormitory at Ha≈°talsk√° street in Prague. After 1989, she started a new career as newspaper journalist and external radio staffer. Since 2003, she has largely devoted time to her own fiction, but continued writing essays for journals. Later she established her own publishing house, which has issued publications on popular science by respected members of the skeptical club Sisyphos, prosaic works by other authors and also her own novels and stories. Vƒõra Noskov√° was a co-founder of the voluntary association of Czech skeptics and for three years also president of the Czech Skeptical Club Sisyphos. She is a member of the Czech center of the International PEN Club.Czech PEN: Vƒõra Noskov√° In 2013 Noskov√° received the Hessian Literature Scholarship, an award granted as part of the Czech- German literary partnership.Prague Literary Agency: Vƒõra Noskov√° As a literary scholarship holder, she stayed in Wiesbaden, Krakow and Bratislava.

Collection of poetry Ink paddle (\\"Inkoustov√© p√°dlo\\") was published in 1988.  Journalism  After 1989, she started new job as secretary and editor of Czech diary (\\"ƒåesk√Ω den√≠k\\"), then editor of Week (\\"T√Ωden\\") (a rural magazine), reporter of the picture supplement of tabloid newspaper Blesk, editor of Europress (Bauer Media) and finally as co-author of the supplement Science and people (\\"Vƒõda a lid√©\\") of the newspaper Hospod√°≈ôsk√© noviny. She cooperated externally with newspapers Lidov√© noviny and MF DNES, Czech journals Reflex, Print and Publishing, Packaging, Sanquist, Listy, and with Rozmer and Prometheus in Slovakia. In the nineties, she hosted the programme called Our theme (\\"Na≈°e t√©ma\\") on the Czech Radio station Vltava and contributes essays for the Radio weekly since then.

Biography  His father was a shoemaker. He originally intended to be a gardener, but decided to pursue landscape painting instead.Brief biography @ the Sophistic Gallery. From 1907 to 1909, he studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design and at the Academy of Fine Arts with Jan Preisler, among others. In 1910, his family emigrated to America for economic reasons, but he remained behind.Timeline @ the Pƒõƒç√≠n website. Monument in Pƒõƒç√≠n In 1913, he became a member of the M√°nes Union of Fine Arts. Two years later, he went to Nov√° Ves u Chotƒõbo≈ôe at the invitation of Jarmila ≈†≈•astn√°-Mixov√° (sister of the poet ) where he and several other young Czech artists spent the time painting en plein aire. In 1916, he was drafted into service and was stationed in Salzburg, Bergheim and Fondo. He held his first exhibition upon returning. From 1919 to 1920, he lived in Nov√© Hrady and Vysok√© M√Ωto as a guest of the painter , and created a series of works on apple farming. He married Albertina Venclov√° (an amateur actor) in 1921 and, after touring Slovakia and Hungary, settled in Pƒõƒç√≠n. From then on, most of his works consisted of landscapes of the local countryside there. His wife died in 1928. From 1930 to 1931, to help relieve his depression, he visited France with his friend, , where he visited the art galleries and went on painting expeditions to Normandy. Upon returning, he exhibited the works he created there, but they were not critically well received. Back in Pƒõƒç√≠n, he attempted to synthesize what he had learned by painting seascapes with his earlier landscape style and spent much of his time in the Orlick√© Mountains. Many of his works from this period were left unfinished. He had always suffered from a weak heart. In 1939, his health began to fail and he died three years later while seeking a cure at the spa in Podƒõbrady. A small monument to him has been erected in Pƒõƒç√≠n.

One of the leading writers for the Socialist Party of America, she often wrote about women's issues, and was active in the suffrage movement. She also published under the name Gertrude Breslau Fuller.  Early life  Gertrude Breslau was born in Chicago on December 10, 1869. Her father, a war artist named James Cushman Breslau, died when she was an infant, and she was adopted by Henry H. Kaiser and Diadma (Best) Kaiser of Howard County, Iowa. She became a socialist at the age of 16 after studying the single tax question and the temperance movement in Iowa.  Career  By 1902, she was writing for socialist periodicals and had earned a reputation as \\"one of the ablest women in the Socialist movement of Illinois.\\" By 1907 she was a national organizer for the Socialist party. She was often described by her contemporaries as a brilliant lecturer, and was involved in the Lyceum movement. She published An Easy Wheel and Other Stories, a work of journalistic fiction depicting working-class and rural life, in 1910. Soon afterwards she moved to Pittsburgh, where she lived the rest of her life. In 1911, she was instrumental in obtaining the release of Fred Merrick, editor of Justice magazine, who had been jailed for libel after exposing brutal treatment of prisoners in the Western Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. The following year, she was a delegate from Pennsylvania to the 1912 Convention of the Socialist Party of America. In 1915, addressing the crowd at a suffrage rally in Pittsburgh, she argued for women's suffrage as a means of achieving equal pay: > So long as women have no voice in government, so long will they be underpaid > ... Why should the woman who earns a living for herself and her family be > differentiated from the male wage earner? She pays the same rent, she pays > the same price for food, for fuel, for clothing. Why should she not be > allowed the privilege accorded to men to have a voice in legislative affairs > that she can better her condition? She later joined the Democratic party and became the state Democratic vice- chairman. In her obituary she is remembered as a \\"pioneer leader in the Democratic Party in Pittsburgh and the State.\\" She was assistant director of the State Museum of Pennsylvania during Governor George H. Earle's administration in the late 1930s. In 1940, she was living in Pittsburgh and still giving political speeches.  Personal life  Breslau married several times: to a Mr. Davies in 1900, to Mr. Hunt in 1901, to Mr. Paul Deininger‚Äîa former Roman Catholic priest‚Äîin 1910, and sometime later to a Mr. Fuller.

The first year Bobo tried to show Rowdy, a chestnut stallion, in the World Grand Championship was 2006, when disagreements between trainers and government officials over the United States Department of Agriculture's Horse Protection Act led to cancellation of the class. Rowdy Rev was one of three horses who passed inspection and would have been allowed to show had the class been held. The next year he and Bobo won the Reserve World Grand Championship. Bobo hoped to win another World Grand Championship on Rowdy, but in 2008 the horse had a cold. In 2009 Bobo competed in and won the Preliminary Stallion class, but Rowdy Rev developed a hoof crack and could not compete in the World Grand Championship.

Inter-ethnic tensions in Bhutan have resulted in the flight of many Lhotshampa to Nepal, many of whom have been expelled by the Bhutanese military. By 1996, over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees were living in refugee camps in Nepal. Many have since resettled in Western nations.Chronology for Lhotshampas in Bhutan Lhotshampa People The Lhotshampa or Lhotsampa (; ) population is a heterogeneous Bhutanese people of Nepalese descent. People of Nepalese origin began to settle in uninhabited areas in southern Bhutan in the 19th century. The Lhotshampa people are native to southern Bhutan, and are therefore commonly referred to as 'Southerners'. As of 2007, much of the Lhotshampa population have relocated to Western nations, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. Today, the number of Lhotshampa in Nepal is significantly less than in the United States and other countries where they have relocated. Expulsion and Migration Since the late 1980s, more than 100,000 Lhotshampa have been forced out of Bhutan after being labelled illegal aliens by Bhutanese authorities. Between 1988 and 1993, thousands of others left the country due to ethnic and political oppression. In 1990, violent ethnic unrest and anti-government protests erupted in southern Bhutan, demanding greater democracy and respect for minority rights. That year, the Bhutan Peoples' Party, whose members are mostly Lhotshampa, launched a campaign of violence against the Bhutanese government. In the wake of this unrest, thousands of people fled Bhutan, settling in Nepal's seven refugee camps or leaving to find work in India. As of January 2010, 85,544 refugees remained in camps.. In 2008, the US State Department estimated that as much as 35% of the population of Bhutan has been displaced as a result of these conflicts.

Democratic state senator Jeremy McPike argued that Smith's victory boded well for Democratic turnout in the state election. In a special election in Chesterfield County on November 7th, Jenefer Hughes defeated Republican incumbent Tim McPeters with over 55% of the vote to become the county's next Commissioner of Revenue, marking the first time in over 37 years the post has gone to a Democrat.

It was composed by Charles Villiers Stanford, was premiered at the 1904 Leeds Festival, and was published as his Op. 91. Songs of the Fleet is a companion cycle of five songs for baritone, mixed chorus, and orchestra, also to poems by Newbolt. It was premiered at Leeds in 1910, and was published by Stanford as his Op. 117. Overview According to music critic Geoffrey Crankshaw: \\"Drake's Drum\\" may be the best known of the ten songs. It relates to the legend that Sir Francis Drake, naval hero under Elizabeth I of England, on his deathbed in the Spanish Main, asked that his drum be taken to England. He promised that should it be beaten in the hour of England's gravest need, he and his fleet would reappear in the English Channel to repel the invaders; as they did the Spanish Armada in 1588. It has been recorded by, among others, Peter Dawson, John Shirley-Quirk and Sir Thomas Allen; either in the original version, or in an arrangement for voice and piano. Songs of the Sea Songs of the Sea was written for Harry Plunket Greene, a renowned baritone in his day. He gave the first performance, at the 1904 Leeds Festival. The texts are: # \\"Drake's Drum\\" # \\"Outward Bound\\" # \\"Devon, O Devon, in Wind and Rain\\" # \\"Homeward Bound\\" # \\"The Old Superb\\" It is not exactly clear which Superb Newbolt had in mind. However, the best-known ship of that name in the Napoleonic era was HMS Superb (1798). A complete performance takes about 18 minutes. Haydn Wood (1882-1959), best known for his light music, made an orchestral arrangement of Songs of the Sea, known variously as Stanford Rhapsody and as Westward Ho. Songs of the Fleet Greene was also connected with Songs of the Fleet, premiered at the 1910 Leeds Festival. The texts are: # \\"Sailing at Dawn\\" # \\"The Song of the Sou'wester\\" # \\"The Middle Watch\\" # \\"The Little Admiral\\" # \\"Fare Well\\" A complete performance takes about 26 minutes.

The large, inclined gravity mill was built on the northwest side of Mount Sheer to assist the transfer of copper ore through the chemical and mechanical processes of the plant. It is a landmark in Britannia Beach, British Columbia some forty-five kilometers north of Vancouver. The nearby volcanic peak of Mount Garibaldi indicates the presence of magmatic inclusions and volcanic cores, in which copper is usually found. As such, the town and mill sit on the western shore of the Britannia Range and defined by the large fjord of Howe Sound. The mining claims were discovered in the 1880s and the Britannia Beach Mining and Smelting Company established in the Edwardian years. Copper was first mined in the area in 1903 and the distance from smelters necessitated the construction of an ore concentrator, a system to deliver ore, and a system to ship the ore concentrate. A primitive concentrator, No. 1, was built in 1904, which was upgraded with two more units, collective known as No.2, built in 1914 and 1915. A fire in 1921 destroyed these, and a concrete and steel structure to house a new concentrator was completed (immediately to the right of the 1914 plant) in early 1923. In the late 1920s, Britannia Mines was the most productive copper mine in the British Empire, and it also produced silver and gold. Now owned by the Britannia Beach Historical Society, it is part of the Britannia Mine Museum. Background In the late 1880s prospectors from Texada Island had surveyed the area for gold, one of them Dr. A. Forbes, then staked claims. It was not until 1898 that trappers among them Oliver Furry, of Furry Creek fame, discovered sulphided copper ore in a mineralized schist. A set of mining claims were made, eventually leading to the establishment of Britannia Mining and Smelting Company, which included claims for mines at four sites named Bluff, Empress, Fairview, and Jane. Britannia Mines began mining copper ore from Mount Sheer and the surrounding area on the eastern shore of Howe Sound in 1903. Because the ore contained relatively little copper, an ore concentrate was produced before shipment to an ore processing plant. This necessitated the construction of a concentrator, and both an inclined and aerial tramway system to transport crushed ore from the mine to the concentrator. In 1904, a gravity concentrator was installed at the site, capable of processing 200 tons of ore daily. The output was a concentrate of about 10% copper, which was sent to Crofton for smelting. The first shipment was made in December 1905. A holding company called the Howe Sound Company held Britannia Beach Mining and Smelting Company. The Howe Sound Company also owned some mines on Mt. Sicker and a smelter at Crofton near Ladysmith. Most of the high-grade ore at Britannia Beach had been mined and milled by 1912. To maintain profitability, the mining operation was expanded to mine low-grade ore, requiring a new wooden concentrator. This was installed as two parts, each made of timber, the first in 1914 and the second in 1915. Its design implemented a new flotation technique that had been tested in the original concentrator in 1912. A ground level inclined railway was built to lower the ore down from the Jane Basin mine. Between the years 1905 and 1915 the mine increased production by a factor of ten. Much of this was due to the outbreak of the First World War and the demand for copper shell casings and bullet jackets. The Imperial Munitions Board, a overseeing and purchasing body, received most of the copper. To further this expansion, the mine kept expanding with more plant and workers. Also, more houses had to be built to keep them. At its peak, the mine employed 900 men. In this period the ore stopped shipment to Crofton and was sent to the ASARCO smelter in Tacoma. In the winter of 1921, a fire spread throughout the concentrator building, destroying it and terminating mining operations. Fortunately, fire crews managed to save the pelton wheel powered, hydro electric plant--a small one story structure that sat right beside No.2 Concentrator. (The mine generated half of its power needs, and the other half came from BC Electric which strung a power line to the mine up the Capilano Valley,) A temporary decline in copper prices provided the company with an incentive to upgrade the concentrator, and it hired San Francisco metallurgical engineering firm Bradley, Bruff, and Labarthe to design a new structure to house it. Expansion In 1922, Britannia Mines began building a new gravity concentrator capable of processing 2,500 tons of ore daily. The monolithic concrete and steel structure to house it, No. 3 Concentrator, was completed in January 1923 on the northwest side of Mount Sheer, and by 1925 Britannia Mines produced more copper ore concentrate than any other mining operation in the British Empire, a distinction it held until 1930. During this time it also produced \\"significant amounts of silver and gold\\". The No. 1 Concentrator, which sat adjacent to the mine wharf, was dismantled. To feed the large new works, dozens of miles of tunnels were cut to ore bodies. The adits stretch high into the mountains and down in the mountain below sea level. Large fans for ventilation, electric lights, pumps and air drills assisted the work. At No. 3 Concentrator, ore was crushed and pulverised in ball mills. It was then ground into a powder and run through separation machines and flotation mills. After, it was graded and dried. Ore concentrate is roughly 40 percent metal and needs to go to a smelter for further refining. Britannia Beach was a company town with its own company store. Workers lived in town and were unable to leave except by scheduled Union Steamship Company boat. Highway 99 was not completed until 1955. The company was very strict with its workers and difficult to work for. The company was unionized only after the war, in 1946. Men had few safety precautions and used hard rock air drills without ear protection. Britannia Beach miners would often go deaf, receiving no compensation. Description The gravity-fed concentrator The 20-storey building dominates its site, its windows facing northwest into Howe Sound. The building is roughly rectangular, with a base about wide and deep. Each level is between . A ventilation shed added in 1926 protrudes from the top. The mill received ore at its peak, from its base, where it entered the concentrator. It passed down stages of the concentrator by gravity, through eight levels of the structure. From the bottom level, it was piped directly into the hold of a cargo ship. Britannia Beach remained in operation until 1974. Many of its business records are held by the UBC Special Collections. National Historic Site The Britannia Mines Concentrator is owned by the Britannia Beach Historical Society, and is part of the Britannia Mine Museum. The industrial building has become the setting for several films and television programs.

His father was a deeply religious Somali Muslim who, Dphrepaulezz recalls, had \\"a lot of rules\\" for his children. Dphrepaulezz and his family relocated to Oakland, California, when he was 12 years old. He began selling drugs as a teenager in Oakland, telling the Guardian, \\"We were all selling drugs, man. We all carried pistols. There was a crack epidemic. [....] I was the kind of kid who would sell fake weed [...]. Sometimes I would use tea.\\" He became inspired to teach himself how to play music after listening to Prince's album Dirty Mind and hearing that Prince was a self- taught musician. He learned to play music by sneaking into music classrooms at the University of California Berkeley despite not being a student there. Career Dphrepaulezz signed an early record deal with Prince's former manager. In 1993, he signed with Interscope Records.

Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert (May 16, 1894 - October 14, 1991) was an American educator, nutritionist, activist and writer. Cabeza de Baca is also known as the inventor of the u-shaped fried taco shell. She was also the first known published author of a cookbook describing New Mexican cuisine. Cabeza de Baca was fluent in Spanish, English, Tewa and Tiwa.  Biography  Cabeza de Baca was part of a prominent New Mexican family and one of four siblings. She was a descendant of Spanish explorer, Alvar Nu√±ez Cabeza de Baca. Her paternal great-grandfather was awarded the title to the Las Vegas Grandes land grant in 1823. She was also related to the second Governor of New Mexico, Ezequiel Cabeza de Baca, who was her uncle. Cabeza de Baca was born in and lived part of her life Las Vegas, New Mexico. She also grew up on a ranch in La Liendre. Her mother died when she was four, and her paternal grandmother raised her afterwards. Her grandmother instilled the idea of \\"nobless oblige\\" in Cabeza de Baca. As a young woman, Cabeza de Baca \\"refused to take on her 'proper' role as a Spanish lady\\" and spent her time riding horses and watching the ranch men work. When she was twelve, she visited Spain. Cabeza de Baca first attended a Catholic school, where she was expelled from Loreto Academy's kindergarten for slapping a nun. She later went to New Mexico Normal College, where she earned her teaching certificate in 1912. In the year of her graduation, her family was nearly bankrupt because of serious economic hardships. In 1921 she earned a bachelor's degree in pedagogy and visited Spain a second time. Later, she would earn a second bachelor's degree in home economics from New Mexico State University (NMSU) in 1929. Her first job was teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in 1916. Her father was opposed to her teaching, but she insisted. She continued to teach school in the New Mexico public school system for a few years, and after receiving her degree from NMSU, began to work as an extension agent for Hispanic and Pueblo villages in New Mexico as part of the New Mexico Agricultural Extension Service (NMAES). Her career as an extension agent for these villages would span thirty years. In this capacity, she taught rural women modern agricultural techniques, introduced modern devices like sewing machines, so that rural families could thrive on their own land. She also helped organize clubs for rural women. She was the first extension agent who spoke Spanish and often translated government information into Spanish for rural residents. She was also the first agent sent out to Pueblos. While visiting homes, she collected cultural information, recipes, stories and more. Some of these were published in the Santa Fe Nuevo Mexicana. She also hosted a bilingual weekly radio show related to homemaking on the station, KVSF. In 1929, she eloped with Carlos Gilbert, an insurance agent and member of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). The match was not approved of by her father, and the couple divorced after 10 years. Her husband's activism affected Cabeza de Baca, who became involved with Hispanic civil rights. In 1932, she was injured by a train car, which resulted in having one of her legs amputated. While she recovered for a period of two years, she continued to write and eventually returned to work, visiting homes. In 1935, she and several other women founded La Sociedad Folklorica in Santa Fe as an organization \\"dedicated to preserving Spanish Language and Hispanic traditions in Santa Fe.\\" During World War II, she helped women create Victory Gardens and set up childcare for women who were working. In 1950, UNESCO sent Cabeza de Baca to P√°tzcuaro to teach modern food and agriculture techniques to students. In 1959, she retired from working as an extension agent. In her retirement, she continued to preserve Spanish culture and was involved with the La Sociedad Folklorica of Santa Fe. She was also active in the Peace Corps. In May 1984, she entered into a nursing home. On October 14, 1991, Cabeza de Baca died in Albuquerque. She was buried near Newkirk, New Mexico on the family's ranch.  Writing  Her book, Historic Cookery, first published in 1931, collected traditional recipes from the area, emphasizing \\"basic New Mexico foods.\\" It was written with an \\"Anglo audience in mind.\\" Historic Cookery also marked the first time that New Mexican recipes were written down with \\"exact measurements.\\" In 1959, Cabeza de Baca and chef as the Alvarado Hotel worked to update the recipes in Historic Cookery to modern techniques. The book sold over 100,000 copies, and was republished many times. A copy of this book was sent to the governor of each state in the US by Thomas Mabry along with a bag of pinto beans. Her work helped introduce cooking with chile to the American public. Cabeza de Baca's second cookbook, The Good Life: New Mexico Traditions and Foods was first published in 1949 and was one of the first cookbooks to \\"place recipes within the historic and cultural contexts out of which they grew.\\" The book contained a fictional family, the Turrieta family, which represented the people that she met as an extension agent. The book also describes regional differences in New Mexican cuisine. Her autobiographical narrative, We Fed Them Cactus (1954), describes the life of New Mexican Hispanos, and documents four generations of her family. The title refers to a major drought that caused her family to have to feed cactus to their cattle. The story is narrated by El Cuate, or the camp cook, and the narrative in We Fed Them Cactus is meant to \\"counter Anglo- American stereotyping of wealthy and corrupt landowners of the rico class.\\" Between 1958 and 1961 she wrote and edited for a magazine she helped found, the Santa Fe Scene. Later Chicano readings of Cabeza de Baca's work were critical of her writing, which was seen as \\"elitist and not representative of the realistic Chicano experience.\\" Despite this criticism, her writing has been viewed by Hispanic literary critics as a precursor to Chicana literature.

Alston received a commission from the Reverend Donald S. Harrington, of the Community Church of New York, to create a bust of King for $5,000. Five bronze busts were cast in 1970, each approximately high. One cast was acquired in 1974 for the collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC, but has been on long-term loan to the White House since 2000, under the administration of Bill Clinton. It was displayed in the White House Library, and was reputedly the first image of an African American on public display in the White House. The bust was moved to the Oval Office in 2009 by Barack Obama, where it was displayed along with a bust of Abraham Lincoln. It replaced a bust of Winston Churchill by Jacob Epstein that had been a loan to George W. Bush from the British Government Art Collection. In January 2017, Donald Trump placed another Epstein Churchill bust belonging to the White House in the Oval Office but also retained the bust of King.

The centrally planned, circular baptistery is also notable as an ancient Roman monument adapted to the needs of Christianity. Mosaic floor of the Butrint baptistery Constructed in the 6th century A.D., the baptistry was excavated in May 1928 by an Italian archaeological mission to Albania, led by Luigi Maria Ugolini.  The baptismal font and water supply  The round structure of the baptistery, measuring 14.5 meters in diameter, was built within a large rectangular space that was either part of a Roman bathhouse or household bathing complex. Archeologists have identified a small room to the northeast of the baptistery as a caldarium, or hot-room, of a Roman hypocaust heating system. The prior existence of this system may explain the choice to build a baptistery there. The cross-shaped font, the baptistry's central feature, has two interior steps, allowing those about to be baptized to step down into the basin. There, the bishop would have poured water over them with a small vessel. The eastern corner room held a water tank and praefurnium, or furnace for heating water. The hot water was piped underground directly to the font, where it was mixed with cold water from a cistern built into the older Roman caldarium. Situated within an arched structure in the baptistery wall is another small fountain. It is positioned directly facing the entrance, an unusual characteristic for a baptistry. Archeologists believe it served a symbolic purpose as an image of the Fountain of Life, a Christian iconographic symbol associated with baptism.  Columns  Column capital from the Butrint BaptistryTwo concentric colonnades (each with eight columns, for a total of 16) once supported a wooden roof. Made from Egyptian granite, the columns stood on a variety of repurposed bases. However, the Ionic impost capitals, which feature acanthus leaves and crosses, were likely made specifically for the building. The wall‚Äôs interior also featured 24 half-columns and was covered with plaster and painted. A low bench, possibly once covered with polished marble, ran continuously around the foot of the interior wall. Archeologist John Mitchell, in his book The Butrint Baptistry and its Mosaics, remarks on the uniqueness of these two colonnades from an architectural standpoint, writing, \\"...the fact that each consists of eight columns means that the distance between the shafts in the outer ring is about twice that in the inner ring. This gives rise to technical and aesthetic issues--far wider and higher arches on the outer arcade--that must have tested the ingenuity of architect to the limit. The scheme must have been driven by symbolic considerations--the power of the number eight. ... No other building of the period takes this form.\\"  Mosaics  Today, the most remarkable aspect of the Butrint baptistery is its mosaic pavement. Most likely created by mosaicists from Nicopolis, the mosaic floor is considered the most complex of any late antique baptismal structure still existing in the Mediterranean today. of seven circling bands turning around the central font, the mosaic features iconography relating both to Christianity and to aristocratic life. Detail of the baptistry's mosaic floor, depicting two peacocks eating grapes from a kantharos The Butrint baptistery mosaics feature two prominent scenes, each strongly evoking Christian iconography befitting a baptismal theme. In one, peacocks are depicted on either side of a kantharos, out of which dangle vines bearing clusters of grapes. According to Mitchell, as peacock flesh was believed not to decompose, the appearance of the animal in late antique art would have symbolized eternal life. The other main scene depicts two stags at a fountain, a reference to a verse from Psalm 42 (‚ÄúAs the hart panteth for the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.‚Äù). Together, the two images connect water with the concept of everlasting life. The rest of the mosaics, which feature animals represented within intersecting roundels across the floor, do not carry an overt Christian meaning, though Mitchell interprets them as representative of the biblical Garden of Eden. Birds and sea animals, as well as domesticated and exotic creatures, are juxtaposed. Several panels, however, also reference the hunt, well known throughout classical antiquity as a favored sport of the aristocracy. Thus, the inclusion of exotic creatures, such as leopards, alongside symbols such as a hunting dog and a net could also reference the staged animal hunts conducted by the elite. Varying motifs throughout the rounded floor may also have demarcated areas of ceremonial importance within the baptistery, rather than simply serve as decoration. Mitchell noted that the checked pattern surrounding the central fountain matches the checked pattern on some of the outermost rings of the medallions. This might have indicated the place where the bishop stood and visually connected the ceremonial power of the fountain with that of the bishop.

Teaching From 1960-1968 she was a lecturer in art at Oberlin College. In 1968 she joined the art faculty at the College of Wooster where she was tenured as a full professor in 1976. She chaired Wooster's Art Department for several terms and was director of Wooster's art museum for a number of years. Career Her research and writing were concentrated in two distinct fields: Byzantine icons and frescoes (she was trained as a medievalist), and contemporary feminist art. She published in Art Bulletin , Gesta , and Dumbarton Oaks Papers , and organized exhibitions of the work of Miriam Schapiro, Audrey Flack, Faith Ringgold, and Emma Amos. She retired in 1999. In early 2000, Gouma-Peterson published two books that epitomize the primary areas of her research and teaching interests. The first, Miriam Schapiro: Shaping the Fragments of Art and Life , is a full- scale critical and biographical study of the New York artist Miriam Schapiro, best known as one of the founders of the feminist art movement of the late 1970s and 80s. The other, Anna Komnene and Her Times , constituted the culmination of her lifelong interest in Byzantine art and culture, and is a collection of original essays by international scholars on the Byzantine princess Anna Kommene.

The region of Southeast Asia is considered a possible place for the evidence of archaic human remains that could be found due to the pathway between Australia and mainland Southeast Asia, where the migration of multiple early humans has occurred out of Africa. One of many evidences is of the early human found in central Java of Indonesia in the late 1800s by Eugene Dubois, and later in 1937 at Sangiran site by G.H.R. van Koenigswald. These skull and fossil materials are Homo erectus or Dubois named Pithecanthropus erectus, and Meganthropus palaeojavanicus by van Koenigswald. They were dated back to c. 1.88 and 1.66 Ma suggested by Swisher et al. from volcanic rocks dating method  Three possible migration routes through Southeast Asia  Most scholars who work in Southeast Asia attempt to establish the possible route through which early humans would migrate passing through the region after they migrated out of Africa. The evidence also indicates the migration route and settlement location along the routes that might have taken place during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. There are three possible routes suggested by scholars; #From the northwest of Thailand they went down to Chao Phraya river basin and the Gulf of Thailand in which this route is supported by the faunal remains found in north Asia and Indonesia. Topographically advantages like the mountainous western flank of the Chao Phraya Basin, are likely to benefit the hominin habitats. Those advantages are ‚Äúenvironmental mosaics with varied food resources and abundant water supplies, combined with physical features offering protection from the weather and providing tactical advantages in the pursuit of prey‚Äù #From Northeastern Vietnam they went down to the Indochinese region. This route is supported by 86 anatomically modern human fossils found in mainland and island East and Southeast Asia. Although this model excluded the recent findings of the H. sapiens tooth found in Thailand and Vietnam and the remains in Laos, this new evidence seems to support this route. # From the coast of South Asia and the west part of mainland Southeast Asia, they went down to the Gulf of Thailand, in which this route is supported by the coastline that many scholars believe that this route is a possible route for the migration from Africa. This route seems to depict the major movement from Africa into this region. However, many possible sites along the coastline are difficult to locate due to the shift of the shoreline, even though the environmental setting is suitable for human habitation.  The Southeast Asia region It was not until the late 1800s that Dubois found the skull of Homo erectus in Java, Indonesia, and had plugged the Southeast Asian region into the spotlight. In 2003 since the archaeologists found another archaic human species on the island of Flores, Indonesia, this discovery has introduced many new theoretical approaches to human evolution in the region and on the global scales. Southeast Asia is separated into two main subregions following the previous Oriental biogeographical region; mainland Southeast Asia and island Southeast Asia. The region of mainland and island Southeast Asia has been separated into four sub-regions: The Indochinese, Sundaic, Indian, and Wallacean provinces. The Indochinese province includes northern Thailand, southern China, Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. The Sundiac province includes southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These two regions are divided by the climatic, zoological, and environmental patterns in which it implicates a different set of mammals and plants. This region is of some importance in paleoanthropology, e.g. Homo erectus in Java, Homo floresiensis in Flores, and until the early anatomically modern human in Laos. Furthermore, the faunal remains that found within the region indicate the possible exchange between the Indochinese and Sundaic faunal in which the assemblages from this intermediate zone might yield the hominid specimen.  Homo erectus in Southeast Asia  Since the discovery of archaic human fossils by Dubois and van Koenigswald during the late 1800s and early 1900s which identified as Homo erectus, there is a small number of later evidence of Homo erectus that found as old as those fossils. Nevertheless, in local scale, one human fossil was found in the region of northern Thailand in 1999 by one villager in which some archaeologists suggest that it might be a fragmental piece of the skull of Homo erectus (c. 500 Ka) the four pieces of the fragmented skull are believed to be the right \\"frontal region of a calvaria with a very thick tabula externa, a thick dipole and very thin tabula interna\\" (Marwick 2009:54). However, this evidence is still debated by scholars and no research has been conducted regarding the age of the piece and the fauna that comes with it.  The Age of Homo erectus in Java  At Trinil, Dubois found the skull (cranial part), tooth and thighbone of one individual (Java Man) and naming him as Pithecanthropus erectus. While at Sangiran, van Koenigswald discovered at least 40 fossils and named them as Meganthropus palaeojavanicus. Although the fossils that were found in Trinil and Sangiran sites are the oldest evidence found within the region, the date of these fossils‚Äîimplicated by Dubois‚Äîis still ambiguous. Swisher et al. are the first scholars who attempted to analyze the age of these fossils by using the 40Ar/39Ar dating of volcanic rock from both sites. Swisher et al. suggest that the result from both sites indicates the age of the fossils is dated back to c. 1.81-1.82 Ma or Early Pleistocene. This date was older than the fossils of the Homo erectus that were found from Olduvai Gorge at Tanzania at least 0.6 Ma. Nevertheless, some scholars argue that the dating method at both Java sites is unclear, especially the collective method of the rock and the relationships between the rock and the fossils. In fact, the remains in Java were found in more than these two sites, such as Ngandong (homo soloensis) and Kedung. Along with these fossils, there are also tools and fauna as well as other related artifacts found within the sites and other sites nearby. These artifacts could nevertheless shed light on the unresolved age of these remains. By using the absolute (radiometric) dating method, these faunal remains implicate the age at 0.8 Ma as for Flores Island. As for Kedung site, the faunal remains indicate the 110 and 70 ka in which this record is quite well known for the turnover of the age of H. erectus. In addition, the faunal remains that Dubois and van Koenigswald used might be overlying on the deposits of Kubuh and Pucangan Formations in which it indicates slightly younger ages from the remains of both sites. Therefore, scholars still debate the age of the H. erectus fossil Java Man. Corvinus et al. suggested that the evidence found between Southeast Asia and India illustrate a different set of understanding. For instance, in Southeast Asia, the finding of the human remains is flourishing and well-studied, but the lack of stone tools and human occupation. While in Indian sites there were discoveries of a number of stone tools (Acheulean), but the lack of the remains found. For this reason, to established and reconstructed the early H. erectuss activity and environment are yet ambiguity in the region regarding the technology and development of the tools and the relation to fossils. The tools that were found within the Java sites are quite different from the Acheulean type that are found in Africa and Europe in which this type of stone tools implicates the H. erectus or Homo ergaster culture. Thus, the tools that are found in Java might suggest a different set of the culture of H. erectus between African and Asian regions. Swisher et al. (1994) also suggest that these tools developed separately from the Acheulean types and might indicate that H. erectus might migrate out of Africa even before the Acheulean type of tools were developed. However, the stone tools found in the Java region are difficult for establishing the age that can link to the H. erectus fossils. The research and analyses (tools, deposits, and faunal analyses) above thus suggests that the Javanese fossils are to be placed in the Middle Pleistocene or approximately 1.66 ‚Äì 0.7 Ma.  Homo floresiensis: The \\"Hobbit\\" of Indonesia  In 2003 another human species was found at Liang Bua cave in Flores, eastern Indonesia. The fossils consist of cranial and some post-cranial remains of one individual, and a premolar from another individual in older deposits. The species was recognized as distinct from H. erectus and H sapiens on the basis of anatomical differences (including much smaller body size), and named Homo floresiensis. It has been suggested that the brain volume of these individuals was approximately around 400 cm3, similar to the African Australopithecus afarensis. However, H. floresiensis remains were dated to only 38 ka ‚Äì 18 ka ago (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene), using radiocarbon, luminescence, uranium-series and electron spin resonance (ESR) methods on sediments and associated artifacts.  Homo floresiensiss hunting technique  Apart from the remains, archaeologists also found stone (bifacial small core) or fleck tools in the same section of the individuals at least 32 of them and other 5,500 flakes per cubic meter on another section nearby. In addition, there is also a formal component found only with evidence of juvenile Stegodon and Komodo dragon, including points, perforators, blades and microblade that were probably hafted as barbs in which these tools indicate a selective hunting method. Although these stone artifacts seem to suggest the possibilities that these individuals use them, archaeologists are unable to establish which human species manufactured them since similar flakes tools and the remains of juvenile Stegodon and Komodo dragon are also found at the Soa Basin sites nearby as well. Despite this fact, the cognitive ability of H. floresiensis should not be underestimated. In addition, all evidence suggests another possibility of this species that they were able to migrate across the Wallace line into the Wallacean province in which according to geographical setting it was difficult to do. Nevertheless, scholars seem to agree that this H. floresiensis represent a species different from H. erectus and H. sapiens and overlapping with the presence of both in the region, raising the possibility that these species might have lived among each other before modern human fully colonized the region later on.

The Cygnus Loop is a gas with a distribution formed by a shock wave generated by a supernova explosion. There is a quartz sample with hypothetical cavitation wavefronts from Ukraine in the picture below (hand specimen). A shock wave should go through it as well. Rajlich's hypothesis is a physical hypothesis with a significance for geology. There exist macroscopic white lamellae inside quartz and other minerals in the Bohemian Massif and even at another places in whole of the world like wavefronts generated by a meteorite impact according to the hypothesis. The hypothetical wavefronts are composed of many microcavities. Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice. The cavities are usually made inside liquids, not in solid state media. The meteorite hit should fluidize the minerals, and mechanical waves of high frequency should tear them. Based on the technical practice it is known that a cavity implosion inside liquid generates high temperatures of thousands of kelvins and even a shock wave. There are found many intersecting systems of white lamellae inside quartz at many localities from the Bohemian Massif. It can be assumed that according to high number of wavefronts transferred through the minerals and resulting high number of cavity implosions, the structure of quartz was partially disrupted during the fluidization and the distribution of prevailing pressure was respected during the transfer into a solid state. There could be then preferred a creation of denser quartz in the area of higher pressure. This means a creation of smaller basic molecular Si-O rings. The situation in the area of lower pressure could be opposite. A finding of such harmonic signature of the quartz density is considered to be an option for the hypothesis verification. The author of the hypothesis is a Czech geologist Petr Rajlich. It is connected with the Czech Crater hypothesis.  Interesting facts  The shapes of the microcavities are between spheres and negative crystals. There is seen a probable erasure of older sets of lamellae by new sets in quartz with hypothetical cavitation lamellae, which is presented by Rajlich in few samples. A similar distribution is common in quartz with conventional PDF lamellae. Their presence is a today's recognized criterion for a verification of impact structures. Undulose extinction of fractured quartz affected by plastic deformation. The cavitation lamellae sometimes seem like small teeth or pillars, which is a well known effect from today's verified impact structures. The teeth become visible after acid etching. The effect is called pillaring. The minerals are not always cut by lot of lamellae, but are absolutely torn up or cut like slices. This is observable for example in the case of tourmalines from Czech pegmatites. The spacing of cavitation lamellae can be from millimeters up to meters. A consolidation into compact blocks by fluidization of more smaller grains is suggested in the case of large quartz cores from pegmatites. Ultrasonic cleaning effects that are well known from the technical practice are also discussed. Quartz between lamellae is very clear and thus contains almost no fluid inclusions. There exists an assumption that they collapsed due to many mechanical pulses. There is found a grooving pattern on some samples of quartz. It looks like surface waves. Many rose quartz samples from the whole of the world contain systems of white lamellae. A causal relationship between the shock metamorphism and the origin of rose color could define the rose quartz as a shocked mineral. A similar relationship could be true also in the case of other quartz varieties. Mechanical or electromagnetic waves move without mutual influencing. The cavitation lamellae intersect each other without visible mutual influencing, for example without mutual movements, as well. It is typical for various types of fractures and deformation lamellae that are connected with quartz undulose extinction. Rock fluidization due to a meteorite hit was already theorized and experimentally tested by H. J. Melosh and E. S. Gaffney in the 1980s. If we estimate the wavelength from the spacing of hypothetical cavitation lamellae, we get values that are equal to fractions of meters. We then obtain the frequencies in the order of min. 106 Hz from the assumption that the waves going through rocks were of higher speed than the speed of the meteorite just before the hit (tens of thousands meters per second). The initial pressure impuls should even generate the waves of frequencies in the order of 1013 Hz according to the hypothesis. This equals to typical frequencies of molecular vibrations. Such waves could be responsible for a short liquid behavior of quartz and other minerals. The white lamellae frequently segue into shapes of wispy trails. Real experiments in liquids showed that such structures arise after a collapse of traveling bubble cavitation.  Other Explanations  Zonal growths in amethyst. The evolution of white areas in given sample is very variable. There is a question whether the cavitation lamellae described by Rajlich could be basically just a frame of the sample in the photo or not.The white lamellae are conventionally explained by two other ways. They can be zonal growths or tensile fractures that could be reactivated (healed) in many ways. The first option is less probable, because the lamellae intersect each other. The zonal growths respect the crystallographic planes. The second option is much more probable. Variations of tensile fractures can be found for example in ice. An example can be the Jupiter's moon Europa that has a surface, which is cut by a dense net of fractures. However the tensile fractures and various ruptures have in comparison to hypothetical cavitation lamellae usually not a straight shape, they are radially distributed, cracked or one fracture is linked to another fracture in its certain part.

History The first Slovenians arrived in Venezuela between the two World Wars, although in a small number, estimated at about 50 people. After World War II small Slovenian community of about 500 members has been formed, which settled between 1947 and 1953, mostly from Primorska. This emigration was motivated by the dissatisfaction with the economic conditions and partly with the political conditions, and by the existing ties with the Slovenes in Venezuela. Based on different sources and testimonies, it is estimated that up to 1960 between 550 and 800 Slovenians arrived in Venezuela. Most of the Slovenes settled in Caracas and in smaller numbers in Valencia, Maracay, Maracaibo and Acarigua. In 1958 the Slovenian priest Janez Grilc arrived in Venezuela from Argentina, who proved to be an excellent organizer. That same year began the masses in Slovene language, also the pilgrimages with marked national qualities, they were followed the social and cultural meetings. In 1966, the association was formally founded in Caracas, Sv. Ciril in Metod \\", whose events were between 100 and 150 people. They organize pilgrimages, during St. Nicholas Day and the commemoration of the independence of Slovenia. At that time, they formed the Asociaci√≥n Eslovena (Slovenian Association) that continues active until the present, which propitiates an annual meeting in Valencia in which a pilgrimage is realized and a mass is officiated. Due to the small number of Slovenian residents, a cultural center of their own did not exist, so they participated in the events and celebrations of the Hogar Croata de Caracas (Croatian Club). From April 1959 onwards the newspaper \\"≈Ωivljenje - Vida\\" was published, with religious and informative themes.

Shetterly started working on the book in 2010. The book takes place from the 1930s through the 1960s when some viewed women as inferior to men. The biographical text follows the lives of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, three mathematicians who worked as computers (then a job description) at NASA, during the space race. They overcame discrimination there, as women and as African Americans. Also featured is Christine Darden, who was the first African-American woman to be promoted into the Senior Executive Service for her work in researching supersonic flight and sonic booms. The book reached number one on The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers list and got the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Nonfiction in 2017. The book was adapted as a film by the same name, released in 2016, that was nominated for three Oscars. It received numerous other awards. Topic Hidden Figures tells the story of three African-American women who worked as computers to solve problems for engineers and others at NASA. For the first years of their careers, the workplace was segregated and women were kept in the background as human computers. Author Margot Lee Shetterly's father was a research scientist at NASA who worked with many of the book's main characters. The book explains how these three historical women overcame discrimination and racial segregation to become three American achievers in mathematics, scientific and engineering history. The main character, Katherine Johnson, calculated rocket trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions. Johnson successfully \\"took matters into her own hands\\"; by being assertive with her supervisor; when her mathematical abilities were recognized, Katherine Johnson was allowed into all male meetings at NASA. Film The book was adapted as a film of the same name, written by Theodore Melfi and Allison Schroeder, and directed by Melfi. It was released on December 25, 2016 to positive reviews from critics, and received a nomination for Best Picture at the 89th Academy Awards. It received numerous other nominations and awards. Taraji P. Henson starred as mathematician Katherine Johnson, Octavia Spencer played Dorothy Vaughan, an African-American mathematician who worked for NASA in 1949, and Janelle Mon√°e played Mary Jackson, the first female African-American engineer to work for NASA. The movie made 231.3 million USD (United States Dollars). The budget of the film was 25 million USD. While the film is based on the book, author Margot Lee Shetterly agrees that there are differences between the two, and she finds that to be understandable. > For better or for worse, there is history, there is the book and then > there's the movie.

The seven days of rioting, looting, and destruction left more than 180 people injured, including 15 New Jersey state troopers, and resulted in an estimated $5,600,000 in damages.  Background  According to Katrina Martin in an article for the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Duke University, > \\"At the time of the riots, Asbury Park was a town of 17,000, 30% of which > were African-American. The town‚Äôs population increased to 80,000 with summer > vacationers. The Great Depression, followed by World War II, caused the > resort industry in Asbury Park to change dramatically to keep up with the > times. The fancy resort stays gave way to weekend vacationers. The community > maintained a steady resort community, but jobs at the resorts were > frequently outsourced to white youth in the surrounding areas instead of > local African American youth, which caused frustration in the community.\\" A number of demands for youth programming by local African-American leaders had gone unmet by town leaders in the years leading up to the riots. As one blogger put it, \\"With the temperature in the high 90‚Äôs, no jobs, no hope for jobs, no recreation programs, and no real indication that city fathers were listening to their concerns ‚Äì the west side youth were frustrated, angry and most likely feeling a sense of hopelessness.\\"  Events  The riots began on July 4, when African-American youth began breaking shop windows after a late dance at the West Side Community Center. By July 7, a list of twenty demands - including employment for black youth and appointment of black people on the Board of Education - was sent to the city by members of the black community.  Impacts  The riots caused an estimated $4,000,000 in damage, plus an additional $1,600,000 of cleanup costs. In the aftermath of the riots, the governor of New Jersey asked President Nixon to declare the city a disaster area. Many West side residents were displaced from their homes, and the neighborhood continued to be impacted for a number of years after the riots ended. The riots brought national attention to Asbury Park, New Jersey. The events received extensive coverage, not only in the local papers, but also in the New York Times and on the major television networks. However, they have received relatively little scholarly notice in the years following; in the words of historian Daniel Weeks, > \\"Some of the reasons for this neglect are obvious. Next to Los Angeles, > Detroit, or Newark, where major ‚Äúrace riots‚Äù took place in the 1960s, Asbury > Park is a small town. Then, too, in Asbury no one died, and historians, who > are never immune to the culture in which they live, tend to measure the > importance of civil unrest in terms of the death toll. But that is not to > say what happened in Asbury is unimportant, particularly to the history of > the city itself and to the history of New Jersey. Beyond these > considerations, the events in Asbury Park should be remembered as part of > what has been called the ‚ÄúBlack Revolt‚Äù of the 1960s.\\"  See also  * Civil rights movement * Mass racial violence in the United States * List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References 1970 in New Jersey Asbury Park, New Jersey Urban decay in the United States Riots and civil disorder in New Jersey ","title":"1970 Asbury Park race riots"},{"id":"52965213","text":"The Vokes Hill Corner to Cook Road is a remote unsealed outback track that links Vokes Hill Corner on the Anne Beadell Highway to Cook on the Trans- Australian Railway in the far west of South Australia. It was built by Len Beadell for the Australian Government's Weapons Research Establishment in late 1961. Background The Vokes Hill Corner to Cook road was built as part of a series of roads that were constructed to support the Woomera Rocket Range project during the 1950s and 1960s. The road provided access to the Trans- Australian Railway line for ease of re-supply, while construction of the Anne Beadell Highway was still taking place. It also completed a loop together with the Maralinga to Emu Road so that Native Patrol Officers could monitor the movements of Aboriginal people through the desert. Reconnaissance for the road was made difficult as the direction of sand ridges was across the path of Beadell's vehicle, and the northern half of the track was through thick mulga scrub. It was not until Beadell reached the Nullarbor Plain that the ground became firmer and more open. Construction from Vokes Hill Corner began on 23 September 1961 and reached Cook on 20 November 1961. En route the road passed three native wells that Beadell had re-located, namely Waldana, Churina and Bringyna. Vokes Hill was named during an expedition by explorer Richard Maurice in July 1901. His general hand and cook on the journey was William Paul Voake.

Anderson Walker (n√©e Annie E. Anderson) (October 5, 1855 ‚Äì June 9, 1929) was an African-American artist, known for her portraits, her work in pastels and for being one of the first African-American women to complete an institutional art education in the United States and exhibit at the Paris Salon. Biography La Parisienne, pastel of 1896, in the collection of Howard University Born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on October 5, 1855 to Nancy Cassidy and Francis Anderson, Walker was the youngest of five children. She entered the teaching profession at an early age, teaching in Jacksonville, Florida and Orrville, Alabama. After passing examinations before the Selma Board of Education, she was appointed a teacher in the Burwell Academy in Selma where she taught for several years. In 1875 she married Selma lawyer Thomas Walker in Dallas, Alabama. In 1890 she moved to Washington, DC and began private lessons in drawing and painting. After a year of private lessons Walker was admitted to the Corcoran School of Art, but was refused entry when it was discovered that she was black. When she appeared at the Corcoran, she was told by the admitting instructor that \\"...the trustees have directed me not to admit colored people. If we had known that you were colored, the committee would not have examined your work.\\" Walker was acquainted with abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and he wrote a powerful appeal to the administration on her behalf asking them to \\" ...reconsider this exclusion and admit Mrs. Walker to the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and thus remove a hardship and redress a grievous wrong imposed upon a person guilty of no crime and one in every way qualified to compete with others in the refining and ennobling study of art...\\" His appeal and others, however, drew no positive response and her rejection was not reversed. Within months of her rejection by the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Walker traveled to New York City to apply at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Susan N. Carter, Principal of the Women's Art School at the Cooper Union in 1892 related this about Walker : > \\"A young colored woman came to the Cooper Union a few months ago. She was > most ladylike and prepossessing in appearance. She brought with her a roll > of drawings, on which she had been admitted to the Art School of the > Corcoran Gallery in Washington. When she presented herself at that school, > she was refused a place there, on the ground of her color solely. She showed > me long letters from Frederick Douglas and others, protesting against such > an injustice; but the decision against her was not changed. Knowing of the > Cooper Institute, she came to New York to see about entering here. > Recognizing the wrong done to her race in her exclusion from a school in the > Capitol city of our country, twenty-seven years after our war was over, I > felt that I was honoring New York City, as well as the dear memory of Mr. > Cooper, if I let her at once have a place in my own office (as the class- > rooms were full), till a vacancy should occur in the drawing-class room. > This young colored girl is doing exceptionally well, and the kindness of her > teacher and companions has helped to soothe her former grief.\\" Walker studied at the Cooper Union from 1892 to 1895 and was a pupil of Thomas Eakins and John Henry Twachtman. Upon Walker's graduation in 1895, Susan N. Carter detailed her success at the school: > \\"It may be remembered that three years ago a colored woman from Washington, > D.C., was admitted to the Woman's Art School. Mrs. Annie E. A. Walker is her > name. Coming to the Cooper Union she was received here, where Mr. Peter > Cooper's free gift of instruction makes no distinction of race or > nationality. Mrs. Walker has been a very satisfactory scholar and now > graduates. She has earned and saved more than $600 since she entered the > Cooper Union, and will use this money for a year's study in Paris, after > which she proposes to open a studio for portrait painting. The energy, > ability and fine character of this colored woman are very encouraging, as > showing the possibilities of her race.\\" Watercolor of a man in 16th Century dress by Annie E. Anderson Walker After graduating in 1895, Walker sailed to Paris in September where she studied at the prestigious Acad√©mie Julian, likely the first African-American woman to do so. She was honored by being chosen to exhibit her work at the 1896 Paris Salon, the official juried art exhibition of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The work exhibited was a pastel drawing entitled La Parisienne, a portrait of a woman now in the collection of Howard University. After her studies, Walker traveled to London, Switzerland, and Italy. Walker returned to the United States in December of 1896, where she settled in Washington, D.C. She continued to paint and draw while balancing her responsibilities as the wife of a successful lawyer. However, two years after returning from Paris, Walker suffered a nervous breakdown, possibly due to the strain of societal pressure and expectations and ceased her artistic work, remaining an invalid, homebound, until her death in 1929 in Washington, D.C. Although Walker's promising career was tragically short, she was noted especially for her pastels, which were compared with those of Alice Pike Barney, and which were shown at Howard University. Art Historian Tritobia Hayes Benjamin, noted Walker's \\"..tireless courage, determination, and persistence in becoming an artist in the face of racism and sexism...\\" She describes Walker's work as \\"...academic in style and execution, and illustrates an active intuitive ability and spirit, as well as a masterful control of the medium.\\" Walker died on June 9th, 1929 at the age of 73 and was buried in Harmony Cemetery in Washington DC.

It is based on the books Berlin Game (1983), Mexico Set (1984), and London Match (1985) by Len Deighton. The two directors worked separately on different episodes. Filmed on location in Berlin and Mexico, the project included a large international cast with 3,000 extras and a budget of $8 million. While critically acclaimed, the ratings for the series were a disaster. Ian Holm was nominated for a BAFTA award for his portrayal of Bernard Samson. It was aired in 1989 in the United States as part of the PBS show Mystery! Plot synopsis The series focuses on Bernard Samson (Ian Holm), beginning with his search for the \\"mole\\" that threatens the Brahms Network in East Germany. Samson is sent to Berlin to bring out a Brahms agent. He is then sent to Mexico to try to persuade a KGB major (Gottfried John) to defect, using his childhood friend Verner Volkmann's wife Zena as bait. After it appears another traitor is working at London Central, Samson himself becomes one of the prime suspects.

The film, shot as a documentary, follows a group of Halloween haunted house creators as they prepare for the 2009 opening of their popular haunted attraction, Hell House. Tragedy strikes on opening night when an unknown \\"malfunction\\" causes the death of fifteen tour-goers and staff. The film reveals the lead-up to the tragedy and documenting what exactly went wrong that night which has been a mystery to the public. The film was released on a number of video on-demand platforms, including Amazon Video, Shudder, YouTube, Vudu, and iTunes, on November 1, 2016. A sequel, Hell House LLC II: The Abaddon Hotel, was released exclusively on Shudder on September 20, 2018. A second sequel, Hell House LLC III: Lake of Fire was released in September 2019. Story On October 8, 2009, Hell House LLC opened its doors to the public for their annual Halloween haunted tour, taking place outside of New York City for the first time in the small town of Abaddon in Rockland County, New York, just outside the city. The Hell House crew had picked the abandoned Abaddon Hotel for their haunt. By the following morning, fifteen tour-goers and staff were confirmed dead at the Hell House attraction. What happened during the opening night was unclear, and authorities only said an \\"unknown malfunction\\" occurred that night. It was produced as a \\"true story\\", but not all facts could be proven. Five years later, a documentary crew led by producer Diane Graves decides to investigate the tragedy further. They interview people familiar with the case, including a journalist who had broken into the closed-off abandoned hotel a few years after the incident and snapped controversial photos that led people to believe something more mysterious happened that night than what had been made public. The documentary team lands a break when the only surviving member of the Hell House staff, Sara Havel, agrees to be interviewed and provides them with never-before-seen footage shot by the members of Hell House themselves leading up to the night of the tragedy. The Hell House tapes start from there. They document the full Hell House crew (Alex, Sara, Mac, Tony, and Paul) and their arrival at the abandoned Abaddon Hotel, where they go to work on setting it up for their haunted attraction. As the days go on, unexplainable events begin to happen to the Hell House Crew. In a building escalation of paranormal events, Alex, the CEO of the company, is determined to press on and not allow his crew to be scared out of the hotel. Despite bitter disagreements between other members of Hell House, Alex convinces the group to stay and opening night goes on as planned. The footage reveals in eerie detail exactly how the tragedy took place and the paranormal forces behind the deaths of all fifteen tour- goers and staff. Production In 2011, the film's executive producers asked for a script revolving around a haunted attraction gone wrong. After many rewrites, the script was locked by late 2013. Casting took place in New York City in February 2014, and production took place shortly after, in May. Initially, the filmmakers were in search of an abandoned house to shoot the film in, as the original script had the events taking place in a house. As early as 2012, the director had been visiting many abandoned buildings and homes, including two in the New York county where the story takes place, Rockland County. After not finding anything suitable, they instead began searching for real haunted house attractions to shoot in. They found the haunted attraction called the Haunting at the Waldorf Hotel in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, run by Angie Moyer, who served as the film's set designer. The script had to be changed in a few areas to reflect the change in setting. After filming wrapped in Lehighton in May, the production then moved to New York City, where most of the interviews were filmed. In mid-June, filming was complete, and the movie went to post-production, where it would be edited for the next five months, before the first private screening of a rough cut would be seen in the Rose Studio at Lincoln Center. After a few more rounds of re- cuts, the film was locked just before its first public screening at the Telluride Horror Show in October 2015.

The Horror Society gave a score of 8.75 out of 10 and saying the mystery and suspense works for this film. Luke Rodriguez of Modern Horror was more critical of the film, saying that \\"it doesn't quite stick the landing\\", but otherwise enjoyed the film.  Trilogy  In an interview with Geeks of Doom Cognetti has stated that he sees the Hell House LLC trilogy as \\"one movie just divided into three acts and each movie is its own act\\". He further commented that he found it easy to write the second and third parts, as he knew \\"where I wanted to go with it from the get-go\\". Hell House LLC II: The Abaddon Hotel Hell House LLC II: The Abaddon Hotel was released on Shudder on September 20, 2018. The film's plot centers around a group of journalists who have gathered to explore the Abaddon Hotel, which has once again been abandoned following the events of the prior film. The movie further fleshes out the character of Andrew Tully, a character introduced in the first film, and his goal of opening a gate to hell. None of the journalists leave the abandoned hotel alive. The sole survivor found by the police is revealed to have been dead all along and sent out to intrigue people into visiting the hotel. Bloody Disgusting reviewed the film, criticizing it as a \\"well- intentioned misstep\\". Hell House LLC III: Lake of Fire Hell House LLC III: Lake of Fire was released as a Shudder exclusive on September 19, 2019. The film is styled as a documentary following Russell Wynn, a wealthy and mysterious entrepreneur who wants the Abaddon Hotel to serve as the location for an immersive theater experience called \\"Insomnia\\" based on Faust. Although aware of the location's history, he is keen to proceed with the venture despite others warning him of ongoing and frightening supernatural events. This prompts the documentary team to investigate Russell's past and the prior two events, uncovering new footage that implies Russell was involved with or was monitoring events. When opening night arrives chaos ensues, however Russell manages to wrestle Tully and overcome him before he can kill or take any other innocent lives. The following day one of the documentary crew muses that Russell was likely an angel sent back to defeat Tully and bring an end to his evil plans. Before the film ends, Russell manages to bring back the spirits of the original crew who died in the house, telling them that they are free from the evil but that the house still holds them captive. Film School Rejects was critical of the movie, stating that it was \\"an ambitious stab at closing out a horror trilogy, but as much as that‚Äôs an accomplishment worth celebrating the end result is an unfortunate disappointment. Still, fans of the first two ‚Äî or even the first one ‚Äî might find some worthwhile closure in the final swan song of the Abaddon Hotel.\\" The film currently holds a rating of 14% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 7 reviews.

Early life Surgal was born in 1916 in Chicago, Illinois, and attended the University of Chicago. He was stationed in London as a writer for the Armed Forces Network during World War II. Career Surgal worked as a writer for the BBC during the war. He then moved to New York City following the end of World War II, where he wrote scripts for radio (and co-creating the radio show, This Is the Underground), before transitioning to television scripts. He penned several episodes for the early NBC television series, Robert Montgomery Presents, including screen adaptations of Arrowsmith and The Canterville Ghost. Surgal became best known for his screenplay for Arthur Penn's 1965 surrealistic dramatic film, Mickey One. To craft the script for Mickey One, Surgal borrowed from his lengthy career as both a dramatic writer as well as a television comedy writer for Victor Borge, Bob Hope, Red Skelton, and Danny Thomas. While the film, which was released during a New York newspaper strike, initially flopped at the box office, Mickey One is now considered a cult classic, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Director Martin Scorsese later supervised the restoration of the film by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Surgal moved to Los Angeles, California in 1978, where he continued to work as a television producer and writer.

His notable paintings include historical and ecclesiastical portraits and murals, including portraits of two United States Presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, as well as notable figures Edward Teller, Eva Gabor, Barbara Sinatra, Ray Price, and Barbara Carrera. Early life and training Americo Makk, last name pronounced \\"Mahk\\", was born Imre Makk in 1927 in a town in western Hungary once known as Gy≈ërszentm√°rton, and later renamed Pannonhalma.Henderson, Shelby (1986). \\"Makk Family: A Vision of Life\\", Makk Studios, Honolulu, HI. His home stood in the shadow of the Pannonhalma Archabbey. Americo's father was financial supervisor to the Benedictine monks who resided in the Abbey and taught in the local school. Americo began sketching at age 6. By the time he was 8, the Benedictine Brothers, with whom he studied, encouraged him further into art.Mary Burke Rossi, \\"The Road Leads to Freedom\\", Second in a Series, Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday, April 28, 1967. Americo was 12 when the communist Russian army first invaded Hungary. At this time, his passion for painting became inexorable. His parents cautioned Americo that pursuing art as a vocation would lead to poverty, and that a career in architectural engineering was more suitable. Americo's formal training as a painter began at the Hungarian National Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest from 1945 through 1948. At the age of 21, he received a scholarship to Italy, and studied at the Academy of Fine Art in Rome beginning in 1948.Belden, Dorothy, \\"Beautiful Art for a Troubled World\\", \\"Hungarian Couple, Son Paint in Romantic Style\\", Lively Arts, The Wichita Eagle, KS, Sunday, November 4, 1979. As Hungary was effectively under the control of communism becoming a satellite state of the Soviet Union and administered by the Hungarian People's Republic, he had doubted the authorities would allow him to accept the scholarship in Rome. Americo was reserved in conveying his memories of the communist takeover in interviews for fear of reprisals against family members still in Hungary, simply describing the period as \\"very unpleasant.\\" However, where his words could not describe, his painting of the Russian takeover was reported as depicting \\"all the grief and agony that the people of Hungary have suffered...\\" Mertens, Susan, \\"Adapt and flourish\\", The Vancouver Sun, B.C., Friday, December 5, 1980. Once in Rome, Americo focused his studies on ecclesiastical art and the works of Renaissance masters, such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.Simoni, John P., \\"Painting Added to Collection\\", Lifestyle, Art in the Bluestem, The El Dorado Times, KS, January 1, 1982. While studying at the Academy, Americo met Eva Holusa, then 16, a fellow student also of Hungarian descent, whom he later married and worked alongside for the remainder of his life. He went on to instruct at the Rome Academy of Fine Art. It was then that he won the Vatican Portrait Award with a portrait of Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, a figure personifying opposition to communism in Hungary in support of religious freedom, which was installed in the Vatican for permanent display.Ledoux, Larry (1982). \\"Makk, Americo, Eva, A.B.\\", Herff Jones Publishers, Logan Utah. Career Brazil and life as the Makks (1949‚Äì1962) One of Four in a Series, Mural of Brazilian Chief Ajuricaba, by Americo Makk In 1949, Americo Makk followed Eva Holusa and moved to S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Eva's father, Dr. Bertalan Holusa, a former economic and agricultural adviser to Ethiopia's Haile Selassie, had fled from Africa with his family, to France in 1937 as a result of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and then to S√£o Paulo with its rapid industrialization. The official language in Brazil was Portuguese. \\"Imre\\" in Portuguese is \\"Americo\\" and it was here where Americo adopted the Portuguese translation for his name. Americo and Eva married in S√£o Paulo on October 18, 1950. In 1951, they were appointed Professors of Fine Arts at the Academia de Belas Artes. That same year, their son, Americo Bartholomew, A.B. Makk, a respected artist in his own right, was born. While in Brazil, Americo and Eva Makk jointly painted fourteen Catholic cathedrals, churches and basilicas.Love, Frances, Art Center Director, \\"Makk Family to Discuss International Art\\", The Daily Advertiser, Lafayette, LA, Friday, February 13, 1981. Their most famous cathedral painting, \\"Coronation of Our Lady\\", was a 2,349 square foot (218 square meters) al-secco ceiling in the Cathedral of Manaus, the largest single motif painting in the world, which depicts the coronation of the Virgin Mary in her crowning as the Queen of Heaven.LeDoux, \\"Makk Painting: The Romance of Yesterday, The Delights of Today\\", Art Gallery, A Magazine of Fine Art and Photography, January 1983/1984. The mural reportedly took two years to complete, working 60 to 100 feet in the air on wood scaffolding in \\"stifling heat and little light.\\" Tsutsumi, Cheryl Chee, \\"The Makk Family\\", Aloha, The Magazine of Hawaii, 1982. Americo Makk reported rats getting into the paints, and he suffered a fall from the scaffolding while painting.Whitaker, William, Entertainment Editor, \\"Artist Battled Rats in Cathedral\\", Abilene Reporter News, Abilene, TX, Sunday, November 16, 1980 During the period from 1958 through 1962, the Makks were appointed the Official Artists of the, then democratic, Brazilian government painting government officials and murals, as well as church officials in Brazil, including Sobral Bishop Dom Jos√© Tupinamb√° da Frota. At this time, Americo and Eva merged their independent styles by working side-by- side on the expansive cathedral murals that appeared to be painted by one hand.Ampersand, \\"Treasures Shared, Art brings together a famous family and Honolulu Couple\\", Alexander & Baldwin, Inc., Spring 1985. From then on, Americo and Eva became synonymous with each other's work and the Makk family brand, \\"Casal Makk\\" (Portuguese for \\"Makk couple\\"), was created.Adams, Anthony, \\"Feast of Art At the Fair\\", Long Island Press, NY, Sunday, April 26, 1964. The remaining cathedral wall and ceiling paintings by the Makks are tourist attractions in Brazil to this day, which are signed Casal Makk, such as those found in the Parish of Our Lady of Patronage (Nossa Senhora do Patrocinio) in Jau, State of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Americo Makk, Amazonas, 1959 Amazon expedition (1957‚Äì1959) In 1957, their cathedral work culminated with a request via telegram from the Governor of Amazonas, Plinio Coelho, for an assignment to travel the Amazon jungle, also known as the Amazon rainforest or Amazonia, to study the remaining indigenous Indian tribes, which were thinning by a boom of industrial growth and deforestation.Rossi, Mary Burke, Women's Editor, \\"The Makk Story, Mural Tourist Attraction\\", Fourth in a Series, Herald Courier, New Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 12, 1967. Both Governor Coehlo, and the Mayor of Manaus, Gilberto Mestrinho, later to succeed Coelho as Governor, co-sponsored the expedition, which was planned to last approximately one to two years. Paintings were the medium of choice for the project, as it was known that some tribes hidden in the darkness of the jungle became anxious or reacted violently to camera flashes or flashbulbs.LeDoux, Larry, \\"Art that's all in the family\\", Kauai Beach Press, August 14‚Äì20, 1987. For the year preceding the trip, Americo and Eva Makk explored areas of the rainforest to get acquainted with the subject matter. In 1958, the Makks, including 8 year-old A.B. with pet ocelot \\"Cica\\" (Hungarian for \\"cat\\"), accompanied by guides and a Catholic missionary priest, embarked on their expedition to study the flora, fauna and inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest. The expedition began in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, and the heart of the Amazon jungle.Dietz, Betty, \\"Da Vinci Never Had Such Help\\", Dayton Daily News, OH, Tuesday, December 3, 1963. The trip spanned over 1,000 miles of travel by foot, river boat, canoe, small plane and helicopter; there were no roads.Mary Burke Rossi, \\"Mural Tourist Attraction\\", The Makk Story, Fourth in a Series, Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 12, 1967. They planned to meet guides at designated checkpoints, who were considered friendly Indians of various tribes. Travel was difficult due to frequent rains that turned to floods washing away landmarks. With high humidity and rain, the Makks described suffering frequent bites from small black insects, called \\"piums\\". Some tribes they met along the way believed that to have their image painted would result in their souls being stolen, thus simple sketches were made in those regions.Whitaker, Bill, Entertainments Editor, \\"Bogeyman were real growing up in Brazil\\", Abilene Reporter News, TX, Thursday, November 13, 1980.Rossi, Mary Burke, \\"The Amazon Jungle... A Green Inferno\\", Part VI, Herald Courier, New Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 26, 1967. Through the expedition, the Makks gathered and recorded images of varying indigenous people of Brazil, which included the Macus, Bare, Tucano and Boca Negra (Tenharim).Rossi, Mary Burke, Women's Editor, \\"Mission to the Amazin' Amazon\\", Fifth in a series, Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday, May 19, 1967. They often sketched subjects through the trip, painting them later. The Makks' memories of the trip were preserved in an estimated 70 paintings. In a 1982 interview for Aloha Magazine, Eva Makk described the Amazon jungle, \\"Sometimes it was so dark and dense, we had to use flashlights at high noon in order to see... I think of it as a forbidden cathedral of God.\\" Upon their return, the Makks painted four large murals in the Palace of the Governor in Manaus, Palacio Rio Negro. One of the four paintings was of Brazilian Chief Ajuricaba leading his warriors with bow and arrow into battle against invading Portuguese forces armed with forged weaponry and armor during the expansion of Portuguese colonization of the Americas. Paintings marked \\"Amazonas\\" denoted the origin and time frame of the painting rather than a title. A small portion of their Amazon paintings was exhibited at the Brazilian consulate in Miami, Florida, in May 1969.Pottorff, Claire, \\"Internationalists Display Here\\", The Miami Beach Sun, FL, Vol 40, No. 156, Friday, May 2, 1969.Miami Herald, \\"Art Work Displayed\\", No. 153, Miami, FL, Friday May 2, 1969. In an interview from 1981, when asked whether he would have attempted the trip a second time, Americo responded, \\"It would be too dangerous to try now. It was too dangerous then. But we (he and Eva) had an artistic feeling and desire to meet challenges, to know and to paint what no one had ever painted before. So we accepted the invitation of the government. We were both ‚Äòofficial artists of Brazil.‚Äô But when it was over, we decided we would never do anything like that again. Because you only have one life.\\"Kerns, William, \\"Acclaimed Artists Exhibit Works\\", Lubbock Avalanche Journal, Lubbock, TX, May 13, 1981 Move to New York City (1962‚Äì1967) By 1960, the communist movement controlled television, radio and the press in S√£o Paulo. Foodstuffs and gasoline were luxuries. As a result of the increasing political unrest in Brazil, the Makks worked on immigrating to the United States to once again escape communism, which took two years to accomplish. As they continued work on church paintings, the Makks often thought whether the communists would soon destroy them.Rossi, Mary Burke, Women's Editor, \\"America- Paradise for the Makks\\", The World of Art Part VIII, The Herald Courier, Hyde Park, NY, Friday June 9, 1967.

They left behind most of their belongings in Brazil to allow room for the Amazon paintings and sketches, taking with them four suitcases and a small amount of cash. On May 10, 1962, knowing very little English, the Makks arrived at Idlewild Airport, in Queens, NY. Both Americo and Eva began exhibiting their work in New York in 1963. Returning to their ancestral roots with a Hungarian colony in New York, they began preserving Hungarian history and culture in their work. They also continued painting under contract for the Ecclesiastical Art Studio of New York to restore and decorate church ceilings and mural painting.

Relocation to Hawaii (1967‚Äì2015) In 1967, before going to Paris for the Salle d' Exposition in Paris, the Makks visited Hawaii and made the decision to relocate to the island of Oahu that same year. The reason for the change was in part due to Americo's health concerns, which included arthritis affecting his hands. The Makk family resides in Hawaii as of 2017. Detail of horse's breath from \\"Windy Crossing\\" The Presidents and beyond In 1967, Americo, as well as Eva, expanded their repertoire of paintings dedicated to the culture, heritage and history of the American old west, which included the American Indians when the Los Angeles Museum sent him to sketch ranches in California, a subject also pursued in Texas.

Eva Makk painted a portrait of the President and Nancy Reagan together, which was 60 inch by 40 inch.

Makk's portrait dramatizes the soul and significance of a strong American President.\\" In 1984, Americo was commissioned to paint Dr. Edward Teller. The painting was presented to Dr. Teller and displayed in the United States Senate Rotunda in May 1984 along with other retrospective works by the Makks.

This marks Ho's directorial debut after being a longtime scriptwriting partner of Neo's, and one of two films distributed by mm2 Entertainment during the Chinese New Year period in 2017, the other being The Fortune Handbook. Plot On a venture to turn over a new leaf and break away from their past misdemeanours, Ah Hu and his 3 other cell mates set up a new F&B; venture selling Japanese ramen. But being ex-convicts hinder their success and their inability to fit in with society lands them in numerous comical situations. Their clumsiness ultimately causes the business to flounder. Unwilling to give up the good fight and believing that change will bring about a solution, the four friends come up with a new idea; a 3-in-1 tuition center for students that also provides F&B; and massage services for their parents. Good times don‚Äôt last when Ah Hu‚Äôs nemesis, Di Tie kidnaps his estranged son. Having sworn never to fall back to the path of wrongdoing, it is down to Ah Hu and his friends to save his son without weapons, alerting the cops, and breaking the law. So begins a daring yet entertaining rescue mission. Cast * Wang Lei as Mad Dog * Ryan Lian as Ah Hu * Maxi Lim as Jian Ren * Gadrick Chin as Sha Bao * Chen Tianwen as Di Tie, Ah Hu's old nemesis * Dennis Chew as Ah Hong * Henry Thia as Hei Ge, Ah Hu's ex-gang leader * Charmaine Sei as Ah Yu, Ah Hu's older sister * Kanny Theng as Joey, Jian Ren's love interest * Shawn Ho as Ah Guang, Ah Hu's son Production Pre-production Neo, whose films has been associated with Chinese New Year, said in an interview with The Straits Times that \\"it's time to give other new film-makers a chance to make their own films\\". As such, he made Ho, who co-wrote the script for Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen, Long Long Time Ago and the \\"That Girl\\" segment of 7 Letters, the director of Take 2, while he serves as executive producer and provides Ho with directorial advice. Casting and crew Wang Lei, who plays Mad Dog in the film, signed up \\"without hesitation\\" because the role mirrors his life experience as a former gambler. Lian, who had taken on minor roles for 17 years, and starred as a gangster in Long Long Time Ago, would be making his debut as one of the leads. In order to fully immerse himself in his role of a former convict, Lian would interact with ex-convicts to understand their lives better. According to an interview with the New Paper, he would \\"eat and talk with them for about three hours (almost every day)\\", \\"(watch) the way they behaved, and they would share their life stories\\". Dennis Chew, who had previously cross-dressed as Aunty Lucy in Paris and Milan, would take on the role of the lady boss of a tuition centre, among five other roles. For this role, he had to put on a female bodysuit, which had to be custom made and ordered from overseas. It takes 1 hour and 10 minutes for Chew to finish the costume and makeup. Shawn Ho, then a final-year student studying for a Higher Nitec in film-making at ITE College Central, was approached by the casting directors on the first day of his internship to play Ryan Lian's son in the film, after they have auditioned many people. In order to prepare for his role, he had to brush up on his Mandarin skills using a personal tutor. Filming Filming started on June 23, 2016, and ended in end July. Reception Critical reception Rachel Chan of The New Paper rated the film a 3.5 out of 5 stars, feeling that \\"it is nice to see a heavy topic on ex-convicts being made into a light-hearted film while still keeping the comedic factor and emotions running high\\". Boon Chan of The Straits Times rated the film a 2.5 out of 5 stars, feeling that Ho \\"cannot quite decide if he wants to do a drama or a comedy\\", and Lian, being the film's lead, \\"surrounded here by discordant notes, from Dennis Chew in a number of cross- dressing roles to Chen Tianwen as a crazily flamboyant nemesis to a bizarre soundtrack of European songs\\", drawing the attention away from him.

The beginnings of \\"Murphy's Manor\\" were difficult. Erichsen's friend gave him a gay bar guide in which the publisher wanted someone to draw cartoons for two newspapers. Unfortunately, this did not work out and so Erichsen decided to publish \\"Murphy's Manor\\" on his own. The series was carried in about 70 papers over the course of its run, which continued until 2008. In 2019 Erichsen published new strips Murphy's Manor: the 30-Year Wedding.

At one time serving as Professor of Latin and Belles-lettres at Mary Sharp College, she went on to occupy the position of Matron and Professor of Rhetoric in the college. In 1841, she married Prof. Zuinglius Calvin Graves (1816‚Äì1902), who was serving as president of Kingsville Academy. She was the author of several books including juvenile literature under the pseudonym of \\"Aunt Alice\\". She also contributed prose and verse to periodical literature. In her day, Graves was one of the most popular writers of the South. Her best-known works were: Life of Columbus; Poems for Children; Seclusarval, or the Arts of Romanism; and Jephtha's Daughter, a drama. Early years and education Adelia Cleopatra Spencer was born in Kingsville, Ohio, March 17, 1821. She was the daughter of Dr. Daniel M. Spencer and Marian T. Cook, and a niece of Platt Rogers Spencer, the originator of the Spencerian script. Graves' mother was an intellectual. Her family was wealthy and cultured, all the men having for generations had the benefit of collegiate education. Her father especially excelled in the Greek and Latin languages. Graves spent her early life on the shores of Lake Erie, where she resolved to devote her life to literature. She loved to be alone, passing her time on the beach, or in the old forests near where she had been born. Her love of nature was a passion, the record of which was preserved in some of her earliest unpublished poems. Stanzas written before she was nine years old were models of correct versification, exhibiting simplicity of expression and happy choice of words which characterized the productions of her more mature years. She wrote because she could not restrain the flow of thoughts, taking shape in rhymes. She was a graduate of Kingsville Academy. Career In 1841, she married Dr. Zuinglius Calvin Graves, who was at that time president of Kingsville Academy; later, president of Soule College; and founder and president of Mary Sharp College. A few years after her marriage, Graves received a bad injury, which crippled her physical energies. For five years, she could not walk across her room; and later found it difficult to walk a short distance. For years, she taught classes in languages in the Kingsville Academy. At Mary Sharp College, there were few positions she did not occupy at some point, save that of mathematics. For 32 years, she was matron and professor of rhetoric, belles-lettres, elocution, and English composition. She also taught French, ancient history, ancient geography, and English literature. The published works of Graves include Seclusaval, or the Arts of Romanism (1870), a work written to deter Protestants from sending children to Catholic schools; and Jephtha's Daughter, a drama, (1867). Besides these, there were two prize stories. Twelve or thirteen small volumes were also compiled from the Southern Child's Book, at the request of the Southern Baptist Sabbath School Union, for the use of Sunday schools. For years, Graves edited and wrote for that publication. She wrote the Old Testament Catechism in Rhyme (1859), on request of the same society, for African American slaves, for which she received a line. Her unpublished poems were numerous. Graves contributed to different periodicals, mostly fugitive poems, and two prose tales, and a prize tale. \\"Ruined Lives,\\" published in the Southern Repository, in Memphis, Tennessee, and the drama of Jephthah's Daughter, were some of her other published works.

On September 17, 1922, the two political organizations merged into the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and on May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, By A. W.

The cadets was a quasi-military youth organization of the Nationalist Party also known as the \\"Liberation Army of Puerto Rico\\". There he met and befriended fellow cadet Hiram Rosado. Events leading to a massacre In 1931, the U.S.-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. named Dr. Carlos E. Chard√≥n as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1935, Chard√≥n initiated a project based on the ideas of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who at the time was a Senator in the Puerto Rican legislature and member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. It was known as the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico Project. The plan, which was within the New Deal criteria established by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression, was well received and became known as Plan Chard√≥n.Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia, Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938; p. 292; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); On October 20, 1935, in a political meeting which the Nationalist Party held in the town of Maunabo and which was transmitted by radio, Albizu Campos denounced Chard√≥n, the university deans and the Liberal Party as traitors, saying they wanted to convert the university into an \\"American\\" propaganda institution.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 305 On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university who supported Chard√≥n began to collect signatures for a petition to declare Albizu Campos \\"Student Enemy Number One.\\" In turn, a protest against the group by the pro-Nationalist faction of students denounced Chard√≥n and the Liberal Party as agents of the United States. The R√≠o Piedras massacre Don Pedro Albizu Campos in 1936 On October 24, 1935, a student assembly held at the university declared Albizu Campos as persona non grata. Chard√≥n requested that the governor provide armed police officers on the university grounds, in case the situation turned violent. Two police officers spotted a \\"suspicious-looking vehicle\\" and asked the driver, Ram√≥n S. Pag√°n, and his friend Pedro Qui√±ones, for identification. A struggle ensued, and the police killed Pag√°n and Qui√±ones. According to the local newspaper \\"El Mundo\\" of Oct. 25th, an explosion, followed by gunfire, was heard resulting in the additional deaths of Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Vega and Jos√© Santiago Barea.

Riggs Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs was born in Georgetown, a historic neighborhood located in northwest Washington, D.C.. Riggs was a former officer in the United States Army who was appointed Chief of Police of Puerto Rico in 1933, by Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico. He was an unpopular police chief, stemming from his decisions to repress the growing sugar cane labor movement and the Nationalist Pro-Independence Movement.\\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America‚Äôs Colony\\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); . The R√≠o Piedras Massacre enraged the nationalists. Beauchamps and the nationalists believed that Elisha Francis Riggs was responsible since Riggs was the police chief of Puerto Rico and the entire Insular Police took their orders from Riggs. He decided to retaliate and avenge the deaths of the four men killed in the massacre with the help of Rosado. On Sunday, February 23, 1936, Elisha F. Riggs had attended mass in the Church of Santa Ana in San Juan. When the mass was over, Riggs stepped out of the church and got into his car, a Packard, driven by Angel Alvarez, a police officer. Rosado knew the route which Riggs would normally take and waited. When Riggs' car reached the corner of Allen and Gambaro streets, Rosado came out of his hideout and began shooting towards Riggs. Rosado then made a run for it, but was soon captured by Alvarez. All the while, Riggs got out of his car and began asking for the declarations of those who witnessed the attempt on his life. He was suddenly approached by Beauchamps who said: Believing that he had a witness to the events Riggs told Beauchamps that he was headed to the police station and to accompany him. Beauchamps boarded Riggs chauffeured car and shot Riggs in the head killing him instantly. Beauchamp tried to escape by hiding inside the nearby Rodriguez y Palacios warehouse in Tetuan Street. Beauchamps and Rosado were arrested and Beauchamp was photographed by the local news media giving a cadet military salute before he and Rosado were taken to the San Juan police headquarters. The police station was located in 305 San Francisco Street. Instead of receiving a fair trial, Beauchamps and Rosado were both gunned down by the police in the police station.\\"The Puerto Ricans: A Documentary History\\"; by: Markus Wiener Publishers; 2008; Page 179 Beauchamps died immediately and Rosado was transferred to a local hospital where he later died of the gun wounds which he received. In the aftermath of the killings, the police claimed that the nationalists were shot because they attempted to escape. None of the police officers involved were demoted or suspendedOfficer Down Memorial Page The news of the assassination of Elisha F. Riggs spread throughout the United States. At that time Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, was in Washington, D.C. and Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935‚Äì1937), asked him to condemn Riggs' assassination. Mu√±oz Mar√≠ntof told Gruening that he would do so only if he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering the Nationalists in the city police station without a trial. Gruening then joined US Senator Millard Tydings a Democrat from Maryland, in a legislative proposal to grant independence to Puerto Rico. However, the bill did not progress in Congress. Post assassination After Riggs' assassination, many Nationalist Party leaders were imprisoned. Members of the Puerto Rican independence movement came under greater scrutiny and persecution. Among the leaders arrested was Pedro Albizu Campos, These leaders were charged with having \\"conspired to overthrow\\" the U.S. government on the island. They were tried in Boston, Massachusetts, as that federal district court had jurisdiction for Puerto Rico. The first trial jury ended in a hung jury. A second jury was picked, consisting solely of \\"Anglo-Americans.\\" This jury found every Nationalist charged to be \\"guilty\\".Historical Timeline, PR Dream The bodies of both nationalists were returned to their respective families.

The film is produced by Rohit Khattar and Ashi Dua. The film was released on 12 January 2018. Plot Rileen (Saif Ali Khan) receives news of his growing stomach cancer, which is at the last stage. He is left heartbroken, but remains quiet in front of everyone. He decides to live life to the fullest, by smoking and taking LSD from a friend, but yet remains unhappy. His engaged brother Angad (Akshay Oberoi) is getting ready when he receives a call from his ex-girlfriend, Selina (Amanda Rosario) to a hotel. Angad sets out to meet her along with Rileen under the excuse of a haircut. In the next story, we see Tara (Sobhita Dhulipala) packing her bags to pursue higher studies in the US, while her boyfriend Zubin (Kunaal Roy Kapur) is trying to convince her to change her plans. Hours before her flight, both of them attend a birthday party, but soon the police raid the place. Tara is nervous as her flight leaves in two hours, but she can't leave as the police have locked the place down. She manages to escape with her friends and Zubin in a car. In the car, Zubin and Tara have a heated argument over Tara kissing a guy, Tara loses control and hits a motorcycle killing two people. Tara feels guilty, but leaves when Zubin and her friends advise her not to go to the police. Meanwhile, Rileen is hallucinating due to the LSD. He meets a transgender woman Sheila (Nary Singh), and coolly tells her that he wants to see her \\"Southern Hemisphere\\", with no touching or feeling, and succeeds in doing so. Rileen becomes happy and decides to fulfill other things on his bucket list. The next story is of two goons who want to make it big, Mafia (Deepak Dobriyal) and Rahmat (Vijay Raaz). They hatch a plan to extract money from their own boss Raza (Asif Basra) and cook up a story. Meanwhile, during a party, Ustad (Neil Bhoopalam), who has helped Raza, is killed on the road by two motorcycle-borne assailants. Mafia and Rahmat witness the crime. Angad learns that Selina is just using him and feels guilty about cheating on Neha (Amyra Dastur), his fianc√©e. Angad meets Neha and talks to her. Angad learns that Neha is a very nice girl he can get and both of them hug each other and get ready for marriage. Mafia's greed pushes him to kill Rahmat and he takes the entire money. He then shoots himself in the abdomen and tells Raza that someone has robbed their money and killed Rahmat and in that fight Mafia too got injured. Raza doesn't believe Mafia and is on the verge of killing Mafia, but leaves him. Mafia walks onto the road. Rileen meets the wedding photographer Rakhi (Isha Talwar) and tells his son too had a birthmark like her on his elbow. Rakhi asks him his name but he states that \\"People just meet, tell each other their names and then go away, which is of no use. He also tells her about his growing cancer. Rakhi comforts Rileen and they kiss each other. On being asked \\"What does he mean to her?\\", she replies \\"I don't know!\\" He happily laughs and tells her his name is Rileen. Tara checks into the airport while Zubin asks her not to think of the horrific night. Tara feels very guilty and decides to approach the police and file an FIR, but the police asks her not to do so as the two guys who were killed in the accident were underworld shooters who killed Ustad. Tara meets Zubin waiting for her. She gets to know he truly loves her and proposes him for marriage and then kisses him. Rileen marches into the dance ceremony of the marriage where everyone is dancing mindlessly along with Angad and Neha. Rileen dances, takes out his gun and scares everyone. He fires two bullets in the air; one of the bullets rises high up in the sky then goes down hitting Mafia on head, thus killing him. In the final scene, Rileen looks into the camera and screams as the second bullet has hit his foot.

It was triggered by the resignation of Herb Graham, the deputy premier in the Labor government of John Tonkin, on 30 May 1973. Like the earlier 1971 Ascot by-election, the Balcatta by-election was of great importance to the Labor Party, as a loss would have seen it reduced to minority government. The party retained the seat despite a 16.5-point negative swing, with Brian Burke (a future premier) outpolling the Liberal candidate, Neil Beck, by only 30 votes on the two-party-preferred count. Burke had been behind Beck on first preferences, but passed him after the preferences of the Australia Party candidate were distributed. Background Herb Graham had held Balcatta for the Labor Party since the seat's re-creation at the 1962 state election, and had served in parliament since 1943. He was made deputy premier under John Tonkin following Labor's victory at the 1971 election, but the pair had frequent differences of opinion. Graham resigned from parliament on 30 May 1973 and was instead appointed chairman of the Licensing Court of Western Australia. After his resignation, the writ for the by-election was issued on 1 June, with the close of nominations on 28 June. Polling day was on 28 July, with the writ returned on 17 August. Results Aftermath The Tonkin government was defeated at the 1974 state election, which also saw Balcatta abolished in a redistribution. Burke transferred to the seat of Balga, and remained in parliament until his retirement in 1988. He was elected leader of the Labor Party in 1981, and became premier at the 1983 state election.Brian Thomas Burke, Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

At the age of 12 he was selected to be part of the representative youth team of the province of SAP Kosovo. They finished in first place at the tournament of the Yugoslav republics and provinces held in Borovo and immediately after, Yugoslav youth national team managers, Stevan Vilotiƒá and Ante Mladiniƒá, called him to the Yugoslav national team to the tournament in Monte Carlo. Immediately upon their return, Stjepan Bobek and Marko Valok, who were coaching at the time FK Galenika Zemun, brought Lala along with his V√´llaznimi teammate ƒêokica Stanojeviƒá, to the club. Zemun is a suburb of capital Belgrade, and initially Lala had difficulties in adapting since he was coming from a rural area. After six months Lala was already feeling at home. The team was playing well with attractive football displayed by a number of great teammates, and all this was resulting in major enthusiasm and support from the fans. Around mid-1970s, as a player of FK Galenika Zemun, Lala was playing for Yugoslav youth national team at the Monte Carlo tournament in honour of Prince Charles. At that initial period he also played for the National amateur team of Yugoslavia and also the Yugoslav Olympic team. At that time footballers were starting to become real media stars and Lala gradually rose to fame and was considered a local star, especially in Zemun. His great performances with FK Zemun in the Yugoslav First and Second LeaguesStats from Yugoslav First and Second Leagues at zerodic.com made him grow in prominence significantly. At some point, after filming a movie \\"Trener\\" (translated \\"Coach\\") in which Lala was an actor, the president of Red Star Belgrade, Dragan D≈æajiƒá along with his associates Branko Stankoviƒá and Stevan Ostojiƒá, spoke with Lala about the possibility of him joining \\"the giants\\", Red Star. Unfortunately, the transfer was never realised. Then Vladica Kovaƒçeviƒá arranged a move of Simo Nikoliƒá and Lala to Olympique Lyonnais, however, Zemun management decided that only one could leave, and they chose Nikoliƒá over Lala. During the long period Lala spent at Zemun, he was also at trials in New York to join New York Cosmos but president of the club, Georgije Bo≈°koviƒá, was advised by the coach that Lala was crucial for the club and that they couldn't let him go, so his transfer to Cosmos did not materialise. Lala was part of the generation that took Zemun to the semi-finals of the 1981‚Äì82 Yugoslav Cup in which they lost against Red Star, but previously eliminating Hajduk Split and also winning against Partizan Belgrade, on their home court, by 2‚Äì0 with Lala scoring the first goal. All in all, Lala spent his entire senior career at FK Zemun becoming one of club's greatest legends, having played over 350 official matches. His speed, agility, explosiveness, dribbling and general creativity of playing on the field left his fans in awe and inspired many to play football afterwards. After retiring Lala led the youth department of FK Zemun which produced numerous notable players such as Nenad D≈æodiƒá, Ilija Stolica, Nenad ƒêorƒëeviƒá, Mateja Ke≈æman and many more. He was declared an honorary citizen of Zemun by the Zemun Municipality. Personal life With time, he has dedicated himself more to painting. He married at age 41 to his wife Kimet which he met during holidays in Gjakova, and has two children, a son Eduard and a daughter Edita both born and living in Belgrade, Zemun.

It is marked by hyperinflation, escalating starvation, disease, crime and mortality rates, resulting in massive emigration from the country. According to economists interviewed by The New York Times, the situation is the worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history and the worst facing a country in peace time since the mid-20th century and is more severe than that of the United States during the Great Depression, of the 1985‚Äì1994 Brazilian economic crisis, or of the 2008‚Äì2009 hyperinflation in Zimbabwe. Other American writers have also compared aspects of the crisis such as unemployment and GDP contraction to Bosnia and Herzegovina after the 1992‚Äì1995 Bosnian War as well as Russia, Cuba and Albania following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989. * On 2 June 2010, Ch√°vez declared an \\"economic war\\" due to increasing shortages in Venezuela. The crisis intensified under the Maduro government, growing more severe as a result of low oil prices in early 2015, * and a drop in Venezuela's oil production from lack of maintenance and investment. The government failed to cut spending in the face of falling oil revenues, and has dealt with the crisis by denying its existence * and violently repressing opposition. Extrajudicial killings by the Venezuelan government became common, with the United Nations (UN) reporting 5,287 killings by the Special Action Forces in 2017, with at least another 1,569 killings recorded in the first six months of 2019; the UN had \\"reasonable grounds to believe that many of these killings constitute extrajudicial executions\\" and characterized the security operations as \\"aimed at neutralizing, repressing and criminalizing political opponents and people critical of the government\\". The UN also stated that the Special Action Forces \\"would plant arms and drugs and fire their weapons against the walls or in the air to suggest a confrontation and to show the victim had resisted authority\\" and that some of the killings were \\"done as a reprisal for [the victims'] participation in anti-government demonstrations\\".\\"Venezuela Forces Killed Thousands, Then Covered It Up, U.N. Says.\\" New York Times. 5 July 2019. Political corruption, chronic shortages of food and medicine, closure of companies, unemployment, deterioration of productivity, authoritarianism, human rights violations, sanctions from other countries, gross economic mismanagement and high dependence on oil have also contributed to the worsening crisis. Supporters of Ch√°vez and Maduro say that the problems result from an \\"economic war\\" on Venezuela and \\"falling oil prices, international sanctions, and the country's business elite\\" while critics of the government say the cause is \\"years of economic mismanagement, and corruption\\". Most critics cite anti-democratic governance, corruption and mismanagement of the economy as causes of the crisis. Others attribute the crisis to the \\"socialist\\", \\"populist\\" or \\"hyper-populist\\" nature of the regime's policies and the use of these policies to maintain political power. In 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented that \\"information gathered indicates that the socioeconomic crisis had been unfolding for several years\\" before international sanctions, with Michelle Bachelet saying in 2019 that the social and economic crisis was dramatically deteriorating, the government had not acknowledged or addressed the extent of the crisis, and she expressed concern that although the \\"pervasive and devastating economic and social crisis began before the imposition of the first economic sanctions\\", the sanctions could worsen the situation. National and international analysts and economists stated that the crisis is not the result of a conflict, natural disaster or sanctions, but rather of the consequences of populist policies and corrupt practices that began under the Ch√°vez administration's Bolivarian Revolution and continued under the Maduro administration.  The crisis has affected the life of the average Venezuelan on all levels. By 2017, hunger had escalated to the point where almost seventy-five percent of the population had lost an average of over 8 kg (over 19 lbs) in weight and more than half did not have enough income to meet their basic food needs. Reuters reported that a UN report estimated in March 2019 that 94% of Venezuelans live in poverty and more than ten percent of Venezuelans (3.4 million) have left their country. The UN analysis estimates in 2019 that 25% of Venezuelans need some form of humanitarian assistance. Venezuela led the world in murder rates, with 81.4 per 100,000 people killed in 2018, making it the third most violent country in the world. Following increased international sanctions throughout 2019, the Maduro government abandoned policies established by Ch√°vez such as price and currency controls, which resulted in the country seeing a temporary rebound from economic decline before COVID-19 entered Venezuela the following year. In an interview with Jos√© Vicente Rangel, President Maduro described dollarization as an \\"escape valve\\" that helps the recovery of the country, the spread of productive forces in the country and the economy. However, Maduro said that the Venezuelan bol√≠var remains as the national currency.  Background   Ch√°vez presidency  Hugo Rafael Ch√°vez Fr√≠as was first elected President of Venezuela in 1998. Increasing oil prices in the early 2000s led to levels of funds not seen in Venezuela since the 1980s. Ch√°vez established Bolivarian missions, aimed at providing public services to improve economic, cultural, and social conditions. According to Corrales and Penfold, \\"aid was disbursed to some of the poor and, more gravely, in a way that ended up helping the president and his allies and cronies more than anyone else\\". Nonetheless, poverty was cut more than 20 percent between 2002 and 2008. The Missions entailed the construction of thousands of free medical clinics for the poor, and the enactment of food and housing subsidies. A 2010 OAS report indicated achievements in addressing illiteracy, healthcare and poverty, and economic and social advances. The quality of life for Venezuelans had also improved according to a UN Index.Charlie Devereux & Raymond Colitt. 7 March 2013. Teresa A. Meade wrote that Ch√°vez's popularity strongly depended \\"on the lower classes who have benefited from these health initiatives and similar policies\\".Meade, Teresa. A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present (Oxford 2010), p. 313. However, Venezuela began to face economic difficulties due to Ch√°vez's populist policies and on 2 June 2010, he declared an \\"economic war\\". The social works initiated by Ch√°vez's government relied on oil products, the keystone of the Venezuelan economy, leading to Dutch disease according to Javier Corrales. By the early 2010s, economic actions taken by Ch√°vez's government during the preceding decade, such as overspending * and price controls, proved to be unsustainable. Venezuela's economy faltered while poverty, * inflation and shortages in Venezuela increased. According to Martinez L√°zaro, professor of economics at the IE Business School in Madrid, the economic woes Venezuela continued to suffer under Maduro would have occurred even if Ch√°vez were still in power. In early 2013, shortly after Ch√°vez's death, Foreign Policy stated that whoever succeeded Ch√°vez would \\"inherit one of the most dysfunctional economies in the Americas‚Äîand just as the bill for the deceased leader's policies comes due.\\" Maduro presidency link=Special:FilePath/Cabello,_Maduro,_Flores.jpg Following Ch√°vez's death in 2013, Nicol√°s Maduro became president after defeating his opponent Henrique Capriles Radonski by 235,000 votes, a 1.5% margin. Maduro continued most of the existing economic policies of his predecessor Ch√°vez. Upon entering the presidency, his administration faced a high inflation rate and large shortages of goods, problems left over from Ch√°vez's policies. Maduro has blamed capitalist speculation for driving high rates of inflation and creating widespread shortages of basic necessities. He has said he is fighting an \\"economic war\\", referring to newly enacted economic measures as \\"economic offensives\\" against political opponents, who he and loyalists state are behind an international economic conspiracy.  * Maduro has been criticized for concentrating on public opinion, instead of tending to practical issues which economists have warned about, or creating ideas to improve Venezuela's economic prospects. * By 2014, Venezuela had entered an economic recession and by 2016, the country had an inflation rate of 800%, the highest in its history. In March 2019, The Wall Street Journal said that \\"Mr. Maduro has long used food and other government handouts to pressure impoverished Venezuelans to attend pro-government rallies and to support him during elections as the country's economic meltdown has intensified.\\" By the end of 2019, The Economist wrote that the Maduro government had obtained \\"extra money from selling gold (both from illegal mines and from its reserves) and narcotics\\". Elections and protests since 2017 2016 Venezuelan protestslink=Special:FilePath/Manifestaci√≥n_en_apoyo_a_Nicol√°s_Maduro.jpg link=Special:FilePath/Gr√°fica_Protestas_Venezuela.png Since 2010, Venezuela has been suffering a socioeconomic crisis under Maduro, and briefly under his predecessor, Ch√°vez. As a result of discontent with the government, in the 2015 parliamentary election the opposition was elected to the majority in the National Assembly, after which the lame duck National Assembly‚Äîconsisting of Bolivarian officials‚Äîfilled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, the highest court in Venezuela, with Maduro allies. Maduro disavowed the National Assembly in 2017 leading to the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis; as of 2018, some considered the National Assembly the only \\"legitimate\\" institution left in the country, and human rights organizations said there were no independent institutional checks on presidential power. Following the constitutional crisis and the push to ban opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles from politics for 15 years, protests grew to their most \\"combative\\" since they began in 2014. During the protests, the Mother of all Protests involved between 2.5 million and 6 million protesters. On 1 May 2017 following a month of protests that resulted in at least 29 dead, Maduro called for a constituent assembly that would draft a new constitution to replace the 1999 Venezuela Constitution created under Ch√°vez. He invoked Article 347, and stated that his call for a new constitution was necessary to counter the actions of the opposition. The members of the Constituent Assembly would not be elected in open elections, but selected from social organizations loyal to Maduro. It would also allow him to stay in power during the interregnum and skip the 2018 presidential elections, as the process would take at least two years. Many countries considered these actions a bid by Maduro to stay in power indefinitely, and over 40 countries stated that they would not recognize the 2017 Constituent National Assembly (ANC), along with supranational bodies such as the European Union, Mercosur and the Organization of American States (OAS). The Democratic Unity Roundtable--the opposition to the incumbent ruling party--boycotted the election, saying that the ANC was \\"a trick to keep [the incumbent ruling party] in power\\". Since the opposition did not participate in the election, the incumbent Great Patriotic Pole, dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, won almost all seats in the assembly by default. Maduro's allies‚Äîsuch as Bolivia, El Salvador, Cuba, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria‚Äîdiscouraged foreign intervention in Venezuelan politics and congratulated the president. The ANC was sworn in on 4 August 2017, and the next day declared itself to be the government branch with supreme power in Venezuela, banning the opposition-led National Assembly from performing actions that would interfere with the assembly while continuing to pass measures in \\"support and solidarity\\" with President Maduro, effectively stripping the National Assembly of all its powers. In February 2018, Maduro called for presidential elections four months before the prescribed date. He was declared the winner in May 2018 after multiple major opposition parties were banned from participating, among other irregularities; many said the elections were invalid. Politicians both internally and internationally said Maduro was not legitimately elected. and considered him an ineffective dictator. In the months leading up to his 10 January 2019 inauguration, Maduro was pressured to step down by nations and bodies including the Lima Group (excluding Mexico), the United States, and the OAS; this pressure was increased after the new National Assembly of Venezuela was sworn in on 5 January 2019. * The 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis came to a head when the National Assembly stated that the results of the May 2018 presidential election were invalid and declared National Assembly president Juan Guaid√≥ as the acting president, citing several clauses of the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution.  Corruption Corruption is high in Venezuela according to the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index and is prevalent at many levels of society. While corruption is difficult to measure reliably, in 2018 Transparency International ranked Venezuela among the top 13 most corrupt countries out of 180 measured, tied with Iraq, but ahead of Afghanistan, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, North Korea, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. A 2016 poll found that 73% of Venezuelans believed their police were corrupt. Latinobar√≥metro's 2018 report said that 65% of Venezuelans believed their president was involved in corruption, and 64% believed that government officials were corrupt. Discontent with corruption was cited by opposition-aligned groups as one of the reasons for the 2014 Venezuelan protests. A once wealthy country, Venezuela's economy was driven into political and economic crisis by corruption and mismanagement. Also available online.  Basic needs  Poverty  The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2019 that poverty was double that of 2014. A study from Andr√©s Bello Catholic University indicated that at least 8 million Venezuelans did not have enough to eat. A UN report estimated in March 2019 that 94% of Venezuelans live in poverty, and that one quarter of Venezuelans need some form of humanitarian assistance.  Food and water  More than 70% of Venezuela's food is imported; Venezuela became so dependent on food imports that it could no longer afford when the price of oil dropped in 2014. According to Al Jazeera, Ch√°vez gave the military control of food, and nationalized much of the industry, which was then neglected, leading to production shortages. With a \\"diminished food supply\\", Maduro put \\"generals in charge of everything from butter to rice\\". With the military in charge of food, food trafficking became profitable, bribes and corruption common, and food did not reach the needy. The government imports most of the food the country needs, it is controlled by the military, and the price paid for food is higher than justified by market prices. Venezuelans were spending \\"all day waiting in lines\\" to buy rationed food, \\"pediatric wards filled up with underweight children, and formerly middle-class adults began picking through rubbish bins for scraps\\", according to Al Jazeera. A group of Venezuelans eating garbage on the streets of link=Special:FilePath/Venezuelans_searching_through_garbage,_2018.jpg Several other factors have led to shortages: imports over the two years until the end of 2017 declined by two-thirds; hyperinflation has made food too costly for many Venezuelans; and for those who depend on food boxes supplied by the government, \\"these do not reach all Venezuelans who need them, provision of boxes is intermittent, and receipt is often linked to political support of the government\\". Corruption became a problem in the distribution of food. The operations director at one food import business, says \\"he pays off a long roster of military officials for each shipment of food he brings in from ... the US. It's an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.\\" A National Guard lieutenant denies this charge, saying corruption would be worse if the military were not involved; government and military officials say the opposition is overstating the corruption problem for their own benefit. Retired General Antonio Rivero said that \\"Maduro is trying to prevent soldiers from going hungry and being tempted to participate in an uprising against an increasingly unpopular government\\", adding that using the military to control food distribution has \\"drained the feeling of rebellion from the armed forces\\" by giving soldiers access to food denied others, with the resulting corruption increasing shortages for the general public. The colectivos are also involved in food trafficking, selling food on the black market; a colectivo leader told InSight Crime that trafficking food and medicine is as profitable as drug-running, but carries less risk. Also available in Spanish. With shadowy connections to the government, The Washington Post says \\"some have been put in charge of the distribution of government food packages in poor areas‚Äîgiving them control over hungry neighborhoods.\\" The Associated Press reports that people gather every evening in downtown Caracas in search of food thrown out on a sidewalk; the people are typically unemployed, but are \\"frequently joined by small business owners, college students and pensioners‚Äîpeople who consider themselves middle class even though their living standards have long ago been pulverized by triple-digit inflation, food shortages and a collapsing currency\\". A waste collection official in Maracaibo reported that most of the trash bags he received had been gone through by people searching for food. One dump reports finding parts of dismembered animals, like \\"dogs, cats, donkeys, horses and pigeons\\" and there is evidence that people are eating wildlife such as anteaters, flamingos, vultures and lizards. \\"Hunger, malnutrition, and severe food shortages are widespread in all Venezuela\\", according to Human Rights Watch. Doctors at 21 public hospitals in 17 Venezuelan states told The New York Times in 2017 that \\"their emergency rooms were being overwhelmed by children with severe malnutrition‚Äîa condition they had rarely encountered before the economic crisis began\\", and that \\"hundreds have died\\". The government has responded with \\"a near-total blackout of health statistics, and by creating a culture in which doctors are often afraid to register cases and deaths that may be associated with the government's failures\\". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN said that less than 5% of Venezuelans were undernourished between 2008 and 2013, but that number had more than doubled, to almost 12% from 2015 and 2017, representing 3.7 million people. A 2016 survey found that almost three-quarters of the population said that, because of improper nutrition, they had lost on average 8.7 kg (19.4 lbs) and 64% said they lost 11 kg (24 lbs) in 2017. A 2016 Venebarometro poll of 1,200 Venezuelans found almost half are no longer able to eat three daily meals; the government blames this on an \\"economic war\\" they say is waged by the opposition. A UN report said that because of lack of water and sanitation, 4.3 million Venezuelans need assistance in 2019. During the ongoing 2019 Venezuelan blackouts which started on 7 March, the water distribution system also had shortages. Jos√© de Viana, an engineer and former president of Hidrocapital, the municipal water company in Caracas, said that 90% of the thermoelectric plants that work as a backup if power fails are not operational because of lack of maintenance, or they have been simply disconnected, and that \\"the most important population centers in the country [had] zero water supply for more than four days\\". According to The Washington Post, analysts said that two-thirds of Venezuela's population (20 million people) were without water, partially or completely, in the weeks after the blackouts. People swarmed the polluted Guaire River in the center of Caracas to fill plastic containers with contaminated water, or collected water from streams at El √Åvila National Park. Others tried to catch water from the city's sewer drains. In the state of Lara people bathed in the sewers. The head of the infectious disease department at the University Hospital of Caracas, Maria Eugenia Landaeta said that, without access to clean water, the chance of people contracting bacterial infections increased, and that doctors had seen during the blackouts \\"surges in diarrhea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A\\", while non-sterile water and lack of hygiene was contributing to postpartum infections. The University Hospital goes months without dependable water or power supply, and depends on water tanks and power generators.  Health care  link=Special:FilePath/Venezuela's_health_expenditure;_1999_-.png During the Bolivarian Revolution, the government began providing free healthcare, with Cuban medical professionals providing aid. The government's failure to concentrate on healthcare and a reduction in spending on healthcare, along with unchecked government corruption resulted in avoidable deaths due to severe shortages of medical supplies and equipment, and the emigration of medical professionals to other countries. Venezuela's reliance on imported goods and the complicated exchange rates initiated under Ch√°vez led to increasing shortages during the late 2000s and into the 2010s that affected the availability of medicines and medical equipment in the country. Associated Press says the government stopped publishing medical statistics in 2010. The Health Minister changed multiple times during Ch√°vez's presidency. According to a high-ranking official of Venezuela's Health Ministry, the ministers were treated as scapegoats whenever issues with public health arose in Venezuela. He also said that officials of the Health Ministry engaged in corruption to enrich themselves by selling goods intended for public healthcare to others. Early in the Maduro presidency, the government could not supply enough money for medical supplies among healthcare providers, with the president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation saying that 9 of 10 large hospitals had only 7% of required supplies and private doctors reporting numbers of patients that are \\"impossible\\" to count \\"dying from easily treatable illnesses when Venezuela's downward economic slide accelerated after Chavez's death\\". Many Venezuelans died avoidable deaths with medical professionals having scarce resources and using methods that were replaced decades ago. In February 2014, doctors at the University of Caracas Medical Hospital stopped performing surgeries due to the lack of supplies, even though nearly 3,000 people required surgery. By early 2015, only 35% of hospital beds were available and 50% of operating rooms could not function due to the lack of resources. In March 2015, a Venezuelan NGO, Red de Medicos por la Salud, reported that there was a 68% shortage of surgical supplies and a 70% shortage of medicines in Venezuelan pharmacies. In 2018, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported that approximately one-third (22,000 of 66,138) of registered physicians left Venezuela as of 2014. Rosemary DiCarlo from the UN said that 40% of medical professionals had left Venezuela and supplies of medicine were at 20% of levels needed. The Venezuelan Medical Federation said that doctors were leaving the public health care system because of shortages of drugs and equipment and poor pay. In August 2015 Human Rights Watch said \\"We have rarely seen access to essential medicines deteriorate as quickly as it has in Venezuela except in war zones.\\" In 2015, the government reported that a third of patients admitted to public hospitals died. The medications of individuals who die are re-distributed through small-scale and local efforts, with the help of the families of the deceased, to try to supply surviving patients. One study of 6,500 households by three of the main universities in Venezuela found that \\"74% of the population had lost on average nineteen pounds in 2016\\". In April 2017 Venezuela's health ministry reported that maternal mortality jumped by 65% in 2016 and that the number of infant deaths rose by 30%. It also said that the number of cases of malaria was up by 76%. Shortly after Minister of Health Antonieta Caporale released in 2017 this data, and health statistics showing increases in 2016 infant and maternal mortality and infectious diseases, Maduro fired her and replaced the physician with a pharmacist close to vice-president Tareck El Aissami, Luis L√≥pez Chejade. The publications were removed from the Ministry's website, and no further health data has been made available, although the government had produced health bulletins for several decades. In March 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that the \\"collapse of Venezuela's health system, once one of the best in Latin America, has led to a surge in infant and maternal mortality rates and a return of rare diseases that were considered all but eradicated. Health officials say malaria, yellow fever, diphtheria, dengue and tuberculosis are now spreading from Venezuela to neighboring countries as Venezuelan refugees surge over borders.\\" The United Nations estimated in 2019 that 2.8 million Venezuelans have healthcare needs, 300,000 are at risk of dying with cancer, diabetes or HIV as they have not had access to medicine for more than a year, and preventable diseases like diphtheria, malaria, measles and tuberculosis are rising in 2019, along with heptatitis A, because of sanitation and lack of access to water. The April 2019 HRW/Johns Hopkins report showed this rise in infectious and preventable diseases, as well as increasing malnutrition, infant and maternal death, and undertreatment of HIV. Inflation and medicine shortages have meant that patients are asked to bring their own food, water and soap, and medical supplies including scalpels and syringes. In August 2019, as part of regional efforts to help Venezuelan migrants, the United States promised that it will provide thousands of doses of HIV medication to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and to treat those who have it. =2019 Human Rights Watch/Johns Hopkins report = protesting in 2017 for medicine due to the shortages in Venezuelalink=Special:FilePath/Parque_Cristal_Protestas_2017_09.jpg In April 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health published the results of a joint, year-long research project in a report entitled \\"Venezuela's humanitarian emergency: Large-scale UN response needed to address health and food crises\\". Combined with data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and Venezuelan sources, the report was based on 156 interviews Also available in Spanish. with Venezuelan emigrants to Colombia and Brazil, officials from relief and humanitarian organizations, Venezuelan health care professionals, Also available at The Independent and UN and government officials from Brazil and Colombia. Most of the interviews occurred in July or August 2018 in visits by the experts to the Venezuelan border towns of C√∫cuta, Colombia and Boa Vista or Pacaraima, Brazil. The Washington Post stated that the HRW/Johns Hopkins report \\"paints an extremely grim picture of life in Venezuela, whose once-prosperous economy has imploded because of mismanagement and corruption under Maduro\\"; it documents rising maternal and infant death, spread of preventable diseases, food insecurity, and child malnutrition. HRW declared that the \\"combination of severe medicine and food shortages ... with the spread of disease ... amounts to a complex humanitarian emergency that requires a full-scale response by the United Nations secretary-general.\\" The Washington Post states that the report describes a healthcare system that is in \\"utter collapse\\", with diseases that are preventable via vaccination spreading, and \\"dramatic surges\\" in infectious diseases once eradicated in Venezuela. According to NPR, the economic crisis in Venezuela started in 2010, and the health crisis followed by two years and significantly worsened in 2017, but the situation in 2019 \\"is even more dismal than researchers expected\\". Paul Spiegel, MD, who was the editor and reviewer of the report said, \\"Venezuela is a middle-income country with a previously strong infrastructure, so just to see this incredible decline ... in such a short period of time is quite astonishing.\\" Alberto Paniz Mondolfi, a doctor in Barquisimeto, Venezuela who is a member of the Venezuelan National Academy of Medicine, told NPR that the report gave an accurate, thorough and timely depiction of the medical situation in his country; he had no affiliation with the report, but said that he had seen cases where there were not even catheters for hooking up children who appeared to have malnutrition for intravenous therapy. Spiegel adds that, because of the infrastructure and trained personnel in Venezuela, aid can be distributed quickly once delivered to Venezuela. ;Maduro administration response The Maduro administration does not publish health statistics, but NPR states that it \\"paint[s] a rosy picture of its health care system\\". The Guardian reported Maduro's response to the country's health care crisis as \\"inadequate\\". According to The Washington Post, \\"because of the intransigence of President Nicolas Maduro‚Äîwho has blamed deprivations on US sanctions and refused to allow anything beyond a trickle of assistance to enter the country\\"‚Äîaid has not been delivered quickly enough. Reuters reported that \\"Maduro says there is no crisis and no need for humanitarian aid, blaming U.S. sanctions for the country's economic problems.\\" Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza did not respond to a letter asking for Venezuela's \\"views regarding the extent of the crisis and the policies it was implementing to address it\\" before the HRW/Johns Hopkins report was published. The HRW summary of the HRW/Johns Hopkins report said, \\"The Venezuelan authorities during the presidency of Nicol√°s Maduro have proven unable to stem the crisis, and have in fact exacerbated it through their efforts to suppress information about the scale and urgency of the problems.\\" The Associated Press said Maduro \\"suppress[es] information\\" and has made the problem worse. Also available at The Globe and Mail The Americas director for HRW, Jos√© Miguel Vivanco said, ‚ÄúVenezuelan authorities publicly minimise and suppress information about the crisis, and harass and retaliate against those who collect data or speak out about it, while also doing far too little to alleviate it.\\" The report discusses a teaching physician who said \\"residents are threatened with being expelled from the program or their hospital if they include a malnutrition diagnosis in medical records\\", causing malnutrition to be understated in Venezuelan data. The report states that \\"many analysts have argued that the government's own policies have played a role in causing the economic crisis ... However, under the presidency of Nicol√°s Maduro, the Venezuelan government has denied the crisis, hidden health statistics and data, harassed health professionals who speak out about the reality on the ground, and made it harder for sufficient humanitarian assistance to reach the Venezuelan people. Through these policies and practices, authorities have contributed to the worsening humanitarian crisis documented in this report.\\" The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is a multilateral treaty ratified by Venezuela; it commits its parties to \\"the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\\", and the right to an adequate \\"standard of living\\" and \\"adequate food\\". The Constitution of Venezuela provides for the right to health. The HRW/Johns Hopkins report states that, facing deteriorating health conditions, the government's suppression of information and actions against those speaking about the crisis \\"represent a violation of Venezuela's obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health\\" to which Venezuelans are entitled from both the ICESCR treaty and their Constitution. Following the April HRW/Johns Hopkins report, and amid announcements from the United Nations about the scale of the humanitarian crisis, along with increasing international pressure, Maduro met with the Red Cross, and it announced it would triple its budget for aid to Venezuela. The increased aid would focus in four areas: the migration crisis, the health care system collapse, water and sanitation, and prisons and detention centers. Maduro, for the first time, indicated he was prepared to accept international aid‚Äîalthough denying a humanitarian crisis exists. The Wall Street Journal said that the acceptance of humanitarian shipments by Maduro was his first acknowledgement that Venezuela is \\"suffering from an economic collapse\\", Also available online. and The Guardian reported that Maduro's stance has softened in the face of increasing pressure. Guaid√≥ said the acceptance of humanitarian aid was the \\"result of our pressure and insistence\\", and called on Venezuelans to \\"stay vigilant to make sure incoming aid is not diverted for 'corrupt' purposes\\". Also available online. = Infectious and preventable diseases = link=Special:FilePath/Malaria_in_Venezuela.png In 1961, Venezuela was the first country declared free of malaria. In 2009, the WHO reported there were less than 36,000 cases of malaria in Venezuela. In 2013, Venezuela registered a new high in the number of cases of malaria in the past 50 years, and by 2014, was the only country in Latin America where the incidence of malaria was increasing, allegedly in part due to illegal mining; medical shortages in the country hampered treatment. By 2016, Venezuela's malaria-prevention program had collapsed, and there were more than a hundred thousand cases of malaria yearly. In 2017, there were 414,000 confirmed cases of malaria, according to the WHO. Other preventable diseases that \\"were rare or nonexistent before the economic crisis, have surged\\", including diphtheria, measles, and tuberculosis. \\"Venezuela did not experience a single case of diphtheria between 2006 and 2015\\"; according to the HRW/Johns Hopkins report, since mid-2016, 1,500 of the 2,500 suspected cases have been confirmed. Between 2008 and 2015, there was one recorded case of measles, in 2012; since June 2017, 6,200 of the 9,300 reported cases have been confirmed. The highest rate of tuberculosis in four decades was reached in 2017. In 2014, there were 6,000 reported cases of tuberculosis; preliminary data shows more than 13,000 for 2017. In 2014, shortages of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS affected about 50,000 Venezuelans, potentially causing thousands of Venezuelans with HIV to develop AIDS. In 2018, PAHO estimated that 90% of Venezuelans who had HIV and were registered by the government‚Äî69,308 of the 79,467 registered‚Äîwere not receiving antiretroviral treatment. The PAHO report estimated that in six years, new HIV cases grew by 24% through 2016, after which the government stopped providing data. NPR reported: \\"New HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have increased sharply, in large part because the vast majority of HIV-positive Venezuelans no longer have access to antiretroviral medications.\\" Because of a shortage of HIV test kits, there may be more people who have HIV but are not aware. The HRW/Johns Hopkins report says: \\"Venezuela is the only country in the world where large numbers of individuals living with HIV have been forced to discontinue their treatment as a result of the lack of availability of antiretroviral (ARV) medicines.\\" In late 2014, Venezuelans began saying that due to shortages of medicines, it was hard to find acetaminophen to help alleviate symptoms of the newly introduced chikungunya virus, a potentially lethal mosquito-borne disease. In September 2014, the Venezuelan government stated that 400 Venezuelans were infected with chikungunya; the Central University of Venezuela stated that there could be between 65,000 and 117,000 Venezuelans infected. In August 2015 independent health monitors said that there were more than two million people infected with chikungunya while the government said there were 36,000 cases.  COVID-19 pandemic  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began since February in the country, costs for services like internet and telephone lines rose between 80% and 749%, further limiting access to these utilities. Shortages of beds and essential medical equipment, such as latex gloves and antibiotics, have severely limited the capabilities of the country's medical infrastructure. In April 2020 the Venezuelan government asked the Bank of England to sell $US1.02 billion of the Venezuelan gold reserves held by the bank to help the government fund its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed on 14 May by a legal claim by the Venezuelan Central Bank asking the Bank of England to send the proceeds of the sale of gold to the United Nations Development Programme. The claim stated that the funds would then be used to buy healthcare equipment, medicine, and food to address the country's \\"COVID-19 emergency\\". = Women, maternal and infant = In 2016, infant mortality increased 30% in one year, to 11,466 deaths of children under the age of one. By 2019, the UN reported that infant mortality had \\"soared\\". \\"Venezuela is the only South American country where infant mortality has returned to levels last seen in the 1990s\\", according to the HRW/Johns Hopkins report. Maternal mortality also increased 65% in one year, to 756 deaths. Abortion is illegal in Venezuela; the director of a large family planning clinic in Venezuela indicated that more women are arranging for permanent sterilization, and that more are presenting with \\"complications from clandestine abortions\\". One of the causes, according to the Venezuelan Association for Alternative Sexual Education, is the severe shortage of oral and injectable contraceptives and intrauterine devices. The HRW/Johns Hopkins report states that the more than 454,000 Venezuelan women who have emigrated to Colombia face 'threats of sexual exploitation and abuse, trafficking, and sexual and reproductive rights violations\\"; violence based on gender accounted for more than 12% of 2018 health-care events, and indigenous women may be at higher risk. Venezuelan women emigrating are at risk for becoming sex trafficking targets virtually anywhere they flee to. Cases of trafficking in Peru, the United States, Spain, and Colombia display the highest numbers. Pregnancy and motherhood Many pregnant women in Venezuela are crossing the border into neighboring countries to give birth due to lack of medical supplies, food, or medical care in Venezuelan hospitals. Lack of basic medicine and equipment is causing preventable deaths and maternity is a very high risk for women‚Äîespecially, since there are no blood banks in the event of excessive bleeding Hospitals frequently have water and electricity outages and only 7% of emergency services are fully operative Maternal mortality is estimated to have increase by 65% from 2013 to 2016, and unsafe abortions have contributed to 20% of preventable maternal deaths. According to Amnesty International, causes of the increase in maternal deaths include a lack of medical personnel and supplies like anticoagulants, scar healing cream, painkillers, antibiotics, antiseptics, and other tools and equipment.  Statelessness  C√∫cuta, a city on the Colombian-Venezuela border, has received 14,000 Venezuelan patients at the Erasmo Meoz University Hospital since 2016 and is expecting to receive even more. In this hospital, 75% percent of the newborns born in the first two months of the year 2019 were Venezuelans. The situation has strained the budget of these hospitals, putting Erasmo Meoz 14 million dollars into debt. While Colombia is the most impacted since it shared a border, women are also traveling to Brazil to give birth The number of births of Venezuelan babies attended to in Boa Vista, Brazil, has increased from 700 in 2014 to 50,000 in 2017. Venezuelan mothers have also been fleeing to neighboring Peru and Ecuador. Colombian citizenship is required that Colombian citizens be born to at least one Colombian parent or be born to foreign parents who meet residence requirements and are eligible to become citizens. Due to the influx of Venezuelan babies being born in Colombia and the Venezuelan government's inability to issue citizenship, Colombia has introduced a new measure that will give these Colombian-born newborns Colombian citizenship to avoid ‚Äòstatelessness‚Äô. The measure went into effect August 2019 and includes babies of Venezuelan parents born in Colombia starting in January 2015, having given citizenship to approximately 27,000 babies born in Colombia over the past four years. = Mental health = Following the Bolivarian Revolution, the rate of suicide among Venezuelans quadrupled over two decades, with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans dying from suicide during the period according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence. As a result of the crisis, stressors resulting in suicide included economic burden, hunger and loneliness due to the emigration of relatives. In 2015, concerns about shortages and inflation overtook violent crime as Venezuelans' main worry for the first time in years according to pollster Datan√°lisis. The chief executive of Datan√°lisis, Luis Vicente Leon, said that Venezuelans had greater concerns over shortages and became preoccupied with the difficulties surrounding them instead. Eldar Shafir, author and American behavioral scientist, said that the psychological \\"obsession\\" with finding scarce goods in Venezuela is because the rarity of the item makes it \\"precious\\". In 2016, reporters from The New York Times visited six psychiatric wards across the Venezuela at the invitation of doctors; all reported shortages of medicine and even food. In the investigation, they reported that El Pampero Hospital had not employed a psychiatrist in two years, and that it only had running water for only a few hours a day. The hospital, the article said, also suffered from shortages of basic personal-care and cleaning supplies, such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste or toilet paper. The nurses declared that without sedatives, they had to restrain patients or lock them in isolation cells to keep them from harming themselves. The reporters also noted that the government had denied that its public hospitals were suffering from shortages, and had refused multiple offers of international medical aid. Despite the threat of violent protests, the economic crisis affected children more than violence. Abel Saraiba, a psychologist with children's rights organization Cecodap said in 2017, \\"We have children from a very early age who are having to think about how to survive\\", with half of her young clients requiring treatment because of the crisis. Children are often forced to stand in food lines or beg with their parents, while the games they play with other children revolve around finding food. Friends of the Child Foundation psychologist Ninoska Zambrano said that children are offering sexual services for food. Zambrano said \\"Families are doing things that not only lead them to break physically, but in general, socially, we are being morally broken\\". In 2017, suicide increased by 67% among the elderly and 18% among minors; by 2018, reports emerged of a rapidly increasing suicide rate due to the stressors surrounding the crisis. = Medical care and elections = Mission Barrio Adentro was a program established by Ch√°vez to bring medical care to poor neighborhoods; it was staffed by Cubans that were sent to Venezuela in exchange for petroleum. The New York Times interviewed sixteen Cuban medical professionals in 2019 who had worked for Barrio Adentro prior to the 2018 Venezuelan presidential elections; all sixteen revealed that they were required to participate in voting fraud. Some of the Cubans said that \\"command centers\\" for elections were placed near clinics to facilitate \\"dispatching doctors to pressure residents\\". Some tactics reported by the Cubans were unrelated to their profession: they were given counterfeit cards to vote even though they were not eligible voters, they witnessed vote tampering when officials opening ballot boxes and destroyed ballots, and they were told to instruct easily manipulated elderly patients in how to vote. But they also \\"described a system of deliberate political manipulation\\"; their services as medical professionals \\"were wielded to secure votes for the governing Socialist Party, often through coercion\\", they told The New York Times. Facing a shortage of supplies and medicine, they were instructed to withhold treatment‚Äìeven for emergencies‚Äìso supplies and treatment could be \\"doled out closer to the election, part of a national strategy to compel patients to vote for the government\\". They reported that life-saving treatment was denied to patients who supported the opposition. As the election neared, they were sent door-to-door, on house visits with a political purpose: \\"to hand out medicine and enlist voters for Venezuela's Socialist Party\\". Patients were warned that they could lose their medical care if they did not vote for the socialist party, and that, if Maduro lost, ties would be broken with Cuba, and Venezuelans would lose all medical care. Patients with chronic conditions, at risk of death if they couldn't get medicine, were a particular focus of these tactics. One said that government officials were posing as doctors to make these house calls before elections; 'We, the doctors, were asked to give our extra robes to people. The fake doctors were even giving out medicines, without knowing what they were or how to use them,\\" he said. Housing link=Special:FilePath/El_Para√≠so_tunnel_main_gate_of_Caracas.jpg Since the mid-2000s during Ch√°vez's presidency, Venezuela has had a housing crisis. In 2005, the Venezuelan Construction Chamber (CVC) estimated that there was a shortage of 1.6 million homes, with only 10,000 of 120,000 promised homes constructed by Ch√°vez's government despite billions of dollars in investments. Poor Venezuelans attempted to construct homes on their own despite structural risks. By 2011, there was a housing shortage of 2 million homes, with nearly twenty prime developments being occupied by squatters following Ch√°vez's call for the poor to occupy \\"unused land\\". Up to 2011, only 500,000 homes were constructed during the Ch√°vez administration, with over two-thirds of the new housing developments being built by private companies; his government provided about the same amount of housing as previous administrations. Housing shortages were further exacerbated when private construction halted due to the fear of property expropriations and because of the government's inability to construct and provide housing. Urban theorist and author Mike Davis said in July 2011 to The Guardian, \\"Despite official rhetoric, the Bolivarianist regime has undertaken no serious redistribution of wealth in the cities and oil revenues pay for too many other programmes and subsidies to leave room for new housing construction.\\" By 2012, a shortage of building materials also disrupted construction, with metal production at a 16-year low. By the end of Ch√°vez's presidency in 2013, the number of Venezuelans in inadequate housing had grown to 3 million. Under the Maduro government, housing shortages continued to worsen. Maduro announced in 2014 that due to the shortage of steel, abandoned cars and other vehicles would be acquired by the government and melted to provide rebar for housing. In April 2014, Maduro ruled by decree that Venezuelans who owned three or more rental properties would be forced by the government to sell their rental units at a set price or they would face fines or have their property possessed by the government. By 2016, residents of government-provided housing, who were usually supporters of the government, began protesting due to the lack of utilities and food. Social Crime thumb300px Murder rate (murder per 100,000 citizens) from 1998 to 2018. Sources: OVV, PROVEA, UN; UN data is extrapolated between 2007 and 2012 because of missing datalink=Special:FilePath/1998_to_2013_Venezuela_Murder_Rate.png Escalating violent crime, especially murder, had been called \\"perhaps the biggest concern\\" of Venezuelans during the crisis. According to The New Yorker magazine Venezuela had \\"by various measures, the world's highest violent-crime rate\\" in 2017, and almost none of crimes that are reported are prosecuted. InSight Crime says the crisis has \\"all too often been obscured by the government's reluctance to release damning crime statistics\\". The New Yorker reporter found that even stairwells in a public hospital were not safe from robbers, who preyed on staff and patients despite the large number of security forces guarding the hospital, saying this was because the police were assigned to contain journalists who might embarrass the government with expos√©s on the state of the hospital; they were not assigned to protect its occupants. The police allegedly collaborated with the robbers receiving a cut of what they stole. According to The U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security, street gang violence, \\"corrupt\\" underpaid police officers, \\" an inefficient and politicized judicial system\\", an extremely troubled prison system, and an increased widespread of weaponry has resulted in the majority of criminal activity in Venezuela, with murder being the crime committed the most. The Bureau states that there were 73 daily violent deaths in 2018, and that the government \\"often attempts to refute or repudiate reports of increasing crime and murder rates; however, independent observers widely reject\\" the Venezuelan government's claims. The government says there were 60 daily homicides in 2016, and 45 daily in 2015, corresponding with Venezuela's downward economic spiral, according to NBC News; the OVV says the numbers are higher. For 2015, the government says the rate of homicides was 70.1 per 100,000 people. The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence (OVV) says the rate was 91.8 homicides per 100,000 people (in 2015, the comparative U.S. number was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants). According to the World Bank, the 2016 homicide rate was 56 per 100,000, making Venezuela third in the world, after El Salvador and Honduras. OVV data has 23,047 homicides committed in Venezuela in 2018, a rate of 81.4 per 100,000 people, with the decline being attributed to emigration. According to the Los Angeles Times, > ... carjack gangs set up ambushes, sometimes laying down nail-embedded > strips to puncture tires of vehicles ferrying potential quarry. Motorists > speak matter-of-factly of spotting body parts along roadways. ... While most > crime victims are poor, they also include members of the middle and upper > classes and scores of police and military personnel killed each year, > sometimes for their weapons. ... \\"Before the thieves would only rob you,\\" is > a common refrain here in the capital. \\"Now they kill you.\\" The BBC reported in 2012 that as a response to the high rate of crime, the Venezuelan government banned private ownership of firearms by some individuals. At the same time the Venezuelan government has provided firearms for militant supporters. El Pa√≠s reported in 2014 that Ch√°vez had years earlier assigned colectivos to be \\"the armed wing of the Bolivarian Revolution\\" for the Venezuelan government, giving them weapons, communication systems, motorcycles and surveillance equipment to exercise control in the hills of Caracas where police are forbidden entry. In 2006, they received arms and funding from the state when they were brought under the government's community councils. Ch√°vez eliminated the Metropolitan Police in 2011, turning security over to the colectivos in some Caracas barrios. Some weapons given to the groups include assault rifles, submachine guns and grenades. Despite the Venezuelan government's statements saying that only official authorities can carry weapons for the defense of Venezuela, colectivos are armed with automatic rifles such as AK-47s, submachine guns, fragmentation grenades, and tear gas. thumb300px Number of kidnappings in Venezuela 1989‚Äì2011. Source: CICPC Note: Express kidnappings may not be included in data.link=Special:FilePath/Number_of_kidnappings_in_Venezuela_1989_to_present_(Presidents).png During the 2014 Venezuelan protests against Maduro, colectivos acted against the opposition protesters. As the crisis intensified, armed gangs have taken control of cities. The Civil Association for Citizen Control said that more than half of those killed during the protests were killed by colectivos. Human Rights Watch described colectivos as \\"armed gangs who use violence with impunity\\" to harass political opponents of the Venezuelan government. Amnesty International calls them \\"armed pro-government supporters who are tolerated or supported by the authorities\\". During the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts in March, Maduro called on the armed paramilitary gangs, saying, \\"The time has come for active resistance\\". As blackouts continued, on 31 March, citizens protested the lack of electricity and water in Caracas and other cities; Maduro called again on the colectivos, asking them \\"to defend the peace of every barrio, of every block\\". Videos circulated on social media showing colectivos threatening protesters and shooting in the streets; two protestors were shot. There is no reliable data on kidnapping in Venezuela and available data is considered an underestimate; it is against the law to pay ransom, and according to criminologists, at least 80% of kidnappings are not reported for fear of retaliation, or because relatives prefer to negotiate, hoping the hostage will be released and fearing they will be killed if authorities are contacted. Available data underestimates the amount of express kidnapping, where victims are typically released in less than two days after relatives pay a quick ransom. Most express kidnapping victims are released, but in 2016, 18 were killed. At least 80% of kidnappings occur in a limited area around Caracas and including Miranda State. In the areas where most kidnappings occur, the government set up so-called \\"peace zones\\" where official police withdrew and gangs took over; according to NBC News, \\"experts say the government has armed these groups ... [who] ... control large territories, financed through extortion and the drug trade\\". Illegal mining creates pools of standing water that encourage mosquito breeding, a partial cause of the increase in malaria seen in Venezuela. The murder rate in Venezuela had also decreased significantly between 2017 and 2019. In 2018, Venezuela's murder rate‚Äìdescribed as the highest in the world‚Äìhad begun to decrease to 81.4 per 100,000 people according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory (OVV), with the organization stating that this downward trend was due to the millions of Venezuelans that emigrated from the country at the time. The murder rate declined even further to 60.3 in 2019. Detentions Arbitrary detentions in Venezuela between 2014 and 2019 according to Foro Penal. Arrests by year in blue and total arrests in red. Repression and politically motivated dententions have risen to record levels in 2019. Foro Penal states that Venezuela has at least 900 political prisoners as of April 2019, with more arrests of people being held longer in poor conditions and on dubious charges. The human rights organization has documented more than 50 instances that include \\"sexual abuse, strangulation using plastic bags and the use of razor blades to cut detainees' feet\\". In the first three months of 2019, Foro Penal says 1,712 people were arrested and about two-thirds of those were held for more than 48 hours, the threshold used to classify a detainee as a political prisoner. Maduro calls those arrested members of \\"terrorist groups\\" and says his government will not hesitate to send them to prison. Juan Requesens and Roberto Marrero are examples of \\"purely political\\" arrests, according to their attorney. Increasingly high numbers of the detainees, though are working-class people, who have been driven to protest by the crisis.  Emigration  The exodus of millions of desperate impoverished Venezuelans to surrounding countries has been called \\"a risk for the entire region\\". Millions of Venezuelan people have voluntarily emigrated from Venezuela during the Ch√°vez and Maduro presidencies. The crisis started during the Ch√°vez presidency, but became much more pronounced during Maduro's term. Emigration has been motivated by economic collapse, expansion of state control over the economy, high crime, high inflation, general uncertainty, a lack of hope for a change in government, a failing public sector, and \\"shortages of basic necessities\\". The PGA Group estimates more than 1.5 million Venezuelans emigrated in the 15 years between 1999 and 2014; an estimated 1.8 million left in ten years through 2015. The UN said that in the first part of 2018, about 5,000 Venezuelans were leaving Venezuela daily. A February 2019 UN reported estimated that 3.4 million Venezuelans have emigrated, and they expect another 1.9 million may emigrate in 2019. The UN estimates 2.7 million have gone to the Caribbean and Latin America. Most have gone to Colombia; estimates of Venezuelans emigrating to Colombia are 1.1 million, Peru 506,000, Chile 288,000, Ecuador 221,000, Argentina 130,000, and Brazil 96,000. This is in contrast to Venezuela's high immigration rate during the 20th century. Kevin Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador in Colombia, says, \\"Colombians, in their tens and hundreds of thousands, migrated to Venezuela in the '60s and '70s and '80s, when Venezuela was a wealthy country and Colombia was not so much. Now, more than 1 million Venezuelans, many of them since 2015, have gone to live in Colombia.\\" Those who leave by foot are known as los caminantes (the walkers); the walk to Bogot√°, Colombia is , and some walk hundreds of kilometres further, to Ecuador or Peru. Alba Pereira, who helps feed and clothe about 800 walkers daily in Northern Colombia, said in 2019 she is seeing more sick, elderly and pregnant among the walkers. The Colombian Red Cross has set up rest tents with food and water on the side of the roads for Venezuelans. Venezuelans also cross into northern Brazil, where UNHCR has set up 10 shelters to house thousands of Venezuelans. Images of Venezuelans fleeing the country by sea have raised symbolic comparisons to the images seen from the Cuban diaspora. In 1998, only 14 Venezuelans were granted U.S. asylum, and by September 1999, 1,086 Venezuelans were granted asylum according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The first wave of Venezuelan emigrants were wealthy and middle class Venezuelans concerned by Ch√°vez's rhetoric of redistributing wealth to the poor; the early exodus of college-educated people with capital caused a brain drain. Emigration especially increased during the Maduro presidency. This second wave of emigration consisted of lower class Venezuelans suffering directly from the economic crisis facing the country; thus, the same individuals whom Ch√°vez attempted to aid were now seeking to emigrate, driven by worsening economic conditions, scarcity of food and medicine, and rising rates of violent crime. A Tomas Perez, who studies the Venezuelan diaspora at the Central University of Venezuela, said in 2018 that because \\"now everyone is poor\\", it is mostly poor leaving the country. Carlos Malamud, from a Spanish think tank, said Maduro is \\"using migration as a political weapon against the opposition\\". The scale of the crisis has surpassed in four years the Cuban exodus, in which 1.7 million emigrated over a period of sixty years; Malamud says \\"Latin American societies aren't prepared for such wide-scale arrivals\\". Impacting the health care crisis in Venezuela, health care professionals are emigrating; a primary factor driving emigration to Colombia is the lack of \\"medicines, supplies, health providers, and basic health services\\" in Venezuela. Since 2017, the banking sector has seen 18,000 employees leave the country.  Economic  Maduro's government stopped releasing social and economic indicators, so most data rely on estimates. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) stated in March 2019 that \\"Venezuela's economic collapse is among the world's worst in recent history\\". A chief economist of the IIF said the crisis resulted from \\"policy decisions, economic mismanagement, and political turmoil\\", saying it is on a scale that \\"one would only expect from extreme natural disasters or military confrontations\\". The April 2019 International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook described Venezuela as being in a \\"wartime economy\\". For the fifth consecutive year, Bloomberg rated Venezuela last on its misery index in 2019. The government's main source of income is oil, with output \\"plummeting due to lack of investment, poor maintenance and neglect\\", from which consultant Eduardo Fortuny expects will take 12 years to recover.  Business and industry  Ratings for Venezuela from 1998 to 2017 by the U.S. Government-funded NGO link=Special:FilePath/Freedom_ratings_in_Venezuela_(1998_to_2013).png A number of foreign firms have left the nation‚Äîoften due to quarrels with the socialist government‚Äîincluding Smurfit Kappa, Clorox, Kimberly Clark and General Mills; the departures aggravate unemployment and shortages. Before the effects of the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts, the number of multinational companies in the industrial city of Valencia in Carabobo State had dropped from 5,000 when Ch√°vez became president to a tenth of that. = Airline industry = Domestic airlines are having difficulties because of hyperinflation and parts shortages, and most international airlines have left the country. Airlines from many countries ceased operating in Venezuela, making travel to the country difficult: Air Canada became the first international airline to cease Venezuela operations in March 2014 and was followed by Alitalia in April 2015. Other airlines that have left are AeroMexico, Avianca, Delta, Lufthansa and LATAM. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Government of Venezuela has not paid US$3.8 billion to international airlines in an issue involving conversion of local currency to U.S. dollars. Airlines have left for other reasons, including crime against flight crews and foreign passengers, stolen baggage, and problems with the quality of jet fuel and maintenance of runways. Aerolineas Argentinas left in 2017, citing security reasons, and American Airlines, the last U.S. airline serving Venezuela, left on 15 March 2019, after its pilots refused to fly to Venezuela, citing safety issues. Following the increasing economic partnership between Venezuela and Turkey in October 2016, Turkish Airlines started offering direct flights from December 2016 connecting between Caracas to Istanbul (via Havana, Cuba) in an effort to \\"link and expand contacts\\" between the two countries. Iranian airline Mahan Air (blacklisted by the U.S. government since 2011) began direct flights to Caracas in April 2019, \\"signifying a growing relationship between the two nations\\" according to Fox News. In May 2019, the United States Department of Transport and Department of Homeland Security suspended all flights between Venezuela and the United States, due to safety and security concerns. The suspension affects mainly Venezuelan airlines flying to Miami, which are Avior Airlines, LASER Airlines and Estelar Latinoamerica.  Gross domestic product  Estimated to drop by 25% in 2019, the IMF said the contraction in Venezuela's GDP‚Äîthe largest since the Libyan Civil War began in 2014‚Äîwas affecting all of Latin America. In 2015 the Venezuelan economy contracted 5.7% and in 2016 it contracted 18.6% according to the Venezuelan central bank; after that, the government stopped producing data. Ecoanal√≠tica, a Venezuelan consultant, told the Wall Street Journal that output had halved between 2016 and 2019. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and AGPV Asesores Econ√≥micos, a consulting firm based in Caracas, estimate that GDP shrunk to $80 billion in 2018 from $196 billion in 2013, making the economy smaller than Guatemala's or Ethiopia's.  Inflation  Venezuelan bol√≠var fuerte banknotes ranging from 2 bolivares to 100,000 bolivares printed within a 10-year period. The magnitude of the currency scalars signifies the extent of the hyperinflation. The banknotes were demonetized in 2018 following the introduction of the bol√≠var soberano, with 5 fewer zeros. The annual inflation rate for consumer prices has risen hundreds and thousands of percentage points during the crisis. Inflation in Venezuela remained high during Ch√°vez's presidency. By 2010, inflation removed any advancement of wage increases, and by 2014 at 69% it was the highest in the world. In November 2016, Venezuela entered a period of hyperinflation, with inflation reaching 4,000% in 2017; the Venezuelan government \\"essentially stopped\\" producing inflation estimates in early 2018. At the end of 2018, inflation had reached 1.35 million percent. In the 2017 Christmas season, some shops stopped using price tags since prices would inflate so quickly. From 2017 to 2019, some Venezuelans became video game gold farmers and could be seen playing games such as RuneScape to sell in-game currency or characters for real currency; players could make more money than salaried workers by earning only a few dollars per day. Some of these \\"gold farmers\\" will use cryptocurrencies as an intermediary currency before converting into Bolivares, as indicated in this interview. In October 2018, the IMF has estimated that inflation would reach 10,000,000% by the end of 2019. In early 2019, the monthly minimum salary was the equivalent of US$5.50 (18,000 sovereign bolivars)‚Äîless than the price of a Happy Meal at McDonald's. Ecoanalitica estimated that prices jumped by 465% in the first two-and-a-half months of 2019. The Wall Street Journal stated in March 2019 that the \\"main cause of hyperinflation is the central bank printing money to increase money supply, thus boosting domestic spending.\\", reporting that a teacher can buy a dozen eggs and two pounds of cheese with a month's wages. In May 2019, the Central Bank of Venezuela released economic data for the first time since 2015. According to the release, Venezuela's inflation rate was 274% in 2016, 863% in 2017 and 130,060% in 2018. The new reports imply a contraction of more than half of the economy in five years, according to the Financial Times \\"one of the biggest contractions in Latin American history\\". Sources quoted by Reuters, said that China may have asked Venezuela to release the data to bring Venezuela into compliance with the IMF and make it more difficult for the IMF to recognise Juan Guaid√≥ during the presidential crisis. The IMF said it was not able to assess the quality of the data as it had no contact with the Venezuelan government.  Shortages  Shortages in Venezuela became prevalent after price controls were enacted according to the economic policy of the Hugo Ch√°vez government. Under the economic policy of the Nicol√°s Maduro government, greater shortages occurred due to the Venezuelan government's policy of withholding United States dollars from importers with price controls. Some Venezuelans must search for food‚Äîoccasionally resorting to eating wild fruit or garbage‚Äîwait in lines for hours and sometimes settle without having certain products.   Unemployment  In January 2016 the unemployment rate was 18.1 percent and the economy was the worst in the world according to the misery index. Venezuela has not reported official unemployment figures since April 2016, when the rate was at 7.3 percent. Unemployment was forecasted to reach 44% for 2019; the IMF stated that this was the highest unemployment seen since the end of the Bosnian War in 1995.  Venezuelan debt  In August 2017 President of the United States Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuela which banned transactions involving Venezuela's state debt including debt restructuring. The technical default period ended 13 November 2017 and Venezuela didn't pay coupons on its dollar eurobonds, causing a cross default on other dollar bonds. A committee consisting of the fifteen largest banks admitted default on state debt obligations which in turn entailed payments on CDS on 30 November. In November 2017, The Economist estimated Venezuela's debt at US$105 billion and its reserves at US$10 billion. In 2018, Venezuela's debt grew to US$156 billion and as of March 2019, its reserves had dropped to US$8 billion. With the exception of PDVSA's 2020 bonds, as of January 2019, all of Venezuela's bonds are in default, and Venezuela's government and state-owned companies owe nearly US$8 billion in unpaid interest and principal. As of March 2019, the government and state-owned companies have US$150 billion in debt.  Oil Industry  By 2018 the political and economic troubles facing Venezuela had engulfed the El Tigre-San Tom√© region, a key region for oil production in eastern Venezuela. Oil workers were fleeing the state-owned oil company as salaries could not keep up with hyperinflation, reducing families to starvation. Workers and criminals stripped vital oil industry equipment of anything valuable, ranging from pickup trucks to the copper wire within critical oil production components. Oil facilities were neglected and unprotected, crippling oil production and leading to environmental damage. As noted petroleum historian, expert, and former San Tom√© resident Emma Brossard stated in 2005, \\"Venezuelan oil fields had a depletion rate of 25 per cent annually [and] there had to be an investment of US$3.4 billion a year to keep up its production.\\" ‚ÄúBut since Chavez has become president there has been no investment.‚Äù Public opinion A November 2016 Datincorp survey that asked Venezuelans living in urban areas which entity was responsible for the crisis, 59% blamed chavismo or the presidents (Ch√°vez, 25%; Maduro 19%; Chavismo 15%) while others blamed the opposition (10%), entrepreneurs (4%) and the United States (2%). A September 2018 Megan√°lisis survey found that 84.3% of Venezuelans approved of a multinational foreign intervention on the condition that the coalition provide food and medicine. David Smilde from the Washington Office on Latin America said that \\"In November 2018, I worked with Datan√°lisis, one of Venezuela's most respected polling companies, to add several questions about military intervention and potential negotiations to its nationwide tracking poll. When asked whether they would support 'a foreign military intervention to remove President Maduro from his position,' only 35 percent said yes.\\" An 11‚Äì14 March 2019 survey of 1,100 people in 16 Venezuelan states and 32 cities by Megan√°lisis found that 89% of respondents want Maduro to leave the presidency. A Datan√°lisis poll on 4 March found Maduro's approval rating at an all-time low of 14%. citing Francisco Monaldi Tweet of 2 March, \\"Maduro cae a su m√≠nimo hist√≥rico de aprobaci√≥n con 14%. Guaid√≥ logra 61% de aprobaci√≥n y arrasar√≠a en una elecci√≥n con 77% vs. 23% Maduro.\\" According to Datan√°lisis, in early 2019, 63% of Venezuelans believed that a change of government was possible. Fourteen months later, in May 2020, after the Macuto Bay raid, the percentage decreased to 20%. Reaction  Economic sanctions  Economists have stated that shortages and high inflation in Venezuela began before US sanctions were directed towards the country. The Wall Street Journal says that economists place the blame for Venezuela's economy shrinking by half on \\"Maduro's policies, including widespread nationalizations, out-of-control spending that sparked inflation, price controls that led to shortages, and widespread graft and mismanagement.\\" The Venezuelan government has stated that the United States is responsible for its economic collapse. The HRW/Johns Hopkins report noted that most sanctions are \\"limited to canceling visas and freezing assets of key officials implicated in abuses and corruption. They in no way target the Venezuelan economy.\\" The report also stated that the 2017 ban on dealing in Venezuelan government stocks and bonds allows exceptions for food and medicine, and that the 28 January 2019 PDVSA sanctions could worsen the situation, although \\"the crisis precedes them\\". The Washington Post stated that \\"the deprivation long predates recently imposed US sanctions\\". In 2011, the United States sanctioned Venezuela's state-owned oil company Petr√≥leos de Venezuela. According to executives within the company as well as the Venezuelan government, the sanctions were mostly symbolic and had little effect (if any) on Venezuela's trade with the US since the company's sale of oil to the US and the operations of its US-based subsidiary Citgo were unaffected. On 9 March 2015, Barack Obama signed and issued an executive order declaring Venezuela a national security threat and ordered sanctions against Venezuelan officials. The sanctions did not affect Venezuela's oil company and trade relations with the US continued. In 2017, Trump's administration imposed additional economic sanctions on Venezuela. In 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented that \\"information gathered indicates that the socioeconomic crisis had been unfolding for several years prior to the imposition of these sanctions\\". According to the Wall Street Journal, new 2019 sanctions‚Äîaimed at depriving the Maduro government of petroleum revenues‚Äîare the most significant sanctions to date, and are likely to affect the Venezuelan people. In 2019, former UN rapporteur Alfred de Zayas asserted that US sanctions on Venezuela were illegal as they constituted economic warfare and \\"could amount to 'crimes against humanity' under international law\\". His report, which he says was ignored by the UN, was criticized by the Latin America and Caribbean programme director for the Crisis Group for neglecting to mention the impact of a \\"difficult business environment on the country\\", which the director said \\"was a symptom of Chavismo and the socialist governments‚Äô failures\\", and that \\"Venezuela could not recover under current government policies even if the sanctions were lifted.\\" Michelle Bachelet updated the situation in a 20 March oral report following the visit of a five-person delegation to Venezuela, saying that the social and economic crisis was dramatically deteriorating, the government had not acknowledged or addressed the extent of the crisis, and she was concerned that although the \\"pervasive and devastating economic and social crisis began before the imposition of the first economic sanctions\\", the sanctions could worsen the situation. \\"Surrounded by diplomats from 16 other countries, including Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba\\", Jorge Arreaza, the Venezuelan Minister for Foreign Affairs, described the actions of the US government as \\"I'm choking you, I'm killing you\\" and said that economic sanctions have \\"blocked\\" the Venezuelan economy, costing it US$30 billion. Reporting on Arreaza's statements, the Associated Press said that Maduro was blocking aid, and \\"saying that Venezuelans are not beggars and that the move is part of a U.S.-led coup\\".  Foreign involvement  link=Special:FilePath/President_Trump_Delivers_Remarks_to_the_Venezuelan_American_Community_(47145953601).jpg On 11 August 2017, President Trump said that he is \\"not going to rule out a military option\\" to confront the autocratic government of Nicol√°s Maduro and the deepening crisis in Venezuela. Military Times said the unnamed aides told Trump it was not wise to even discuss a military solution due to the history of unpopular intervention in Latin America by the United States. Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino criticized Trump for the statement, calling it \\"an act of supreme extremism\\" and \\"an act of madness\\". The Venezuelan communications minister, Ernesto Villegas, said Trump's words amounted to \\"an unprecedented threat to national sovereignty\\". Representatives of the United States were in contact with dissident Venezuelan military officers during 2017 and 2018 but declined to collaborate with them or provide assistance to them. The opinion of other Latin American nations was split with respect to military intervention. Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, while visiting Colombia, did not rule out the potential benefit of the use of military force to intervene with the crisis. Canada, Colombia and Guyana, which are members of the Lima Group, refused to sign the organization's document rejecting military intervention in Venezuela. During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, allegations of potential United States military involvement began to circulate, with military intervention in Venezuela was already being executed by the governments of Cuba and Russia. According to professor Erick Langer of Georgetown University, while it was being discussed whether the United States would militarily intervene, \\"Cuba and Russia have already intervened\\". Hundreds or thousands of Cuban security forces have allegedly been operating in Venezuela while professor Robert Ellis of United States Army War College described the between several dozen and 400 Wagner Group mercenaries provided by Russia as the \\"palace guard of Nicol√°s Maduro\\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the deployment of Russian mercenaries, calling it \\"fake news\\". On 2 April 2019, the Russian Foreign Ministry rejected Trump's call to \\"get out\\" saying their 100 military servicemen now in Venezuela will support Maduro \\"for as long as needed\\".  Humanitarian aid  Peruvian Minister of Defense Jos√© Modesto Huerta Torres visits the USNS Comfort during Operation Enduring Promise.link=Special:FilePath/USNS_Comfort_Operation_Enduring_Promise.jpg Throughout the crisis, humanitarian aid was provided to Venezuelans in need both within Venezuela and abroad. In October 2018, the USNS Comfort departed for an eleven-week operation in Latin America, with a primary mission being to assist countries who received Venezuelan refugees who fled the crisis in Venezuela. The main goal was to relieve health systems in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and other nations which faced the arrival of thousands of Venezuelan migrants.  * At the end of January 2019, as the US prepared to bring aid across the border, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned the United States about the risk of delivering humanitarian aid without the approval of the government's security forces. The UN similarly warned the US about politicising the crisis and using aid as a pawn in the power struggle. Other humanitarian organisations also raised risks. On 23 February 2019, 14 trucks carrying 280 tons of humanitarian aid attempted to bring aid across the Simon Bolivar and Francisco de Paula Santander bridges from Colombia. There were clashes, with Venezuelan security forces reported to use tear gas attack in attempt to maintain a blockade of the border. Colombia said around 285 people were injured and at least two trucks set on fire. CNN reported that the Venezuela government accused Guaido supporters of burning the trucks and noted that \\"While a CNN team saw incendiary devices from police on the Venezuelan side of the border ignite the trucks, the network's journalists are unsure if the trucks were burned on purpose.\\" In March, the New Tork Times reported that footage showed that it was anti-Maduro protestors rather than Venezuelan security forces who were responsible for the burning trucks. Glenn Greenwald wrote in The Intercept that Max Blumenthal and later the New York Times reported that the trucks had been set on fire by anti-Maduro protesters who threw a Molotov cocktail that hit one of the trucks. Greenwald said that the accusation by the US government and media that Venezuelan troops had set the trucks on fire was a lie to \\"inflame regime change against Venezuela\\". Greenwald also commented that the Venezuelan government had accepted substantial amounts of aid from \\"countries that have not threatened to overthrow the President with an external coup\\" and had only \\"blocked trucks and planes from entering that come from those countries (the U.S, Brazil, Colombia) that have been threatening Venezuela\\". Franceso Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, announced on 29 March 2019 that the Red Cross was preparing to bring humanitarian aid to the country to help ease both the chronic hunger and the medical crisis. The Guardian reported that Maduro had \\"long denied the existence of a humanitarian crisis, and on 23 February blocked an effort led by Guaid√≥ to bring aid into the country\\", and that the Red Cross had \\"brokered a deal\\" between the Maduro and Guaid√≥ administrations \\"indicating a seldom-seen middle ground between the two men\\". The Red Cross aid shipments were expected to begin within a few weeks, and the first shipment would help about 650,000 people; simultaneously, a leaked UN report estimated that seven million Venezuelans were likely in need of humanitarian assistance. During what The Wall Street Journal called \\"Latin America's worst humanitarian crisis ever\\", the \\"operation would rival Red Cross relief efforts in war-torn Syria, signaling the depth of Venezuela's crisis.\\" Rocca said the efforts would focus first on hospitals, including state-run facilities, and said the Red Cross was open to the possibility of delivering aid products stored on the Venezuelan borders with Colombia and Brazil. He warned that the Red Cross would not accept any political interference, and said the effort must be \\"independent, neutral, impartial and unhindered\\". Maduro and Arreaza met with representative of Red Cross International on 9 April to discuss the aid effort. The Wall Street Journal said that the acceptance of humanitarian shipments by Maduro was his first acknowledgement that Venezuela is \\"suffering from an economic collapse\\", adding that \\"until a few days ago, the government maintained there was no crisis and it didn't need outside help\\". Guaid√≥ said the acceptance of humanitarian aid was the \\"result of our pressure and insistence\\", and called on Venezuelans to \\"stay vigilant to make sure incoming aid is not diverted for 'corrupt' purposes\\". The first Red Cross delivery of supplies for hospitals arrived on 16 April, offering an encouraging sign that the Maduro administration would allow more aid to enter. Quoting Tamara Taraciuk‚Äîan expert at Human Rights Watch on Venezuela‚Äîwho called the situation \\"a completely man-made crisis\\", The New York Times said the aid effort in Venezuela presented challenges regarding how to deliver aid in an \\"unprecedented political, economic and humanitarian crisis\\" that was \\"caused largely by the policies of a government intent on staying in power, rather than war or natural disaster\\". According to The New York Times, \\"armed pro-government paramilitaries\\" fired weapons to disrupt the first Red Cross delivery, and officials associated with Maduro's party told the Red Cross to leave.

It was published in England by Hodder and Stoughton in 1951 and in the United States by Harper & Brothers in 1952. It is basically a classical courtroom trial story but with almost equally important thriller elements juxtaposed with the courtroom scenes. Although Inspector Hazlerigg, who had appeared in all of Gilbert's earlier novels as a mostly leading character, does play a role in this story, it is only in two brief appearances, once towards the beginning of the book and once again near the end. Two of the three main characters in this book are from previous novels, Major Angus McMann (They Never Looked Inside) and Noel Anthony Pontarlier (\\"Nap\\") Rumbold (The Doors Open). The other leading character, the trial barrister Hargest Macrae, also appears in some of Gilbert's early short stories. Plot The setting is London about 1950. Victoria Lamartine, a young French woman working at a small family hotel in Soho, has been arrested for the murder of an English major whom she had previously known in France during the war. Lamartine had been active in the Resistance and, the prosecution now asserts, had had a child fathered by the major, who was liaising with the French maquisards. In spite of being arrested by the Gestapo, she nevertheless bears the child and survives the war. The child dies not long afterwards and Lamartine comes to London to work in the hotel. Since the end of the war she has been trying to locate the major but in vain. Finally, just before the story opens, she succeeds in contacting him and he agrees to meet her at the hotel. That evening he is found dead in his hotel room, stabbed through the heart with a deadly technique that the Resistance had developed. Lamartine is quickly arrested and charged with his murder. Nap Rumbold, a junior solicitor in his father's London firm, is asked by Lamartine to represent her. Nap, who speaks excellent French, had himself spent four months on dangerous missions with the French maquis in occupied France and is now a retired Lieutenant-Colonel, D.S.O. He is a friend of Major McCann, who had led tanks through France after the D-Day invasion, and asks McCann for help. McMann in turn interviews his friend Inspector Hazlerigg at Scotland Yard. Hazlerigg is not directly involved in the case, but subtly points McMann into a possible direction to take. The rest of the book is divided about equally between courtroom scenes involving Hargest Macrae and various witnesses, and the adventures (and misadventures) of Rumbold and McCann as they try to track down witnesses in both England and France who might help bring in a verdict of not guilty. Rumbold, in particular, in trying to uncover new information in France, is put in particular danger by a murderous gang and at one point saves his life only by a desperate plunge into the Loire River. The final scenes are in the courtroom and with a summing up in Hazlerigg's office. Reception and Appraisals Anthony Boucher of the New York Times said that \\"the first 1952 book to reach this reviewer's desk is one which wouldn't disgrace any Best-of-the-Year list\\" and went on to say that it concerned: > ...an important murder trial, with real understanding of courtroom > psychology and technique. But the camera eye of the author constantly > flashes from this... to the efforts of two likable and believable amateurs > detectives who are striving to assemble last-minute evidence for the > defense; and their adventures, involving maquisards and collaborators from > the past, and gold-smugglers and secret agents of the present, make a > thriller as wildly exciting as the courtroom scenes are suavely persuasive. > It's hard to recall any technical tour de force of fusion quite so admirably > integrated as this.

Plot The story is told from the perspective of 3 different characters. Players explore different areas of a Bangkok hospital in order to piece together the mysterious circumstances and solve the murder case of Araya. Araya is bipolar and claims misanthropy, and prefers staying home. However, when she befriends a girl named Marisa, she feels that she can be at ease around her. Araya later is hit on by a boy named Sorn, but Marisa warns her to stay away from him, claiming that he's a playboy. Araya agrees at first, but starts a relationship with Sorn anyway, resulting in a pregnancy that causes arguments. For an unknown reason, Sorn procures a sleeping pill and gives it to Araya, but it kills her, and Sorn panics, as he doesn't want to be blamed for her death. Sorn takes Araya's body to the hospital's parking garage, where he hangs her by a noose and dies by accident. Marisa gets a text message from Araya years after her death, and goes to the now decrepit hospital. While she is searching it, she is chased by a man named Jit, who previously worked there and now stays for an unknown reason. Marisa is caught by Jit, who doesn't kill her while she is unconscious. Rama is the hospital's security guard who patrols the hospital and is also chased by Jit, who he previously knew. Rama's boss later tells him to meet up at a location in the hospital, but is supposedly stabbed in the back by Jit. Jit chases Rama again, but this time he gets knocked out by a bookshelf. The third character, Boon, has to go to the hospital to complete tasks for a gang to clear his gambling debt. He is chased several times by a gigantic \\"Praet\\", a type of ghost that Thai people believe children who have sinned against their parents will become after death. During the end of Boon's mission, he and Rama cross paths, and both quickly discuss how to escape the hospital. Later, Marisa finds the corpse of Araya and faints. She wakes up in a nightmarish labyrinth, where at the end she hears Sorn and Araya's argument, and finds a ghostly version of Araya hanging. Araya transforms into a vengeful ghost, believing that there is no one left who cares about her. Rama finds the room where an unconscious Mariya and Araya's corpse are. If Rama looks at Araya's corpse, he can examine the nail in her forehead. After trying to wake Marisa, Jit enters the room and attacks Rama. Rama pushes Jit away, and is then given the option to either kill or spare Jit. Rama's boss comes in the room and knocks Rama out, blaming him for ruining his and Jit's unknown plan. The boss in turn is pushed by Araya's ghost and knocks his head against a table, and presumably dies. Marisa awakes and tries to escape from Araya. When she is by the exit, the spirit appears and blocks her way. There are two endings that can happen depending on whether or not Jit was spared: if he was spared, Jit will come and attack the spirit by stabbing her in the forehead with his sacred dagger. If Jit is killed, it is Rama who attacks Araya instead. Either way, the three main characters escape the burning hospital. Marisa wakes up surrounded by police outside. Rama stares at the hospital. Boon is trying to explain to a policeman what happened. If Jit is spared, he can be seen sitting on the ground outside holding his head in his hands. Marisa looks up at the hospital sadly, and the game ends with someone reaching for her hand. Characters *Marisa: A brave, confident girl and the only friend Araya ever had.

History Conquerors and Settlers Juan P√©rez de Tolosa, judge of residence for the zone of Venezuela and Cabo de la Vela, arrived in 1546 and restored the order in the city of Coro and Tocuyo. His brother Alonso recognized what would be Trujillo. We should point out the first Simon Bolivar, from Zenarruza, royal clerk and secretary of the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, who from Santo Domingo passed, in 1589, to Caracas as the first perpetual regidor and procurator general. He was responsible for the creation of schools of first letters and a seminary of grammar directed by Juan de Arteaga and Sim√≥n de Basauri (1591). Captain Antonio de Berrio, a pearl seeker in Guayana, goes down the rivers to the Orinoco where he founds San Jose de Oru√±a (1592) and Santo Tom√°s de Guayana (1593, later Angostura). A further mention deserves the new adventure of El Dorado (1561) with Lope de Aguirre and Pedro de Urs√∫a as protagonists and Barquisimeto as the end point of it. Already in the c. XVII, ranch owners, such as Francisco de Arrieta, Pedro Hern√°ndez de Galarza and Antonio Arraez de Mendoza in the Bobures Valley, Juan F√©lix de Arr√∫a in the Chama valley, etc. Among the governors and members of the Caracas chapter, Basque's surnames such as Alquiza, Hernani, O√±ate, Aguirre, Hoz de Berrio, Ybarra, Bol√≠var, Lezama, Arguinzoniz, Zabala, Arechederra, Mendoza, Arteaga, M√∫xica and Butr√≥n, Villela, Echeverria, Landaeta, Guevara, Zuazo, Arraez, Ochoa, Bera settled on the city. In Barinas, the Ochagav√≠a, in Barquisimeto the Ansola, in M√©rida the Uzcategui, etc. In the fight against the Dutch pirates of the first third of the century, Navarre Lope D√≠az de Armend√°riz (Marquis of Cadreita), Admiral Manuel de Red√≠n and his brother, Captain Tiburcio Red√≠n, who in 1637 entered Capuchin and died in 1651 in La Guaira. Capuchin missionaries They were part of the white population penetration, for which they learned the aboriginal languages. In 1672 Francisco de Puente la Reina and 10 other friars, passed to Cuman√° where they resided during 40 years. This Navarrese founded the Conversion of the Christian Doctrine for the Chaima Indians. Francisco Javier de Alfaro (Manuel Fr√≠as) moved from the convent of Los Arcos to Maracaibo; wrote a catechism for each group of native coianos, chaques and anatomists. Nicol√°s de Renteria missioned in Los Llanos in 1663. Antonio de Idiazabal arrived in Venezuela in 1672 and died, ill, in Cuman√°. Real Compa√±√≠a Guipuzcoana de Caracas Logo of the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas It was the most important mercantile company of its time (1728-1785); Its objective to displace the Dutch from the Venezuelan cocoa trade (also tobacco and hides). The royal permit authorized the Guipuzcoans to bring it in exchange for carrying their own merchandise from Pasaia and Cadiz and to pay a canon to the monopolistic port of Cadiz. The main factor in Caracas was Pedro de Olavarriaga. Factories were opened in La Guaira, Caracas, Puerto Cabello, San Felipe, Maracaibo, Cuman√° and Guayana. Not only did he carry goods from Gipuzkoa, but also supplies and troops and enabled his own ships to defend Venezuela from the English attacks, a war in which Blas de Lezo was distinguished. It was due to the colonization of Cumana and several fishing trials. The free trade declaration of 1778 and the English harassment determined its closure. The Basques established in Venezuela continued colonization mainly in the valleys of Aragua, in the plains of Cojedes, Portuguesa, Orinoco and coasts of Caracas. They introduced, among other things, the indigo of dye, the cotton and the sugar cane. The link with Pasaia-San Sebasti√°n remained until the end of the century. Second wave of Basque immigration In 1939 as a result of the Spanish Civil War, begins the arrival at Venezuelan ports of what is considered the largest migration of Basques to Venezuela since the colony. With the support of the Basque Government in exile, the Venezuelan Government of General Eleazar L√≥pez Contreras and with the approval of a large number of Venezuelan intellectuals such as Arturo Uslar Pietri and Antonio Arra√≠z, on June 24 of the same year, 82 Basques addressed the Transatlantic \\"Cuba\\" in the French port of Le Havre departing for Venezuela under the notes of the Txistu de Segundo de Atxurra who interprets the Agur Jaunak, many of them said goodbye to their land to not see it again. The arrival of this first contingent was an event in the Caracas of the time and the local press echoed the same dedicating some reviews, in the same it is mentioned that on Sunday July 6, 1939 after hearing Mass in the Church of Santa Rosal√≠a in the city of Caracas, the group accompanied by Arturo Uslar Pietri and Sim√≥n Gonzalo Salas make a wreath to the remains of the Liberator Simon Bolivar in the National Pantheon, singing the Agur Jaunak, the National Anthem of Venezuela and the Eusko Abendaren Ereserkia, creating this last great controversy since some media criticized this, erroneously, for having been interpreted communist hymns in the national pantheon, a situation that was not taken into account by the Venezuelan Government. To this first contingent others occurred almost consecutively and with a larger number of people. Caracas Basque Center On March 3, 1950, the Basque Center of Caracas was inaugurated with the presence of the Lehendakari Jos√© Antonio Aguirre and the Basque delegate in New York, Jes√∫s de Gal√≠ndez, where they keep alive the legacies and customs of the exiles and publish Caracas'ko Eusko Etxea. At present it is the most populous Basque Center (600 families, predominantly Vizcainos and Alaveses) and one of the most important in the world. Built in the neighborhood of El Para√≠so. Euzko Gaztedi and the extraterritorial press EG was created in 1948 in the heart of the Centro Vasco de Caracas (Basque Center of Caracas) with the purpose of grouping the youth and promoting cultural and social activities. Its presidents were: Mart√≠n Ugalde, Sabin Zenarruzabeitia, Jon Urrezti, I√±aki Elguezabal, Jon Aretxabaleta, Jesus Dolara, Joseba Leizaola, Rosario Amestoy, I√±aki Aretxabaleta, Joseba Bilbao, Joseba Iturralde, Txomin Bizkarret, Bilgen Am√©zaga, I√±aki Anasagasti, Jes√∫s Azpiritxaga, I√±aki Goikoetxea, Xabier Azpiritxaga, Adolfo Urrutia and Ander Amenabar. From the work of this group invigorated by Jokin Intza emerges Euzko Gaztedi of the Basque Interior- Resistance (EGI), dependent of the PNV, that clandestinely introduced the magazine \\"Gudari\\" in Overseas between 1960-1974 and published important titles (Steer, Land√°buru, Azpiazu, Aguirre, Leizaola, Abrisketa, etc.). Some of its members and the new refugees of the 60 establish a group related to ETA. The Basque-Venezuelan impulse to the Basque press in America, France and underground was very important with about 30 different modalities among which the magazine \\"Noticentro\\" of the Caracas Basque Center.

When he feels dizzy, he is transported to what is described as the \\"space-time of [his] reveries\\" by a guardian of the Louvre. The guardians are the souls of each piece of art, with the guardian he meets being of the Winged Victory of Samothrace. On his second day at the Louvre, he looks at the paintings of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. While looking at Recollection of Mortefontaine, he meets Asai Ch≈´, who had worked on introducing Western-style art to Japan. He is then transported to an art gallery in Ueno which is exhibiting Ch≈´'s works posthumously and hears the writer Natsume S≈çseki speaking of Ch≈´'s work.

Hans Rollman of PopMatters said that Guardians of the Louvre \\"demonstrates that contemporary manga artists can hold their own against the greatest in the pantheon of western art\\", commending its artwork and atmosphere, while describing the plot as minimal. Publishers Weekly called the manga \\"coolly and resplendently drawn, if rather indifferently written\\". Katherine Dacey of MangaBlog was critical of the manga's \\"middlebrow sensibility\\" and attempt to dictate how art should be appreciated, but commended its sensual imagery. Summer Hayes of Booklist liked the use of color in the manga to \\"heighten emotion, create distance, and echo artistic styles\\", concluding that while the story has seams, the manga is a \\"voyeuristic trip\\" showing the relationship between art and life. Guardians of the Louvre was part of the selection for the (2015 Fnac Comics Prize).

Background Aaron and Jessica Schaffhausen married in 2000 and both filed for divorce in 2011; the divorce was finalized the subsequent year, in January. Jessica Schaffhausen and their daughters, Amara, Sophie, and Cecilia, lived in a house in River Falls which they rented from Aaron Schaffhausen while he lived in Minot, North Dakota. The ex-wife had primary physical custody and determined the girls' education and health care; otherwise the two parties had joint custody. Amara and Sophie attended Greenwood Elementary School. Crime On July 10, 2012 Schaffhausen sent a text message to his wife requesting a visit to his daughters. The daughters were in the house while the ex-wife was not present. The babysitter left the house after the father arrived. After he arrived, he slit the throats of the three girls. He also strangled Cecilia. Amara, Sophie, and Cecilia were 11, 8, and 5. He later called Jessica Schaffhausen to tell her that he had killed them. A can of gasoline was spilled onto the ground. He turned himself in after arriving at a police station in River Falls. He was charged with three murders and attempted arson. Schaffhausen's bond was set to $2 million. Trial and punishment On March 29, 2013 Schaffhausen entered a \\"guilty but insane\\" plea. Prosecutors accused Schaffhausen of killing the girls to get revenge against his ex-wife. Schaffhausen stated that this was his motive, but that he did not know right from wrong due to a mental issue. Schaffhausen also pleaded guilty to attempted arson. According to prosecutors, Schaffhausen disliked the fact that his ex-wife was romantically involved with someone else and that he held resentment over the prior divorce. In April 2013 a jury ruled that Schaffhausen was sane when he committed the murders. Jurors took three and a half hours to conclude that Schaffhausen knew right from wrong despite his mental issues. Howard Cameron, the St. Croix County judge, gave him three life sentences without parole, one for each victim. In 2014 Cameron also made Schaffhausen pay over $14,000 in restitution to Jessica Schaffhausen; about one fourth of the money given by his family and any money he earns while in prison will be garnished and given to the ex-wife. In addition he was asked to pay witness costs of $10,000. In 2015 one of Schaffhausen's appeals was denied. Schaffhausen was housed in the St. Croix County Jail during his trial. He entered the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in July 2013, and is incarcerated at Waupun Correctional Institution.

Features Main memory Main memory for the Model 168, which was \\"four-way doubleword interleaved,\\" could be 1 to 8 megabytes, with offerings selectable in increments of one megabyte. Newer technology than that of the 370/165, which had been introduced 2 years prior, used \\"monolithic, instead of magnetic core\\" memory, resulting in a system which was faster and physically smaller than a Model 165.

Information is presented as screenshots, text descriptions, videos, and web links. As Windows upgrades have traditionally been drastic, each version since Windows 95 has had its own tutorial app, and the name has changed frequently. Notably, the feature list shown has tended to expand as newer versions of Windows are released and the most recently released tutorial receives updates through the Microsoft Store, allowing it to receive updates more frequently than Windows itself is upgraded. Evolution Tips originated with a popup in Windows 95 named Welcome to Windows 95, a series of screens that resembled Windows Installer and introduced the user to the Start menu and dial-up networking. The popup appeared the first time a user logged into Windows. A nearly identical popup named Welcome to NT was included in the 1996 release of Windows NT 4.0. The Windows 98 version featured a new sidebar design and a cloud background. The contents were arranged into four categories: Register Now, Connect to the Internet, Discover Windows 98, and Maintain Your Computer. In the Getting Started with Windows 2000 popup, the Maintain Your Computer section was removed and the Windows 2000 logo was added. Windows ME replaced the static information popup with a much larger Flash-based narrated tutorial popup named Welcome to Windows ME. It began with a video and included four main sections: Digital Media, Rich Internet Experience, Home Networking, and Improved User Experience. XP followed up with a larger Flash-based narrated tutorial called Windows XP Tour, which was also published online, with five sections: Best for Business, Safe and Easy Personal Computing, Unlock the World of Digital Media, The Connected Home and Office, and Windows XP Basics. While the narrator showed users around, music based on the XP theme played. The tour emphasizes Windows XP's then-new features but also explained basic features such as windowing and the Recycle Bin. When all sections are played in one session, the session lasts about 20 minutes. Windows Vista replaced the Windows XP Tour with a Control Panel screen called Welcome Center that provided links to tools available to users, with an emphasis on setting up a new computer or using Vista for the first time. It was originally known as Welcome Center and opened at startup, although it could be disabled. Welcome Center informed users what edition of Vista they were using at the top and 21 links to other items at the bottom. Some of the links provided information at the top of the current screen, some opened other parts of the Control Panel, and some linked to the Internet. The 21 links included View computer details, Transfer files and settings, Add new users, Connect to the Internet, Windows Ultimate Extras, What's new in Windows Vista, Go online to learn about Windows Live, Go online to find it fast with Windows Live, Go online to help protect your PC with Windows Live, Go online to Windows Marketplace, Go online to find more ways to help protect your PC, and Sign up online for technical support. Despite Welcome Center's emphasis on online features and add-ons, it was not designed for receiving frequent updates and has not been updated. As a result, it still links to the discontinued Windows Live, discontinued Windows Marketplace, discontinued Windows Ultimate Extras, and renamed Windows Live Search. In Windows 7, Welcome Center was renamed Getting Started. Getting Started featured fewer links, and the links provided reflect the new features in Windows 7 and Windows Live in 2009. Get Started includes nine links: Go online to find what's new in Windows 7, Personalize Windows, Transfer files and settings from another computer, Use a homegroup to share with other computers in your home, Choose when to be notified about changes to your computer, Go online to get Windows Live Essentials, Back up your files, Add new users to your computer, and Change the size of the text on your screen. Getting Started does not start up automatically, but it is pinned to the Windows 7 Start menu. In Windows 8.0, Getting Started was completely removed. Windows 8.1 introduced a new app called Help + Tips that was pinned to the Start screen. It features a primary screen with a search box six tiles that focus exclusively on features new to Windows 8: Start and apps, Get around, Basic actions, Your account and files, Settings, and What's new. The info in each tile's section is viewed with horizontal scrolling. In addition to the app, Windows 8.1 features hints for finding hidden navigation menus, buttons, and flyouts. Windows 10's introductory app was originally titled Getting Started but was renamed Get Started before it was generally released to the public. The first few iterations featured a large, comprehensive hamburger menu with sidebar links for most major topics. Later iterations minimized the interface by including a welcome page with links to the Internet, a section for new topics, and a page with links to all topics in the app. It continues to receive updates from the Windows Store as Windows 10 apps and the system itself continue to change. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, Get Started was renamed Tips. Tips' interface is entirely different in Windows 10's Retail Demo Mode, which is used on Windows 10 PCs on display at stores. In Retail Demo Mode, Tips features a different set of information that informs the consumer about Windows 10, Microsoft Office, and sometimes the brand of the computer Tips is running on.

Launched in 1756, she was a successful privateer hunter off the coast of France before being reassigned to North American waters in 1763. Fifteen years later she was briefly refitted as a receiving ship for press ganged sailors brought into Sheerness Dockyard, before being re-registered in August 1779 as the fireship Comet.Winfield 2007, pp.310-311 In December 1780 she was sold into private hands at Sheerness Dockyard for ¬£300. Construction Diligence was one of three vessels built to a 1755 design by Surveyor of the Navy William Bately, and collectively known as Alderney-class sloops in recognition of which was the first to be formally contracted for construction. This was Bately's first experience with vessel design, for which he substantially borrowed from the shape and dimensions of George IIs yacht HMY Royal Caroline, built in 1750 by Master Shipwright John Hollond.McLaughlin 2014, p. 208, 279 Bately then added to Hollond's hull design by lengthening the \\"fore-rake\\" ‚Äì the area of the bow that extended beyond the keel ‚Äì in order to improve the sloop's stability in heavy swell.McLaughlin 2014, p.208 Admiralty Orders of 14 November 1755 indicated that the Alderney-class vessels were to be built at private dockyards, leaving the Royal Dockyards fully engaged in constructing or fitting-out the larger ships of the line. For previous Navy contracts the prices quoted by Thames River shipyards had proved exorbitant, and the Navy Board had evidence that the shipwrights were colluding to fix higher rates for construction work. In consequence only regional shipwrights were invited to bid for Diligence, with the contract awarded on 27 February 1756 to William Wells and Company, a private shipyard in Deptford. Contract terms stipulated that the vessel be completed within six months. The new vessel's keel was laid in March 1756 and work commenced on the hull. Bately's initial design was for a two-masted snow-rigged sloop, but Diligence was the only one completed to this specification; her sister ships Alderney and were modified in mid-1756 into a traditional three-masted ship rig to increase speed at the expense of manoeuvrability. When completed, Diligence was long with a keel, a beam of and a hold. As fitted out for Royal Navy service she was lightly armed with 10 four-pounder cannons ranged along her upper deck, accompanied by 12 -pounder swivel guns for anti-personnel use. The half-built sloop was formally christened Diligence on 25 May 1756 and was launched in July 1756, well within the contracted deadline of six months. After launch, she was sailed to Deptford Dockyard for fitting out and to take on guns and crew.

Both men were arrested and without receiving a fair trial were executed by the police at the police headquarters in San Juan. News of the assassinations spread throughout the United States and lead to legislative proposal by U.S. Senator Millard Tydings, to grant independence to Puerto Rico. Early years Rosado (birth name: Hiram Rosado Ayala ) was born in the town of Ciales, Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. Rosado enjoyed reading and his father, Pedro Rosado would often buy him books. Rosado also had a passion for music and played the violin.\\"Latino History and Culture: An Encyclopedia\\" ; By David J. Leonard, Carmen R. Lugo-Lugo; Publisher: Sharpe Reference; 1st edition (2010) ; ‚Ä¢ . After he graduated, Rosado went to work for a company called FERA where he became a supervisor. Puerto Rican Nationalist Party The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was founded by Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠ as a direct response to the American colonial government in 1919, By the 1920s, there were two other pro- independence organizations in the Island, they were the \\"Nationalist Youth\\" and the \\"Independence Association of Puerto Rico\\". On September 17, 1922, the two political organizations merged into the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and on May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico , (December 1, 2006), , Rosado was interested in the cause for Puerto Rican independence and joined the Nationalist Party. He became a member of the Cadets of the Republic (Cadetes de la Republica) where he befriended fellow cadet El√≠as Beauchamp. The cadets was a quasi-military youth organization of the Nationalist Party also known as the \\"Liberation Army of Puerto Rico\\". Events leading to a massacre In 1931, the U.S.-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. named Dr. Carlos E. Chard√≥n as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1935, Chard√≥n initiated a project based on the ideas of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who at the time was a Senator in the Puerto Rican legislature and member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. It was known as the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico Project. The plan, which was within the New Deal criteria established by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression, was well received and became known as Plan Chard√≥n.Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia, Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938; p. 292; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); On October 20, 1935, in a political meeting which the Nationalist Party held in the town of Maunabo and which was transmitted by radio, Albizu Campos denounced Chard√≥n, the university deans and the Liberal Party as traitors, saying they wanted to convert the university into an \\"American\\" propaganda institution.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 305 On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university who supported Chard√≥n began to collect signatures for a petition to declare Albizu Campos \\"Student Enemy Number One.\\" In turn, a protest against the group by the pro-Nationalist faction of students denounced Chard√≥n and the Liberal Party as agents of the United States.

Two police officers spotted a \\"suspicious-looking vehicle\\" and asked the driver, Ram√≥n S. Pag√°n, and his friend Pedro Qui√±ones, for identification. A struggle ensued, and the police killed Pag√°n and Qui√±ones.

Riggs Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs was born in Georgetown, a historic neighborhood located in northwest Washington, D.C.. Riggs was a former officer in the United States Army who was appointed Chief of Police of Puerto Rico in 1933, by Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico. He was an unpopular police chief, stemming from his decisions to repress the growing sugar cane labor movement and the Nationalist Pro-Independence Movement.\\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America‚Äôs Colony\\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); . The R√≠o Piedras Massacre enraged the nationalists including Rosado and Beauchamps. The nationalists believed that Elisha F. Riggs was responsible since Riggs was the police chief of Puerto Rico and the entire Insular Police took their orders from Riggs. Beauchamps decided to retaliate with the help of Rosado. On Sunday, February 23, 1936, Elisha F. Riggs had attended mass in the Church of Santa Ana in San Juan. When the mass was over, Riggs stepped out of the church and got into his car, a Packard, driven by Angel Alvarez, a police officer. Rosado knew the route which Riggs would normally take and waited. When Riggs' car reached the corner of Allen and Gambaro Streets, Rosado came out of his hideout and began shooting towards Riggs. Rosado then made a run for it, but was soon captured by Alvarez. All the while, Riggs got out of his car and began asking for the declarations of those who witnessed the attempt on his life. He was suddenly approached by Beauchamps who said: Believing that he had a witness to the events Riggs told Beauchamps that he was headed to the police station and to accompany him. Beauchamps boarded Riggs chauffeured car and shot Riggs in the head killing him instantly. Beauchamp tried to escape and hid inside \\"Rodriguez y Palacios\\", a warehouse in Tetuan Street. Both men were arrested and taken to the San Juan police headquarters located in 305 San Francisco Street. They were not given a fair trial, instead Beauchamps and Rosado were both gunned down in the police station.\\"The Puerto Ricans: A Documentary History\\"; by: Markus Wiener Publishers; 2008; Page 179 Beauchamps died immediately and Rosado was transferred to a local hospital. In the hospital his last words to a nurse where: He later died of the gun wounds which he received. In the aftermath of the killings, the police claimed that the nationalists were shot because they attempted to escape. None of the police officers involved were demoted or suspended. The news of the assassination of Elisha F. Riggs spread throughout the United States. At that time Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, was in Washington, D.C. and Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935‚Äì1937), asked him to condemn Riggs' assassination. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n told Gruening that he would do so only if he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering the Nationalists in the city police station without a trial. Post assassination After Riggs' assassination, many Nationalist Party leaders were imprisoned. Members of the Puerto Rican independence movement came under greater scrutiny and persecution. Among the leaders arrested was Pedro Albizu Campos, These leaders were charged with having \\"conspired to overthrow\\" the U.S. government on the island. They were tried in Boston, Massachusetts, as that federal district court had jurisdiction for Puerto Rico. The first trial jury refused to convict, and ended in a hung jury. A second jury was picked, consisting solely of \\"Anglo-Americans.\\" This jury found every Nationalist charged to be \\"guilty\\".Historical Timeline, PR Dream The bodies of both nationalists were returned to their respective families.

The role of anthropology in institutions has expanded significantly since the end of the 20th century. Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of globalization in both institutions and the field of anthropology. Anthropologists can be employed by institutions such as for-profit business, nonprofit organizations, and governments. For instance, cultural anthropologists are commonly employed by the United States federal government. The two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are total institutions and social institutions. Total institutions are places that comprehensively coordinate the actions of people within them, and examples of total institutions include prisons, convents, and hospitals. Social institutions, on the other hand, are constructs that regulate individuals‚Äô day-to-day lives, such as kinship, religion, and economics. Anthropology of institutions may analyze labor unions, businesses ranging from small enterprises to corporations, government, medical organizations, education, prisons, and financial institutions. Nongovernmental organizations have garnered particular interest in the field of institutional anthropology because they are capable of fulfilling roles previously ignored by governments, or previously realized by families or local groups, in an attempt to mitigate social problems. The types and methods of scholarship performed in the anthropology of institutions can take a number of forms. Institutional anthropologists may study the relationship between organizations or between an organization and other parts of society. Institutional anthropology may also focus on the inner workings of an institution, such as the relationships, hierarchiesand cultures formed, and the ways that these elements are transmitted and maintained, transformed, or abandoned over time. Additionally, some anthropology of institutions examines the specific design of institutions and their corresponding strength. More specifically, anthropologists may analyze specific events within an institution, perform semiotic investigations, or analyze the mechanisms by which knowledge and culture are organized and dispersed. In all manifestations of institutional anthropology, participant observation is critical to understanding the intricacies of the way an institution works and the consequences of actions taken by individuals within it. Simultaneously, anthropology of institutions extends beyond examination of the commonplace involvement of individuals in institutions to discover how and why the organizational principles evolved in the manner that they did. Common considerations taken by anthropologists in studying institutions include the physical location at which a researcher places themselves, as important interactions often take place in private, and the fact that the members of an institution are often being examined in their workplace and may not have much idle time to discuss the details of their everyday endeavors. The ability of individuals to present the workings of an institution in a particular light or frame must additionally be taken into account when using interviews and document analysis to understand an institution, as the involvement of an anthropologist may be met with distrust when information being released to the public isn‚Äôt directly controlled by the institution and could potentially be damaging.

The suburb is named after Armstrong's cottage. Armstrong influenced development in the Swan River colony with properties in both Dalkeith and in his later property in Ravenswood. Early life Armstrong was born on 23 February 1788 in Smeaton, near Dalkeith, Midlothian, Scotland. His middle name \\"Pearson\\" was not on his birth certificate. Confusion concerning a Captain Armstrong who served in the Peninsular Wars and lost an eye, was at one time taken as accurate but disproved later. In 1810 he married Margaret Gow, whose father Nathaniel Gow and grandfather Niel Gow were celebrated Scottish musicians. Musical interests were evident in the family, and a harmonium they brought out is displayed, with other family memorabilia, in the Azelia Ley Homestead Museum in Hamilton Hill. In 1811, Armstrong bought a part of the Drum coalfield in Scotland. However the Drum Colliery Company failed due to flooding issues and the availability of cheaper coal from England. Armstrong moved his family to England and then to Wales. In Wales, his last position prior to moving to London was as an agent for William Edward Powell, who owned the Nanteos estate. Such was the friendship between the two that when Armstrong's only daughter was born he named her after Powell's wife Laura. Armstrong was dismissed from Nanteos and went to London, where he found clerical work with Thomas Peel at 1 Eagle Place, Piccadilly. Peel was taking up an offer by Captain James Stirling to provide free settlers the opportunity to move to the new settlement on the Swan River in Western Australia. Australia Peel had been promised land grants if he arrived at the colony before 1 November 1829, but on arrival with the Armstrongs on on 15 December 1829 discovered this land had been given to someone else. His other ships, and , were also carrying settlers so he was persuaded to accept an area of land named Clarence, between the present day suburbs of Mandurah and Rockingham and inland to Pinjarra. Armstrong was Peel's surveyor and he took up a parcel of land with good water to establish a farm on the Murray River that he named Ravenswood, establishing one of many Scottish connections. The family struggled to survive initially, in shelters made of wooden horse stalls, barrels and canvas, and eating food mostly brought by English ships. Attempts at farming were unsuccessful because of winter flooding and the theft of stock, so six families who had hoped to live there all returned to Perth and Fremantle. Armstrong acquired land in Fremantle, lot numbers P99 and P84 around Thompson Street, Harbour Street Laneway and Quarry Street. He had befriended Captain Currie, the harbour master who lived on Crawley Bay, and the Armstrong children were to stay there until their father found a better place. Armstrong had no money for provisions, relying on loans to buy food for his family. He was granted Swan Location 85 comprising on 18 September 1831. He dug the water well that can still be seen at the site, built a cottage on the foreshore using limestone from the cliff, becoming Nedlands' first European settler. The surrounding bush and pastureland was cultivated successfully by the Armstrong family, with Adam naming their new home Dalkeith Cottage after the Scottish town where he grew up. When he came to sell his land in 1838, he had developed a farm of about on the fertile soil of the foreshore of Melville Water.

Generic advertising of medical nostrums and other products typical of that appearing on a preprinted \\"patent inside\\" sheet. During the Civil War year of 1863, Andrew J. Aikens devised an idea improving upon an older British idea of preprinting multiple local editions of newspapers, using common plates for most of the internal content. Aikens' idea was to print one side of a sheet with news and advertising and to provide these sheets at little or no cost to publishers of weekly newspapers, covering costs and generating profit from the advertising sold. Local publishers would be free to print on the other side of the page as they wished ‚Äî thereby obtaining syndicated content without charge as well as free or very low cost newsprint. These preprinted sheets were commonly known as \\"patent insides,\\" probably due to the preponderance of patent medicine advertising which they contained.See, for example, \\"The Power and Influence of the Proprietary Association of America,\\" Journal of the American Medical Association, vol. 45, no. 21 (Nov. 18, 1905), pg. 1577, which editorializes about the \\"patent insides\\" used by \\"country newspapers\\" and their relationship to the patent medicine industry. The earliest use of this precise phrase found using the Newspapers.com search engine dates to January 1868. \\"Madison County Courier,\\" Alton [IL] Weekly Telegraph, Jan. 10, 1868, pg. 1. In 1868, Aikens was rewarded with a partnership in the publishing company which produced The Daily Wisconsin, which was henceforth known as Cramer, Aikens, & Cramer. Shortly thereafter the name of the publication was changed to The Evening Wisconsin, a title which it retained into the 20th Century.Bruce, (ed.), History of Milwaukee City and County: Volume 1, pp. 719-720. Cramer, Aikens, & Cramer soon generated a lucrative business around its \\"patent insides,\\" with Aikens creating what he called \\"Newspaper Unions,\\" making use of preprints that he created at dedicated printing facilities in New York, Chicago, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Nashville, and Memphis. Profits generated from this specialized operation helped to subsidize losses incurred by The Evening Wisconsin during economic lean times, helping to ensure the paper's survival. Aikens' patent insides and ones produced by rivals rose in popularity in the 19th century. The trade journal Printers' Ink estimated in 1894 that more than 7,000 weekly newspapers in the United States relied on patent insides produced by five companies.

He is best known for the songs \\"Rasm-e-Ulfat Ko Nibhayen\\" (Dil Ki Rahen, 1973), \\"Tumhe Ho Na Ho\\" (Gharonda, 1977), \\"Yeh Mulaqaat Ek Bahana Hai \\" (Khandaan, 1979), \\"Pyar Ka Dard Hai\\" (Dard, 1981), and \\"Chitthiye Ni Dard Firaaq Vaaliye\\" (Henna, 1991).  Early life  Jaswant Rai Sharma was born in Lyallpur (now called Faisalabad and in present-day Pakistan) on 24 February 1928 to a Punjabi-Brahmin family. His father, a mechanical engineer, wanted Jaswant to be an engineer, too. He disapproved of Jaswant's affinity for literature. His mother died of chickenpox when he was eight and his father remarried, after which the father-son relationship deteriorated. In 1946 Sharma worked at a publishing house named Hero Publications and later moved to Lahore looking for work. After the Partition of India, the family migrated to Lucknow. Sharma later took on the pen name \\"Naqsh\\" ‚Äì meaning an impression, a mark or a print ‚Äì and added \\"Lyallpuri\\" to it, following the tradition of Urdu poets to associate with their birthplace. Lyallpuri moved to Bombay in 1951 and started working at The Times of India as a proofreader. He married Kamlesh, with whom he has three sons, Bappan, Rajendra, and Suneet. His family members also adopted Lyallpuri as their surname. Lyallpuri credits his wife as his \\"pillar of strength\\" who supported him in his unsuccessful years. His son Rajendra \\"Rajan\\" Lyallpuri is a cinematographer.  Works  Lyallpuri came to Mumbai in the 1950s seeking a career in the Hindi film industry. He started writing stage plays and was introduced to actor Ram Mohan, who was an assistant to actor-director Jagdish Sethi. Mohan introduced Lyallpuri to Sethi, who listened to his poetry and asked him to write songs for his next film. Lyallpuri debuted as a film lyricist with the 1953 film Jaggu, writing the lyrics of \\"Agar Teri Aankhon Se Aankhein Mila Doon\\", rendered by Asha Bhosle and composed by Hansraj Bahl. Until the 1970s, Lyallpuri's work did not meet with success. He worked in the postal department to earn his living. Music director Jaidev introduced him to television serials and asked him to write lyrics for the Hindi television series Shrikant. Lyallpuri went on to write songs for about 50 TV serials along with nearly 40 Punjabi films. Lyallpuri collaborated with various Bollywood music directors, including Madan Mohan, Khayyam, Sapan Jagmohan, Jaidev, Naushad, and Ravindra Jain, and Punjabi music composers like Surinder Kohli, Hansraj Bahl, Ved Sethi, and Husnlal-Bhagatram. He had a close association with director B. R. Ishara from their first film, Chetna, in 1970, which Lyallpuri's song \\"Main Toh Har Mod Par Tujhko Doonga Sada\\" performed by Mukesh. Lyallpuri's songs have been noted for being \\"hummable\\", although they did not make a major impact on the overall industry. He avoided unwarranted word play and kept the lyrics simple, although he used Urdu words frequently. His command of Urdu made many doubt his Punjabi ethnicity. In his earlier career, he faced competition from Sahir Ludhianvi, Hasrat Jaipuri, and Shailendra and later from other Urdu-poets like Gulzar and Majrooh Sultanpuri, who were all well established in the Hindi film industry. Lyallpuri hence focused on Hindi B-grade films and Punjabi films. His 1973 song \\"Rasm-e-Ulfat Ko Nibhayen\\" for the film Dil Ki Rahen was sung by Lata Mangeshkar. Mangeshkar counts it as her favourite Lyallpuri song but gives credit for its success to the music composed by Madan Mohan, based on raag Madhuvanti and the lyrics written by Lyallpuri, rather than her own singing. Lyallpuri is best known for the song \\"Tumhe Ho Na Ho\\" from the film Gharonda (1977), sung by Bangladeshi singer Runa Laila. The song is often wrongly ascribed to Gulzar, who wrote the other songs in the film, whereas the song \\"Do Deewane Shahar Mein\\" in the same film is misattributed to Lyallpuri. The 1979 song \\"Yeh Mulaqaat Ek Bahana Hai\\" in the film Khandaan is noted for its unusual ghazal format. His \\"Pyar Ka Dard Hai\\" from the 1981 film Dard has been lauded for Kishore Kumar's soft singing and for using \\"everyday lyrics\\". He also wrote the only Punjabi song \\"Chitthiye Ni Dard Firaaq Vaaliye\\" in the film Henna (1991). Lyallpuri published two books: Teri Gali Ki Taref (On Your Street) is a collection of his non-film shayari and Angan Angan Barse Geet features his songs from films, television serials, and music albums. Lyallpuri took a sabbatical from films in the 1990s, disliking the lyrical style prevalent then, some using profanity and continued with television. He returned in the 2000s penning lyrics for the films Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story (2005) and Yatra (2007), collaborating with his earlier music directors Naushad and Khayyam, respectively. He was a founding member of the Indian Performing Rights Society, which works for royalty rights of music directors and lyricists. ; Selective filmography * 1952 ‚Äì Jaggu * 1955 ‚Äì Ghamand * 1958 ‚Äì Rifle Girl * 1959 ‚Äì Circus Queen * 1960 ‚Äì Choron Ki Baraat * 1960 ‚Äì Road No. 303 * 1968 - Teri Talash Mein * 1970 ‚Äì Chetna * 1971 ‚Äì Man Tera Tan Mera * 1972 ‚Äì Man Jaiye * 1973 ‚Äì Dil Ki Rahen * 1974 ‚Äì Parinay * 1974 ‚Äì Call Girl * 1977 ‚Äì Gharonda * 1975 ‚Äì Kaagaz Ki Nao * 1978 ‚Äì Tumhare Liye * 1979 ‚Äì Khandaan * 1981 ‚Äì Ahista Ahista * 1981 ‚Äì Dard * 1982 ‚Äì Dil-e-Nadaan * 1985 ‚Äì Kala Suraj * 1991 ‚Äì Heena * 2005 ‚Äì Taj Mahal: An Eternal Love Story * 2007 ‚Äì Yatra  Death  Lyallpuri suffered from a hip bone fracture in March 2016 and was hospitalized in October 2016.

She is on the radio at 3AW and 2GB. Early life and education Rita Panahi was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, USA in 1976. Her mother was a midwife and her father was an agricultural engineer; they were from Iran. They returned to Iran during her infancy, living on the coast and moving to Tehran by 1979. Her mother worked for a hospital associated with the Shah during the Iranian Revolution. Panahi describes her parents as 'relaxed Muslims who were not particularly political'. However, her family was targeted by the repressive Islamic regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini. In 1984, they were accepted by Australia as refugees and lived in Melbourne. Panahi worked in banking while attending Monash University, studying but not completing a Bachelor of Business Finance. She joined Australian Young Labor and volunteered in the 1996 election campaign. Panahi worked as a personal banker at Colonial Mutual and was the youngest branch manager in the company's history. She has a child and is a single mother at present. Journalism career Panahi initially wrote for the daily newspaper mX, writing a weekly sports gossip column. Her column was picked up for a second year and by 2007 she was a regular guest on the AM sports radio station SEN. She earned her MBA from Swinburne. In September 2007, Panahi began working for the Herald Sun, published by the Herald and Weekly Times (HWT), a subsidiary of News Corp Australia. Panahi is also a regular guest on Sky News and Sunrise on the Seven Network. She is also a radio commentator on 3AW and 2GB. Panahi is described as a conservative. However, she has argued against the burqa but opposes banning it. She criticises parts of Islam, but opposes a ban on Muslim immigration. She supports offshore detention camps for illegal immigrants, while also supporting asylum seekers who arrive to Australia by boat. She has been described as 'surprisingly' progressive on some social issues. Writing for SBS, Margaret Simons observed that Panahi hates homophobia and has argued in favour of women choosing single motherhood, as she has. In January 2015, Panahi sparred with Andrew O'Keefe on Weekend Sunrise over Islamic extremists. She said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to stop ... pretending like Islam is like any other religion as far as being behind incidences of terror‚Äù and ‚Äúif you value the rights of women you‚Äôd have issues with the burqa‚Äù. In January 2015, Panahi wrote an article entitled ‚ÄòIslam, you have a very serious problem‚Äô which was published in the ‚Äò‚ÄôDaily Telegraph‚Äô‚Äô. News website New Matilda published an open letter critical of Panahi‚Äôs article. In a debate over racism in early 2016, Panahi was on a team opposing ABC presenter Stan Grant. Panahi argued that Australia should not be characterised as racist. In January 2017, Panahi was encouraged by Michael Kroger to stand for Liberal Party pre-selection in the Victorian state electorate of Frankston. In March 2018, Panahi began hosting The Friday Show on Sky News Live.

Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney ordered the hiring freeze lifted on April 12, 2017.  Provisions  The order instituted a 90-day hiring freeze for United States federal employees, after which it was to be replaced by a long-term workforce reduction plan to be developed by the Office of Personnel Management. The order bans hiring contractors to fill positions that would otherwise be filled by employees. The hiring freeze does not affect military personnel and those deemed essential for security, but the details of implementation rules have been clarified over time with multiple sets of guidance listing exceptions.  History  The hiring freeze follows similar measures instituted by Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. In 1982, the Government Accounting Office issued a report on the impact of these freezes and found they had \\"little effect on Federal employment levels\\" and \\"disrupted agency operations, and in some cases, increased costs to the Government.\\" This was because government agencies, rather than hire more contractors, had to pay overtime to existing employees, which is more expensive. In December 2010, President Obama issued Executive Order 13561 carrying out a two-year federal employee pay freeze. Two years later, on December 27, 2012, he issued a new order, Executive Order 13635, which would end the pay freeze and give civilian federal employees a 0.5% raise in 2013. Congress then proposed legislation that would continue the pay freeze. In 2013, Federal employees endured sequestration-related furloughs as well as several unpaid days related to government shutdown. In November 2016, President Obama enacted a freeze on the hiring of Senior Executive Service positions. The size of the federal workforce ended Obama's administration essentially unchanged, increasing to 2.8 million from 2.79 million, and below the peak of 3.15 million during the Reagan administration. Prior to becoming president, Trump indicated that he would institute a hiring freeze. In late October 2016, he revealed a six-point plan for his first 100 days; the second of these six was \\"a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health)\\" In a November 14, 2016, press conference, President Barack Obama had urged Trump to reconsider his proposed freeze, noting that, since 1967, the country's population increased 136%, the private sector workforce increased 67%, and the federal workforce has increased 10%. The order was signed as one of the first executive actions of the Trump Administration in a ceremony that also included orders for the withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for reimposing the Mexico City Policy banning foreign non-governmental organizations that receive federal funding from performing or promoting abortion services. Following the signing ceremony, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed the press corps on hiring freeze and other issues. He said that the order \\"counters the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years.\\" Several articles pointed to the lack of a factual basis for this statement. The hiring freeze was lifted by Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on April 12, 2017. Scope of freeze Trump initially stated on January 23 that the hiring freeze does not affect \\"the military\\" and personnel associated with public safety. After two days of confusion, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management clarified on January 25 that the freeze would not apply to public healthcare workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but would apply to Department of Defense civilians. On January 31, OMB and OPM issued more guidance with several more exceptions to the hiring freeze. In this guidance, the freeze does not apply to agencies under the following circumstances: * Presidential appointees, regardless of Senate confirmation (includes political Senior Executive Service members) * Seasonal and other short-term employees to meet \\"traditionally recurring seasonal workloads\\" such as National Park Service rangers (must be pre- approved by OMB) * U.S. Postal Service hires * Civilians hired by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Central Intelligence Agency * Appointments in the Pathways Internship and Presidential Management Fellows programs and related conversions to permanent positions in those programs, and in conjunction with the Veterans Recruitment Act * Hirings in conjunction with 5 C.F.R. ¬ß 213.3102(r) (time limited positions in support of fellowship or professional/industry exchange programs) * Placement of federal employees with restoration rights accorded by law, such as restoration after absence with injury compensation and restoration after military duty * Job offers made prior to January 22, 2017, for which the person has a confirmed start date on or before February 22, 2017. Those people should report to work according to their designated start dates.(Job offers made prior to January 22, 2017, but which have a confirmed start date later than February 22, 2017 (or no confirmed start date), should be decided on a case-by-case basis and must go through an agency-head review.) * Career ladder promotions of current employees. * Reassignments or details of current employees within an agency or between agencies, as well as voluntary transfers of senior executives between agencies, under certain circumstances. Further, OMB guidance declared that \\"The head of any agency may exempt any positions that it deems necessary to: Meet national security (including foreign relations) responsibilities, or Meet public safety responsibilities (including essential activities to the extent that they protect life and property). Agencies may refer to longstanding guidance, which provides examples of such activities in OMB Memorandum. Agency Operations in the Absence of Appropriations.\\" Impacts and reactions The hiring freeze was criticized by Democratic members of Congress, veterans' advocates, advocates for disabled people, and others. Harry Stein, director of fiscal policy at the Center for American Progress, criticized the freeze, predicting that it \\"will have profound negative consequences throughout the country.\\" Stein and others cited a 1982 GAO report analyzing hiring freezes during the Reagan and Carter administrations, which determined that the freezes caused disruption to government services without saving funds. At a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on February 15, 2017, Comptroller General of the United States Gene L. Dodaro, the head of the Government Accountability Office, said: \\"We've looked at hiring freezes in the past by prior administrations and they haven't proven to be effective in reducing costs and they cause some problems if they're in effect for a long period of time.\\"Eric Yoder, Hiring freeze could add to government‚Äôs risk, GAO chief warns, Washington Post (February 16, 2017). Dodaro noted that the hiring freeze posed a risk to the government, particularly in areas with a \\"skill gaps\\" such as cybersecurity and acquisition workforce. Dodaro said that if reducing the size of the federal workforce was a goal, \\"a sustained hiring freeze is not the best way. It‚Äôs better to do it through a budget or workforce plan.\\" Federal employees' unions criticized the freeze and questioned the notion that there were too many federal employees, noting that there are about as many federal employees today as there were in 1962 under the John F. Kennedy administration. Impact on veterans and the military Because veterans make up one-third of all federal employees, the hiring freeze were seen as disproportionately likely to be affect veterans. The extent of the impact of the freeze on the VA was unclear, with the White House and the VA sending out conflicting signals. Many veterans had VA job interviews delayed or canceled. Paul Rieckhoff, the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that the freeze \\"sent shock waves across the entire veteran community\\" and \\"raises serious concerns about the president‚Äôs commitment to veterans and improving the VA.\\" Disabled American Veterans said that the situation was confusing. VoteVets slammed the inclusion of the VA, saying \\"If his executive order leads to preventable deaths, that will be on Donald Trump‚Äôs hands, and we will hold him personally accountable.\\" The Republican chairs of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees wrote a letter asking for clarification, while the Democratic ranking members of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees of those committees, joined by 53 other congressional Democrats, asked Trump to explicitly exclude the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from the hiring freeze. Several days after the hiring freeze was announced, following this backlash, the acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Snyder issued a memo saying that certain VA positions, such as physicians and nurses, would be exempted from the freeze. The confusion following the hiring freeze hit parent in the U.S. military. In late February 2017, the commander of the U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden, in Germany informed Army parents that all part-day childcare programs at the garrison would end on March 1 as a \\"result of staff shortages due to the Federal Hiring Freeze\\" that prevented childcare services \\"from replacing staff who depart for any reason.\\"Joe Davidson, Hiring-freeze confusion hits military parents, Washington Post (February 24, 2016). A similar memo was issued at Fort Knox in Kentucky. Subsequently, waivers were granted for Fort Knox and Garrison Wiesbaden, but the freeze still interrupted service and disrupted hiring at those sites and elsewhere.Amy Bushatz, Some Child Care Still on Hold Despite Hiring Freeze Waiver, Military.com (February 23, 2017). The hiring freeze also caused disruption in Navy shipbuilding, which Navy officials said was counterproductive.Scott Maucione, Hiring freeze cools off Navy ship buildup too, WFED (February 23, 2017). Other impacts and reactions Federal employees' organizations condemned the hiring freeze, with the National Federation of Federal Employees saying that it would \\"will cripple employment opportunities particularly for women, veterans, minorities and the disabled.\\" The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association also opposed the freeze, saying it would save no money. The National Treasury Employees Union, American Federation of Government Employees, and other unions similarly criticized the freeze. The hiring freeze caused fears among employees at federal scientific agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Science Foundation (NSF), all of which are subject to the freeze. Scientists feared that the freeze might become permanent or be a precursor to deeper budget cuts. The hiring freeze was seen as likely to worsen the delay in adjudicating Social Security Disability applications, which already has a 526-day backlog. On January 27, 2017, Budget Director Mulvaney addressed the issue briefly stating, \\"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong to be concerned about it, Senator,\\"... \\"I don‚Äôt think it automatically follows that hiring more people will create more efficiency.\\" in response to questioning from Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. In a smaller market, the hiring freeze came in the middle of the 2017 hiring season for new PhD Economists, removing approximately 10% of the jobs in the US that target people with newly granted PhDs in Economics.https://www.npr.org/2017/05/11/527990603/economists-take-cues-from- speed-dating-with-job-search-system  See also  * List of executive actions by Donald Trump References  External links  * Text of the order * Report by the Comptroller General of the United States - Report on effectiveness of hiring freezes (March 10, 1982) 2017 in American law Executive orders of Donald Trump ","title":"2017 United States federal hiring freeze"},{"id":"52966904","text":"The 1994 Glendalough state by-election was a by-election for the seat of Glendalough in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia held on 19 March 1994.

Microorganism used in the process of bioremediation can either be implanted or cultivated within the site through the application of fertilizers and other nutrients. Common polluted sites targeted by bioremediation are groundwater/aquifers and polluted soils. Aquatic ecosystems affected by oil spills have also shown improvement through the application of bioremediation. The most notable cases being the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. Two variations of bioremediation exist defined by the location where the process occurs. Ex situ bioremediation occurs at a location separate from the contaminated site and involves the translocation of the contaminated material. In situ occurs within the site of contamination In situ bioremediation can further be categorized by the metabolism occurring, aerobic and anaerobic, and by the level of human involvement. __TOC__ History The Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, Pennsylvania spurred the first commercial usage of in situ bioremediation in 1972 to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites. A patent was filed in 1974 by Richard Raymond, Reclamation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground Waters, which provided the basis for the commercialization of in situ bioremediation.  Classifications of In situ Bioremediation  Accelerated Accelerated in situ bioremediation is defined when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth through the application of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site. Within aerobic metabolism the nutrient added to the soil can be solely Oxygen. Anaerobic in situ bioremediation often requires a variety of electron donors or acceptors such as benzoate and lactate. Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation. The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed bioaugmentation and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective. Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable. =Raymond Process= The Raymond Process is a type of accelerated in situ bioremediation that was developed by Richard Raymond and involves the introduction of nutrients and electron acceptors to a contaminated site. This process is primarily used to treat polluted groundwater. In the Raymond process a loop system is created. Contaminated Groundwater from downstream of the groundwater flow is pumped to the surface and infused with nutrients and an electron donor, often oxygen. This treated water is then pumped back down below the water table upstream of where it was originally taken. This process introduces nutrients and electron donors into the site allowing for the growth of a determined microbial population. Oxygen Injection In contaminated sites where the desired microbial metabolism is aerobic the introduction of oxygen to the site can be used to increase the population of targeted microorganisms. The injection of Oxygen can occur through a variety of processes. Oxygen can be injected into the subsurface through injection wells. It can also be introduced through an injection gallery. The presence of oxygen within a site is often the limiting factor when determining the time frame and efficacy of a proposed in situ bioremediation process.  Ozone Injection  Ozone injected into the subsurface can also be a means of introducing oxygen into a contaminated site. Despite being a strong oxidizing agent and potentially having a toxic effect on subsurface microbial populations, ozone can be an efficient means of spreading oxygen throughout a site due to its high solubility. Within twenty minutes after being injected into the subsurface, fifty percent of the ozone will have decomposed to Oxygen. Ozone is commonly introduced to the soil in either a dissolved or gaseous state. Accelerated Anaerobic In situ Bioremediation Within accelerated anaerobic in situ bioremediation electron donors and acceptors are introduced into a contaminated site in order to increase the population of anaerobic microorganisms. Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) Monitored Natural Attenuation is in situ bioremediation that occurs with little to no human intervention. This process relies on the natural microbial populations sustained within the contaminated sites to over time reduce the contaminants to a desired level. During monitored natural attenuation the site is monitored in order to track the progress of the bioremediation. Monitored natural attenuation is used in sites where the source of contamination is no longer present, often after other more active types of in situ bioremediation have been conducted. Uses of In situ bioremediation Hydrocarbon Degradation Naturally occurring within the soil are microbial populations that utilize hydrocarbons as a source of energy and Carbon. Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons. These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic. The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded. Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded. Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism. Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound. Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts. Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is cometabolism. The fungus genus Phanerochaete under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme. Chlorinated Compounds =Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds= A variety of metabolic modes exist capable of degrading chlorinated aliphatic compounds. Anaerobic reduction, oxidation of the compound, and cometabolism under aerobic conditions are the three main metabolic modes utilized by microorganisms to degrade chlorinated aliphatic compounds. Organisms that can readily metabolize chlorinated aliphatic compounds are not common in the environment. One and two carbons that have little chlorination are the compounds most effectively metabolized by soil microbial populations. The degradation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds is most often performed through cometabolism. Synthesis and general structure of polychlorinated byphenyls. =Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons= Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are resistant to bioremediation and many microorganisms lack the ability to degrade the compounds. Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are most often degraded through a process of reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are primarily degraded through cometabolism. There are also some fungi that can degrade the compounds as well. Studies show an increase in PCB degradation when biphenyl is added to the site due to cometabolic affects the enzymes used to degrade biphenyl have on PCBs. Benefits Due to in situ bioremediation taking place at the site of contamination there is a lessened risk of cross contamination as opposed to ex situ bioremediation where the polluted material is transported to other sites. In situ bioremediation can also have lower costs and a higher rate of decontamination than ex situ bioremediation.

After 7 February, the clashes also included Jund al-Aqsa as a third belligerent, which had re-branded itself as Liwa al-Aqsa and was attacking the other combatants. The battles were fought in the Idlib Governorate and the western countryside of the Aleppo Governorate. Background In October 2016, major clashes erupted between Ahrar al-Sham and Jund al-Aqsa in the Idlib province. This resulted in most of Jund al-Aqsa pledging allegiance to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (JFS) on 13 October 2016. Sporadic clashes continued for the next few months. Another reason for the recent attacks by JFS were airstrikes conducted by the United States Air Force earlier in January, which killed more than 100 Jihadists belonging to the group. Fatah al-Sham accused rival opposition groups of providing targeting information to the United States. In a statement released by Fatah al-Sham, the group claimed its attacks were to \\"prevent conspiracies\\" against them. One of the rebel groups involved in the conflict, the Army of Mujahideen, is a party to the peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. Representatives from Jaysh al-Islam and the Sham Legion, along with 13 more factions are also involved. Ahrar al-Sham, on the other hand, refused to participate in Astana due to their relations with JFS. Negotiations between Syrian government and opposition representatives began on 23 January. The clashes January 2017 On 20 January 2017, the al-Nusra Front (Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS)) launched several coordinated attacks against Ahrar al- Sham headquarters and positions in the northern Idlib Governorate, near the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. In addition, al-Nusra also attacked Ahrar al-Sham outposts in Darkush and Jisr al-Shughur. On the same day, Jund al-Aqsa raided an Ahrar al-Sham prison in Jabal Zawiya and freed 13 of their prisoners. Meanwhile, in the same area, al-Nusra attacked the Mountain Hawks Brigade of the Free Idlib Army and captured a commander and his equipment. On 23 January, JFS announced that it has expelled Jund al-Aqsa from its ranks. Clashes then continued. JFS fighters, with support from the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, captured the headquarters of the Army of Mujahideen in western Aleppo. They also proceeded to attack the Levant Front in Haritan. By 24 January, the Army of Mujahideen joined Ahrar al-Sham after its defeat by JFS. Ahrar al-Sham then deployed several military convoys to the countryside of Idlib and western Aleppo in order to deter attacks by JFS. Meanwhile, the Sham Legion repelled a JFS attack against a Mujahideen Army base in rural Idlib. On 25 January, JFS militants captured the Idlib central prison from the Suqour al-Sham Brigade. By 26 January, Ahrar al-Sham and its allies had captured multiple villages in the northern part of the Jabal Zawiya region from JFS, in a region between Balyin, Kafr Naya, and Maarrat al-Nu'man. On the same day, militants loyal to JFS captured the strategic town of Halfaya from rival opposition forces. The next day, JFS forces attacked the headquarters of Jaysh al-Islam in northern Idlib. By 27 January, it was reported that JFS had lost over 35 fighters in the clashes with other rebel groups. During the clashes, it was reported that civilians gathered near settlements caught in the conflict and protested against Fatah al-Sham's attacks on rival opposition forces, and called on the conflict to end in order to save civilian lives. On 28 January, JFS and several other Jihadist groups formed Tahrir al-Sham (Levant Liberation Body). The overall mission for this new front is likely to consolidate power in northwestern Syria against rival opposition groups, most prominently Ahrar al- Sham. On 30 January, there were reports of mobilizations by Tahrir al-Sham and Ahrar ash-Sham at the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing and other nearby areas, and that the 2 groups were preparing for another round of clashes. February 2017 On 2 February, Tahrir al-Sham's former JFS forces attempted to occupy a bakery in Atarib, the largest bakery in western Aleppo, but withdrew after protests by residents. Several days later, the Uzbek Jihadist group Katibat al-Tawhid wal-Jihad pledged its allegiance to Tahrir al-Sham. On 7 February 2017, Jund al-Aqsa attacked the headquarters of Jaysh al-Nasr near the town of Murak, in northern Hama. Jund al-Aqsa then captured the town of Kafr Zita and stormed Taybat al-Imam, capturing more than 250 fighters and weapons from Jaysh al-Nasr. On 9 February, Jund al-Aqsa attacked the headquarters of Ajnad al-Sham, Saraya al-Ghuraba, Liwa al-Maghawir and several other rebel units around Kafr Zita and in other areas in the northern Hama countryside, expanding its influence and capturing weapons, supplies and vehicles. By then, Jund al-Aqsa had taken full control of 17 towns and villages overall. During the afternoon of 11 February, local civilians expelled Islamist rebels of Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Nasr from the town of Kafr Nabudah. The rebels were mobilizing in the town to prepare for an offensive in northern Hama. Protesters threw stones and attacked the rebel convoy, killing 3 and injuring 20 of the rebel fighters. On 13 February, clashes erupted between the previously-allied Tahrir al-Sham and Jund al-Aqsa in northern Hama and southern Idlib. HTS declared war on Jund al-Aqsa as a result, and the clashes resulted in the deaths of almost 70 fighters on both sides. At least 17 of those killed were Jund al-Aqsa fighters, Abu Bakr Tamanna, who led a group of suicide bombers for JFS during the rebel the attempt to break the siege of Aleppo, at the 3000 apartments, was killed by Liwa al-Aqsa. During the fighting, Kafers Jonah village was captured by Liwa al-Aqsa after its general security leader Abu Rihana was killed by Tahrir al-Sham. On 14 February, Jund al-Aqsa announced the execution of 150‚Äì200 prisoners of war, including both HTS and FSA fighters. More than 160 of those executed were FSA fighters, including more than 70 from Jaysh al-Nasr, while 43 were HTS members who were killed after a Sharia Court was stormed in Idlib's rural countryside in Moqa village by Liwa al-Aqsa. In order to secure a potential withdraw the Syrian opposition and Liwa Aqsa engaged in talks. Still, on the next day, HTS captured the village of Heish from Jund al-Aqsa, and then besieged the retreating Jund al-Aqsa forces in Khan Shaykhun and Murak. The Turkistan Islamic Party and Tahrir al-Sham surrounded Liwa Al-Aqsa in Mourak and Khan Shaykhoun. Turkistan Islamic Party and Liwa al-Aqsa negotiated an agreement. On 19 February, it was reported that 600 Jund al-Aqsa militants would be transported to the Ar-Raqqah Governorate to join ISIL, while the remaining Jund al-Aqsa forces would surrender their heavy weapons and join the Turkistan Islamic Party within 72 hours. By this point, it was reported that over 250 Free Syrian Army and Tahrir al-Sham fighters had been killed in clashes by Jund al-Aqsa. That afternoon, a convoy of Jund al-Aqsa members and their relatives tried to cross from Idlib Province into the Raqqa Governorate, across a Syrian government supply route to Aleppo, stretching from Ithriyah to Salamiyah, in order to escape the rebel infighting. However, they were ambushed by the National Defence Forces, resulting in several deaths, with rest of the militants surrendering themselves. On the same day, Tahir al-Sham stormed Jaysh al-Islam positions near the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing and captured heavy weapons. HTS also occupied several abandoned warehouses formerly belonging to the Hazzm Movement. On 22 February, the last of Liwa al- Aqsa's 2,100 militants left their final positions in Khan Skaykhun, to join ISIL in Ar-Raqqah province, after a negotiated withdrawal deal with Tahrir al- Sham and the Turkistan Islamic Party. Armored vehicles, tanks, and heavy weapons were all burned by Liwa al-Aqsa during their withdrawal. Afterward, Tahrir al-Sham declared the termination Liwa al-Aqsa, and promised to watch for any remaining cells. On 23 February, the relatives of the FSA prisoners executed by Liwa al-Aqsa accused the group of treating them worse than the Syria government ever did. Around Khan Seikhoun, mass graves were discovered following Liwa al-Aqsa's retreat. Between 22 and 23 February, two separate mass graves containing the bodies of at least 131 executed rebels were found near the town. This was in addition to the discovery of the bodies of 41 fighters the previous week. On 25 February, Ahrar al-Sham raided the Free Idlib Army's headquarters and warehouses in the village of Aqrab, Idlib. The AaS fighters occupied the area under the pretext of \\"protecting\\" the FIA from a potential HTS attack. The Free Idlib Army, however, denied that they were under attack by Ahrar al-Sham. Three days later, HTS attacked a Sham Legion headquarters in northern Idlib, and captured an arms depot. March 2017 On 2 March, according to pro-government sources, the Sham Legion split into three armed groups, while fighting erupted in town of Saraqib, after a brigade in Ahrar al-Sham defected to Tahrir al-Sham. The former Ahrar al-Sham brigade had reportedly been responsible for manufacturing and maintaining Ahrar al- Sham's weapons. On 3 March, the clashes escalated, with clashes erupting between Ahrar al-Sham and Tahrir al-Sham in the city of Salqin. On 4 March, it was reported that the Syrian Government had taken a high interest in the inter-rebel conflict, and that they were watching the clashes closely. On 6 March, Tahrir al-Sham attacked Ahrar al-Sham inside of Al-Mastoumeh and Kafr Yahmoul, to the south of Idlib, and captured several checkpoints inside of those villages, severing the main Idlib-Ariha road. On 7 March, three Tahrir al-Sham fighters died when their vehicle hit an IED in the eastern Hama province; one of the fighters was reportedly as young as 14 years old. Later that day, Tahrir al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham signed a ceasefire deal to end the fighting between them, and to create a new council to resolve their issues diplomatically instead of fighting. However, two days later, clashes broke out between Ahrar al-Sham and Tahrir al-Sham again in the Jabal Zawiya region, after Tahrir al-Sham attempted to arrest a senior Ahrar al-Sham leader in the area. US aid for Syrian rebels During the infighting, CIA military aid was frozen, due to the Islamist attacks on FSA groups in the Idlib Governorate. Salaries, training, and ammunition were halted, due to fears of falling into Islamist hands. On 10 March 2017, United States labeled the Tahrir a terrorist organization, although in the past it supported and provided military assistance to some rebel groups which are now part of this alliance, most notably Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki.US denies reports Syria rebels Nusra off terror list, Al-Araby, 16 May 2017 Aftermath After the inter-rebel clashes, HTS grew further in size and launched the 2017 Hama offensive in March 2017. On 5 April 2017, a vehicle carrying Lt. Col. Ahmed al-Saud of the 13th Division and Col. Ali al-Samahi, the chief of staff of the Free Idlib Army, came under fire from Tahrir al-Sham fighters at a checkpoint near Khan al-Subul, which was under complete control of HTS. Al-Samahi and another FSA fighter was killed in the shootout, while al-Saud was wounded and was transferred to Turkey for treatment. On 29 May, Ahrar al-Sham reportedly executed at least 6 fighters of Tahrir al-Sham after capturing them in southern Idlib province. On 4 June, 5 fighters of the Sham Legion were killed and 2 wounded after their vehicle hit a roadside bomb. From 6 to 8 June, clashes broke out between Tahrir al-Sham and Sham Legion in Maarrat al-Nu'man. The Free Idlib Army's 13th Division and the Free Police joined the fighting on 8 June. By the evening of 8 June, HTS captured both the 13th Division and the Sham Legion's headquarters in Maarat al-Nu'man and killed Col. Tayser al- Samahi, the brother of Col. Ali al-Samahi and the head of the Free Police in the town. Ahrar al-Sham reportedly deployed fighters to the town during the fighting.Al-Masdar On 9 June, Tahrir al-Sham announced the completion of their operations against the FSA and took full control of the town. Later that day, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Free Idlib Army and Tahrir al- Sham in the town and the latter ordered the 13th Division to be disbanded. From 14‚Äì23 July, clashes erupted between Ahrar al-Sham and Suqour al-Sham against Tahrir al-Sham in multiple locations in the Idlib Governorate, including Saraqib and Jabal Zawiya. These clashes resulted in HTS capturing Idlib city and most of the areas bordering Turkey.

The name \\"Koo Koo Roo\\" was an onomatopoeic reference to the crow of a rooster. After a series of expansions and ownership changes, in which Koo Koo Roo struggled for profitability throughout the 1990s, the last location in Santa Monica, California closed in 2014, which was replaced with a Fuddruckers which closed in January 2019 under the ownership of Luby's Restaurants, Inc. who still owns the Koo Koo Roo trademark. History The Badalian brothers originally ran two locations in Los Angeles, one in Koreatown, and the other on Beverly Boulevard close to the Beverly Center. The brothers opened their first restaurant in 1988 on west Sixth Street near Normandie Avenue in Los Angeles. The restaurant served skinless chicken that was marinated in vegetable juices and char-broiled over open flames and served with a fold-able Middle Eastern inspired flatbread that they called \\"Koo Koo Roo bread.\\" The only sides available were a Middle Eastern cucumber and onion salad, an eggplant salad, and a mixture of pinto and Northern beans. The only dessert initially available was frozen yogurt. Everything on the initial menu had relative low calories when compared to offerings at other chicken restaurants. On the evening of March 26, 1990, Kenneth Berg, a retired real estate broker from New York, stopped at the Beverly Blvd. location to get dinner, particularly a meal for him to take home while he watched the 62nd Academy Awards. Impressed by the quality of the food, Berg met with the Badalians and later invested $2,500,000 as a silent partner, eventually investing more and taking control of the restaurant. The following year, the company became public with its stock being traded on NASDAQ under the stock ticker KKRO. The company had 15 locations in February 1992. Two years later, the number of locations had dropped to 8. In a bid to diversify the company, Koo Koo Roo launched a coffee bar chain called Arrosto Coffee Co. and acquired a color-your-own-ceramics chain called Color Me Mine in 1996. The following year, Koo Koo Roo acquired the bankrupted 14 outlets Hamburger Hamlet chain for $11.5 million. After suffering financial problems during the previous three years, the company was acquired by Family Restaurants Inc., the owner of Chi-Chi's and El Torito Mexican restaurants, in 1998 for $143 million in stock. At the time of the announcement, Koo Koo Roo had 38 locations in California, Florida, and Nevada. Before the acquisition was completed, Koo Koo Roo sold off its Arrosto Coffee Co. and Color Me Mine chains. Immediate after Family Restaurants completed the acquisition of the Koo Koo Roo and Hamburger Hamlet chains, Family Restaurants Inc. renamed itself Koo Koo Roo Enterprises and then Prandium Inc. a few months later. Prandium was the parent company for the Koo Koo Roo, El Torito, Chi-Chi's and Hamburger Hamlet chains. By January 1999, Koo Koo Roo had 40 locations. In 2003, the Prandium subsidiaries Koo Koo Roo, Chi-Chi's, and Hamburger Hamlet, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. At the time of the filing, Koo Koo Roo had 28 locations, down from 38 in 2001. As the result of the filing, the company was acquired by Magic Brands.

Construction began in 1894 and opened in 1895, capable of housing 700 patients. In March 1941, the Australian Army accepted an offer from the New South Government, where the Kenmore Asylum would be the site for a military hospital. As a result, patients located at the asylum were moved to various mental institutions in Sydney. In 1946, the Australian Department of Health resumed control of Kenmore Asylum after the army moved out. The property was sold in 2003 and resold in 2010. It is described as one of Australia's \\"most haunted locations\\". The property was sold to Australia China International Pty Ltd in March 2015 and it is planned to restore the once derelict building as Kenmore Gardens with likely uses to include retirement living, government services, or educational facilities. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 April 2005. History Background and construction In October 1879, of land of the Kenmore Estate was purchased by the government at a cost of ¬£1,252. Frederick Norton Manning, who was recently appointed as the colony's Inspector-General of the Insane purchased the estate, making it his first major achievement in his new role. A new hospital for the site was planned, in which the first constructed wards were intended for chronic cases which have accumulated in existing hospitals from the southern districts of the New South Wales colony. Several concerns were raised about the location of the proposed hospital. Although Manning considered the site to be \\"very suitable\\", questions were raised about the water supply, and there was little outlook. Members of the Public Works Committee agreed that the Rossiville Estate was a more suitable site for a new hospital, providing that a sewerage scheme could not be obtained without polluting the Goulburn water supply. The purchase of Kenmore Estate by Manning was his first major achievement in his new role. The estimated cost of building the asylum was ¬£150,000; the cost was spread over a period of five years, and up to 650 patients could accommodate it. The first construction contracts were permitted in 1894, the major one going to John Baldwin, a builder from Sydney for ¬£12,760. Local Goulburn builder J.C. O'Brien was granted the second contract for ¬£923, where his contract involved the erection of a number of buildings in brick, as well as a few temporal wooden structures. In O'Brien's contract, it also called for the erection of a small brick \\"special ward\\" for patients who became violent or uncontrollable, although the first patients for the asylum would be chosen for their quiet and industrious nature. Violent and uncontrollable patients would be kept under lock and key. By the end of 1894, the asylum was ready to temporarily accommodate 140 patients, with several wards of the hospital yet to be complete. In January 1895, the first personnel for the asylum were officially appointed, and upon opening, 152 patients from other hospitals were transferred to Kenmore; of the 152 patients, 146 of them were male. Despite several wards being opened for operation, the asylum was anticipated for completion by June 1897 to provide services for the southern regions of New South Wales. By 1896, a considerable amount of work was made, where edifices of brick now lay upon several acres of land. The new contractors, Messrs, Parry and Farley, hoped to get through their contract by the end of the year despite it only intending to complete one third of the work. The number of patients rose up to 156 in that year. In addition, there were temporary offices and quarters for the staff, which composed of two officers, 17 attendants, a cook, a laundress and a needlewoman. Further progress was made in 1897, with most of the prominent buildings being completed and taken in possession by the staff and patients. It began assuming the appearance of a township, and ¬£70,000 was already spent on its construction between a three to four year period. A further ¬£70,000 was estimated to complete the complex. A new contract was also made, and it composed of a nurses' and attendants' home, which stand on either side of the administrative block and thus would complete the front elevation of the asylum. The remainder of the work primarily consisted of the construction of additional wards which stretched outwards towards a nearby river, forming a \\"V-shape\\" from the central quadrangle. In 1897, 150 male and 42 female patients resided at the asylum. By 1901, Kenmore Asylum had been completed, although small additions were expected in the future. 20th century Article on the suicide from The Sydney Morning Herald, 17 January 1902 Several deaths at Kenmore began to plague the complex. In 1902, Henry George Bailey, a patient who was admitted to the asylum, committed suicide by hanging himself from a window shutter, using a thick canvas rug by tearing a thick piece off of it. These rugs were specifically made to be strong because they were used on violent patients. Due to his violent and homicidal tenancies, Bailey was visited by an attendant every half-hour. At 5 o'clock, the attendant saw Bailey sleeping, but upon returning to him 25 minutes after the last visit, Bailey had committed suicide. An inquiry was held by the coroner who concluded that he did commit suicide. A year later, a second patient who was admitted to the asylum died. The coroner found that the patient died from suffocation, as a result of an epileptic fit. In 1908, a patient was attacked and killed by another resident of the asylum, who struck him on the head with a holystone. The patient, Prince Dean, had a history of hitting other patients and explained why he had struck him, saying it was \\"for fun\\". At the time of the incident, the victim, John Cubitt, was scrubbing floors with Dean. In 1909, tenders were received for the erection of two convalescent wards, one each for males and females. A new admission block and doctor's quarters was also proposed. The accepted tender involved a new admission block and a new administration block, costing ¬£10,995. The asylum suffered considerable damage in 1912, where a fire broke out at 2 o'clock in a drying room. All of the clothing in the dryers was destroyed, and furnishings of the room were burnt; in addition, the value of this loss was considerable. The cause was unknown. Years after the deaths of patients at Kenmore, many more were reported. In 1917, a patient named James Claxton hung himself from a tree, despite being noted as a quiet sociable, well behaved person who never indicated any desire to commit suicide. Two years later, in August 1919, a pneumonic influenza pandemic swept across the asylum and killed 21 more patients; of these, 19 patients were male and two were female. In 1920, Alston Paul Broome was sentenced to death for murdering his wife at the asylum.  Heritage listing  Kenmore Hospital for the Insane The Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital site is of State significance: as the first purpose-built, whole complex for mental health care in rural NSW; as the largest example of the work of W.L. Vernon (the first Government Architect); and for having been used and maintained by the one agency for the original purpose continuously (except for the brief Defence period during WWII). The Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital complex is a representation, in physical form, of the changing ideas and policies concerning the treatment of the mentally ill and handicapped people, in the State, spanning one hundred years. Within the Hospital precinct, and within the actual layout and design of the precinct buildings and landscape, these changing ideals are \\"laid out\\" one upon another like successive occupation layers of an archaeological site. The Hospital fabric also clearly evidences the Military occupancy of the site. The original 1890s Vernon complex of buildings still evidence the features that made Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital one of the most modern psychiatric institution of its day. Many of the buildings which followed the Vernon structures have significant historical associations in their own right and in their functional relationships with the original Vernon buildings. The early buildings of Kenmore, particularly the \\"core\\" Vernon buildings, represent perhaps the finest \\"corporate\\" architectural expression of the Edwardian (later Federation) Free style in Australia. The institution of Kenmore has important links with the community of the locality and region. These links were particularly strong in the early 20th century, when Kenmore was a focal point for regional sporting and cultural activities. The institution of Kenmore has played a pivotal role in the evolution and development of treatment for the mentally ill and handicapped in the State of NSW. The farm complex of Kenmore is culturally significant as a physically intact precinct created as an integral part of rehabilitation treatment for the patients of Kenmore. The sporting related functions, particularly the cricket pavilion, are significant as exemplars of the close connection of Kenmore to its community, and the use of sport as an integral part of rehabilitation treatment. The cemetery complex, and its landscape, is a significant element of the life / death cycle of the Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital. It is one of the few \\"pauper\\" cemeteries in the state. The institutionalisation of psychiatric patients is a function now less practised. A large psychiatric institution, such as Kenmore, although not unique, demonstrates a way of life and a treatment ethic now no longer practised. The layout and design of the core buildings clearly evidence the institutional beliefs and treatments of psychiatric patients in the late 19th century. The Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital, although not unique as a remnant late 19th century psychiatric hospital, is by its intactness and architectural excellence an exemplar of the structure and philosophy and physical basis of the institution. The hospital also has specific association with those Inspectors General who ran it.Freeman 1999:25 Kenmore Asylum was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital complex is a representation, in physical form, of the changing ideas and policies concerning the treatment of the mentally ill and handicapped people, in the State, spanning one hundred years. Within the Hospital precinct, and within the actual layout and design of the precinct buildings and landscape, these changing ideals are \\"laid out\\" one upon another like successive occupation layers of an archaeological site.

The original 1890s Vernon complex of buildings still evidence the features that made Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital the best planned, the best situated and the most modern psychiatric institution of its day. Many of the buildings which followed the Vernon structures have significant historical associations in their own right and in their functional relationships with the original Vernon buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The institution of Kenmore has played a pivotal role in the evolution and development of treatment for the mentally ill and handicapped in the State of NSW. The hospital has specific associations with those who created the philosophical and physical basis of the institution. The Hospital and its landscape also has specific association with those Inspector Generals who ran it. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The early buildings of Kenmore, particularly the \\"core\\" Vernon buildings, represent perhaps the finest \\"corporate\\" architectural expression of the Edwardian (later Federation) Free style in Australia. The unity of the building complex, and the quality of the design, detailing and construction is exceptional. The relationship between buildings and landscape is an important reflection of institutional landscape management over a period of one hundred years. The riverside setting on land which slopes gently towards the depression of the river provides Kenmore with an exceptional aspect that is viewed from the major transport (road and rail) to the east. This aspect has been enhanced by the Goulbourn town bypass road and ensures that the town is identified to a large extent by the Kenmore Hospital aspect. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The institution of Kenmore once had important links with the community of the locality and region. These links were particularly strong in the early 20th century, when Kenmore was a focal point for regional sporting and cultural activities. With the prohibition of \\"external\\" use of the Kenmore playing fields and the virtual \\"close down\\" of the majority of the Kenmore buildings, these links with the community (both actual and virtual) are now not much more than historical associations. However, when the Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital was in its \\"prime\\", it was a centre for sporting excellence in the region and great pride was felt by patients, staff and the Goulbourn community in the Kenmore playing fields. The Hospital is regarded today by the community, former staff and patients in both a positive and negative light. There is the positive contribution of Kenmore to the community; and the negative ethos of psychiatric institutions. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The institutionalisation of psychiatric patients is a function now less practiced. A large psychiatric institution, such as Kenmore, although not unique, demonstrates a way of life and a treatment ethic now no longer practised. The layout and design of the core buildings clearly evidence the institutional beliefs and treatments of psychiatric patients in the late 19th century. The 1990s has seen the de-institutionalisation of eth State's psychiatric care; and the gradual removal from Kenmore is a State and National phenomenon. The archive files of the Kenmore Hospital mental health activities elicit numerous requests for the provision of historical and archival data. The Archive si almost complete (extending back to Patient No. 1), and is of great historical importance. The Archives should be curated and conserved in proper condition. The services reticulation within the site is significant in its own right. The \\"oral history\\" archive retained by the past and present artisans is of cultural significance. This oral history is being lost because trades expertise is being lost to the campus, and with it the oral history record associated with the twentieth century history of the place. Kenmore has traditionally played a \\"service\\" role. With the closure of that service period, the opportunity to assess and interpret the role of the institution is now being taken. A Kenmore museum is currently being relocated to one of the historical ward buildings. The core precinct within the campus is virtually a living museum. There is an opportunity to reinterpret the whole role of psychiatric treatment in the State of Kenmore. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Whereas psychiatric hospitals were once viable and important institutions dealing with the mentally ill and handicapped, the radical changes in recent years in the treatment of mental illness has resulted in very low rates of institutionalisation and the closure of purpose-built facilities. Although part of Kenmore have been handed over for alternative uses, it is the most intact of the large psychiatric institutions (apart from the modern hospitals at Stockton and Orange), Kirkbride (Callan Park, which was the first purpose-built hospital of the type, has now been handed over to alternative uses. Kenmore is therefore the last, substantially 19th century hospital, to remain as a functioning hospital for the mentally ill. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Kenmore Psychiatric Hospital, although not unique as a remnant late 19th century psychiatric hospital, is by its intactness and architectural excellence an exemplar of the structure and philosophy of psychiatric institutions of its time.

He was the second son of the prominent businessman and diplomat Koo Chen-fu, and a member of the Lukang Koo clan, one of the five wealthiest families of Taiwan. Life and career Born in Taiwan on 28 November 1954, Leslie Koo attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, graduating with a Master of Business Administration in 1981. After the death of his elder brother Chester in late 2001, Leslie took over the management of Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC) in 2003. The company was at the time mired in 25 billion of debt because several risky investments made by Chester in the previous ten years had gone bad. Over the objection of some board members, Koo decided to invest in mainland Chinese cement businesses, which helped the company to turn around and double its revenue in thirteen years, making Taiwan Cement the world's twelfth largest cement company and the sixth biggest in China. He was credited with saving the business. Koo's net worth was estimated at US$1.2 billion. Despite his wealth, he reportedly flew economy class and ate at night markets. Koo refused to retain bodyguards, believing their presence to be a snobbish, insulting admission that the wealthy could not be seen alongside others of lower socioeconomic status. Alt URL After Li Chia-wei met Koo to discuss ideas for a plant shelter in 2006, Koo agreed to fund the project, operated by the Dr. Cecilia Koo Botanic Conservation Center, on land in Gaoshu, Pingtung provided by Leslie Koo. Bribery scandal In June 2003, Dayu Development Corporation, the Koo family's property subsidiary, was on the verge of insolvency and threatening the survival of the family business. To raise emergency funds, Leslie Koo needed to sell a parcel of land in Longtan District, Taoyuan owned by Dayu. He paid what he called a \\"commission\\" to an associate of the then first lady Wu Shu-chen, and in exchange President Chen Shui-bian arranged for the Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park to rent and then buy the parcel, which was incorporated into the Longtan Science Park. In 2008, Koo met with prosecutors investigating corruption charges against Chen Shui-bian. Chen was convicted in 2010 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, including 11 years for taking a NT$400 million bribe from Koo in the Longtan land transaction. In a subsequent interview with the media, Koo said that \\"I don't have any special feelings about the case.\\" Death On 21 January 2017, Koo fell down a flight of stairs while attending a wedding banquet at the Regent Taipei Hotel. He was sent to Mackay Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Cheng Hsin General Hospital, where he died from cerebral haemorrhage on 23 January 2017.

This is where the current full band Radiator Hospital lineup settled, also featuring guitarist/vocalist Cynthia Schemmer, bassist Jon Rybicki, and drummer Jeff Bolt. Their first official full-length, Something Wild, was released in the summer of 2013 on Salinas Records. It was recorded partially in the same lo-fi manner as earlier cassettes, but added a more studio honed production sound (provided by Swearin' guitarist/vocalist Kyle Gilbride) on the more energetic full-band songs. Their next album Torch Song, also recorded with Gilbride, was released in 2014. In 2017 Radiator Hospital released Play the Songs You Like, which had been recorded by Jeff Zeigler. Latest release Sings 'Music For Daydreaming' came out in early 2019. It was also recorded with Zeigler and is the first full length album credited to Radiator Hospital to be performed entirely by Cook-Parrott since 2011. Radiator Hospital's recorded output often features collaborations with other vocalists, such as Allison and Katie Crutchfield, Maryn Jones, and Elaiza Santos. Likewise Cook-Parrott has contributed to recordings by Waxahatchee, Japanese Breakfast and Allison Crutchfield.

He was highly tried as a juvenile and ran prominently in several major races before winning the Dewhurst on his tenth appearance of the season at odds of 33/1. As a three- year-old he won the Desmond Stakes and ended his year with a success in the Qatar Derby. He was based in Qatar for the rest of his racing career, making his last appearance in 2015. Background Beethoven is a bay horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by Whisperview Trading Ltd, a breeding company owned by the trainer Aidan O'Brien. As a yearling the colt was consigned by the Carriganog Stud to the Goffs Million sale in September 2008 and was bought for 260,000 euros by Hugo Merry Bloodstock on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of Beethoven's ownership changed from race to race; he was sometimes listed as being the property of Michael Tabor, whilst on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of Tabor, Derrick Smith and Susan Magnier. Beethoven was from the first crop of foals sired by Oratorio a top- class performer over ten furlongs who won the Eclipse Stakes and the Irish Champion Stakes in 2005. As a breeding stallion the best of his other offspring have included Military Attack, the Italian champion Biz the Nurse and the Golden Rose Stakes winner Manawanui. Beethoven was the first foal of his dam Queen Titi, a useful racemare who won the Listed Garnet Stakes at Naas Racecourse in 2005. She was bred and owned by Anne-Marie O'Brien and trained by her husband Aidan. Queen Titi is a granddaughter of Luv Luvin', an American broodmare whose other descendants have included Henrythenavigator, Magician and the Irish 2000 Guineas winner Saffron Walden. Racing career 2009: two-year-old season Beethoven began his racing career in a maiden race over six furlongs at York Racecourse in England on 14 May in which he started the 9/4 favourite but finished third of the ten runners behind No Hubris and Flying Statesman. At Naas Racecourse on 1 June he started odds-on favourite for a minor event and led for most of the way before being overtaken inside the final furlong and beaten a head into second place by the Ger Lyons-trained gelding Love Lockdown. Despite his defeats, Beethoven was then stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Chesham Stakes over seven furlongs at Royal Ascot on 20 June and started the 4/1 joint-favourite alongside his stablemate Emperor Claudius. He was in contention from the start but never looked likely to win and finished fourth, three and a quarter lengths behind the Richard Hannon Sr-trained Big Audio. In July he ran twice at the Curragh, finishing third to Walk On Bye in the Group Three Anglesey Stakes and fifth to his stablemate Alfred Nobel in the Group One Phoenix Stakes. On 6 August the colt was dropped back in class for a maiden race over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse and started the 4/7 favourite in an eleven-runner field. Ridden as in three of his five previous starts by Johnny Murtagh, he took the lead after two furlongs and stayed on in the closing stages to win by a head form Clashnacree. Beethoven ran twice at the Curragh in September, finishing third to Kingsfort when a 25/1 outsider for the Group One National Stakes and fourth (of twenty) when favourite for the Goffs Million Sprint. On 4 October he was sent to France and was Ireland's only representative in the Group One Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Starting at odds of 16/1 in a seven-runner field he was never able to challenge the leaders and finished sixth behind Siyouni. Thirteen days after his run in France Beethoven was one of fifteen colts to contest the Group One Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore he was part of a four- horse O'Brien entry which also included Steinbeck (the choice of the stable jockey Johnny Murtagh), Fencing Master and Lord High Admiral and started a 33/1 outsider. The National Stakes runner-up Chabal started favourite ahead of Steinbeck and Xtension whilst the other runners included Silver Grecian (Superlative Stakes), Dick Turpin (Richmond Stakes) and Buzzword (Prix La Rochette). Equipped with a visor for the first time Beethoven was settled behind the leaders by Moore as Pure Champion set the early pace. After briefly looking to be outpaced a quarter of a mile from the finish he was switched to the right and began to make rapid progress approaching the final furlong. In a four-way \\"blanket finish\\" he gained the advantage with 50 yards to run and prevailed by a neck, a nose and a neck from Fencing Master, Xtension and Steinbeck. Aidan O'Brien said \\"He's a very tough horse and he's been improving all the time. He's been getting better with every run even if the figures don't show that. During the week Joseph was riding him and said that there's lots there, and to put a visor on him to sharpen him up\\". On his final appearance of the year, Beethoven was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile over eight and a half furlongs on the synthetic Cushion Track at Santa Anita Park on 7 November. After racing towards the rear of the thirteen-runner field he made steady progress in the straight to finish sixth, less than three lengths behind the winner Vale of York. 2010: three-year- old season Beethoven had been expected to challenge for the 2000 Guineas but missed the race after a training setback. He did not appear as a three- year-old until June when he finished sixth of nine behind Canford Cliffs in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. In the following month he was matched against older horses for the first time in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse and finished fourth behind Canford Cliffs, Rip Van Winkle and Premio Loco. On 12 August Beethoven was dropped in class for the Group Three Desmond Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown and started the 2/1 favourite with the best of his five opponents appearing to be the (Blue Wind Stakes) winner Akdarena. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien he tracked Akdarena before taking the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and winning \\"comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from Dandy Boy. Joseph O'Brien, who was winning his first Group race, said \\"He quickened up really well when I asked and it was a good performance. He can‚Äôt have the ground fast enough, so it suited him well tonight\\". In September Beethoven stepped back up to Group One class and finished fourth to Cape Blanco in the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown and fourth in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot behind Poet's Voice. After finishing sixth to Gitano Hernando at Dundalk Racecourse he was sent to the United States to contest his second Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs on 6 November. He started a 25/1 outsider for the Breeders' Cup Mile and finished tenth of the eleven runners behind Goldikova. In December the colt was shipped to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile but made little impact as he finished unplaced behind Beauty Flash. Shortly after his race in Hong Kong Beethoven was acquired by Mohammed Kazim Al Ansari & Sons and relocated to Qatar where he was trained by Ahmed Kobeissi. On his first appearance for his new connections Beethoven contested the Qatar Derby over ten furlongs at Doha on 23 December. Ridden by Seb Sanders he took the lead two and a half furlongs from the finish, went clear of the field and held off the late challenge of the French colt Lancelot to win by a neck. 2011 - 2015: later career Beethoven continued his racing career in Qatar. On his 2011 debut in the HH Heir Apparent Trophy at Doha on 27 January he produced a strong late finish to win by half a length from Miss Starlight with Lancelot and Joshua Tree in third and fourth. He failed to win in seven subsequent starts that year and was beaten in all eleven of his races as a five-year-old in 2012. In 2013 he ran ten times, recording his only victory in a minor event at Doha in April. He was unplaced in both his starts in 2014 and in his only recorded race as an eight-year-old in 2015. Assessment In the 2009 European Thoroughbred Rankings, Beethoven was given a rating of 117, making him the eighth-best juvenile of the year, seven pounds behind the top-rated St Nicholas Abbey.

At the age of 13 years he left his home and went to St. Louis. For a while he worked as a cabin boy on a Mississippi steamboat. In 1855 he arrived in the Kansas Territory, which at that time was overshadowed by violent political confrontations known as the Bleeding Kansas. Eskridge started working in the newspaper business. He joined the newly founded Republican Party and as a supporter of the anti- slavery movement he took an active part in the political quarrel. Later he settled down in Emporia, Kansas where he worked in a store. In 1859 he became a probate judge in his new home town. After Kansas was admitted to the United States in 1861, Eskridge became a member of the Kansas House of Representatives. One year later he secured himself a seat in the State Senate. In 1868 Charles Eskridge was elected to the office of the Lieutenant Governor of Kansas. He served in this position between 11 January 1869 and 9 January 1871 when his term ended.

The webcomic makes use of an experimental zooming user interface, where each subsequent panel is nested inside of the panel that comes before it. The Right Number follows a man who discovers that one can figure out someone's character traits based on their phone number, and starts to abuse the patterns he finds to search the perfect girlfriend. The story is focused on obsession and how it is impossible to find the perfect mate. Two of its three parts were published in 2003 through the BitPass micropayment service McCloud was a consultant for at the time. The third part was never released, and when BitPass went under in 2007, McCloud released the two existing parts of The Right Number for free. Concept A tiny panel is nested inside of the current panel. Scott McCloud has been advocating the concept of the infinite canvas since he wrote about it in his 2000 book Reinventing Comics, as he believes that webcomics may revolutionize the way long-form comics are created and read. The Right Number uses Flash animation to create a seamless transition between any two panels. The webcomic is set up so that at the center of each screen-filling panel lies a very small version of the next panel. The reader can click on an arrow below the webcomic or use the navigation keys to zoom in on this tiny panel so that it in turn fills the screen. McCloud described this layout as a \\"long chain of panels, one behind the other, with a hole in the center of each of them; so the reader is successively moving in on each of the panels in order to see the next.\\" The layout of The Right Number preserves a visual link between panels or pages that traditional webcomics lack, as readers aren't taken out of the experience as they may when using a hyperlink to move to the next page. The Right Number has an advantage over infinitely-scrollable webcomics in that it preserves the rhythm of reading the comic, while scrollers may start to \\"drag on and on.\\" The time the webcomic spends zooming in on panels forces the reader to pace themselves. Synopsis The Right Number follows a man who accidentally meets up with a stranger rather than his own girlfriend after misdialing a phone call. The woman he meets looks, sounds, and acts significantly like his wife, however, and the protagonist finds that this girl is a \\"better version\\" of his girlfriend. He starts to experiment with his phone, and discovers a pattern where women with similar phone numbers have similar character traits. He then abuses this system to find the perfect girlfriend, as he starts to obsess over the smallest details. McCloud describes The Right Number as \\"a story about obsession\\" and calls this a theme he returns to often. In an interview with Joe Zabel, McCloud said that he is \\"pessimistic about the wisdom of trying to find the perfect mate,\\" which is what the protagonist of his webcomic fails to understand. Publication Scott McCloud was contacted by the founders of BitPass in November 2002, and liking their implementation of micropayments - a model McCloud had advocated for years - he became a consultant. The first part of McCloud's The Right Number was released online on June 30, 2003, to coincide with the launch of BitPass. The part could be bought worldwide for $.25 USD, and a purchase remained good for 180 days. The Right Number was to be released in three parts, each about five weeks apart. However, the third part was indefinitely delayed - initially due to tendinitis in McCloud's hands, and later because McCloud started working on Making Comics. When BitPass ceased operation in 2007, the two parts of The Right Number were released free of charge. The webcomic received attention from non-comic readers who were interested in the outcome of McCloud's micropayment system; in the four years BitPass was in place, McCloud sold just under 2,300 copies of The Right Number. Reception In 2011, David Balan of Sequart Organization praised McCloud's webcomic for successfully crafting a new reading convention, calling it far superior than existing formats. Karin L. Kross of Bookslut noted in a review of the first part of The Right Number that it is tempting to \\"[argue] over whether the use of the form and technology is sufficiently 'innovative,'\\" but that such discussions lose sight of the more important questions of whether the story is worth reading and the art is worth looking at. In the case of The Right Number, Kross answered both of these questions with \\"yes\\".

It tells the story of a young writer who hopes to make his reputation and fortune by publishing a biography of one of the greatest 20th- century painters, now blind and living in total seclusion. It was released in Germany on 17 September 2015 by X Verleih. Plot Sebastian Z√∂llner, a cocky young writer, travels to the Swiss Alps to interview Manuel Kaminski, a legend among 20th-century painters, who knew everybody in the art world but lost his sight and withdrew from all contact. Z√∂llner's idea is to have a biography ready the moment Kaminski is dead. Kaminski is looked after by a wary daughter Miriam, who insists on being at interviews, and a dim housekeeper. While the daughter is out, Z√∂llner bribes the housekeeper to leave the house and he starts exploring. In the desk he finds letters to Kaminski from friends like Matisse and Picasso, and pockets some. In the basement he finds a secret studio with huge self-portraits, two of which he rolls up and keeps. But he needs to get Kaminski on his own, so he tells the old man that his great love Therese, who the world thought dead, is in fact living in the north. Kaminski gives him the keys to his Jaguar and the two set off, but at a service station the car is stolen (and hidden in it the paintings Z√∂llner had stolen). Continuing by taxi, they stop at a shabby hotel where Kaminski, free of Miriam's control, orders a huge meal and a prostitute. Arriving at the house of the ancient Therese, all she wants to talk about is grandchildren and TV programs. She does however admit that she spoke extensively to another writer, who has a biography of Kaminski ready for publication. As the disappointed pair leave, Miriam is outside in the recovered Jaguar, into which she bundles her father. Z√∂llner asks if he can quickly say a private goodbye to the old man and, as soon as Miriam gets out, roars off with Kaminski. The old man says he'd like to go to the seaside, and the two paddle happily in the surf. Relaxing afterwards on the sand, after signing the two canvases Z√∂llner had stolen, Kaminski hints that the young man should give up his quest and leave him alone. Z√∂llner takes the hint and, after throwing his notes, tapes, and camera into the sea, disappears with the canvases over the dunes. The solitary old man on the beach slowly changes into one of his self-portraits.

Killilea was hired by the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as their head coach in 1986 and served in that capacity until he was fired in January 1988 after being called for 14 technical fouls and ejected from three games. During his early career, Killilea was head coach of the Melrose and Silver Lake high school basketball teams. He was inducted into the Massachusetts Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1976. Killilea was the first person in the Boston Celtics organization to scout Larry Bird. According to Killilea, Bird was \\"the best passing forward since Rick Barry.\\" In 1977 Don Nelson was hired as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. Nelson at first suggested his former assistant coach with the Celtics, John Killilea, for the job. When the Bucks insisted they wanted Nelson at the head coach position he brought Killilea on as his assistant. United Press International reporter Michael V. Uschan wrote an article on March 20, 1981 titled \\"Nelson matures as Bucks coach\\". It noted that, \\"Nelson depends on Killilea more than most other NBA coaches depend on their assistants\\". Before the 1983‚Äì84 season, Killilea joined the New Jersey Nets as an assistant coach under Stan Albeck. After the season a New York Post report cited several anonymous Nets players who blamed their poor performance on an ongoing feud between Killilea and assistant coach Herman Kull. Nets' owner Joe Taub and head coach Stan Albeck approached the Post reporter, Steve Baronfeld, telling him that Kull suffered a heart attack after reading the story. The Post responded by pulling their reporters from the Nets' beat.

The cathedral is in the Eritrean Catholic Archeparchy of Asmara.  Kidane Mehret  Kidane Mehret (·ä™·ã≥·äê ·àù·àï·à®·âµ) is a Ge'ez phrase meaning Covenant of Mercy. It refers to the Ethiopic tradition that Jesus promised his mother that he would forgive the sins of those who sought her intercession.The Art Institute of Chicago, \\"Miracles of Mary (Te'amire Maryam)\\"Covenant of Mercy, Ethiopia and Eritrea The feast of Our Lady of the Covenant of Mercy is celebrated on 16 Yekatit (Ethiopian calendar), corresponding at present to 24 February (Gregorian calendar)The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Faith and Order, \\"Religious Holidays and Calendar\\" except in leap years, when it corresponds to 25 February, since in the Ethiopian calendar the extra day is inserted in what for the Gregorian calendar is the preceding month of September.  History  In the centre of the capital of Italian Eritrea the Latin Church Catholics had what was known as the \\"Asmara Catholic Cathedral\\" (the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, Asmara) as their principal church, which was completed in 1923. In the northwestern corner of the city, a place of worship was granted to the Alexandrian Rite Catholic community,Edward Denison, Edward Paice, Eritrea: The Bradt Travel Guide (Bradt Travel Guides 2007 ), pp. 118‚àí119 who preceded the arrival of the Italians. In 1930, they were given their own ordinariate, independent of the Apostolic Vicariate of Eritrea. Father Kidan√®-Maryam Cass√†, who since 1926 had been their pro-vicar within the Vicariate, was appointed their ordinary and on 3 August 1930 was ordained titular bishop of Thibaris in the chapel of the Pontifical Ethiopian College in Vatican City. At that time they numbered less than 3% of the population of Eritrea.Antonio Cataldi, I missionari cattolici italiani nell'Etiopia occupata (2013), p. 125 The first building on the site was a small church constructed with the \\"monkey-head\\" technique, as used also in the ancient church of Kidane Mehret, with which this Catholic church is not to be confused:Eritrean Ministry of Education, \\"The Ancient Church of Kidane Mehret\\" \\"The supporting walls incorporate wooden beams that protrude from the exterior of the walls; they look like rows of monkey scalps.\\"Lonely Planet Ethiopia & Eritrea -Jean-Bernard Carillet, Stuart Butler, Dean Starnes - 2009 Page 339 1741048141. Father Kidane-Maryam Cassa obtained from the Italian colonial governor the initial improvement of the small church in the late 1930s. When on 31 October 1951 the Alexandrian-Rite community were given the rank of an Apostolic Exarchate and a cathedral had to be assigned to it, this building was given the rights and privileges of a cathedral but, being too small to be given that title, it was referred to as the pro-cathedral.Papal bull Aethiopica Alexandrini, Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1952, page 207] A building more worthy of being called the cathedral was completed in 1969. It is of much greater size and is noted for its strikingly large dome.  Present day  With the suppression on 21 December 1995 of the Apostolic Vicariate of Eritrea, Kidane Mehret became the only Catholic church in Asmara that has a right to the title of cathedral. However, what had been the principal church of the Apostolic Vicariate ( the \\"Church of Our Lady of the Rosary\\") is still in Asmara commonly called \\"the Cathedral\\".
