The derivation of the club's name is due to the club's origins in the part of Kensington to the west of Holland Park where the streets are named after the politician Joseph Addison. The team's colours were blue and black. On 26 January 1871, they sent representation to a meeting of twenty-one London and suburban football clubs that followed Rugby School rules (Wasps were invited by failed to attend) assembled at the Pall Mall Restaurant in Regent Street. E.C. Holmes, captain of the Richmond Club assumed the presidency. It was resolved unanimously that the formation of a Rugby Football Society was desirable and thus the Rugby Football Union was formed. A president, a secretary and treasurer, and a committee of thirteen were elected, to whom was entrusted the drawing-up of the laws of the game upon the basis of the code in use at Rugby School. Although Addison was considered prominent enough to have been invited, they did not gain any of the thirteen places on the original committee.Marshall, Francis, Football; the Rugby union game, p68, (1892) (London Paris Melbourne, Cassell and company, limited) The club originally played its football at the Red House Farm in the present Little Wormwood Scrubs.

Haydar maintained the policies and political ambitions initiated by his father. Under Sheikh Haydar, the order became crystallized as a political movement with an increasingly extremist heterodox Twelver Shi'i coloring and Haydar was viewed as a divine figure by his followers.Islam without Allah?, By Colin Turner, pg.63 Shaykh Haydar was responsible for instructing his followers to adopt the scarlet headgear of 12 gores commemorating The Twelve Imams, which led to them being designated by the Turkish term Qizilbash \\"Red Head\\".The IsmƒÅ ªƒ±ÃÑlƒ±ÃÑs, By Farhad Daftary, pg.466 Haydar soon came into conflict with the Shirvanshahs, as well as the Ak Koyunlu, who were allied to the former. Following several campaigns into the North Caucasus, mainly in Circassia and Dagestan, he and his men were eventually trapped in 1488 at Tabasaran by the combined forces of the Shirvanshah Farrukh Yassar and Ya'qub ibn Uzun Hassan of the Ak Koyunlu. In a pitched battled that ensued, Shaykh Haydar and his men were defeated and killed. He was succeeded by his son Soltan-Ali as leader of the order. Soltan- Ali was on his part succeeded by Haydar's younger son, who would become the founder of the Safavid dynasty, and known by his regnal name of Ismail I. Biography Haydar was born in June‚ÄìJuly 1459 to Shaykh Junayd and Khadija Begum bt. Qara Othman, a sister of Uzun Hasan of the Ak Koyunlu. His parents had married on the eve of Shaykh Junayd's invasion of Trabzon. Less than a year later, Haydar's father was killed in the Battle of Tabasaran. Apart from Haydar, the only sons of Junayd that had survived were Khvajeh Mohammad Safavi and Khvajeh Jamshid Safavi. Haydar's only surviving sister, Shah-Pasha Khatun, was married off to Mohammad Beg Talish, a pivotal figure in the foundation of the Safavid dynasty in the early 16th century. In 1469-70, Haydar was installed in Ardabil by his uncle Uzun Hassan, who had defeated Jahan Shah of Kara Koyunlu dynasty at the Battle of Chapakchur and established his own authority over its former domains. The Safavid order's return to Ardabil prompted an influx of Haydar‚Äôs followers from northern Syria and eastern Anatolia to Ardabil to be beside him.Islam without Allah?, By Colin Turner, pg.63 Functioning as the \\"spiritual leader\\" of the order \\"tariqa\\", Haydar would engage into various alliances with the leaders of the Talish, Shirvan and southern Dagestan regions. Subsequently, he initiated three military campaigns against various rural areas and villages in the Northern Caucasus. According to Prof. Roger Savory, meant to drill his men, these raids targeted the \\"infidels\\" of Circassia and Dagestan. These were however probably the Christian Alans (nowadays better known as Ossetians) who roamed to the north of the Darial Pass as well as the Kabardian subgroup of Circassians. In order to reach the area, Haydar had to cross areas ruled by the Shirvanshah (specifically the Shirvanshah rulers of Salyan and Mahmudabad), who were hostile as they were allied to the Ak Koyunlu ruler of Azerbaijan, Sultan Yaqub. Therefore, Haydar ordered for the production of boats in Khalkhal and Astara, in order to avoid having to go by land. By using boats, Haydar and his men would be able to circumvent the Shirvanshah's, reaching Derbent and coastal Dagestan through the Caspian Sea. In particular, the towns of Agrica and Mian-Qeslaq seem to have been the main target at the time. In around 1473-3, Haydar and his men performed their first seaborne attack on Dagestan, during which they plundered the predominantly Circassian-inhabited town of Qaytaq as well as the Hamiri plain. Haydar's first mainland campaign in Dagestan happened five years later, in 1478. However, the third and final of his campaigns in Dagestan, which took place in 1488, proved to be his last. The Shirvanshah had allowed Haydar's first two campaigns, but this time, on his way to the North Caucasus, he sacked the city of Shamakhi. In Tabasaran, outside the Bayqird Castle, Haydar and his men were cornered; in the ensuing pitched battle, on 9 July 1488, they were killed by the combined forces of the Shirvanshah ruler Farrukh Yassar and the Ak Koyunlu Sultan Ya'qub ibn Uzun Hassan. The Ak Koyunlu then ordered for the beheading of Haydar; they buried his severed head later on in Tabriz. Haydar died not far from the location where his own father Junayd had died in 1460. Haydar's son, known regnally as Ismail I, would later move his father's remains (which were thus located in both Tabriz as well as Tabasaran), and bury them inside the Safavid shrine located at Ardabil. Haydar's tomb in Ardabil became a place of pilgrimage. Family Shaykh Haydar was married on two occasions. His first wife, whom he married in 1471-1472, named Halima (otherwise known as Alamshah Begum, or Martha) was a daughter of Uzun Hasan by his wife Despina Khatun (Theodora Megale Komnene), daughter of John IV of Trebizond.Safavid Iran, By Andrew J. Newman, pg.129Don Juan of Persia - A Shi-Ah Catholic 1560-1604, By & Brothers Harper & Brothers, Harper Brothers Staff, &. Brothers Harper &. Brothers, pg.107 In 1473, he married a daughter of Shaykh Farid al-din Jafar b. Khvajeh Ali, the paternal uncle of his father. Shaykh Haydar furthermore had several Circassian and Georgian concubines. With regard to his offspring, ten sons and four daughters are known to have survived his death in 1488. By Alamshah, Soltan-Ali, Ebrahim Mirza and Ismail I were born.Voices of Islam: Voices of tradition, By Vincent J. Cornell, pg.225 From his marriage to Jafar's daughter, Sayyed Hasan was born (died ca. 1525). He would serve as an official at the Safavid shrine located in Ardabil during the reign of his half-brother and future king Ismail I. Haydar's eldest daughter, Fakhr-Jahan Khanum, was given in marriage to Bayram Beg Qaramanlu (d. 1514) a powerful tribal leader. The younger sister of Fakhr-Jahan Khanum, Malek Khanum, married Abdallah Khan Shamlu, a high-ranking Qizilbash chief, who hailed from Ardabil. The other two daughters of Haydar were given in marriage to respectively Husayn Beg Shamlu, who would later serve as the first vakil (viceregent) of the Safavid Empire, and to Shah-Ali Beg (d. after 1540), the ruler of Hazo and Sason in Anatolia.

Agni Yoga () or the Living Ethics (), or the Teaching of Life (), is a Neo-Theosophical religious doctrine transmitted by Helena Roerich and Nicholas Roerich from 1920. The term Agni Yoga means \\"Mergence with Divine Fire\\" or \\"Path to Mergence with Divine Fire\\". This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of the Roerichs and of Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the modern Theosophical movement and of the Theosophical Society. Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the synthesis of all yogas. In all the ancient Hindu scriptures, the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni‚ÄìFire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all yogas, will saturate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire baptism. The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the universe. Agni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of Asian religions to the Western world. Living Ethics has an international following and has thousands of adherents. The ideas of the Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on other esoteric movements and philosophies, among them New Age and transhumanism. Birth of the new religion=Etymology and concept= The term Agni Yoga means \\"Mergence with Divine Fire\\" or \\"Path to Mergence with Divine Fire\\". This term was introduced to the Western public by Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich. Agni () is the Vedic and Living Ethics' \\"god of fire\\", who marks immortality and is the symbol of life. Agni is one of the highest gods in the Rigveda. In Agni Yoga it is the creative fire of the universe, the root of the \\"Fire of Space\\"; and the \\"psychic energy\\", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity. In the original myth found in many Indo-European cultures Agni is a bird-like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from Heaven to Earth. In the early Vedic literature, Agni primarily connotes fire as a god, reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey. Yoga (; ) is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Yoga is a group of spiritual, mental, and physical practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. The term Yoga has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Laya Yoga and Hatha Yoga. The term RƒÅja Yoga originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is Samadhi (Sanskrit: , ), but was popularised by Swami Vivekananda as the common name for Ashtanga Yoga. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, Samadhi is the eighth and final limb identified in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Aum or O·πÉ (Devanagari: ), , is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. This word has three phonemes: a, u, and m, though it is often described as trisyllabic despite this being either archaic or the result of translation. It signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or Atman. The twelfth book of the scriptures of Agni Yoga is called \\"Aum\\". Aum, as this book says, was a synthesis of sonant strivings. Prayer and inward concentration are excellent attainments which render healthful the state of the spirit. Each one in his own way has contributed a manifestation useful to spiritual concentration, whether he sought the solution in music, in song, or in the dance; man was striving to create a particularly exalted state of mind, promoting the reception of the higher energies. Ur or Aditi (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡§ø \\"limitless\\"),From a- (privative a) and diti \\"bound\\", which is from the Proto-Indo-European root *da- \\"to bind.\\" in the Vedas and Living Ethics is the mother of the gods and all twelve zodiacal spirits from whose cosmic matrix the heavenly bodies were born. As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space and with mystic speech. She is mentioned nearly eighty times in the Rigveda: the verse \\"Daksha sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha\\" is seen by Theosophists as a reference to \\"the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine essence\\" and divine wisdom. \\"Ur is the root of the Light of Fire\\", it is stated in the holy writ of Agni Yoga. Shambhala (, ;) is the birthplace of Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, who will usher a New Age ‚Äì Satya Yuga. Shambhala is ruled by Maitreya. The Kalachakra Tantra prophesies that when all is lost, Kalki will emerge from Shambhala to vanquish the \\"Dark Forces\\" and usher a worldwide Golden Age. Shambhala is also called Shangri-La. Master Morya by Hermann Schmiechen, 1884. ¬´Hermann Schmiechen was a German painter living in London who had joined the Theosophical Society. He agreed to take part in a psychical experiment to see if images could be transferred to his mind from those who had seen the Masters...¬ª Morya is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom within modern Theosophical beliefs. He is one of the Mahatmas who inspired the founding of Theosophy and Agni Yoga. He has written and dictated the letters with the goal of elevating mankind and bringing a New Age. Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu (\\"progenitor\\") of the new root race.Besant/Leadbeater, Man: How, Whence, and Whither?. pp. 353‚Äì495. Tara Urusvati (The Light of the Morning Star) is the spiritual name of Helena Roerich (1879‚Äì1955) in Agni Yoga and Roerichism. She was a teacher and healer as well as the inspired co-author of the Agni Yoga series of books, the first English books about Living Ethics and the Roerichs' relationship with their guru. Each of the 935 paragraphs of the book \\"Supermundane\\" begins with the word \\"Urusvati\\". In the epilogue of the book \\"Agni Yoga\\" she is called the Mother of Agni Yoga. Fuyama is the spiritual name of Nicholas Roerich (1874‚Äì1947) in Agni Yoga and Roerichism. He was an internationally acclaimed artist, conservationist, archeologist, humanitarian and peacemaker. Nicolas Roerich called Urusvati \\"She Who Leads\\" in his creations. Karma (; , ) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in ancient India's Vedic civilization, the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions, particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Karma works as one of the great principles of cosmic action. When man realizes the power of karma and strives to express the best aspirations, his path is parallel with the universal energy. The universal energy attracts the creative strivings. The future and the infinite are thus being built, written in the holy scripture of Agni Yoga. Spiritual evolution is the philosophical, theological, esoteric or spiritual idea that nature and human beings and human culture evolve either extending from an established cosmological pattern (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials. The phrase \\"spiritual evolution\\" can occur in the context of \\"higher evolution\\", a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the \\"lower evolution\\" or biological evolution of physical form. The concept of spiritual evolution is also complemented by the idea of a creative impulse in human beings, known as epigenesis. Agni Yoga, in general, is a Neo- Theosophical religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena and Nicholas Roerichs from 1920. The followers of Living Ethics believe that the teaching was given to the Roerichs' family and their associates by Master Morya, the guru of Roerichs and Helena Blavatsky, one of the founders of the modern Theosophical movement and the Theosophical Society. The Teaching of Life is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the Universe. =Precursors of Agni Yoga= The Voice of the Silence presented by Helena Blavatsky to Leo Tolstoy (Yasnaya Polyana, a writer's home) Theosophy The Theosophical Society was officially formed in New York City on 17 November 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, Henry Steel Olcott, William Quan Judge, and others. It was self-described as \\"an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity\\". After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at Adyar, in Madras. Madame Blavatsky (Upasica ‚Äì this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the \\"Teachers\\" called her), the greatest occultist in the history of Western civilization, insisted that Theosophy is not a religion, although she did refer to it as the modern transmission of the \\"once universal religion\\" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement is: \\"There is no Religion higher than Truth\\". Theosophical organisations regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the \\"essential truth\\" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in Theosophists who also identify as Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus. The term Neo-Theosophy was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world. Daryl S. Paulson associates \\"Neo-Theosophy\\" with Alice Bailey. She introduced the term New Age ‚Äì Age of Aquarius. Other Neo-Theosophists include Rudolf Steiner's contemporary Peter Deunov, and Samael Aun Weor. Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley were also influencers of the leading edge of the Theosophical movement. Some examples of Neo-Theosophists today include Benjamin Creme and Victor Skumin. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of spiritual evolution, proposed a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \\"Spiritual man\\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): HS-0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS-1 Scientella spiritalis, HS-2 Aurora spiritalis, HS-3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS-4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS-5 Illuminatio spiritalis, –ùS-6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS-7 Servitus spiritalis.  Russian philosophy and Russian Cosmism  Vladimir Solovyov by Nikolai Yaroshenko, 1892 Nikolai Fyodorov by Leonid Pasternak Russian philosophy as a separate entity started its development in the 19th century, defined initially by the opposition of Westernizers, advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and Slavophiles, insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group included Nikolai Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontiev, the early founders of Eurasianism. \\"Slavophilia\\" was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the Russian Empire to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its own early history. There were also similar movements in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Serbia. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed Slavophobia, a fear of Slavic culture. The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include Vladimir Solovyev, Vasily Rozanov, Lev Shestov, Leo Tolstoy, Sergei Bulgakov, Pavel Florensky, Pitirim Sorokin. In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, religion, and Russian cosmism. Vladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity Sophia in his works, such as Three Encounters and Lectures on Godmanhood. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various iterations of the Russian Slavophiles' concept of sobornost. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the Russian symbolist art movements of his time. His teachings on Sophia, conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew Shekinah or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a heresy by Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and as unsound and unorthodox by the Patriarchate of Moscow. Tsiolkovsky, 1928 Nikolai Fyodorov was a Russian Orthodox Christian philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmist movement and a precursor of transhumanism. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of evolution, as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the \\"Common Cause\\". Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving immortality and revival is the greatest goal of science. At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by fiction writers such as Jules Verne and Herbert Wells as well as philosophical movements like Russian cosmism. In 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the Russian Empire, but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of Interplanetary Spaceflight. Tsiolkovsky wrote a book called \\"The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces\\" in which he propounded a philosophy of panpsychism. He believed humans would eventually colonize the Milky Way. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans. The ideas of the Russian philosophers and cosmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and Roerichism. For example, the Russian scientist Victor Skumin argues that the Culture of Health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society into the Solar System. Historical development 140th birth anniversary of Nicholas Roerich. Master Building in NYC, 1929 view. Information about Vedanta and Buddhism spread in Western countries in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voices in religion were arguing over fundamentalism and modernism as the only available choice, and long before Shangri-La had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the Eastern world. Theosophy proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the Great White Brotherhood. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and New Age, are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended Masters. They are referred to by Theosophists as Elder Brothers of the human race, Adepts, MahƒÅtmƒÅs, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was Helena Blavatsky, after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich, too. She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers. Knowledge will permit a free and vital approach to the great Teaching, as vitally real as is the great Matter itself. When Nicholas Roerich died, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, \\"I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment\\". The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga. =The Agni Yoga Society in the State of New York= The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incorporated in 1946 under the laws of the State of New York, and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building Master Apartments. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name‚ÄîAgni Yoga‚Äîas contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific. Unlike previous yogas, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the common good. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a \\"Living Ethics\\". Speaking about the role of personality in the spiritual evolution of mankind, Helena Roerich wrote: =Latvian Roerich Society in Riga= The Latvian Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerich family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in London, met Nicholas and Helena Roerich. In Riga they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and other theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to India, to become the secretary of Roerich. In Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by doctor-homeopath Felix Lukin. He and his son Harald Lukin conducted clinical trials and many natural medications that they received from Svetoslav Roerich of the Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati. In 1936 Richard Rudzitis officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, Helena Blavatsky's and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of Baltic Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed in the Soviet Union in 1988. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs Banner of Peace. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the USSR who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received social beneficial status in the Republic of Latvia. =Master Institute of United Arts in New York City= Nicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to beauty, knowledge, and culture. His vision is captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in New York City in 1921: Louis L. Horch and Nettie S. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the Master Apartments, designed by Harvey Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City. Roerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as George Bellows, Claude Fayette Bragdon, Norman Bel Geddes, Stark Young, Deems Taylor, Robert Edmond Jones, and Lee Simonson. Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students in accordance with the proposed curriculum. There were Felix Salmond, Ernest Bloch, and Michael Fokin. In the Institute of United Arts in New York City also taught Rockwell Kent, Claude Bragdon, George Bellows, and Norman Bel Geddes. Some contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases. Roerich's name is universally known not only as a master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. The works of the artist are an evocation to beauty, knowledge, and culture. =Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati in India= Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati in Naggar (Himachal Pradesh, India). Roerich's family moved to India in December 1923. They settled in Darjeeling, a town in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is located in the Lower Himalayan Ranges at an elevation of . From 1925 to 1928, Roerich took part in a Central Asia expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Soviet Union, Mongolia and Tibet. Sikkim was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett. She also wrote a book entitled \\"Chalice of the East\\", which was published under the pen name \\"Iskander Khanum\\". Helena Roerich's manuscript \\"Foundations of Buddhism\\" was published in 1926, at Urga, where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's teaching were interpreted. Prof. George de Roerich, director of the Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati. The subtitle beneath the first picture: George Roerich ‚Äì director of ¬´Urusvati¬ª Institute. Courtesy of N. Roerich Museum, New York. The plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley. The center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. George de Roerich was a world-renowned scientist, Orientalist, and guru. His monumental translation of the Blue Annals (), and his 11-volume \\"Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary with Sanskrit parallels\\" were published in 1934. One of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined at the center. George Roerich was the director of the Himalayan Research Institute named Urusvati for 10 years. Svetoslav Roerich. Russian postage stamp Svetoslav Roerich was in charge of the work of the Natural Sciences Department. He carried out unique researches in various fields of the natural sciences. At the basis of his scientific investigations was understanding of nature as one whole that is inalienably connected with the cosmic laws. The scope of his interests: cultural studies, comparative religious studies and philosophy, botany, mineralogy, Tibetan pharmacopoeia, chemistry and its alchemical sources. The work of the Himalayan Research Institute was based on wide international cooperation. Major scientists and cultural workers collaborated with the Institute Urusvati, including the Soviet academician Nikolai Vavilov, the biologist and biophysicist Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore, the father of Indian journalism Ramananda Chatterjee, the Indian philosopher and statesman Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the Swedish geographer and explorer Sven Hedin, and many others. The Journal of the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute (U.J.) published articles on various aspects of science and culture. The publications presented a multi-level perception of the authors who were looking for a new integration of different cultural models into the mainstream of Agni Yoga. =Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City= Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and Riverside Drive (Manhattan), which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920s. The brownstone has natural scenes from the Himalayas, where the artist spent two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with orange skies or deep blue mountains. Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich's accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more. The Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness. Information about these ideas of Roerich's is always available. The museum also provides an opportunity for young musicians to perform in front of an audience on a voluntary and free basis. The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York is the largest center of Roerich-related activity outside of Russian Federation. =International non- governmental organisation \\"International Centre of the Roerichs\\"= International Center of the Roerichs (The hall of Living Ethics) in 2014. The International Center of the Roerichs (Russian: –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æÃÅ–¥–Ω—ã–π —Ü–µÃÅ–Ω—Ç—Ä –†–µÃÅ—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–≤) is a non-governmental public association of citizens and public associations incorporated on the basis of their common interests in the cause of study, preservation, and popularization of the Roerich family heritage. The Center is an associated member of the Non-Governmental Organizations Association under the United Nations Department of Public Information. Conducting its activities, this international public organization proceeds by applying the law of the states in which its structural divisions are acting, the United Nations Charter, norms of international law and international legal acts related to the Center's sphere of activity. The Museum named after Nicholas Roerich (Russian: –ú—É–∑–µÃÅ–π –∏ÃÅ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –ù. –ö. –†–µÃÅ—Ä–∏—Ö–∞ –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æÃÅ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ü–µÃÅ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞ –†–µÃÅ—Ä–∏—Ö–æ–≤) contains the Roerichs' cultural heritage passed on to the Soviet Roerichs' Foundation (now International Center of the Roerichs) by Svetoslav Roerich in 1990. It carries in itself a new cosmic worldview. The core of Roerichism is the philosophy of cosmic reality ‚Äì Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between mankind and the cosmos, contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development. =The World Organisation of Culture of Health= Skumin at the age of 72 The World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH) ‚Äì International social movement \\"To Health via Culture'\\" (Russian: –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æÃÅ–¥–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—â–µÃÅ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –î–≤–∏–∂–µÃÅ–Ω–∏–µ ¬´–ö –ó–¥–æ—Ä–æÃÅ–≤—å—é —á–µÃÅ—Ä–µ–∑ –ö—É–ª—å—Ç—ÉÃÅ—Ä—É¬ª) was founded in the year 1994. Victor Skumin was elected to the post of the president-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the charter registered with the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. In Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book Supermundane (paragraph 525) recorded the words of Master Morya, addressed to Urusvati, It is from these positions that WOCH approaches the solution of problems related to health. As the holy scripture of Agni Yoga says, physicians can be true helpers of humanity in the ascent of the spirit. The intellect of a physician must be reinforced by his heart. The physician must be a psychologist, and he must not ignore the wondrous psychic energy. Professors Verhorubova and Lobanova from Tomsk State Pedagogical University argued (2012) that, in accordance with the concept of the culture of health, proposed by Skumin, culture ‚Äì spiritual, mental, and physical ‚Äì determines the status of human health. And health ‚Äì spiritual, mental, physical ‚Äì is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture. The World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre. The anthem of WOCH (To Health via Culture) consists of four stanzas. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word Agni. Another anthem by Skumin is termed \\"Urusvati\\". Helena Roerich is known as the Tara Urusvati in Agni Yoga and Roerichism. This anthem begins with the phrase, \\"The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace\\". Six more hymns have the names: \\"Heart\\", \\"Shambhala\\", \\"Morya\\", \\"Ur\\", \\"Agni\\", and \\"Sun\\". The Russian Orthodox Church criticises Agni Yoga as New Age: The WOCH has its own publishing house (\\"To Health via Culture\\"), which has the right to publish the books with the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). The Journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (‚Ä≥World Health Culture Organization‚Ä≥) is based in Novocheboksarsk. The journal has received the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of culture of health, holistic medicine, Roerichism, and Agni Yoga.

The beginning of the religious and philosophical book series of Agni Yoga was delivered on 24 March 1920. These records eventually became the holy scripture, consisting of a series of books with a total volume of about five thousand pages. # Transmitted from 1920 to 1923. First published in Paris in 1923. # Transmitted from May 1923 to June 1925. # # # # # # # # # # # # =Further reading=    Gallery Many works of Nicholas Roerich and Svetoslav Roerich, as artists, are thematically related to Agni Yoga. Roerich's artistic works tell about the internal needs of the individual and about the ways of their realization. Roerich's paintings are a kind of \\"Teaching of Life\\", on the spiritual development of mankind, about culture and its role in human life. They are a conversation about the eternity. German-born New Age and ambient musician Karunesh (Bruno Reuter) believes that Roerich's paintings have healing properties. The same opinion was expressed earlier by Victor Skumin.

History Concrete Central was built between 1915 and 1917 at the height of World War I. Due to its being the largest grain elevator in the world and concerns about German sabotage, Concrete Central's method of construction was top secret. The facility was utilized for grain storage until 1966. Concrete Central stretches along the Buffalo River for almost a quarter of a mile and was the largest transfer elevator in the world at the time of its completion in 1917. It is also the largest elevator ever built in the Buffalo area. When in operation, it had the capacity to handle a total of of grain. The elevator allowed crews to load and unload 20 railroad cars an hour, three marine legs along the Buffalo River side could load and unload three massive lake freighters at one time. In the news In 1976, a young boy was killed in a fall after climbing to the roof of the building. The City of Buffalo removed nearly all stairs from the multiple staircases in the structure to secure the building from a similar tragedy. On May 28, 2013, at roughly 1630 hrs the Buffalo Fire Department received multiple reports of smoke showing from the roof of the Concrete Central main elevator. Due to the location of the grain elevator and no accessible roads to the complex, the Buffalo Fire Department requested Engine 20, the Edward M. Cotter (fireboat) to respond and extinguish the flames only. It took several hours but the fire was contained to small area of the roof and put out. Buffalo Fire Arson Investigators were investigating possible arson at the complex. No damage estimate was listed, and no injuries were reported. Location The complex sits on a remote parcel, with the only land access attainable via multiple railroad bridges from the northside of the complex and one railroad service road. The complex is easily viewable from the Red Jacket Park located at the foot of Smith Street or for kayakers in the Buffalo River. This area, riddled with mostly inactive but a few operational elevators, is known as Silo City. Present day Following 1966, Concrete Central changed ownership multiple times but sat idle. Note: This includes and Accompanying four photographs In 1975 Concrete Central was abandoned as a derelict property. Machinery, furniture and metal as well as other items have been looted from the building leaving it an unsecured empty shell to this day. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Initially published in 1908 with six pieces, it was subsequently expanded to seven by the addition of the Berceuse (BV 252).Kindermann, pp. 231-234. The set of seven takes just over 40 minutes to play.Duration is based on the following recordings: Geoffrey Douglas Madge, 41:07 (Philips 420 740-2); Jeni Slotchiver, 44:05 (Centaur CRC 2438).  Sections of the work  The seven pieces are titled as follows: :1. Nach der Wendung (Recueillement) [\\"After the Turning\\" (Contemplation)] :2. All' Italia! (In modo napolitano) [\\"To Italy!\\" (In a Neapolitan Mode)] :3. Meine Seele bangt und hofft zu Dir (Choralvorspiel) [\\"My soul trembles and hopes of thee\\" (Chorale Prelude)] :4. Turandots Frauengemach (Intermezzo) [\\"Turandot's Zenana\\" (Intermezzo)] :5. Die N√§chtlichen (Walzer) [\\"The Nocturnal\\" (Waltz)] :6. Erscheinung (Notturno) [\\"Visitation\\" (Nocturne)] :7. Berceuse [\\"Lullaby\\"] Although labelled as \\"Neue Klavierst√ºcke\\" [New Piano Pieces] by the publisher Breitkopf & H√§rtel, that is not a totally accurate description, since three of the pieces are based on other, older compositions by the composer. No. 2 is based on the All' Italiana (4th movement) of the Piano Concerto (BV 247), although the music itself is not entirely from that movement. A particularly effective moment is based on a section of the second movement marked \\"in modo napolitano.\\" Nos. 4 and 5 come from the Turandot Suite (BV 248), and were later used in the opera Turandot (BV 273). A further three pieces were also used again: No. 3 became the introductory \\"Preludio corale\\" of the Fantasia contrappuntistica (BV 256), No. 6 was used for Act I part 1 of the opera Die Brautwahl (BV 258), and No. 7 was extended into the orchestral masterpiece Berceuse √©l√©giaque (BV 252a).Beaumont (1985), pp. 101-115.Sitsky, pp. 60-65.  New musical style  The Elegies mark a significant change in Busoni's compositional approach. Up to this point he had composed in the Romantic style, reaching a level of full mastery, as exemplified by the Violin Concerto (BV 243) and the Piano Concerto (BV 247). The harmonic language of the Elegies is extended, with the pedal used audaciously to blend disparate tones: unrelated triads are overlapped and juxtaposed; chords are constructed from intervals other than thirds; unusual and highly chromatic scales and runs, often differing from the surrounding harmonies, are extensively employed and varied; melodies, and solitary \\"sighs,\\" moving by whole and half steps, magnify these disorienting effects.Sitsky, p. 61. Busoni recognized the change: \\"My entire personal vision I put down at last and for the first time in the Elegies\\"Ferruccio Busoni, The Essence of Music and Other Papers, trans. Rosamond Ley. London: Rockliff (1957), p. 78, as quoted in Sitsky, p. 61. and \\"the Elegies signify a milestone in my development. Almost a transformation. Hence the title, 'nach der Wendung'.\\"Letter to Robert Freund, 7 May 1908, translated and quoted by Beaumont (1980), p. 112. Even the backward-looking pieces based on previously published works (the tarantella and neapolitan song from the Piano Concerto, and Frauengemach and Die N√§chtlichen from the Turandot Suite) have been changed to reflect his new outlook. Tonality is weakened by the use of bitonality. Introductory measures, bridge passages, and transpositions have been added which incorporate this new style.  First performance and critical reaction  With his publication of the Sketch of a New Aesthetic of MusicEnglish translation of Sketch Of A New Esthetic Of Music from 1911 at archive.org. in 1907 Busoni had become identified as one of the leaders of the musical avant-garde. With this, of course, came both new friends and opponents, many with rather strong feelings and opinions. \\"Every new composition would be avidly awaited, on the one hand by the blood-lusty opponents of the new, on the other by those eager to show themselves up-to- date.\\"Beaumont (1985), p. 101. Nevertheless, Busoni plunged ahead with a performance of all six pieces on 12 March 1909 at the Beethovensaal in Berlin. \\"Turandots Frauengemach\\" was well received, and to this day remains the most popular of the six.\\"Turandots Frauengemach\\" was selected by Raymond Lewenthal for his Encores of Great Pianists, G. Schirmer, 1975. Roberge (1991), p. 33. Otherwise, the critics reactions were generally negative, and sometimes downright hostile. August Spamuth's review in Signale f√ºr die musikalische Welt is representative: > [Busoni] conducts, composes, agitates etc. He is one of those restless > spirits who are never satisfied with what has been achieved, who can never > call a halt.... He is something of a born opposer of the Establishment and > when that for which he strives with all his power, a new aesthetic of music, > is established and recognized, Busoni will become its irreconcilable > opponent.... Busoni's six elegies were a veritable source of dismay, with > the exception of the fourth, which bears the title \\"Turandots Frauengemach.\\" > He who knew something of Busoni's strivings for a new harmonic system and of > his belief that he has already achieved new tonalities through curiously > built scales, could certainly perceive a structural logic and an > aesthetically ordered system of sound deployment in these pieces; but > novelty seekers will have found as little \\"music\\" here as the normal, na√Øve > listener ... No, no and no again, these were not the inspirations of a man > ahead of his time, these were simply calculations.... What a weird creature, > for instance, is the \\"waltz\\" entitled \\"Die N√§chtlichen.\\" I trust they aren't > \\"All-N√§chtlichen.\\"August Spumath's review in Signale f√ºr die musikalische > Welt, 18 March 1908; cited, translated and quoted by Beaumont (1985), p. > 112. Later, after more public performances, Busoni was well aware of the negative public reaction, but still clearly believed he had chosen the correct path. In a letter to Egon Petri he wrote, \\"Thank you for your kind words about the Elegies. On several occasions I have now found that they appear infinitely simpler to the reader than to the listener. In these pieces I am particularly proud of the form and clarity. For instance, the structure and proportions of the \\"Erscheinung\\" seem exemplary.\\"Letter in German to Egon Petri, dated Vienna, 2 May 1908, Beaumont (1987), pp. 87-88.

Having grown wary of his political power, Ali Mirza was captured by the Ak Koyunlu and spent several years in captivity in Fars before being released in 1493 by prince Rostam. In the ensuing period he and his men assisted the prince in defeating Baysonqor bin Yaqub. A year later however, in 1494, now perceiving the Safavid order as a threat to his own position, Rostam ordered for the execution of Ali Mirza Safavi. Realizing his inevitable fate, shortly before his death, Ali Mirza Safavi appointed his brother Ismail as his successor. Ismail, in turn, eventually came to establish the Safavid Empire, with the regnal name Ismail I (1501‚Äì1524). Biography Ali Mirza Safavi was the eldest son of Shaykh Haydar by his wife Alam-Shah Begum (Halima, Mart[h]a), daughter of Uzun Hasan by Despina Khatun (Theodora Megale Komnene). He succeeded his father as head of the Safavid order after his death at Tabasaran in Dagestan in 1488. Ali Mirza Safavi was the first head of the Safavid order to assume the title of Padeshah. According to Roger Savory (1985), this was \\"a clear indication that by this stage the Safavids were aspiring to temporal as well as spiritual authority\\". The attribution of the title of Soltan, given to Ali Mirza Safavi by later historians, is doubtful; Ali Mirza probably didn't use the title himself according to Savory. At some point, Sufi's of the Safavid order mobilized themselves at Ardabil around Ali Mirza Safavi, and instigated him \\"to avenge his father's death\\", in which the Ak Koyunlu had been involved. Dismayed by the news, the ruler of the Ak Koyunlu, Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan, ordered for the arrest of Ali Mirza Safavi and a number of his relatives, including his mother and two brothers. They were imprisoned at the fortress of Istakhr in Fars. Had it not been for the intervention of his mother, who also happened to be Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan's sister, Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan would have probably executed Ali Mirza. Ali Mirza Safavi spent more than four years incarcerated; he was eventually released in 1493 by a prince of the Ak Koyunlu named Rostam, who happened to be one of the claimants to the throne following Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan's death in 1490. Rostam wanted to use Ali Mirza Safavi and his followers (i.e. members of the Safavid order) to capture the throne. In turn, Rostam reportedly promised Ali Mirza Safavi to give him \\"the throne of Iran after his own death\\". In the ensuing period, in 1493, Ali Mirza Safavi and his men assisted Rostam in defeating the incumbent Baysonqor bin Yaqub. However, soon after, in 1494, Rostam realized that Ali Mirza Safavi and his order were an actual threat to his own position, and thus ordered for the arrest of Ali Mirza Safavi and his brothers. Ali Mirza Safavi and his brothers, accompanied by a small retinue, managed to escape from Rostam's camp and moved towards Ardabil. Rostam however was aware that the reunification of Ali Mirza Safavi and his men could mean possible danger to his own position. He thus \\"sent a force in hot pursuit\\" after the fugitives. Realizing his own inevitable fate, Ali Mirza Safavi appointed his brother Ismail as his successor, and ordered him to move ahead to reach Ardabil. Ali Mirza Safavi himself was caught by the Ak Koyunlu troops at Shamasbi near Ardabil, and killed. On the order of his mother, Alam-Shah Begum (Halima, Mart[h]a), his body was taken to Ardabil where it was buried. His brother Ismail eventually founded the Safavid Empire some years later, and became regnally known as Ismail I (1501‚Äì1524).

Career= Early career = In 1983, Naughton co-wrote a MacPaint clone, Painter's Apprentice, with Russ Nelson. =Sun Microsystems= As a Sun Microsystems engineer, Patrick Naughton had become frustrated with the state of Sun's C++ and C APIs (application programming interfaces) and tools. While considering moving to NeXT, Naughton was offered a chance to work on new technology and thus the Stealth Project was started. The Stealth Project was soon renamed to the Green Project with James Gosling and Mike Sheridan joining Naughton. Together with other engineers, they began work in a small office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California. They were attempting to develop a new technology for programming next generation smart appliances, which Sun expected to be a major new opportunity. In June and July 1994, after three days of brainstorming with John Gage, the Director of Science for Sun, James Gosling, Bill Joy, Naughton, Wayne Rosing, and Eric Schmidt, the team re-targeted the platform for the World Wide Web. They felt that with the advent of the first graphical web browser, Mosaic, the Internet was on its way to evolving into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable TV. As a prototype, Naughton wrote a small browser, WebRunner, later renamed HotJava. =After Sun= In 1994, Naughton quit Sun for Starwave (then a property of Paul Allen) to develop server Java applications for web sites. He was the author of \\"The Java Handbook\\", (, Osborne, 1995) and co-author of Java: The Complete Reference, with Herbert Schildt (, Osborne, 1996) In 1998, Walt Disney Internet Group acquired Starwave and amalgamated it with Infoseek in the Go Network company. As a result, Naughton became executive vice president of Infoseek. After his arrest in 1999, Naughton was fired from Infoseek. Sex crime arrest and conviction On Sept. 14, 1999, Naughton flew from Seattle to Los Angeles on a private Disney jet. expecting a five-foot, blonde haired 13-year-old girl to wait on the pier near the roller coaster, carrying a green backpack as instructed by Naughton. Naughton had written to her about love and sex and that he \\"wanted to get [her] alone in his hotel room and have [her] strip naked for him\\". Naughton had arranged this meeting, posing as \\"Hot Seattle\\", his online predator handle in an online chat room called \\"dad&daughtersex.;\\" The \\"girl\\" was actually an FBI agent. Two days later, he was arrested by the FBI and was charged with traveling in interstate commerce with the intent to have sex with a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß2423(b). After a trial ended in a hung jury, Naughton struck a plea agreement where he took a reduced sentence and admitted that he traveled from Seattle to Los Angeles last September with a \\"dominant purpose\\" to engage in sexual acts with \\"KrisLA\\", an online chat buddy he believed was a 13-year-old girl. He ended up serving no prison time, in exchange for working for the FBI for free for a year. =Novel defense= His line of defense was that he claimed he was persuaded to participate online in a ritualized sexual role-playing exercise, dealing with a mature woman acting as a girl.

It was founded at the end of the 11th century as a large cruciform church which, due to its original scale, has been described as a collegiate church‚Äîa reflection of the port of Shoreham's importance at the time. The former east end of that building survives to form the present church, and much 12th-century work remains. It functions as Shoreham-by-Sea's \\"town church\\" for major religious and social events, as well as serving its small town-centre parish. English Heritage has listed it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. History Old Shoreham was a mostly agricultural village on the east bank of the River Adur. Claims that it was founded near the place (Cymenshore) where √Ülle of Sussex‚Äîthe first King of the South Saxons‚Äîcame ashore in 477 have been disproved, but it had become a successful village by the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, supporting a population of 76. In the decade after this, William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber or his son Philip founded a new settlement to the south, on the estuary where the Adur flowed into the English Channel. This may have been a result of William de Braose's failure to gain control of the harbour upstream at Steyning. The settlement, named New Shoreham, was planned on a grid pattern of streets based around the High Street. Its harbour quickly became prosperous and successful: it overcame the competition from contemporary inland Sussex ports such as Arundel and Steyning, and gained royal patronage when King John's fleet was stationed there in the early 13th century. Its importance was further enhanced by its position as the closest English Channel port to London. William the Conqueror had granted the Rape of Bramber, one of the six Rapes (subdivisions) of Sussex, to the de Braose family in the 11th century. Shortly afterwards, they founded a new church to serve the new settlement. William de Braose died no later than 1096, which has been suggested as the date of founding, but the first documentary evidence was a deed dated 1103, referring to Philip de Braose's return from the First Crusade. At this time, he granted the advowson of the church to an abbey in the French town of Saumur, which held it until about 1250. This abbey had an associated priory at Sele (present-day Upper Beeding), further up the river Adur, which became the church's patron in 1250. The patronage later transferred to Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1948 to the Bishop of Chichester. Locally, the church had originally been administered from St Nicolas' Church in Old Shoreham, but it was given its own parish in the late 12th century. The two churches have been part of a united benefice, served by the same vicar, since 1897, however. The present building‚Äîa large edifice itself, bigger than the small-scale buildings of the town‚Äî is merely the surviving east section of a much more substantial church, which would have been cruciform when built by the de Braoses. Although it was never more than a parish church, it may have been planned as a priory or collegiate church, or would have become one if the Port of Shoreham and the de Braose family had retained the power and influence they had in the 12th and 13th centuries. By 1500, however, no male heirs were left and the de Braoses' estates and holdings were broken up; and erosion and changing tidal activity made the port dangerous to sail into and had washed away parts of the grid-pattern town. New Shoreham was therefore left with a church of a much larger scale than it could support‚Äîit was described by Edward Augustus Freeman as \\"a parish church absolutely without a fellow in England\\". As originally built, the church had a tower and a nave, beyond which was a chancel with an apse and east-facing rounded chapels at the east end; the outline of these can still be discerned. Later in the 12th century (probably from the 1170s onwards) everything beyond the nave was replaced with a tall, expansive quire with five bays, a quadripartite (four-celled) rib vault, aisles with their own vaulting, a triforium and a clerestory. This work took several decades and was undertaken for William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, Philip de Braose's son. Flying buttresses were added to the exterior to support the vaulted aisles soon after they were built‚Äîan early usage of this structural technique. The church had reached its greatest physical extent by about 1225, when this work was completed. Its influence was also at its highest, as it had gained administrative independence from St Nicolas' Church, the de Braoses still wielded considerable power and the Port of Shoreham was thriving: King John stationed ships there and established a prison in 1221. New Shoreham even challenged Chichester's long-established position as the county town. A vicarage was founded in 1261; it was disestablished in 1897 when the vicarages of Old and New Shoreham were combined in a united benefice. Over the following centuries, Shoreham's influence declined as its old trade routes (especially to France) were lost and the port was affected by erosion. Minor structural alterations took place, such as the construction of a porch, a rood screen and an accompanying altar, but the fabric of the church gradually disintegrated. It worsened during the 17th century, and the original (1130s) nave collapsed in storms in about 1700, reducing the length of the church by about half. The rubble was cleared in the early 18th century, although part of one of the bays survived and has been incorporated into a porch. The quire was altered to form a new nave and chancel. During the 19th century, some work was undertaken in the interior, including Arthur Loader's replacement of some original Perpendicular Gothic-style aisle windows with Norman-style equivalents in 1876. The north transept was converted into a memorial for the war dead after the Second World War. Architecture This view from the southeast shows the south transept, flying buttresses and two-stage tower with its two- and three- light openings. The church is a pale stone and cobbled flint structure with some ashlar work. Tiles manufactured in Horsham of local stone cover the roof. A less durable stone was used for interior structures; some of these (for example a door at the west end) were exposed by the collapse of the original nave, and have experienced severe weathering. The earliest surviving parts of St Mary de Haura Church are the transepts and their associated chapels, part of the tower and some of the tower arches with their large scalloped and leaved capitals; these are believed to date from 1130 at the latest, and possibly from much earlier in the 12th century. Part of one of the six bays of the original nave also remains, although it was restored in the 18th century. The tower, flanked by transepts, perches on top of the roof at the west end and was built in two stages, both in the 12th century. The lower stage, dating from about 1130, has paired two-light openings in rounded arches on each side; the upper stage has larger three-light openings in pointed arches, and was built in the 1170s. There is also a clock on each side, at the top of the upper stage. Nikolaus Pevsner called it a \\"noble composite\\" and drew comparisons with church towers in northern France. Inside, the east, north and south tower arches date from about 1130 and have scalloped capitals; the west arch may be later and is taller, and has roll-moulding and other intricate decoration. Interior: the tower arches at the west end The former quire, with its five bays and low-vaulted aisles, has become the nave and chancel. The tall, four-celled vaulting extends across this space and gives the church a spacious feel. The architectural details of this area are varied, incorporating elements of late Norman and early Gothic design. For example, the alternating octagonal and round columns in the north aisle are a typical Norman feature, whereas those in the south aisle are more in the early Gothic style. The north aisle's columns have been compared to those of the contemporary Canterbury Cathedral, although their capitals are different; and it has been described as \\"[along] with Canterbury, the most continental of English churches\\". The church today St Mary de Haura Church was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 8 May 1950. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and 119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district. The parish, which was established in the late 12th century when the church became independent from St Nicolas' Church, is small‚Äîthe extent of its land area is . It covers the ancient grid-pattern town centre and High Street area, as well as a small section of land on the west side of the River Adur. The main service of the week is the Sunday morning Eucharistic service at 10.00am. A Sunday evening service is also held every week; these include traditional Evensong and ecumenical services with Shoreham-by-Sea's other churches. Although St Nicolas' Church, inland at Old Shoreham, is older, St Mary de Haura's size and central location makes it the de facto \\"town church\\" of Shoreham-by-Sea, and it is the venue for regular events such as Remembrance Sunday and the services of Holy Week and Christmas.

He first got his huge break in the Japanese music circuit in 1984 as the guitarist and primary songwriter for the rock band, Barbee Boys, although it is reported that he has been writing music himself since at least 1975 after being highly influenced by Toshikatsu Utsumi from the legendary folk band Carol. Musical career=1980s= In 1984, Imamichi debuted as the leader and guitarist of the Japanese new wave band Barbee Boys, which he had formed in 1982. As the main songwriter, he composed most songs for the band, including hit singles such as \\"Me wo Tojite Oide yo\\" (lit. \\"Close your eyes and come here\\"), \\"Makeru Mon ka\\" (lit. \\"I Won't Give in\\"), and \\"Megitsune ON THE RUN\\" (lit. \\"Vixen On the Run\\").

In celebration of what would have been John Lennon's 50th birthday, the event was the first large-scale charity event held in Japan and sought to promote environmental awareness through music, featuring various top international artists (including Miles Davis, Natalie Cole, Lenny Kravitz, and Hall & Oates) along with a number of famous Japanese artists such as Kiyoshiro Imawano, Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, for a total of 29 performances. At the event, Imamichi performed a guitar solo rendition of \\"Come Together\\" before the audience of 50,000. The event was later broadcast on the Japanese pay-per-view station WOWOW. ‚Ä† In fact, Imamichi had translated the lyrics of \\"Come Together\\" for the booklet in the Japanese version of the 1967‚Äì1970 (The Blue Album). Later, Imamichi and Konta recorded an electronical version of the song for the Love Dynamights STEREO SOLID SONIC Vol. 2 album. (See discography below.)

His mother had been a soprano singer and taught at a music university, but his parents divorced while he was still a young child. Consequently, Imamichi was raised by his father.Interview with Yoshida Gou, \\"Bando Raifu\\" (lit., \\"Band Life\\"), recorded by Mediax Co., Ltd. Imamichi (who often goes by the nickname Imasa) married the head stylist for the Barbee Boys on March 3, 1991 at precisely 3:33 a.m. (The year 1991 corresponds to the Japanese calendar scheme as Heisei 3, thus making his marriage on 3/3/3 at 3:33.) The couple had a child, but later divorced. In 2001, Imamichi remarried when he entered a civil marriage with former musical collaborator, Kei-Tee, after a period of cohabitation. The two did not have children and divorced in January 2007, at least in part due to a poor relationship between Imamichi and Kei-Tee's father, Japanese publisher and film producer, Haruki Kadokawa. Career as a guitarist Imamichi is noted for his spatial-sounding backup guitar work, which closely resembles Andy Summers. Although there were five members in Barbee Boys, when you exclude the saxophonist, Konta, the band basically consisted of only three main instruments: drums, bass and guitar. Nevertheless, Imamichi's unique arpeggio technique, coupled with the clear sound he produced using a compressor and spatial effects pedals (i.e., echo and delay), produced the distinct depth of sound that became a hallmark of the band's performance. Superficially, there does not seem to be much technique involved with Imamichi's style, but producing such a sound is actually quite difficult. Backup and collaboration work Since his time with Barbee Boys, Imamichi has composed songs with artists such as Kaori Kawamura, and has recorded as a guitarist with Psy-S, Misato Watanabe, Motoharu Sano, and Y≈çsui Inoue, among others. =As recording guitarist (including)= * Y≈çsui Inoue * Kaori Kawamura * Kenji Sawada * Ringo Shiina * Kazuo Zaitsu * Kazuyuki Sekiguchi * Akina Nakamori * Yukari Morikawa * Chris Mosdell =As a live guitarist (including)= * Kumiko Yamashita * Gurf Morlix =As a songwriter (including)= * Ky≈çko Koizumi * Kenji Sawada * Seiko Matsuda * Barbee Boys Discography (solo)=Albums= * STEREO SOLID SONIC Ôºàas Love Dynamights„ÄÅreleased Dec. 22, 1993Ôºâ * STEREO SOLID SONIC Vol.2 ~The Ultra Sound Track Ôºàas Love Dynamights„ÄÅreleased Dec. 19, 1994Ôºâ * ÊÑõ„ÅØÊ•µÂ¨¢ Ôºàas Kei-Tee+LOVE DYNAMIGHTS„ÄÅreleased Nov. 23, 1994Ôºâ * PINK&BLUE; Ôºàas Kei-Tee„Å®„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åø„Å°„Å®„ÇÇ„Åü„Åã„Å®love LOVE DYNAMIGHTS„ÄÅreleased 1996Ôºâ * SLOW RIDE Ôºàas Tomotaka Imamichi„ÄÅreleased Apr. 7, 2004Ôºâ =Singles= * WILD„É´„Éì„Ç£ Ôºàas Kei-Tee+LOVE DYNAMIGHTS„ÄÅreleased Oct. 21, 1994Ôºâ TV appearances * Morita Kazuyoshi's Hour, Waratte Iitomo: \\"Telephone Shocking\\" (Aug. 2, 1990) :Imamichi's physical appearance is marked by his large lower jaw, and during the interview he brought up the subject saying that, \\"From a medical point of view, such a bone structure is quite rare.\\" He jokingly commented, \\"I love shishamo, and eating shishamo all day your bones will grow all too well and you end up with a chin like this.\\" FootnotesExternal links * Artist's homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20090803001423/http://homepage3.nifty.com/chordstroke/ * Barbee Boys (Japanese): http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/barbeeboys/ 1959 births Japanese male musicians Living people Musicians from Tokyo ","title":"Tomotaka Imamichi"},{"id":"23834702","title":"Arturo Beristain"},{"id":"23834723","text":"Talism√°n may refer to: * Talism√°n (ship), a Peruvian Navy ship * The ring name of professional wrestler Arturo Beristain * Talism√°n, Chiapas * Talism√°n (singer), a Mexican singer * Talism√°n (musical composition by Juan Mar√≠a Solare), a musical composition by Juan Mar√≠a Solare ","title":"Talism√°n"},{"id":"23834749","text":"Thomas Indian School, also known as the Thomas Asylum of Orphan and Destitute Indian Children, is a historic school and national historic district located near Irving at the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in Erie County, New York.

The depot is approximately from London Fenchurch Street station, and just west of the River Roding. History The depot was formerly the site of London Underground District line's Little Ilford depot from 1905 to 1958, when it was replaced by Upminster Depot.London Transport's Upminster Depot Completed The Railway Magazine issue 703 November 1959 page 752 Layout It lies between the Down Main (towards Barking and Shoeburyness) and Up Main (towards East Ham and London Fenchurch Street) railway lines between the two stations (East Ham and Barking). It is the main maintenance depot for the Essex Thameside franchise and is currently operated by c2c, working with Bombardier Transportation service technicians to maintain its fleet of 74 Class 357 and six Class 387Electrostars. It has an 11 road shed, 8 road sidings, and 27 sets of points. Number 1 - 8 and 10 roads in the shed can hold 12 coaches, whereas 9 & 11 roads can hold 8 coaches. In the 4 balloon roads, 17 road can hold 8 coaches, and 18 - 20 roads can hold 12 coaches. In the yard, 12 & 13 roads can hold 8 coaches, whereas 15 & 16 roads can hold 12 coaches. The carriage wash road (outside the shed's inlet and exit toads) can hold 24 coaches, and is 6.35 miles from London Fenchurch Street. The short 14 road is no longer in use. There is also an office and a traincrew depot on site, as well as the West End Shunters' Hut next to the Shed Exit Road, and an East End Shunters' Hut next to the east end set of points of the balloon roads. Maintenance East Ham Depot won the Golden Spanner Award for Maintenance Team of the Year (Rolling Stock) at the Annual National Rail Awards in 2005 and 2006. This led to FM Rail choosing it as a base to clean and maintain its Mark 2 Blue Pullman train for a 12-month trial with an option to extend its stay indefinitely. Another factor leading to FM Rail's choice of East Ham over depots which would have been more convenient pathing wise such as Hornsey TMD or Ilford Depot may have been that East Ham had spare capacity and was therefore probably cheaper. When FM Rail was placed in administration in December 2006, it owed c2c about ¬£40,000 and the Blue Pullman train and associated locomotives were bought by Cotswold Rail on 1 February 2007, who continued the maintenance contract with c2c at East Ham. Class 86 electric locomotive 86212 was based at the depot to pre-heat the Mark 2 coaches of the Blue Pullman rake.FM rail uses 86 as pre- heater at East Ham Rail issue 533 15 February 2006 page 51 From 1996 to 2000, Class 317/1 units hired by LTS Rail from its sister Prism Rail franchise WAGN were maintained at East Ham Depot. London Overground Class 172 Turbostar and Class 378 Capitalstar units have on occasions been stabled in the sidings of East Ham Depot. Accident In December 2006, two Class 357 units, 357 002 and 357 043, were involved in a minor incident at East Ham Depot when one unit scraped down the side of the other. The damaged units, formed mostly of 357 002 with the driving car of 357 043, were used to form a hybrid unit which was renumbered 357 098 under the TOPS system and sent to Crewe Electric TMD for repairs.

A great- grandson of a blacksmith, parish pastor August Amsberg (1747‚Äì1820) started calling himself \\"von Amsberg\\" in 1795 and the family's right to use this name was confirmed by the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1891. By this permission to use a noble privilege, the family effectively became part of the untitled lower nobility of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The present King of the Netherlands, Willem-Alexander is an agnatic member of this family. Members of the family live in the Netherlands and in Northern Germany. Its most notable member is the family's current head (i.e. senior male line descendant), King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. King Willem-Alexander, his brothers and his brothers children hold the title \\"Jonkheer (or female Jonkvrouw) van Amsberg,\\" and have the surname \\"van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg.\\" History The line traces back to one J√ºrgen Amtsberg (d. 1686), master blacksmith in the village of Schwichtenberg near Borrentin, then part of Swedish Pomerania. His great‚Äìgrandson Johann David Theodor August Amsberg (1747‚Äì1820), Protestant pastor at the parish church of Kavelstorf near Rostock in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, from about 1795 styled himself von Amsberg without objection. The Amsbergs had been commoners at first, and the preposition probably was used to signify the family from the name of their ancestors, rather than from the name of a place they originated from. A notable member was his son Philipp August von Amsberg (1788‚Äì1871), who initiated the establishment of the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway inaugurated in 1838. The family received the official approval to hold the noble title by decree of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1891. On 10 March 1966 Claus von Amsberg married the heir presumptive to the Dutch throne, Princess Beatrix of Orange-Nassau, Princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld, and from 1980 until his death in 2002 was prince consort of the Queen of the Netherlands. He is the father of Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands and Jonkheer van Amsberg. Willem-Alexander's younger brother Prince Friso van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg, due to his marriage with Mabel Martine Wisse Smit, lost his status as a Prince of the Netherlands but retained for himself royal status as prince of Orange-Nassau and for his children received the title of count/countess of Orange-Nassau. The marriage of the third-born son Prince Constantijn so far has produced the only male heir of the main Amsberg line, Claus-Casimir van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg born in 2004. In 2001 it was established by Decree that children born in the marriage of Prince Constantijn will hold the hereditary noble title and honorific Count (Countess) van Oranje-Nassau, Jonkheer (Jonkvrouw) van Amsberg and have the surname Van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg. In 2004 the same regulation was established for Prince Friso and the children born in his marriage. When Willem-Alexander became king in 2013 the House of Amsberg became the ruling House of the Netherlands. It is, however, likely to lose that status, since Willem- Alexander has only daughters, and membership of the Amsberg noble family descends via the agnatic line whereas the Dutch monarchy follows absolute primogeniture. Several members of the family, mainly descendants of Philipp August von Amsberg and of Prince Claus' great‚Äìuncle General Joachim von Amsberg (1869‚Äì1945), still live in Northern Germany. The Dutch branch of the family, i.e. Prince Claus, the former Claus von Amsberg, has some distant Dutch/Flemish ancestors who left the Low Countries during Spanish rule, such as the Berenberg merchant family and other prominent families of Antwerp. Other notable family members include colonel Joachim von Amsberg, general Joachim von Amsberg and banker Joachim von Amsberg. Heads of the family This is a list of the heads, i.e. the senior male line members, of the Amsberg family, as well the patrilineal line of the current Dutch royal family. Before the 1891 ennoblement, being the senior male descendant didn't have any legal relevance, and such the term \\"head\\" is anachronistic before the family's rise as a noble and eventually royal family. The headship of the family since its recognition as noble in 1891 has some historical legal relevance prior to the formal abolition of the nobility's privileges in 1918. #J√ºrgen Amtsberg, ca. 1640-1686, master blacksmith #J√ºrgen Amtsberg, 1680-1756, master baker #Georg Amtsberg, 1717-1772 #Johann David Theodor August Amsberg, who started calling himself \\"von Amsberg\\" from 1795, 1747-1820, pastor in Kavelstorf #Joachim Karl Theodor von Amsberg, 1777-1842 #Gabriel Ludwig Johann von Amsberg, 1822-1899, received permission from the Grand Duke to use the particle \\"von\\" in 1891, effectively an ennoblement #Wilhelm von Amsberg, 1856-1929 #Claus Felix von Amsberg, 1890-1953 #Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg, n√© Klaus von Amsberg, 1926-2002, a former diplomat of Germany #King Willem- Alexander of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg, b. 1967. =Line of succession to the headship of the Amsberg family= Since German aristocracy practice agnatic primogeniture, the heir presumptive to the headship, and the ones next in line, are #Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg, Willem-Alexander's younger brother #Count Claus-Casimir of Orange- Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg, Constantijn's son #Dirk von Amsberg (b. 1961), a grandson of General Joachim von Amsberg #Paul von Amsberg (b. 2002), Dirk's son  Literature  * Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Adelslexikon Band I, Band 53 der Gesamtreihe, C.

It was authorised by Parliament in 1856, but serious difficulties were encountered in raising the money to build it. It opened in 1868 by which time the principal colliery intended to be served had ceased operation. It was unable to finance the construction of the dock at Brimspill and relied on transfer of traffic to the main line of the South Wales Railway (later the Great Western Railway). It was a broad gauge line, and it was worked from the outset by the Great Western Railway. It was converted to standard gauge in 1872. The limited traffic potential resulted in a continuing inability to pay routine outgoings, and it was leased to the Great Western Railway in 1885. About 1921 the last colliery on the line ceased operation and the line was shortened back to Blakeney, where there was a goods depot. That business too ended in 1949, and there was no more commercial use of the line. Background For centuries, the Forest of Dean has been an important site of mineral extraction: coal and iron ore, and also stone. Free Miners had certain exclusive rights to minerals, but the restriction on outside involvement had prevented the introduction of capital and large scale industrial processes. Moreover the extremely poor road network in the area, due in part to the very hilly terrain, added cost to the products of the Forest. The Crown interest in timber had resulted in statutory control of development. The small scale mining operations needed to get their output to market, generally by river transport on the Severn or the Wye, and a number of tramways, generally plateways, had been constructed. This culminated in the construction of the Severn and Wye Railway and the Forest of Dean Railway.H W Paar, The Great Western Railway in Dean: A History of the Railways of the Forest of Dean : Part Two, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, second edition 1971, Early proposals The Forest of Dean Central Railway in 1872By 1830, tramroads were well established in the Forest of Dean for conveying the mineral products of the Forest to market. A coal mine was being developed at Foxes Bridge, about a mile east of Speech House, and the promoter Edward Protheroe proposed a \\"Steam Carriage Road\\", that is, a steam tramway to convey the output via Howbeach Slade to the Severn at Purton Pill, near the site of the later Severn Railway Bridge; it was to be about eight miles in extent. The scheme was presented in Parliament in 1832 and some construction took place, but the line was never finished. A considerable number of proposals were put forward in the following years to construct a tramroad or railway from the area to the River Severn, but all failed to materialise. In 1840 Edward Protheroe agitated to persuade the Severn and Wye Railway to construct a steam railway from Lydney up to Foxes Bridge, but the S&WR; were not interested. In 1849 a similar line was proposed from Brimspill on the Severn to Howbeach Slade and Foxes Bridge; this did not go ahead, and a further scheme was put forward in 1850. This too failed.Humphrey Household, Gloucestershire Railways in the Twenties, Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, Gloucester, 1984, The Commissioners of Woods were strongly in favour of these proposals, because they would promote improved railway facilities in the Forest. The Commissioners reported in 1852 that the existing railways were unsatisfactory and antiquated, and that the opening of the South Wales Railway and the conversion of the Severn and Wye Railway to an edge railway heralded a new era. The Forest of Dean Railway was mentioned, as was the necessity for a new railway to serve the central part of the Forest.John Marshall, The Forest of Dean Central Railway, Railway Magazine, June 1958 The Forest of Dean Central Railway authorised Heartened by the support of the Commissioners, promoters put forward a Bill in Parliament for the line; they included William Racster Wagstaff, Timothy Bennett and James Teague. The gauge was to be the same as that of the South Wales Railway, at that time broad gauge. Passenger traffic was provided for, though no such service was ever operated. However a toll of 2d per mile was stipulated for persons riding in road carriages conveyed on trucks. The Commissioners of Woods were authorised to subscribe ¬£20,000 in instalments at 5 per cent interest. The company was entitled to borrow ¬£21,660 on mortgage and the GWR advanced ¬£15,000. The Forest of Dean Central Railway Act received the Royal Assent on 11 July 1856. It was to run from Foxes Bridge Colliery to Brimspill, serving Howbeach Colliery on the way, with a branch line from New Fancy Colliery. The capital authorised was ¬£65,000 in ¬£10 shares.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Brimspill is a tidal creek near Poulton Court on modern maps. Much of the land was leased from the Crown at a rent of ¬£100 a year, and the company was required to fence it throughout. It was decided that the sections from the South Wales Railway to New Fancy Colliery, and from Moseley Green to Foxes Bridge with the branch at Brimspill, should be built in two successive years. Plans were already being made for extending the line, and on 29 November 1856 an application was published for the Forest of Dean Central, Lydbrook & Hereford, Ross & Gloucester Junction Railway. This would extend the Forest of Dean Central Railway to the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway line near Mitcheldean Road station, with a later extension to Ledbury. This was presented to Parliament in the 1857 session, but in fact no powers for the work were obtained. (In the 1870s a line was built on part of the intended route by the Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Junction Railway.) The engineer Richard B Grantham considered various forms of permanent way and he recommended 100 lb per yard Barlow rail with cross sleepers at the joints, at a cost of ¬£1,960 per mile. This system had proved fairly satisfactory on other lightly used lines, although gauge retention problems were beginning to be apparent. The report of the first half-yearly meeting, on 28 February 1857, was optimistic. It was intended to complete the line to New Fancy Colliery Junction in Moseley Green by Christmas 1858, serving Howbeach Engine, Blackpool Engine and other collieries which were expected to be in a position to supply a large quantity of coal to the railway. The New Fancy Colliery was said to be in a forward state and would, when opened, afford large traffic. Grantham had received two tenders for construction of the line, one for ¬£43,260 and the other for ¬£47,500, excluding rails and sleepers. E W Morris, the contractor offering the higher estimate, secured the contract. By November 1857 the harbour at Brimspill had been designed: the dock was to be about 176 yards by 154 yards and 22 feet deep at spring tides. Entry would be by a lock about 88 yards long. In 1859 the confidence of the directors was such that they declared that \\"Since the line was projected, large coalfields have been got into working order, and consequently the expectations formed with regard to traffic has been so far realised.\\" The coalfields referred to are difficult to identify, and at the time of this assertion the Company's bank balance stood at ¬£3.Rex Christiansen, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 13: Thames and Severn, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1981, Raising the money The raising of capital was slow, and after a brisk start, the financial position steadily deteriorated. Land was unobtainable for lack of finance, and progress slowed up. To save expense the company moved its office from London to Blakeney, and at the meeting there on 15 August 1858 it was reported that work had been suspended because many shareholders had not paid up their calls. In the following February the directors were able to obtain sufficient credit to permit Morris to resume work. During the session of 1860 the company applied for an extension of time until June 1862, which they received, together with powers for the South Wales Railway to work the line when opened, and to make enhanced siding provision at Awre, where there was to be a junction with the SWR main line. The success of the South Wales Railway showed that onward transport of the mineral output from collieries on the FODCR might be by rail in preference to river movement.It is not clear from the sources whether a junction with the South Wales Railway was planned from the outset, or whether only river transport from Brimspill was intended at first. The report of 21 February 1860 stated that the first instalment of the loan from the Crown‚Äî¬£3,333 6s 8d‚Äîhad been received and that the engineer's report was encouraging. The contractor had been delayed in building the embankment at Nibley by difficulties over possession of land, but a bridge over a mill stream was almost completed, and this would enable him to go ahead with the embankment. Bad weather had also held up work, but the company now owned the land down to the Severn, and the building of the bridge over the South Wales main line could proceed. Of the portion from Awre to Moseley Green, nearly 3 miles had been executed to formation level, as well as a small portion of the Brimspill branch. On 24 August 1860 the directors complained of large arrears on share calls, but the contract for rails and sleepers had been let and they declared that they anticipated an early opening. They had been \\"induced by the engineer\\" to substitute iron girders for timber in the bridges, and this would involve an additional ¬£1,000. The formation of the Brimspill branch was completed from the South Wales line to the Severn and the bridge over the main line was in course of construction. The heaviest works were the Blakeney embankment and Gilbert‚Äôs Hill rock cutting. Parliamentary powers to construct the dock at Brimspill, and further sidings at Awre Junction were secured by an Act of 1861. By December 1861 the Directors were impatiently suggesting opening as much of the line as was ready, working it with horses, and changing to locomotives as soon as traffic warranted. On 4 February 1862 the engineer reported that the whole of the formation was completed, with the exception of the self-acting incline at the staith at Brimspill. In June 1862 the contractor Morris stopped work altogether, as the financial difficulty of the company had resulted in him not being paid. The Directors implied that this was his fault: \\"The position taken by Mr Morris renders it necessary to postpone the financial arrangements which would enable the directors to complete and open the railway without delay\\". Work had not even started on constructing the Brimspill dock, so it was obvious that if the line were to be opened early, the only outlet for the traffic would be the South Wales line. W G Owen, the engineer of the South Wales Railway, was asked to advise on the most economical junction arrangements for a limited mineral traffic, with accommodation for 20 to 30 wagons and strong enough for heavy engines. He estimated the cost at ¬£5,603, and advised the company to arrange for the SWR to work the traffic to begin with. Meanwhile the trouble with Morris continued, the work was held up, and in 1863 he claimed ¬£37,678 from the company. He was awarded ¬£10,098 by an arbitrator and in April took legal action to obtain payment, but without success. Two years later he stated that he had received nothing since March 1861, and was owed about ¬£40,000, adding that he had paid over ¬£17,000 for his original shares.It was common at the time for undercapitalised companies to require contractors to accept part payment in shares. Paar comments that the company appears to have ruined Morris for, ten years later, he was reduced to a pathetic state of poverty, with little hope of ever recovering what was due to him. Desperation to open the line In June 1863 an engineer, Charles Bartholomew, was asked to go over the line and advise on what should be done to make possible an early opening. He reported that ¬£7,308 would be required, and he was critical of the engineering of the construction work already carried out. He observed that three difficult and deep cuttings could easily have been avoided altogether, as each is quite close to the end of a spur round which the line could have been carried. Further trouble arose when the Office of Woods threatened to resume possession of the Crown leases because rents were in arrears and fences had not been kept up.A condition of the Crown lease was that the affected land should be fenced immediately; the Commissioners of Woods attached great importance to this. However the FODCR was reluctant to spend its scarce cash on fencing wooded land remote from any habitation. In fact the Commissioners of Woods carried the fencing out itself, and sent the bill to the FODCR; this may not have been paid for some time. The financial situation of the Company was extremely difficult and there was no prospect of it improving. There was only one way out: at a special general meeting on 27 February 1865 an agreement was approved with the Great Western Railway (with which the South Wales Railway had amalgamated in 1863), whereby the GWR should lease and work the line for 50 per cent of gross income. Any excess expenditure during the first three years would be made good to the GWR. The contractor Morris was to complete the railway within two months, for which payment was to be made to him by the GWR. This agreement was signed on 21 June 1866. In February 1867 Owen reported that the bad winter had delayed work, but that the line would be completed in a month's time. After yet more delays the railway was ready at the end of June, when the GWR ran an engine on a trial trip throughout. The railway seems not to have been ready for immediate opening, however. Only two months later the County Sheriff seized the line under a writ at the suit of the Crown for a debt of ¬£1,339, and posted two men to prevent traffic from being worked. In February 1868 the GWR, having been unable to get this embargo removed, refused to work the line. As the railway was still unfinished‚Äîno further work had been done on the Brimspill branch and the line ended at the junction for New Fancy colliery‚Äîa further agreement was signed on 8 April under which the GWR was to complete the line. Opening at last At length the GWR, having been indemnified against any legal action that might arise if they worked the railway, opened it for goods traffic on Monday 25 May 1868.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 After the opening, a train ran on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, leaving Awre at 11:10 and arriving at Howbeach at 11:35. Blakeney did not appear in the timetable until January 1870. The service terminated at Howbeach because the branch to New Fancy, although licensed by the Crown on 6 April 1868 to the Park End Coal Company, was not ready until early in 1869. The section northward from New Fancy Junction to Foxes Bridge was never completed. At the lower end, the final approach to Brimspill, east of the South Wales Railway was constructed but also never completed. (A short length of track appears to have been laid on it but not connected to the operational line.).Ordnance Survey 25 inch Plan, first edition, sheet XL 9, surveyed 1878, published 1881, reprinted edition 1891 The only signal on the line, apart from that protecting the junction at Awre, was an old disc and crossbar at Howbeach on the south side of the line just within the rock cutting. This type of signal was not made after November 1869, so this must have been one of the last to be installed. It was still there in 1901 but had gone by 1921. The Mineral Loop of the Severn and Wye Railway Meanwhile the New Fancy branch was in danger of competition from the Severn and Wye Railway, which was applying for powers to construct a new route to be called the Mineral Loop. This was to intersect the New Fancy branch and would be likely to abstract business, because of the superior shipping facilities at Lydney dock. The FODCR put up a spirited opposition to the S&WR; proposal in Parliament but the S&WR; obtained its Act on 16 July 1869. Its Mineral Loop was opened fully in April 1872. There was some difficulty over the intersection crossing with the New Fancy branch, as the latter was on a sharp curve with heavy superelevation and a steep gradient, and there was a slight level difference. Nonetheless the S&WR; and the FODCR reached a technical compromise. Gauge conversion The Great Western Railway, as successor to the South Wales Railway, converted its main line and branches in the area to standard gauge between 11 May and 13 May 1872. The FODCR line was converted by the GWR at the same time, at the expense of the FODCR. The Barlow rails were removed and a better standard of permanent way was installed. Poor business The commercial position of the FODCR was extremely poor; the fears that the Severn and Wye Railway's Mineral Loop would take away most of the New Fancy traffic proved correct. In connection with a possible extension of the line in 1879, it was stated by the Deputy Chairman that the Central line had not been in use since August 1875, as no collieries were working. The line was formally disused beyond Howbeach after 1877. The desperate financial situation of the company was illustrated by solicitor‚Äôs letter of 1877 which read, \\"I regret to say that the company does not possess sufficient funds to pay even the small expense of printing accounts, and none are therefore published\\". On 31 December 1884 the company owed the GWR ¬£22,746 17s 10d, and the GWR even paid the rents due on leases. In 1885 negotiations for a renewal of the agreement ended with a letter from the FODCR secretary to the GWR, in effect begging the GWR to pay the Crown rent in order to keep the line available for future traffic. The Ordnance Survey of 1901 showed that the track had been removed beyond the north-east corner of Brandrick‚Äôs Green, and the stretch from Howbeach Colliery to Brandrick‚Äôs Green was removed about 1911. Thereafter, the railway continued to function to Howbeach with three goods trains a week. After World War I The coal strike of 1921 finished off Howbeach Colliery and traffic ceased beyond Blakeney about this time; the track beyond Blakeney remained in position, but was removed in 1942. Because of the lease, the line had long been simply a quiet mineral branch line of the Great Western Railway; the Forest of Dean Central Railway owned the line but took no involvement in operating it, and the huge indebtedness meant that there was no dividend distribution. After World War I the Government determined that the railways of Great Britain should be \\"grouped\\" into four large companies, under the Railways Act 1921. The Great Western Railway absorbed many small networks in its area of influence, and the Forest of Dean Central Railway was absorbed by the GWR from 1 January 1923. No shareholders could be traced, and the line was gifted to the GWR; it had spent ¬£141,000 on the line. During the Second World War, traffic was quite heavy because charcoal, a war material, was made in the Forest and there was a storage depot at Blakeney. After the war the traffic fell off and the last train ran on Friday, 29 July 1949, the line being officially closed from 2 August. The last engine was 0-6-0 pannier tank No. 2153. The track from Awre to Blakeney was used for condemned wagon storage for some years, the wagons being shunted up to Blakeney with gaps left at the occupation crossings, but the rails were lifted early in 1962. Route From Awre the line climbed at 1 in 69 to Blakeney, where there was a goods shed. At 1 in 60 it crossed the main road, a 10-span viaduct, went through two deep cuttings, crossed the Roman road at Blackpool Bridge and another cutting to Howbeach Colliery. Beyond the line rose at 1 in 103, then 1 in 54 to New Fancy. Note: Cobb shows the Forest of Dean Central Railway making a converging junction with the Mineral Loop of the Severn and Wye Railway, but this is a mistake. It crossed it, although both railways eventually had a connection to New Fancy Colliery.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, NotesReferencesSee also * Aditnow website at www.aditnow.co.uk (free registration required) gives location information for Howbeach, New Fancy and Foxes Bridge, with modern images of the first two.

Known for pioneering the portable belt sander, helical-drive circular saw, and portable band saw, it is a subsidiary of Stanley Black & Decker.  History  Porter- Cable was founded in 1906 in Syracuse, New York, by R.E. Porter, G.G. Porter, and F.E. Cable, who invested $2,300 in a jobbing machine and tool shop the trio ran out of a garage. In 1914, the company began to focus on power tools, starting with a line of lathes. Three years later, the company bought a plant on North Salina Street. Porter-Cable began to develop a niche in portable electric power tools in 1926, when Chief Engineer Art Emmons invented the portable electric belt sander, called the Take-About Sander. In 1929, Emmons invented the helical drive circular saw, a compact, lightweight design that is still the most widely used circular saw design produced today. In 1960, the company was sold to Rockwell International. Rockwell made numerous changes, including phasing out the Porter-Cable name, relocating the company's base of operations to Jackson, Tennessee, and creating a lower end of power tools to compete with Black & Decker. These tools had numerous reliability problems and harmed the brand's image. Porter-Cable nail gun in use In 1981, Pentair, Inc. acquired Rockwell's power tool group ‚Äî consisting of Porter-Cable and Delta Machinery ‚Äî and restored the Porter-Cable name. The company ended production of consumer level tools, and repositioned itself as a manufacturer of professional power tools. In 1989, it introduced the first electric random orbital sander. Around this time, the company returned to consumer tools, sold via retail outlets which included The Home Depot and Lowe's, greatly expanding its sales. In 1996, the Smithsonian Institution established a collection of materials from the company's ninety year history, the first such effort for a power tool company. In 2000, Porter-Cable consolidated with sister company Delta Machinery, the latter moving its headquarters and distribution center from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Jackson. The same year, Pentair acquired DeVilbiss Air Power Company and, in 2002, Porter-Cable expanded its line-up to include air compressors, air tools, generators, and pressure washers. In October 2004, the Pentair Tools Group ‚Äî comprising Porter-Cable, Delta Machinery, DeVilbiss Air Power, and others ‚Äî was purchased by Black & Decker, now Stanley Black & Decker. Porter-Cable is headquartered in Jackson, Tennessee. Manufacturing in the United States has mostly ceased; tools are now made primarily in Mexico and China.

Expanding on the last two examples, there is an analogy between knots and prime numbers in which one considers \\"links\\" between primes. The triple of primes are \\"linked\\" modulo 2 (the R√©dei symbol is ‚àí1) but are \\"pairwise unlinked\\" modulo 2 (the Legendre symbols are all 1). Therefore these primes have been called a \\"proper Borromean triple modulo 2\\" or \\"mod 2 Borromean primes\\".

In Ratha's Courage, the fifth book in the Named series, Ratha extends the use of the Red Tongue to a hunter tribe. One of the hunters ignites a blaze that sets off a devastating conflict between the two clans. Now Ratha must find the courage within herself to set it right. Plot summary The Named and the hunter Tribe have entered into an uneasy alliance as neighbors. When Quiet Hunter, a young member of the Tribe, asks the Named if they can share their fire to warm the Tribe's cubs, a strange young male steals the Red Tongue in an attempt to harness its powers. However, he is young and foolish, and he accidentally starts a canyon fire which kills many of his tribe, mainly the Tribe's breeding-age females. When the mating season comes the leader of the Tribe, True-of-voice, ends up driving out the younger males from his tribe because they are competition for females. New- Singer (True-of-Voice's son) leads the outcast young males with his song, and wages an attack on the Named. New-Singer's Tribe kills the majority of the cubs and kidnaps the Named females, with the exception of Ratha. Ratha attempts to rescue her clan sisters by sneaking into the new Tribe's camp, but ends up in captivity herself. New-Singer waits until all the females are in heat, and then begins a courting circle. During this frenzy, it is revealed that the strange young male who stole the fire was Night-who-eats-Stars, Ratha's long lost son. Two young Named cubs, Mishanti and Bundi, end up helping the Named males in destroying the courting circle with their \\"Rumblers\\" (Paraceratherium), and the young Tribe members are driven away.

This family has no subfamilies. According to P. Yu. Parkhaev in 2007, the family is within the superfamily Helcionelloidea Wenz, 1938 in the order Helcionelliformes Golikov & Starobogatov, 1975 within the subclass Archaeobranchia Parkhaev, 2001 in the class Helcionelloida Peel, 1991. Carinopelta is one of six genera which was placed into the family, along with Protoconus, Rozanoviella, Gonamella, Mastakhella, and Squamiconus by P. Yu. Parkhaev in 2002. Homonymy The type species was first described by N.I. Vassiljeva as \\"Trilobella\\" levis in 1990. The genus name was already preoccupied by \\"Trilobella\\" Woodward, 1924, itself a synonym of Triloba Vest, 1867WoRMS Trilobella B.B. Woodward, 1924 making Trilobella Vassiljeva a homonym. In 1998 a new genus, Igarkiella was erected for the species to correct the homonym status and in 2001 a new family Igarkiellidae was named for the genus.Parkhaev P. Yu. 2001.

However the chosen genus name was again a homonym, already having been used by A.V. Rozova for the trilobite Igarkiella. In 2013 a new genus and family name were erected by Parkhaev to fully remove the homonym status of the species. Due to the family name Igarkiellidae being based on the invalid genus name, it too was invalid for use and the replacement family name Carinopeltidae was given.

Early life and education Kinahan Cornwallis was born on 19 February 1883 in the United States and was the son of British poet, writer, and world traveler Kinahan Cornwallis and his wife Miss Elisabeth Chapman of Hartford, Connecticut. Cornwallis was educated at Haileybury and University College, Oxford, from 1904 to 1906 he was president of the Oxford University Athletic Club.\\"Sir Kinahan Cornwallis.\\" Times [London, England] 5 June 1959: 17. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 19 Aug. 2016. He left university and spent eight years in the Sudan Civil Service. Career=Director of the Arab Bureau= From 1916 to 1920, Cornwallis was the Director of the Arab Bureau. He had been Deputy Director of the bureau under David Hogarth, a Naval Intelligence officer. The Arab Bureau was created by the British as a section of the Cairo Intelligence Department during the World War I. The bureau was created on the initiative of Mark Sykes. Its purpose was to improve British decision making with regard to Arab affairs more unified and effective. Other members of the Arab Bureau included George Stewart Symes, Philip Graves, Gertrude Bell, Aubrey Herbert, and T. E. Lawrence. =Advisor= As the British advisor to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, Cornwallis played a part in the ratification of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922. The treaty was signed by the members of the Iraqi cabinet in October 1922 and required ratification by an Iraqi 100-member constituent assembly.Bengio, p.16 On 11 September 1923, Cornwallis asked the British administrative inspectors in all Iraqi provinces (liwa) to telegraph him the names of candidates who they and the Iraqi provincial governors felt would vote for the treaty.Bengio, p.17 On 8 February 1924, after considering the names, Cornwallis sent each provincial inspector and governor a list of proposed candidates for the 100-member constituent assembly. The treaty was ratified by the assembly on 24 March 1924. A quorum of only 69 out of 100 delegates participated in the meeting. Of the 69, only 37 voted for the treaty; and even these votes came only after the British High Commissioner Sir Percy Cox threatened to dissolve the assembly and issue orders to occupy the assembly building and its surroundings. In 1940, Cornwallis wrote the Introduction to Gertrude Bell's posthumously published The Arab War.Bell, pp. 3-5, Bell died in 1926. The book was censored by a mark indicating confidential information for General Headquarters from Bell bring composed of dispatches from the secretive Arab Bulletin. According to his signature, Cornwallis wrote the Introduction while in Petersfield. =Ambassador to Iraq= On 1 April 1941, pro-German Rashid Ali and a group of supporters staged a coup d'√©tat to depose the government of the pro-British Regent of the Kingdom of Iraq, Prince Abdul Illah. From 2 April, Cornwallis was named as the British Ambassador to Iraq. He had much experience in Mesopotamia having spent twenty years in the country as adviser to former King Faisal I who had died in 1933. Cornwallis, being highly regarded, was sent to Iraq on the understanding that he would be able to hold a more forceful line with the new Iraqi government than had hitherto been the case. Unfortunately the British agent Cornwallis arrived in Iraq too late to prevent the outbreak of war.Lyman, p.18 On 18 April, as part of Operation Sabine, the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade was landed at Basra without opposition.Lyman, p. 31 The brigade included personnel of the Royal Artillery's 3rd Field Regiment; but without their guns,Mackenzie, p. 92 and the headquarters of the 10th Indian Infantry Division landed at Basra;Playfair, p. 179 covered by infantry of the King's Own Royal Regiment.Martin, p. 42 Major-General William Fraser, commanding officer of the 10th Indian Infantry Division, assumed control over the land forces based within Iraq, initially known as Sabine Force and ultimately known as Iraqforce. Brigadier Donald Powell commanded the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade. The following day seven aircraft were flown into RAF Habbaniya to bolster the air force there. Following the landing of the troops on 18 April, Rashid Ali requested that they be moved quickly through the country and that no more should arrive until the previous force had left.Playfair, pp. 179 - 180 Cornwallis referred the issue to London and received the reply that there was no interest in moving the troops out of the country. London wanted to establish the troops within Iraq. Cornwallis was also informed not to inform Rashid Ali who, as he had taken control of the country via a coup d'√©tat, had no right to be informed about British troop movements.Playfair, p. 181 On 29 April, a further three ships landed at Basra and brought ancillary troops.Mackenzie, pp. 92 - 93 On the same day Ambassador CornwallisPlayfair, p. 178 advised that all British women and children should leave Baghdad; 230 civilians were escorted by road to Habbaniya and during the following days were gradually air lifted to RAF Shaibah. A further 350 civilians took refuge in the British Embassy and 150 British civilians in the American Legation.Jackson, p. 149 On 30 April, when Ali was informed that ships containing even more British forces had arrived, he refused permission for these troops to disembark. Rashid Ali also began organizing for an armed demonstration at RAF Habbaniya while anticipating German assistance would be forthcoming in the guise of aircraft and airborne troops. Later that day, Iraqi ground forces with artillery took up strong positions on the escarpment above RAF Habbaniya. Cornwallis signaled the Foreign Office that he regarded the Iraqi actions as an act of war which required an immediate air response. He also informed them that he intended to demand the withdrawal of the Iraqi forces and permission to launch air strikes to restore control. Even if the Iraqi troops overlooking Habbaniya did withdraw it would only postpone aerial attacks.Playfair, p. 183 On 1 May, the Cornwallis received a response giving him full authority to take any steps needed to ensure the withdrawal of the Iraqi armed forces. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill also sent a personal reply, stating: \\"If you have to strike, strike hard. Use all necessary force.\\"Mackenzie, p. 94 Were contact to break down between the Embassy in Baghdad and the besieged force at Habbaniya, the Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal H. G. Smart, was given permission to act on his own authority. On 2 May, after several days of warnings and counter-warnings, Smart launched pre-emptive air strikes on the Iraqi forces positioned on the escarpment. AVM Smart also launched air attacks on Iraqi forces throughout the country. From this point, Cornwallis was confined to the British Embassy compound in Baghdad.Wavell, p. 3439 The British air strikes were extremely successful and, by the evening of 6 May, the Iraqis abandoned the escarpment above Habbaniya. After the arrival of elements of Habforce, the British ground forces from Habbaniya pressed on to Fallujah and, after its fall, they advanced towards Baghdad. On 29 May, the government of Rashid Ali collapsed and he and his supporters fled to Persia. On the morning of 31 May, the Mayor of Baghdad and a delegation approached British forces at the Washash Bridge outside of Baghdad. With the Mayor was Sir Kinahan Cornwallis. Terms were quickly reached,Lyman, pp. 84-85 an armistice was signed,Mackenzie, p.104 and the monarchy and a pro-British government were put back in place. On 1 June, the Regent returned to Baghdad.Lyman, p. 86 On 1 June an armed Iraqi mob began a two-day murder spree against Baghdad's Jews, known as \\"The Farhud\\". After two days the Mayor of Baghdad and police loyal to the Iraqi monarchy quelled the violence by imposing a curfew and shot violators on sight. An investigation conducted by the journalist Tony Rocca of the London Sunday Times looked at Cornwallis's conduct, when he refused to act against the riots.Memories of Eden - Haaretz - Israel News Family life On 14 October 1911 in London, Cornwallis married Gertrude Dorothy Bowen, daughter of Sir Albert Edward Bowen, 1st Baronet, and Alice Anita Crowther. They had a daughter Elisabeth Cornwallis (1912‚Äì1999), and two sons; Richard Kinahan Cornwallis and Peter Brownell Cornwallis, who was killed in action along with his Australian flight crew while flying over the North Sea on a supplies mission to Norway in February 1945.

Baron Jacobus von Washington (26 January 1778 ‚Äì 5 April 1848) was a lieutenant general in the Bavarian Army and a distant relative of US President George Washington. Born in The Hague, Netherlands, he was christened James Washington. Most of his adult life was shaped by his participation in wars for and against Napoleonic France and his service to Ludwig I of Bavaria. Origins The known history of the Washington family goes back to the 12th century. Sir Robert Washington (d. 1324) was the progenitor of the branch of the family residing in Sulgrave Manor, England. One of his descendants, John Washington, emigrated to Virginia in 1656 and was the great-grandfather of George Washington. The brother of Sir Robert, Sir John Washington (died 1331), founded the Hallhead Hall/Adwick-le- street branch of the Washingtons. His descendant, James Washington, accompanied John Washington to Virginia, but returned to England, then shortly thereafter emigrated to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. There he married a Dutchwoman named Clara van der Lauen, leading, five generations later, to Jacobus Washington. Early life On 2 February 1777, Daniel Washington, aged 46 and a military solicitor, married Elisabeth Cornelia Hoogstad. Jacobus was born on 26 January 1778. His only sibling, Daniel, was born 27 July 1781. Their father died in October 1786, and their mother in September 1789, leaving them orphaned at 11 and 8 years old. Little is known of their lives for some years after. Daniel remained in the Netherlands, married in 1808, and died in 1813, apparently without children. Military career In 1794, aged 16, Jacobus Washington joined the Dutch Army. When the French invaded later that year he fought against them. His lot under French domination in the new Batavian Republic was not a happy one. In 1799, in a letter to George Washington, Jacobus offered his services to the United States in its undeclared Quasi-War with France, but was turned down due to his inexperience. He then moved to the Kingdom of Bavaria, where he joined the Bavarian Army. He came to the attention of Crown Prince Ludwig, who made Jakob his adjutant. In July 1807 Jakob was present at the negotiations for the Treaties of Tilsit following the victory of the French Empire (of which Bavaria was now an ally) over Russia. Over the next few years he advanced to the rank of Colonel. In October 1813, Bavaria joined the Allies against France. On 7 June 1815 in Brussels, Jakob Washington signed a treaty with the Duke of Wellington representing Bavaria. On the night of 15 June 1815, prior to the Battle of Quatre Bras, Washington was an invited guest at the now famous Duchess of Richmond's ball. He fought in the Battle of Waterloo, the only Bavarian officer to do so, since the rest of the Bavarians were held in reserve in Saarbr√ºcken. In 1825, Ludwig became King of Bavaria as Ludwig I. Washington's career continued apace, rising eventually to lieutenant general. On 8 December 1829, Ludwig made him Freiherr (Baron) von Washington. Ludwig also appointed him Grand Chamberlain and Marshal of his military household. In 1843, on a visit to London, Queen Victoria dubbed him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Family Duchess Frederica of Oldenburg Washington's first wife was baroness Antonie van L√∂chner (born Baroness von Verger) (1788‚Äì1830), a wealthy widow. They had two sons, Ludwig Carl August Maximilian Gerhardt (1827‚Äì1845) and Maximilian Emanuel Willibald Bernhard Johann Gerhard von Washington (1829‚Äì1903). After her death, he married baroness Caroline Segesser von Brunegg (1802‚Äì1841) in 1833. Through this marriage he gained the Castle Notzing, near the town of Erding, Bavaria. They had a son, Carl Theodor Albrecht Sigmund Jacob Gerhardt von Washington (1833‚Äì1897). Baron Jakob von Washington died in Notzing on 5 April 1848. Maximilian Emanuel also became Grand Chamberlain, married Duchess Frederica of Oldenburg (sister of Queen Amalia of Greece), and had two sons, one of whom, named Peter Elimar Otto Karl George, served in the 11th Hussars of the Austro-Hungarian army reaching the rank of captain. However, despite reports to the contrary, he did not fight during the First World War, having retired before the War started. Both sons died without issue, and since none of Jakob's other children had any offspring, the von Washington line became extinct.

The name derives from Greek, combining the words pente (five) and athlon (competition). Five events were contested over one day, starting with the stadion (a short foot race), followed by the javelin throw, discus throw, and long jump (the order of these three events is still unclear), and ending with wrestling. While Pentathletes were considered to be inferior to the specialized athletes in a certain event, they were superior in overall development and were some of the most well balanced of all the athletes. Their training was often part of military service‚Äîeach of the five events was thought to be useful in battle. History The event was first held at the 18th Ancient Olympiad around 708 BC,Notations on the 1920 discus stamps at the Olympic Museum. International Olympic Committee. Retrieved on 2009-08-03. and changed format a number of times. By the 77th Ancient Olympiad, the pentathlon was generally ordered into three sections: the triagmos of the long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw, the stadion foot race, and wrestling as the final event. The first three events were generally not held as individual events, but rather as only part of pentathlon competitions.Waldo E. Sweet, Erich Segal (1987). Sport and recreation in ancient Greece. Oxford University Press. (p37). Retrieved on 2009-08-03. The wide variety of skills needed to compete meant that pentathletes were held in high esteem as physical specimens: in Rhetoric, Aristotle remarked \\"a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength...This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful\\".Ancient Olympic Events; Pentathlon. Perseus digital library. Retrieved on 2009-08-03. Every four years when Olympic games occurred, there was the ‚ÄúOlympic truce‚Äù. This was an agreement that all the city states agreed on. At this time there was an organized truce between all the cities involved in the games. This was done to give families and people the safety needed to travel long distance to the games. This truce was known as ‚ÄúEkecheiria‚Äù. Events thumbleft Gymnasium scene: athlete holding a javelin; next to him, a mattock to soften the soil of the jumping pit; jumping weights and a sponge bag hang on the wall. Attic red-figure cup, ca. 490 BC The stadion was a sprint of approximately 200 yards (or about 180 metres), longer than the modern 100 metres sprint, but shorter than all other ancient running events. The javelin, like the discus, was thrown for length, but in addition there was a second section of it where they threw for accuracy. The javelin was a lighter, longer version of a war spear. The ‚Äúekebolon‚Äù was the event won by distance. The ‚Äústochastikon‚Äù was the event based on accuracy. The javelin throw used a leather strap, called an amentum, rather than having the athlete grip the shaft of the javelin itself. Competitors in the javelin and discus throws were allowed five throws each, and only their longest throw would count. The long jump was also attempted five times. In the classical games, it was traditional for all of these events to be performed naked. In the discus throw the athlete must throw a solid bronze disc. They usually weighed around nine pounds, although varied in size. They took the longest distance out of five throws. The long jump is perhaps the most unusual, compared to the modern athletics version. A long jumper used weights called halteres to propel himself farther out of standing, and his jump probably consisted of five separate leaps, more like the modern triple jump; otherwise, distances of known jumps (which are often as far as 50 feet) would seem to be impossible. Wrestling was the fifth and last event of the Pentathlon. To win, one had to wrestle the opponent to the ground. Different from modern day wrestling where the entire back must be touching, any part of the back can touch to become the victor. Wrestling was held in a sand pit at the Olympic Games outside the Temple of Zeus, while the other events were all held in the stadion (or stadium) from which the name of the race was taken. Wrestling and the discus throw had essentially the same basic format as their modern versions (although the actual technique and rules may have differed). However, the discus throw was completed atop a raised podium, rather than on a level field. Winning It is unclear how a winner was chosen, but there are many theories that circulate. The first, and most unlikely, is that in order to be proclaimed the victor, a competitor must win all five of the events. This method is impractical, for the prize would have hardly ever been awarded. Another hypothesis is that perhaps an athlete who was victorious in just three events, was declared the overall winner. One of the more common theories is that only a certain number of competitors would qualify for the final event, wrestling, based on their performance in the previous four events. Ultimately, the victor of wrestling would be deemed the champion of the entire pentathlon. Further reading *Pentathlon (athletic contest). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

It was founded in 1921 and claims a seven-digit-membership. It used to bear the name Vereeniging De Pinkstergemeente in Nederlandsch Oost Indie.http://www.gpdiworld.us/node/176 History of GPdI in GPdIWorld website It is one of the largest Pentecostal denominations in Indonesia. GPdI has a partnership connection with International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. GPdI is currently led by Pdt. DR. John Weol. MM. MTh. Doctrine The teaching emphasized in this church is different from other charismatic churches. the most dominant is concerning the Holy Spirit in Acts 2 where the disciples experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit. With the power of the Holy Spirit Simon Peter and other disciples preached the gospel and the church was born. GPdI Church believes that there will be anti-Christ who will rule 3.5 years, the kingdom of 1000 years of peace, and the second coming of Jesus. History The establishment of the Pentecostal Church in Indonesia was inseparable from the arrival of two missionary families from the Church of Bethel Temple Seattle, USA to Indonesia in 1921 namely Rev. Cornelius Groesbeek and Rev. Dutch descendant Richard Van Klaveren immigrated to America. From Bali, the ministry switched to Surabaya on the island of Java in 1922, then to the oil city of Cepu in 1923. In this city F.G Van Gessel BPM employees repented and were filled with the Holy Spirit accompanied by many other Indonesian sons, including: H.N. Runkat, J. Repi, A. Tambuwun, J. Lumenta, E. Lesnussa, G.A Yokom, R.Mangindaan, W. Mamahit, S.I.P Lumoindong and A.E. Siwi later became a pioneer of the Pentecostal movement throughout Indonesia. Due to rapid progress, on June 4, 1924 the Dutch East Indies Government recognized the existence of \\"De Pinkster Gemeente in Nederlansch Indie\\" as a legitimate \\"Vereeniging\\" (association). And by the power of the Holy Spirit and the high spirit of service, new churches began to grow everywhere. On 4 June 1937, the government increased its recognition of the Pentecostal movement to \\"Kerkgenootschap\\" (church alliance) based on the Statutes of 1927 number 156 and 523, with Beslit Government No.33 dated 4 June 1937 Staadblad number 768 the name \\"pinkster Gemente\\" changed to \\"Pinkster in Indie Nederlansch. During the Japanese occupation in 1942, the Dutch name was changed to \\"Pentecostal Church in Indonesia\\". At that time the Chairperson of the Oemoem Pengoeroes Agency (Central Assembly) was Rev. H.N Runkat. In addition to the developments, it was also necessary to note several divisions which later gave birth to new churches where the founders came from GPdI people, including: Rev. Ho Liong Seng (DR.H.L Senduk) founder of GBI church who was with Rev. Van Gessel in 1950 parted ways with GPdI and founded GBIS, Rev. Isaac Lew in 1959 left and founded GPPS, previously in 1936 Missionary R.M. Devin and R. Busby left and formed the Assemblies of God, in 1946 Rev. Tan Hok Tjoan separated and formed the Isa Almasih Church and so on. The role of the pioneers is also worth remembering, because of their struggle the GPdI trees have grown heavily, they include: Rev. H.N. Runkat which penetrated fields on Java, (Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, etc.), 1929 Rev. Yulianus Repi and Rev. A. Tambuwun followed by Rev. A. Yokom, Rev. Lumenta, Rev. Runtuwailan attacked North Sulawesi, in 1939, from North Sulawesi / Ternante Pdt. E. Lesnussa to Makassar and its surroundings. In 1926 Rev. Nanlohy reaches the Maluku islands (Amahasa) which was then followed by Rev. Yoop Siloey, etc. In 1928 Rev. S.I.P Lumoindong to D.I Yogyakarta in 1933 Rev. A.E. Siwi sows to Sumatra islands (South Sumatra, Lampung, West Sumatra and then 1939 to North Sumatra), 1932 Rev. RM Soeprapto began helping services in Blitar then Singosari dsk, in 1937 to Sitiarjo, South Malang. In 1935 Rev. Siloey et al. Pioneered services to Kupang NTT, 1930 Pdt. De Boer followed by Rev. E. Pattyradjawane and A.F Wessel to East Kalimantan. In 1940 Rev. JMP Coal cut down the West Kalimantan (Pontianak) field, Rev. Yonathan Itar is a pioneer of the Pentecostal Gospel in Irian Jaya, and others that cannot be mentioned one by one. By their sacrifice GPdI grew rapidly. GPdI Organizational Structures The highest forum in the GPdI forum is the Grand Conference held every 5 years. In addition to establishing the Work Program Outline (GBPK), the Mubes also functions to elect the GPdI National Leadership called the Central Assembly. The Central Assembly now has as many as 24 people, namely a General Chairperson, several Chairpersons, a General Secretary, a number of Secretaries, a General Treasurer, several Treasurers, and others leading departments, namely: Ministry of Evangelism, Pastoring, Education & Teaching, Organization, Church Growth, Diaconia, Development Then the Central Assembly appointed 9 national level committee members called the Central Commission, namely: Pentecostal Children Services (PELNAP), Pentecostal Youth Services (PELRAP), Pentecostal Youth Services (PELPAP), Pentecostal Women's Services (PELWAP), Pentecostal Male Services (PELPRIP), Pentecostal Professional Services & Entrepreneurs (PELPRUP), Servants of the Servant (PELAHT), Pentecostal Student Services (PELMAP), Central Pentecostal Evangelism Commission. After the Mubes are held, each region holds a Regional Deliberation (Musda) whose purpose, among others, is to elect regional leaders called the Regional Assembly. GPdI now has 32 regional assemblies, domestic and foreign, as follows: MD North Sumatra-NAD, MD West Sumatra, MD Riau, MD Kepri, MD Jambi, MD Sumsel, MD Bengkulu, MD Bangka-Belitung, MD Lampung, MD Banten, MD Jakarta, MD West Java, MD Central Java, MD Yogyakarta, MD East Java, MD Bali / NTB, MD NTT, MD West Kalimantan, MD Kalteng, MD Kaltim, MD South Kalimantan, MD Sulselbar, MD Sultra, MD Sulteng, MD Sulut, MD Gorontalo, MD North Maluku, MD Maluku, MD Papua, MD Australia, MD West Coast USA, MD East Coast USA. After being elected, each MD also assigns administrators at the regional level according to the needs called the Regional Commission. In addition, MD also stipulates the Regional Assemblies as needed, and the Regional Assembly will determine the management of the forum at the regional level, called the Regional Commission. Each Regional Assembly oversees pastors who become the main base of GPdI services, and each pastor appoints board members at the congregation level. How to be A GPdI Pastor The ideal time for someone to reach the full Pastor degree at GPdI, on average ranges from 10 years (calculated from the start of fulltime in service). The long journey that must be taken is generally as follows: starting with the TC (Training Center) in a pastor at least 1 year, then entering a class 1 Bible School for 1 year - after that the service practices as a 'workman' at least 1 year, then enter Class 2 Bible School for 1 year, then start pioneering a new session with a very relative time of at least 1 more year. If you already have stable and routine services, MD will be determined to be a pastor with a title of Pdp (Assistant Pastor), and if the ministry develops 2 years later you will get the title Pdm (Young Priest). And if the Regional Assembly recommends again, then 2 years later the person concerned can be appointed as Full Pastor (Pdt).  Notable churches  * GPdI Ketapang, Jakarta. Led by Pdt. A. H.

Etymology The name was consolidated in Oruro from 1789 to 1944, where masked groups which participated in parades dressed in devil costumes came to be known as Diabladas. In 1904, the first group with the label Diablada originated, the \\"Great Traditional Authentic Diablada Oruro,\\" with a defined music, dress, choreography, and plot. This period culminated with the founding of new groups of Diabladas in 1944, consolidating the denomination.http://www.carnavaldeoruroacfo.com/documentos/FORMULARIO%20DE%20CANDIDATURA.pdf Compilation of historians, anthropologists, researchers and folklorists about the Carnival of Oruro and La Diablada History *Oruro, Bolivia: Its earliest record found in pre-Hispanic times, the dance of \\"Llama llama\\"in worship of the Uru god Tiw, dance subsequent ironically devoted Aymara language of the Urus dance dressed as devils, as recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. Ethnohistorical development process of disguise and the dance of Diablada fall into three periods, according to the document sent by Carnaval de Oruro to the Organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) proclaimed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity: Periods of 1606 to 1789, 1789 to 1944 y 1944 to 1960. *Potos√≠, Bolivia: The dance could have had its beginnings in another city of modern-day Bolivia, such as in the city of Potos√≠, back then a miner's settlement during the Spanish conquest, from where it later spread to Oruro and other parts of the Altiplano. *Juli, Peru: The Diablada would have been introduced in 1576 to the native Lupakas people of Juli, located near Lake Titicaca in the Altiplano of present-day Puno, Peru; and from there it allegedly spread to other parts of the Spanish domain in the Americas. =Native American roots= Depiction of a Collasuyu party in the 17th century book Primer Nueva Cor√≥nica y Buen Gobierno of Felipe Guam√°n Poma de Ayala. The debate about the patrimonial identity of the Diablada concerns its roots as well. Chilean and Peruvian organizations suggest that since this dance is inspired in the Andean civilizations previous to the formation of the current national borders, it should belong equally to the three nations and other Andean states such as Argentina and Ecuador as well. Bolivian cultural organizations and government label this as an \\"unlawful cultural heritage appropriation\\" and consider that the declaration of the Carnaval de Oruro as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity gives Bolivia and the city of Oruro support on this claim. Bolivian scholars such as the professor of ethnomusicology and cultural heritage, Diego Echevers T√≥rrez, express that the Diablada is not the mere representation of the devils in a defined space, but constitutes the cultural heritage of the city of Oruro with specific actors and environment.Echevers T√≥rrez 2009 Aymaran roots theory The scholars who defend the theory of Juli (Peru) identify the roots of this dance with the Aymaran traditions of the Lupakas. Based on the written accounts of 16th century historian and writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the Lupaka natives of Juli in the year 1576 presented their version of the Autos Sacramentales taught to them by Spanish Jesuit priests. The director of the cultural group Yuyachkani of Peru, Miguel Rubio Zapata, during an interview in 2007 with the Punean mask maker, Edwin Loza Huarachi, proposes linking the Diablada Pune√±a with the myth of the Anchanchu, a pre-Hispanic Aymara deity. Also, researchers Peter McFarren, Sixto Choque, and Teresa Gisbert state that the Diablada has roots to the Aymaran narrative of the Myth of the Supaya. Uru roots theory After the declaration of the Carnaval de Oruro as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 18 May 2001, the UNESCO delegated their ex-ambassador in Bolivia, Iv√©s de la Goublaye de Menorval, the task to be the moderator of the project and handed a form to the Bolivian authorities to be filled in coordination with historians and folklorists, such as Ramiro Condarco Morales, Mario Monta√±o Arag√≥n, Fernando Caj√≠as, Alberto Guerra Guti√©rrez, Javier Romero, El√≠as Delgado, Carlos Condarco Santill√°n, Marcelo Lara, Zenobio Calizaya, Zulma Yugar, Walter Zambrana and Ascanio Nava. The document elaborated by this group is based in the theory that the modern Diablada has roots in the ancient rituals performed 2000 years ago by the Uru civilization. The study makes reference to a deity named Tiw who was the protector of the Urus in mines, lakes and rivers and, in the case of Oruro (or Uru-uru), the owner of caves and rocky shelters. The Urus worship this deity with the dance of the devils being the Tiw himself the main character, later this name was Hispanicized as T√≠o (), and as product of the syncretism, the Tiw represented the figure of the devil regretting and becoming devotee of the Virgin of Socav√≥n.A.C.F, O. 2001, p.3. During the times of the Tahuantinsuyu, the four administrative entities known as suyus had their own representative dances during the Ito festival, a festivity once celebrated throughout the entire empire but, according to the historian Jos√© Mansilla V√°zquez, who based on manuscripts of Fray Mart√≠n de Mur√∫a, says that these festivities were outlawed during the Viceroyalty of Peru with the exception of Oruro which, for being considered an important miner city in the 16th century, counted with some privileges and the Spanish authorities looked to the other way allowing this festivity persist in this city, adapting itself later into the Spanish traditions between the Carnestolendas and the Corpus Christi becoming into the Carnaval of Oruro over the centuries.A.C.F, O. 2001, pp.10-17. Map of the sacred places in the city of Oruro, Bolivia showing the location of the ants, lizards, toads and snakes, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. The ancient authors, Fray Mart√≠n de Mur√∫a and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala make reference in their works to the different dances of the area, including the dance of the Llama llama, name given by the Aymaras to refer to the Urus dressed as dancing demons, as it was recorded by Ludovico Bertonio. This dance was performed during the Ito festivities by the representatives of the region known as Urucolla, a sub- region of the south-eastern suyu of Collasuyu located in the lake system of the Department of Oruro between the basins of the lakes Poop√≥ and Coipasa, where the Uru civilization had the city of Oruro as their main social centre, becoming together with Nazca and Wari one of the most ancient cities in the Andean world.Guaman Poma de Ayala 1615, p.235. The supporters of this theory consider that the Uru mythology is reflected in the symbolism of the Diablada. The legend behind the importance of the city of Oruro as an ancient sacred place for the Urus tells the story of the chthonic deity Wari, which in the Uru language means soul (). He, after hearing that the Urus were worshiping Pachacamaj, represented by Inti, unleashed his revenge by sending plagues of ants, lizards, toads and snakes, animals considered sacred in the Uru mythology. But they were protected by the √ëusta who adopted the figure of a condor, defeating the creatures petrifying them and becoming sacred hills in the four cardinal points of the city of Oruro; these animals are also often represented in the traditional masks of the Diablada. =Spanish influence= One of the most referenced studies about the Diablada is the 1961 book of Julia Elena Fort√∫n, La danza de los diablos (The dance of the devils), in which the theory of a relationship between this dance and a Catalan dance named Ball de diables, was suggested; more specifically with the elements used in the localities of Pened√®s and Tarragona.Fort√∫n 1961, p. 23.Rius I Mercade 2005 Julia Elena Fort√∫n, unlike other historians in the Peruvian side, disagrees with the idea of considering the Diablada as a product of the introduction of the autos sacramentales in the Andes, because among the ones studied by her, the thematic of the devil and his temptations was not contemplated.Fort√∫n 1961, p. 24. Autos sacramentales Theory 18th century painting of the Danza de los diablicos de T√∫cume, region of T√∫cume, Peru. In 2003, the newspaper Correo and Jos√© Morales Serruto, coordinator of cultural activities of the Asociaci√≥n Nativa Puno (Native Association Puno), suggested that the dance of the Diablada was originated in the Peruvian city of Juli during a representation of the autos sacramentales in the year 1576 to the Aymaran kingdom of the Lupacas. Historian Mercedes Serna observes that as soon as the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was achieved, there was a sudden increase in the amount of Autos Sacramentales presented in the Spanish colonies. Jose Miguel Oviedo records that by the year 1560 contests were held for religious theatrical presentations. This representation was documented in the 17th century book Comentarios Reales of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega where it reads: Garcilaso de la Vega further mentions that the Jesuit priests taught the Auto Sacramental comedy by writing it in Aymara, and the natives of Juli later presented their version of the religious dance to the priests and, later, presented a dialogue to the rest of the Spanish population in such a way that it ‚Äúchanged the opinion that up to that point had regarded the natives as being dumb, rude, or incapable.‚Äù This same information is used by other authors, such as the Peruvian scholar Nicomedes Santa Cruz and the Bolivian anthropologist Freddy Arancibia Andrade, to suggest that the Spanish influence was spread to Oruro from the southern Bolivian region of Potos√≠. Andrade considers that the Diablada recovers the steps of rebellion and combat of the ritual of Tinku mixed with the biblic vision introduced by the Spanish conquerors in the miner region of Aullagas starting in the year 1538.Santa Cruz, 2004, p. 285. Another piece of information collected by Andrade is that in 1780 the army of Tom√°s Katari wore demon suits to attack the towns of Macha, Pocoata, Colquechaca, Aullagas and San Pedro de Buena Vista, giving more strength to the syncretism and represents the appearance of the tinku- devil. After the silver era in Bolivia, the miners went to Unc√≠a to work for the tin company of Sim√≥n Iturri Pati√±o and during the Bolivian federal war, the miners migrated to Oruro where in 1904 they were allowed to dance for the Virgin of Socav√≥n. Ball de diables theory Ball de diables during a Correfoc in Catalonia, Spain. \\"Struggle of the Diablada\\" written and presented in Oruro in 1818 by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre, maintained and presented to date by the \\"Great Traditional Diablada Autentic Oruro\\" in the Carnival of Oruro. The Ball de diables has origins in a 12th-century entrem√©s representing the struggle between the good and the evil where the figure of the archangel Saint Michael and his angels battled the forces of evil represented by Lucifer and his demons. This act was performed in the wedding banquet of the Barcelona count, Ram√≥n Berenguer IV with the princess Petronila, daughter of the king of Arag√≥n and Catalonia in the year 1150. In a study presented in 2005 by the Catalan scholar Jordi Rius i Mercade, member of the Ball de Sant Miquel i Diables de la Riera (board of the Ball de diables in Spain) and editor in chief of the specialized magazine El Dragabales during the Symposium of the Catalan Discovery of America, states that the traditional dances and short plays performed during the celebration of Corpus Christi in Spain were adopted by the Christian church to teach their doctrines to the Native Americans; their festivities were readapted to the new calendar and their deities were redefined acquiring demoniac forms representing the evil fighting against the divine power. According to Rius i Mercade, the Ball de diables was the most suitable for this purpose. In this study, he identifies three Latin American dances that contain similar elements to the Catalan Ball de diables; the Diablada of Oruro, Baile de Diablos de Cob√°n in Guatemala and Danza de los diablicos de T√∫cume in Peru. The Diablada of Oruro represents the tale of the struggle between the archangel Saint Michael and Lucifer, the she- devil China Supay and devils accompanying them. Ruis i Mercade suggests that this was a tale presented by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre of the city of Oruro in 1818 inspired in the Catalan Ball de diables. =Colonial history= During the colonial times in the region, from the 15th century till the first half of the 19th century, the ancient Andean beliefs were blended with the new Christian traditions. The traditions adopted new iconography and the celebrations adopted a new meaning during the Latin American wars of independence. From the worship of the Sun to the Virgin of Candlemas The church of Copacabana, Bolivia where the Virgin of the Candlemas was selected as patroness of the city and her cult spread across the region. With the advent of the Inca state religion the inhabitants of the Island of the Sun () were replaced by ministers in worship of the sun (Inti) and the city of Copacabana located in the Bolivian side of the Lake Titicaca had been repopulated by forty-two different nations of mitimaes and became one of the most important landmarks for the constant pilgrimage to the sanctuary; with the migration, two social classes were created in this area, the newcomers became Anansaya (upper) and the indigenous people Urinsaya (lower).Salles- Reese 1997, pp. 166-167. The selection of the Virgin of the Candlemas as the patroness of Copacabana was a sign of the power structures established by the Incas in the area. In the year 1582 a frost threatened to destroy the crops, and the inhabitants decided to build an altar to a Christian figure, but there was a dispute because the Anansayas insisted to use the Virgin of the Candlemas since Francisco Tito Yupanqui had already sculpted her image while the Urinsayas wanted it use the image of Saint Bartholomew instead. But the Anansayas' wishes were imposed in the enthronement of the Virgin of Copacabana and the foundation of a brotherhood. Independence and the transition to the Carnival Different models of Diablada masks in an exhibition in the British Museum. The cult of the Virgin of the Candlemas, was then spread throughout the Andes reaching, Oruro and to the west to Puno. In Oruro there is a Sanctuary in honour of the Virgin of Socav√≥n (or Sanctuary of the Virgin of the Mineshaft) who was originally the Virgin of Candlemas traditionally honoured on 2 February, like in Puno, but later the date was moved to Carnival; this transition is product of the Bolivian War of Independence. Harris 2003, pp. 205-211. There is a legend that says that on the Saturday of Carnival in 1789 a bandit known as Nina-Nina or Chiru-Chiru was mortally wounded in a street fight and before dying he was confronted by the Virgin of the Candlemas. Some versions state that he used to worship a life-size image of the Virgin painted in a wall of a deserted house, some say that the painting miraculously appeared on the wall of the bandit's own house after his death. And the legend is concluded with the tale of the troupe of devils dancing in honour of the Virgin in the next year's Carnival. The present sanctuary in Oruro was completed in 1891. However, according to the Ph D in religious studies and Executive Director of the Wisconsin Humanities Council at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Max Harris, this legend is related to a historical reality. During the Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II, which started in Cusco and spread along the Andean highlands, Oruro experienced a brief but bloody revolution as well. Pushed by the fear of being target of the indigenous revolution, the majority Creole on the night of Saturday, 10 February 1781, attacked the minority ruling class of the peninsular-born Spaniards () . With the arrival of the Indigenous army the Creoles made an alliance. On 15 February, a messenger arrived in Oruro with orders from T√∫pac Amaru II. He instructed his army to respect churches and clergy, to do no harm to Creoles, and to prosecute none but chapetones. And assured the victory by entering in La Paz \\"by Carnival (por Carnestolendas)\\", the Indigenous occupation of Oruro started to retreat leaving several thousands of deaths. But during March and April they launched more attacks to the city this time against the Creoles and the remaining Spaniards who unified forces to repel them. Harris observes that the Carnival of the year of 1781, fell on 24 February, placing Oruro's occupation exactly halfway between Candlemas and Carnival, making the situation in Oruro in Harris' words, \\"carnivalesque\\". Religious processions duelled with secular parades. Europeans and Creoles disguised as Indigenous, cases like a Spaniard resorting to cross-dressing tin a vain attempt to save his life and thousands of armed men in the streets of the colonial city. By 19 February people in the city regardless of the conflict continued celebrating and, throughout Carnival, the city markets were full of robbers selling the looted gold and silver back to its owners or to cholos and mestizos. By 1784 it was customary to rejoice, dance, play, and form comparsas (companies of masqueraders) for the Carnival in Oruro. Harris considers that with this background is that the legend of the Virgin of the Mineshaft in 1789 appeared favouring the rebellion as they worshiped the Virgin of Candlemas while the chapetones used to worship the Virgin of the Rosary. Under the beliefs of the revolutionaries, the Virgin of the Socav√≥n tolerated the indigenous deities or devils and, according to Harris, if the legend is correct, by 1790, Oruro's miners had moved Candlemas to Carnival and added indigenous gods, masked as Christian devils, to the festivities. In 1818, Oruro's parish priest, Ladislao Montealegre, wrote the play Narrative of the seven deadly sins, where according to Harris and Fort√∫n, borrowed elements of the Catalan Ball de diables like the female devil, Diablesa in the Catalan dance and China supay in the Diablada and where the Devil leads the Seven Deadly Sins into battle against the opposing Virtues and an angel. Harris suggests that Montealegre may have wanted to represent the threat of rebellion and the historical context with this play. A generation later, in 1825 after Bolivia achieved its independence, the Diablada and the Carnival adopted a new meaning for Oruro's residents. Two of the Diablada dance squads and the street from where the parade starts are named after Sebastian Pagador, one of the Creole heroes of the uprising. And the main square which is in the route of the Carnival to the Virgin of the Mineshaft temple is named Plaza 10 de febrero (10 February square) remembering the date of the uprising. Choreography In its original form, the dance was performed to accompany a band of Sikuris, which were a group of musicians playing the Siku. Nowadays, the Diablada in the Altiplano is accompanied by band and orchestra. The uniformity of the suits brought choreographic innovation, with the layout of steps, movements, and figure designs that are not only ready to be staged in open areas such as roads, streets, and public squares; but also in places such as theaters and arenas. At the start of the krewe are Lucifer and Satan with several China Supay, or devil women. They are followed by the personified seven deadly sins of pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. Afterwards, a troop of devils come out. They are all led by Saint Michael, with a blouse, short skirt, sword, and shield. During the dance, angels and demons are constantly moving around while forming somewhat complex figures such as crosses and circles. This confrontation between the two sides is eclipsed when Saint Michael appears, battles, and defeats the Devil. Both characters are dressed in heavy costumes that are highly ornate and finely wrought. The weight of the costume is more of a challenge than an obstacle for the different dance groups. The dancers often attempt to make unique and complex choreographies. The result is a colourful dance, creating a show very much appreciated by the public. The choreography have three versions, each conformed by seven moves. =First version= Diablada dancers in Puno, Peru. # Greetings: The dance starts with formations and greetings to the Virgin. The characters are displayed in two columns with the evil characters (Satan, Lucifer and China Supay) to one side, the Archangel Saint Michael to the other and the Condor in the middle. In formation they greet the rest of the devils to both sides. # Movings: The devils start their greetings in groups of four jumping bouncing on one or other foot. # Crossings of devil's step: S-shape crossings in couples and individuals. # Curl: One column starts a spiral advancing to the centre then the other. Satan and Lucifer stand in the shoulders of several devils to tell their tale. # Star: Represents the rebellion of the rest of the devils against the angel. The figure represented is an inverted Pentagram as the Sigil of Baphomet or the Signature of the Devil. Once the devils are knelled the angel enters marching. # Star banish: Once the angel says \\"Oh evil spirits, get out of these places\\" the star is dissolved, the angel pronounces a speech and the devils representing the seven deadly sins confess towards the angel who says \\"Against arrogance\\" and the devil yells \\"Humility!\\" and regretful and with the head low retires to his row, once the sins are defeated the devils are under the command of the angel and the triumph or joy dance is interpreted. # Squads: Formations with jump- step in rows of four, three, two, and one in front of the angel. =Second version= 210px # Movings: In each column there are two leaders named guides or back-guides. The Archangel Saint Michael directs the moves with a whistle, to its signal the devils come from outside to the place of the angel while the China Supay, Satan and Lucifer switch places with him. To the second signal the devils do the same move but jumping. In the centre there is a complementary character such as the bear or condor. # Curl: The spiral is formed and the guides or back-guides hold Satan in their shoulders who pronounces his speech. Then the band plays a slow march and the angel enters with martial step and with a cross and a mirror dazzles the devils and they return to their original places. # Street: There is a representation of the struggle between Lucifer and the angel who wins, then Satan comes to defend his friend and is defeated too. Finally the she-devil China Spuay representing sin and flesh comes and is defeated as well. Then the angel returns to his original position. # Squads: The China Supay and the angel on one side and Lucifer and Satan to the other dancing make switches and the devils greet them in groups of four and two. # Star: The shape is formed and with the signal of the whistle the devils kneel, the band plays a slow march and the angel enters to the centre and the star is dissolved calling to the seven deadly sins who defeated go back to their places. Then the guides switch places. # Chain: The dancers do a double chain and dancing holding by their arms first with the right arm then with the left one and going back to their places. # End: The devils go to the centre in groups of four, three two and one finishing the show. =Third version= Diablada choreography in the Carnaval de Oruro in Oruro, Bolivia. The third version is the one performed by the squad Gran Tradicional y Aut√©ntica Diablada Oruro. Introduction Devil's walk: The devils in the left column start the movement while the ones in the right one follow them. Lucifer and Satan are named the \\"Kings\\", they are placed behind followed by the Angel and the China Supay and the band to the right side behind the second column of devils. The Kings break the formation followed by the devils, and the Condor and Bear who stay in the middle.

Since the second half of the 20th century \\"the dialogue\\" is omitted focusing only in the dance.Gisbert 2002, p. 9. Regional variations=Puno= Diablos from Puno. The Diablada Pune√±a is inspired in the Lupakas people when they presented their version of the Autos Sacramentales taught by the Spanish Jesuit priests in 1576 in the city of in present-day Peru. Nevertheless, the dance holds Native American roots from the cult of Anchanchu, a pre-Hispanic Aymara deity, and the narrative of the Myth of the Supaya. The dance's association with the cult of the Virgin of Candelaria stems from a popular legend that tells that in 1675, in the mine of Laikakota (located near Puno), a Spaniard by the name of Jos√© Salcedo changed his decision to destroy the miner's houses because he saw a fire coming out of the mine as a result of the Virgin Mary fighting the Devil inside the mine. According to historian Enrique Cuentas Ormachea, until 1965 the Diablada Pune√±a was very different from the Diablada of Oruro when the group Los Vaporinos (formed by workers from the Peruvian Corp that worked in Lake Titicaca) began to dance in the Fiesta de la Candelaria with costumes and bands from Bolivia. Despite this, due to budget restrictions, the groups from Puno couldn't afford hiring Bolivian bands and started using their traditional groupings of Sicu-Morenos, such as the orchestra Sikuris del Barrio Ma√±azo (whom integrated this dance in 1922). Nowadays, the dance still maintains its differences from the Diablada of Oruro and integrates new characters such as Superman, Redskins, the Mexican, and others taken from films. Since its beginnings, the performance had a variety of changes. Originally the masks were made from plaster and the hair from baize (a coarse woollen cloth). Overtime, the mask models were influenced by Tibetan masks as well as elements from Native American cultures such as Sechin, Chavin, Nazca, and Mochica. These masks were traditionally made by each dancer or bought from a Bolivian mask-maker named Antonio Vizacarra, but in 1956 the brothers Alberto and Ram√≥n Vel√°squez established a workshop in Puno where masks were created and sold for the event. Also, the Diablada was at first small and reserved for important religious dates in the Catholic Church. As the dance further developed, the devil dancers began to accompany groups of Sikuris, which are an assemblage of musicians that play the Siku (the traditional Andean panpipe). Among the first Sikuris that surged at this point were those of the Barrio Ma√±azo (1892) and Juventud Obrera (1909). Nevertheless, anthropologist Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas suggests that eventually the role of the Sikuris was minimized to the point that they began to accompany the devil dancers under the new name of Sicu- Morenos. The Sicu-Morenos play with sicus, bombos, snare drums, cymbals, and triangles; and they dance Huaynos while accompanied by characters such as Caporales, minor devils, Chinas Diablas, the old man, the big-lipped negro, the Apache, the lion, the bat, the condor, the bear, the gorilla, and the giraffe (among others). These characters, along with the central performance of the devil dancers and the archangel Saint Michael, make the Diablada Pune√±a one of the dances in the Fiesta de la Candelaria. =Oruro= Oruro Carnival in Bolivia. 1880 Diablada patronal squad mask, from Paria, Oruro The Diablada of Oruro goes back to the pre-Columbian period of the Urus who used to practice this dance in honour of the god Wari (also known as Huaricato or Huari). With the arrival of the Spanish conquerors and the evangelicalism, this divinity gradually personified the devil. The iconography depicted in the current suits, such as the snake, frog and ants, respond to the Uru mythology with the belief that if Wari wouldn't protect them they'd be destroyed by those creatures. Wari after petrifying the creatures retired to the depths of the mountains. The Bolivian anthropologist, Milton Eyzaguirre, based on a 16th-century chronicle of Bartolom√© de √Ålvarez commented that in the Andean region of Bolivia, a cult in honour of the dead, named cupay, was practised. Over the centuries the cupay derived in supay, the figure of the devil in the modern Diablada. In pre-Columbian times the dead season started in November with the crop season, the conquerors made efforts to coincide the Andean calendar with their festivities, such as the carnival. The Diablada as is danced today in was originally the accompaniment of a theatrical play. In Bolivia there are two versions of this play preserved by Julia Elena Fort√∫n. The oldest of these pieces belongs to the 16th century when in the parties of the city of Potos√≠ in honour of the Virgin of Guadalupe, this play tells the story of Lucifer who, riding a horse, delivers a letter to be read to the public telling that Proserpina, the goddess of hell, was the most beautiful. A gentleman, representing the church, faces the demon defending Virgin Mary as the most beautiful. In the play after this dialogue a tournament started with fireworks and artillery shots followed by a squad of light cavalry of demons wearing black clothes and torches leading a chariot with snakes carrying Proserpina.Gisbert 2002, p. 8. Sanctuary of the Virgin of Socav√≥n during the festivities for the Oruro Carnival in Bolivia. This tradition continued in the city of Oruro over the centuries, in 1789 with the tale of the Chiru Chiru the festivity had another transformation with the introduction of the tale of the Seven deadly sins written by the parish priest Ladislao Montealegre, and with the Bolivian War of Independence the parade was moved to Carnival. By the 19th century the tradition had profound roots with the mining and the devotion to the Virgin of Socav√≥n and, as it was recorded in the newspapers of that time, the dancers made offerings to the feet of the Virgin after the parade. At the beginning it was considered a working class custom but by the ends of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th century the tradition was popularized reaching all groups of the Oruro society.Caj√≠as 2009 The first institutionalized dance squad is the Gran Tradicional y Aut√©ntica Diablada Oruro founded on 25 November 1904 by Pedro Pablo Corrales, followed by a Tradicional Folkl√≥rica Diablada de Oruro (1943), Diablada C√≠rculo de Artes y Letras (1943) and the Fraternidad Art√≠stica y Cultural ¬¥La Diablada¬¥ (1944). The squad founded by Pedro Pablo Corrales travelled to Peru in 1918 teaching to the squad Los Vaporinos the dance. In 1956 this dance entered Chile brought by the squad Diablada Ferroviaria of Oruro which was invited to participate in the Tirana festivities of that year. The Chilean citizen, Gregorio Ordenes, was inspired by this visit to form the first Chilean Diablada squad Primera Diablada Servidores Virgen del Carmen in Iquique. In the year 2001, the Carnival of Oruro was declared one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity where the Diablada along with 19 other dances were registered as part of the festivity. And in the year 2004 the squad Gran Tradicional y Aut√©ntica Diablada Oruro in its 100th anniversary received the C√≥ndor de Los Andes award, the highest distinction given by the Bolivian government. =La Tirana= Tirana festivity in Chile. The Diablada in Chile form part of the Tirana festivities, or Fiesta de La Tirana, a festival of the northern region of that country. The town of La Tirana is located at 84 kilometres from the city of Iquique with a population of less than 400 inhabitants but during the week of the festivities, which are held in the week of 12 to 16 July, it receives nearly 120,000 visitors. A documentary broadcast by Iquique TV (A Chilean television station) asserts that the dance has its roots in miners of Oruro. The sanctuary of the Virgin of Carmen was built in the region in the year 1540 and since then the festival is made in her honour in that locality with different dances. There are two kinds of squad organization: * Ancient type: with a structure not too differenced, traditional type authority, paternalistic, religiously guarantee, The power is in one person who is representative of a familiar clan. * Modern type: has a differenced internal structure, with defined statutes and rules. Tend to be named dance society. There are managers and a director, they are responsible of the social life of the group. There is the figure of the Caporal as well, who has the authority with respect to the religious activities. The first Diablada squad in Chile was founded in the city of Iquique by Gregorio Ordenes in 1956 under the name of Primera Diablada Servidores Virgen del Carmen after the visit of the Bolivian squad Diablada Ferroviaria to the festival of that year.

Brenner middle school in Petah Tikva, Israel. The crash happened near Moshav HaBonim, killing 22 people (19 students, a teacher, the bus driver, and a parent), and injuring 17. The bus involved in the incident was the second of four buses taking seventh graders from Y.H. Brenner middle school on an outing to the beach near HaBonim. The accident occurred along the coastal railway line at a level crossing on a rural dirt road less than a mile from the beach. The crossing was marked by signs, but as it was a little-used crossing on a secondary road, it had no gates or crossing signals to warn of an approaching train. The director of Israel Railways said that the first bus made it safely across the tracks, while the second bus probably got stuck on the crossing as it tried to cross the railroad. A Haifa-bound passenger train travelling at 60 miles per hour then collided with the bus. The train's engineer sounded the horn and applied the brakes when he saw the bus in its path, but did not manage to bring the train to a halt in time. The train collided with the bus towards its rear, crushing its sides, flipping it over, and throwing it 40 yards from the crossing. All of the dead were from the bus, while of the injured, 16 were from the bus and one was a soldier aboard the train who had been looking out of a window and was injured when the driver applied the brakes.https://www.jta.org/1985/06/13/archive/israel- mourns-18-children-4-adults-killed-when-train-hit-school- bushttps://www.jta.org/1985/06/12/archive/21-persons-most-of-them-teenagers- on-outing-killed-in-bus-train-collision-near- haifa-17-injuredhttps://www.jta.org/1985/07/09/archive/train-bus-collision- site-closed-to-buses-pending-corrective-measures Memorial to victims of HaBonim disaster Several investigative committees were appointed after the accident. The first, led by Professor Moshe Livneh of the Technion, found no mechanical faults in the bus. A committee led by Judge Ezra Kama recommended clearer signage at train crossings and installation of barriers. The train operator, Shlomo Somech, was prosecuted for his role in the accident, but was found not guilty. Survivors of the accident who needed continuing medical treatment fought the Egged bus company for compensation. Two weeks after the disaster, Yitzhak Peretz, a government minister from the Shas party, linked the train accident to Sabbath violation in Petach Tikva and invalid mezuzot at the school. Outraged parents of the victims unsuccessfully lobbied Prime Minister Shimon Peres to fire Peretz. A memorial constructed at the site used rails from the train tracks with the victims' names inscribed on them. In 2004, it was discovered that metal thieves had stolen the rails. In 1989 the rural dirt road at the crossing was paved with asphalt. In 1990 crossing lights and crossing arms barriers were installed. In 2006, in the wake of crashes at Revadim and Beit Yehoshua train crossings, Israel Railways accelerated its plan to minimize train-road interactions. At the time of the accident the railway at the site consisted of a single track, which was widened to double track a decade later. With train traffic having increased substantially since the days of the accident, and with the anticipated future four-tracking of the coastal railway, the construction of a grade-separated rail crossing at the site is expected to begin in late 2019. In 2001, fifteen years after the incident, the father of one of the victims committed suicide at the crossing where the disaster had occurred.

She was a prominent member of the Jamaican trade union movement, and was affectionately known as \\"Lady B\\" by Jamaicans. She has been called the \\"Mother of the Nation\\" due to her relationship with many of Jamaica's founders. Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding has called Bustamante \\"an icon of political struggles\\" in Jamaica's march towards independence. Early life She was born out of wedlock as Gladys Maud Longbridge on 8 March 1912 in Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica, to Frank Longbridge, a farmer, and Rebecca Blackwood, a housewife. In her memoir, The Memoirs of Lady Bustamante, she described her birth as a \\"welcome baby\\", writing \\"Being born out of wedlock was not a major issue in rural Jamaica then.\\" She was raised by her grandparents in rural Jamaica following her mother's move to Cuba when she was 3 years old. Longbridge enrolled in Ashton Primary School. Her aunt moved with the girl to Kingston, where they lived in the city's Jones Town neighborhood. Longbridge enrolled at the Tutorial Secondary and Commercial College, a private secondary school, where she studied to be a secretary. Career Longbridge returned to her native Westmoreland in the 1930s, but was unable to find employment during the Great Depression. She moved back to Kingston in 1934. Upon her return to Kingston, she began working as a cashier at a restaurant called Arlington House, which had become an important meeting place for members of the Jamaican colonial legislative assembly from rural areas of the island. While working there, she met Alexander Bustamante, a businessman and politician, whom she later married. He pronounced her name \\"Glad Ice\\" and called her \\"Miss G\\" at the time. On 9 March 1936, Longbridge at age 24 started working for Bustamante as his personal secretary. He later founded the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU). Bustamante and Longbridge formed a long personal and professional relationship that would last for decades. She served as his secretary through his years as a trade unionist and as a politician, until he became Prime Minister of Jamaica in 1962. That year they married. Longbridge became active in the Jamaican trade union movement and was considered a prominent member since 1938. She travelled extensively with Bustamante throughout Jamaica to deal with the concerns of the islands' workers. Longbridge became the treasurer and day-to-day decision maker for the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) from the time of the union's foundation. As the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union was the largest organization in Jamaica at the time, Longbridge was arguably the most influential woman in Jamaica. Bustamante later described the role of women in the Jamaican trade union movement in her memoir, \\"We women were the mainstay of the union's organisation, though we could hardly have functioned without the brave men who toiled day and night, facing all sorts of criticism and opposition as they tried to help the workers.\\" She also played a prominent role in the founding of the Jamaica Labour Party by Alexander Bustamante in July 1943. In 1951, Longbridge agreed to run for political office in Eastern Westmoreland. She lost the election, which pleased her as she had reluctantly agreed to seek elected office. At the time, the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper described her as \\"the happiest loser\\" of the election. Jamaican political and union life during the late colonial and post-independence eras centered largely on the rivalry between Bustamante and Norman Manley. While the two men, who were cousins and rivals for political power, often feuded in public, relations between Gladys Bustamante and Manley's wife, Edna Manley, were much more cordial. Marriage Gladys Longbridge married Alexander Bustamante on 7 September 1962, shortly after Jamaica achieved independence from the United Kingdom in August 1962. She was 28 years younger than he. Bustamante remained the first Prime Minister of Jamaica until his resignation in 1967 due to ill health. He had been effectively incapacitated for the last two years of his premiership due to illness. Gladys Bustamante cared for her husband at their home, which was called Bellencita, for the remainder of his life. Alexander Bustamante died on 6 August 1977. Bustamante described herself as \\"paralysed with grief\\" following her husband's death. She coped with her husband's death by becoming deeply involved with Jamaican charitable causes. Bustamante became a patron of the Bustamante Hospital for Children in Kingston, named for her husband. Much of her work focused on the plight of poor, working-class Jamaicans and their children. She worked to improve the standard of living for workers in Jamaica's shipping ports and sugarcane communities. She also worked to improve the lives of impoverished children and their families. When they first met in the 1930s, Gladys Bustamante attended the Moravian Church of the Redeemer. She later converted to Roman Catholicism, her husband's religion. Recognition Gladys Bustamante received a number of domestic and international awards for her work. She was awarded the Order of Jamaica in 1982. The government of Venezuela bestowed Mrs. Bustamante with the Orchid Award in 1979 in recognition of her husband's career. The Jamaican government further awarded Bustamante the Plaque for Outstanding Public Service to Jamaica in 1986 to mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women (1976‚Äì1986). The Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC) awarded Gladys Bustamante the Key to the city of Kingston on 16 October 2006, which was declared to be Lady Bustamante Day. Later life In 2009, Prime Minister Bruce Golding and the leadership of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) celebrated Bustamante's 97th birthday at her residence in Irish Town, Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica. Bustamante continued to hold the title of honorary treasurer of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union at the time of her death in 2009. She was also a trustee and executive member of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) that her husband had founded. Death Gladys Bustamante had been ill for several years and had been confined to her Irish Town home for the last two years of her life. Her condition suddenly worsened around 10:00 am on 25 July 2009. She was rushed to the hospital by her caregivers. However, Bustamante died at approximately 4:40 pm on 25 July 2009, at the Tony Thwaites Wing of the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. She was 97 years old. Bustamante had no children. Bustamante lay in state at both the BITU headquarters and the Jamaica Labour Party headquarters on 4 August 2009. She was moved to the National Indoor Sports Centre for viewing on 7 August 2009. Gladys Bustamante was interred alongside her husband, Prime Minister Alexander Bustamante, at the National Heroes Park in Kingston, Jamaica.

The Marines did not accept the YROE due to its low performance, vulnerability to small-arms fire and the lack of visual references on the structure. This problem could cause the pilot to experience spatial disorientation at all but very low altitudes.NASM: Hiller YROE-1 Rotorcycle The YROE or ROE never saw military service. In 1954, the United States Navy‚Ä≤s Bureau of Aeronautics selected Hiller to build its proposed design of a one- man helicopter. The XROE Rotocycle completed flight testing in mid-1957.

The public is welcome and admission is free (2018). The Museum of Zoology is in the David Attenborough Building (formerly known as the Arup Building) on the New Museums Site, just north of Downing Street in central Cambridge, England. The building also provides a home for the Cambridge Conservation Initiative, a biodiversity project. The Museum houses an extensive collection of scientifically important zoological material. The collections were designated in 1998 by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (now managed by the Arts Council England) as being of outstanding historical and international importance. The Museum reopened on 23 June 2018 after a major redevelopment for which it had been awarded a grant of ¬£1.8m by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The redevelopment aimed to create a \\"green\\" building\\" and to create displays and new interpretation to engage people with the wonders of animal diversity; create new stores to care for the Museum‚Äôs internationally significant collections to the highest standards and expand the Museum‚Äôs learning programmes, reaching out to wider audiences and increasing online resources. The Museum is one of the eight museums of the University of Cambridge Museums consortium. History of the Museum Much of the Museum‚Äôs material derives from the great collecting expeditions of the 19th century, which provided the first documentation of the fauna in many parts of the world. The earliest exhibits come from the Harwood anatomical collection which was purchased in 1814. The museum added further collections including birds from Swainson and animals from the Cambridge Philosophical Society, to which Charles Darwin himself had contributed. Past Superintendents of the museum include: William Clark 1817-1866, John Willis Clark 1866-1892, Sidney Frederic Harmer 1892-1908, Reginald Crundall Punnett 1908-1909, and Leonard Doncaster 1909-1914. The Museum was moved into the current purpose-designed building during 1968‚Äì70. Five separate stores currently house the collection of specimens. Collections Many of the collections were assembled during the nineteenth century, which was a key period for the development of modern biology. Much of the material was accumulated between 1865 and 1915 through private collections and expeditions. Cambridge was a centre of major importance for the development of biology, and several of the individuals associated with the Museum were central figures in the most active areas of scientific debate. Collections and letters from various collectors are on display, including collections of: *F.M. Balfour, Professor of Zoology *George Robert Crotch, entomologist *Charles Darwin, Naturalist *Sir Clive Forster-Cooper, former Director of the Museum *John Henry Gurney Sr., banker and amateur ornithologist *James Hepburn, Ornithologist *Reverend Leonard Jenyns, originally chosen as the naturalist for the voyage of HMS Beagle *Robert MacAndrew, amateur naturalist and shell- collector *Alfred Newton, zoologist and ornithologist. *Hugh Strickland, ornithologist *William Swainson, ornithologist *Alfred Russel Wallace, co- originator of the theory of natural selection *Henry Woodward, geologist Before the redevelopment a 21.3 m (70 ft) finback whale skeleton, colloquially known as Bobby, was displayed at the entrance of the museum; it was dismantled and stored during the redevelopment. The new interior entrance hall now contains this skeleton which was extensively cleaned before being reassembled. Skeletons and preserved skins of many extinct animals are housed in the museum. Most of the fish specimens are stored in spirit, some of them having been collected by Darwin himself on the voyage of HMS Beagle from 1831 - 1836. The bird collection consists of skins, eggs and skeletal material. There are skeletal remains from extinct birds such as the dodo from Mauritius and the solitaire from Rodrigues in the collection. The insect collection contains specimens collected by Darwin from around Cambridge. Collections of molluscs, corals and other sea-dwellers offer insight into the biological diversity of the oceans.

A 26-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were killed. Three deaths were mentioned in earlier reports of the incident but one has since been discounted. Most of the injured were minors; six were in serious condition. The city was subject to a \\"clampdown\\" after the attack, and several hundred police launched a manhunt to locate the killer(s). In June 2013, Hagai Felician was charged over the murder, but the police retracted its allegations in March 2014, after revealing its key witness fabricated evidence. The shooting sparked widespread condemnation, with one lawmaker calling it the worst attack against the gay community in Israel's history. The location of the attack‚Äîat the heart of what is seen as Israel's most liberal city‚Äî resulted in protests by the gay community. As of 2020, the police had yet to apprehend the shooter.Israeli prison allows homosexual conjugal visit for first time, 25 April 2017 Sue Surkes, Times of Israel Shooting Cactus and Succulent plants memorial garden, near the gay center of Tel Aviv, in memory of Liz Troubishi and Nir Katz, murdered in the Tel Aviv gay centre shooting. The plants were donated from the private garden of Eli Troubishi, Liz's father On the evening of August 1 at around 23:00, an unknown person with firearms entered the Aguda building in Tel Aviv, opened fire on the crowd attending a \\"Youth Get Together\\" event, and immediately escaped by foot. Two people were killed, and fifteen were wounded. Police launched a search campaign to find the shooter, and in addition immediately closed most entertainment locations for the gay community that operated during the same time of the shooting for fear of additional shooting. The building was frequented by gay teenagers who engaged in social activities and listened to music. The centre was small with one terrace, thus preventing anyone from escaping. Attendees instead hid under a bed and tables as shots were fired. Israeli television said the crime scene was a \\"bloodbath\\". Five of the injured were treated at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, while five were treated at Wolfson Medical Center in Holon. The shooter was masked, dressed in black and used a pistol to carry out the attack. It was not believed his motive was related to nationalist terrorism. The city's gay community stated the killer had a homophobic motive, while police criticized them for rushing to make declarations about incitement being the cause. Police were also investigating leads that the attack may have been due to a personal feud.2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting report, Haaretz; accessed 25 February 2014. =Manhunt= A manhunt was immediately launched in an attempt to locate the gunman. Roadblocks were set up in the city. Police shut down all other gay clubs and buildings that had homosexual connections near the crime scene immediately after the shooting in case there were further attacks. Hundreds of police officers were conducting street and door-to-door searches in the city. Police soon discarded the possibility that the shooting was a terror attack. =Reenactment= Police in Tel Aviv accompanied a teenaged survivor of the attack to the basement to conduct a reenactment on 3 August 2009. Victims The dead were named as 26-year-old Nir Katz from Givatayim and 17-year-old Liz Troubishi from Holon. One 16-year-old victim spoke of his fear that the shooting would cause an effect of enforced outing as parents find out their children are gay. Chen Langer, the most badly injured victim, who became outspoken after the shooting, committed suicide on 15 of June 2020 as a result of the long battle with after-shooting PTSD. He officially became a third victim of the shooting. Hagai Felician case Following a police investigation lasting nearly four years, three suspects were arrested. Their arrests were announced on 5 June 2013. A gag order was placed on the details of the investigation. The three suspects, all residents of Pardes Katz, a neighborhood in Bnei Brak, ranged in ages from 20 to 40. It was later announced that a prominent activist in the Israeli LGBT community had also been detained for questioning.Eli Senyor. Investigation into 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting, ynetnews.com; accessed 25 February 2014. The Jerusalem Post reported that the shooting was planned by two young men, one of whom believed his teenaged relative had been abused by an activist at the Bar- Noar center. After the shooting, the gunman and his accomplice fled into Tel Aviv. The pistol (a Tanfoglio 9mm) used by the killer was found by hikers in December 2012 and the suspects were arrested some months later.Ben Hartman. \\"LGBT center shooting: Revenge for sexual abuse of minor\\", jpost.com, 10 June 2013. On 11 June, the gag order was officially lifted. According to police, a few months before the killings, one of the suspects, then 15 years old, came to Bar-Noar struggling with his sexual identity. There he met with a veteran Bar-Noar figure, the fourth person to be arrested in the case. Hagai Felician, the teenager's relative, became aware that the teen had been seen a few times at Bar-Noar, and asked him what he was doing there. The teenager confirmed he had been going there, and that he was raped by the senior figure at the club. Felician allegedly decided to take matters into his own hands, and together with another suspect, Tarlan Hankishayev, and the state's witness, plotted to harm the activist. On the day of the shooting, Felician allegedly came to Bar- Noar looking for the activist. Unable to find him, Felician \\"lost it\\" and shot those present. On 23 June 2013, charges were dropped against the other two suspects. On 10 July 2013, Hagai Felician was indicted on two counts of murder. In February 2014, the prosecution's case against Hagai Felician collapsed after new information was uncovered that suggested that the state witness around whose testimony the case had been built had lied. Subsequently, the witness, who was identified in media reports as \\"Z\\" due to his identity being under gag order, was arrested on charges of fabricating evidence. On 26 February, Felician was released, although he was remanded to house arrest until 2 April.Bar Noar double murder suspect Hagai Felician released after collapse of state case On 9 March 2014, all charges against Felician were dropped.Charges dropped against gay youth club murder suspect, timesofisrael.com; accessed 26 March 2015. =Yaakov Felician rape case= On 24 June 2013, it was cleared for publication that Felician's brother, Yaakov, had been arrested on rape charges, and was suspected of raping a female attorney who had applied to serve as part of Hagai's defense team. Under police interrogation, Yaakov Felician claimed that the attorney had only filed a rape complaint after he did not hire her to serve on his brother's defense team.

He expressed his \\"shock and dismay\\", condemning the \\"shocking murder\\" and reminding Israeli citizens that \\"we are a democratic and tolerant country and we must respect every person as he is\\". Nitzan Horowitz, the only openly gay member of the Knesset at the time, condemned it as \\"the worst attack ever against the gay community in Israel [...] a blind attack against innocent youths. The Shas party said they were \\"shocked and bereaved, and denounce without reservation the murderous incident\\". Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, head of Israel's police force, called it \\"a serious and grave incident\\". Aharonovitch spoke of going to the crime scene, saying \\"it was a difficult sight\\". Opposition leader Tzipi Livni called it a \\"grave incident\\", saying \\"even if all the details surrounding the event are not yet clear, the hatred exists and must be dealt with\\". She said it should \\"awaken society to rid itself of prejudice\\" and \\"shake up society, and all the circles inherent in it, including the political establishment and the education system, and on this day deliver an unequivocal message against intolerance, incitement and violence, and to act against any manifestation of these\\". The Mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, said his city would still welcome members of the gay and lesbian community, saying they would fight for their rights to live. Tel Aviv's Head of Police, Shachar Ayalon, did not say the shooting was a hate crime. On 8 August, days after the event, Peres came to the crime scene at Bar-Noar to show support for the community and the deadly attack on it.\\"Netanyahu visits Tel Aviv gay center\\" , Yediot Ahronot, 8 August 2009; accessed 6 August 2009.Archived records; 16 August 2009. =Protest rally= A protest rally was held in Tel Aviv following the shooting, including lit candles.

He was also the author of numerous art- related books. Biography His father, August Ferdinand Pauli (1815-1904), was an apothecary and manufacturer. The family was descended from Lieutenant General Wilhelm Pauli (1730-1800). The original Pauli came from Italy under the sponsorship of Emperor Rudolf II, during the early part of the Thirty Years' War and later went to Sweden, where he was accepted into the nobility in 1625. Portrait of his wife Hanna, 1896 He originally studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts during the 1870s and 1880s, then made several study trips abroad, primarily to Paris and Italy. He later became a teacher at the Valand Academy in Gothenburg. In 1887, he married his fellow painter, Hanna Hirsch. In 1905, they moved into a manor house and studio called the \\"Villa Pauli\\", designed by Albin Brag, in , Nacka. He spent much of his time creating decorative paintings; including frescoes in the \\"Ostindiska huset\\" (East India House, which is now home to the G√∂teborgs stadsmuseum), the \\"S√∂dermalms l√§roverk\\" (which is now S√∂dra Latin, a highly selective secondary school), and at the √ñstra Real, another secondary school. At the Per Brahegymnasiet, in his hometown, he created murals in the Cubist style that were very controversial. Similar works may be found at the Stockholm City Hall and the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which features a dining area with his works called the \\"Restaurang Pauli\\". He also created some minor murals at the headquarters of the Handelsbanken and at Waldemarsudde (now a museum) for Prince Eugen. He was a member of the , a group of artists who were opposed to the teaching methods at the Royal Academy. In addition to painting, he wrote numerous historical/biographical works, including Ernst Josephson (1903 and 1914), Konstn√§rslif och om konst (1913), I Paris, nya konstens k√§lla (1915), V√§ggm√•leri (1920) and Prins Eugen (1925). He also wrote a memoir about his fellow artists in the opposition, I v√•r ungdom (1925) and stories of his travels, En m√•lares resa (1922). From 1917 to 1921, he published an art journal called FlammanSvensk uppslagsbok, Malm√∂ 1937 (often confused with a socialist newspaper of the same name).

The riot was chiefly directed by black residents against white-owned property in Harlem. It was one of six riots in the nation that year related to black and white tensions during World War II. The others took place in Detroit; Beaumont, Texas; Mobile, Alabama; and Los Angeles. In Harlem, Bandy had witnessed a black woman's arrest for disorderly conduct in a hotel and sought to have her released. According to the police, Bandy hit the officer, who shot the soldier as he was trying to flee from the scene. A crowd of about 3,000 people gathered at police headquarters, after a smaller crowd had followed Bandy and the officer to a hospital for treatment. When someone in the crowd at police headquarters incorrectly stated that Bandy had been killed, a riot ensued in the community that lasted for two days and resulted in six deaths and hundreds injured, with nearly 600 arrests. The riot had a pattern mostly of vandalism, theft, and property destruction of white-owned businesses in Harlem, resulting in monetary damages, rather than attacks on persons. New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia ultimately restored order in the borough on August 2 with the recruitment of several thousand officers and volunteer forces to contain the rioters. City units cleaned up and repaired buildings. The mayor also supplied food and goods afterward to compensate for the closed businesses. The underlying causes of the riot stemmed from resentment among black residents of Harlem of the disparity between the vaunted values of American democracy and the social and economic conditions they were forced to live under, including brutality and discriminatory treatment by the mostly white city police force. They resented the segregation of black troops serving with the United States, and wartime shortages created more difficult conditions in Harlem housing and supplies. African Americans suffered discriminatory practices in civil and private employment, and city services, which created tension as they tried to improve their lives. Bandy symbolized the Black soldiers who were segregated in the Army, even as the United States promoted the national fight for 'freedom.' Collins represented the white discrimination and suppression black residents had to deal with on a daily basis. The riot became a subject of art and literature: it inspired the \\"theatrical climax\\" of Ralph Ellison's novel Invisible Man, winner of the 1953 National Book Award, it frames the events recounted in James Baldwin's memoirs Notes of a Native Son, and it appears in artist William Johnson's painting Moon Over Harlem. Cause On Sunday, August 1, 1943, a white policeman attempted to arrest an African-American woman for disturbing the peace in the lobby of the Braddock Hotel. By the 1940s, the hotel, which had hosted show business celebrities in the 1920s, had become a location known for prostitution. The Army designated the area as a \\"raided premise\\", and a policeman was stationed in the lobby to prevent crime.Brandt 1996, p. 184 Various accounts detail how Marjorie (Margie) Polite, the African-American woman, became confrontational with James Collins, the white policeman. According to one, Polite checked into the hotel on August 1, but was dissatisfied and asked for another room. When she switched rooms and found the replacement did not have the shower and bath she wanted, Polite asked for a refund, which she received.Capeci 1977, p. 100 Afterward, however, she asked for return of a $1 tip ($ in 2014) that she gave to an elevator operator. The operator refused; Polite began to protest loudly, which caught the attention of Collins. According to another account, she became drunk at a party in one of the rooms, and confronted the officer as she attempted to leave.Brandt 1996, p. 185 After Collins told Polite to leave, she became verbally abusive of the officer and Collins arrested her on the grounds of disturbing the peace. Florine Roberts, the mother of Robert Bandy, a black soldier in the U.S. Army who was also present, observed the incident and asked for Polite's release. The official police report held that the soldier threatened Collins; in the report, Bandy and Mrs. Roberts then attacked Collins. Bandy hit the officer and, while attempting to flee, Collins shot Bandy in the shoulder with his revolver. In an interview with PM, the soldier said that he intervened when the officer pushed Polite. According to Bandy, Collins threw his nightstick at Bandy, which he caught. When Bandy hesitated after Collins asked for its return, Collins shot him.Lawrence 1947, pp. 242‚Äì243 Bandy's wound was superficial, but he was taken to Sydenham Hospital for treatment. Crowds quickly gathered around Bandy as he entered the hospital, and also around the hotel and police headquarters, where a crowd of 3,000 amassed by 9:00 pm.Capeci 1977, p. 101Lawrence 1947, p. 243 The crowds combined and grew tense, as rumors that an African-American soldier had been shot soon turned to rumors that an African-American soldier had been killed. Riot At 10:30 pm, the crowd became violent after an individual threw a bottle off a roof into the crowd aggregated about the hospital. The crowd dispersed into groups containing between 50‚Äì100 members. The groups first broke windows of white businesses as they traveled through Harlem: if the mob was told the business was owned by blacks, they left it alone. If it was owned by whites, the store would be looted and vandalized. Rioters broke streetlights and threw white mannequins onto the ground.Brandt 1996, p. 188 In grocery stores, the rioters took war-scarce items, such as coffee and sugar; clothing, and liquor; and furniture stores were also looted. Estimates put the total monetary damage between $250,000‚Äì$5,000,000, which included 1,485 stores burglarized and 4,495 windows broken.Capeci 1977, p. 102Brandt 1996, p. 207 When Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia was informed of the situation at 9:00 pm, he met with police and visited the riot district with black authority figures such as Max Yergan and Hope Stevens.Capeci 1977, p. 103 La Guardia ordered all unoccupied officers into the region: in addition to the 6,000 city and military police, 1,500 volunteers were called on to help control the riot, with an additional 8,000 guardsmen \\"on standby\\".Brandt 1996, p. 190Capeci 1977, p. 104 Traffic was directed around Harlem to contain the riot. After he returned from the tour, the mayor made the first of a series of radio announcements that urged Harlemites to return home. Soon after, he met with Walter Francis White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to discuss the appropriate action; White suggested that black leaders again visit the district to spread the message of order. Just after 2:00 A.M, the mayor instructed all taverns to close. Aftermath The riot ended on the night of August 2. Cleanup efforts started that day; the New York City Department of Sanitation worked to clean the area for three days and the New York City Departments of Buildings and Housing boarded windows. The city assigned a police escort for all department workers.Brandt 1996, p. 206 The Red Cross gave Harlemites lemonade and crullers, and the mayor organized various hospitals to handle an influx of injured patients.Capeci 1977, pp. 105‚Äì106 By August 4, traffic had resumed through the borough, and taverns reopened the next day. La Guardia had food delivered to the residents of Harlem, and on August 6, food supplies returned to normal levels.Capeci 1977, p. 107 Overall, six people died and nearly 700 were injured. Six hundred men and women were arrested in connection with the riot. Underlying issues In a piece for the Berkeley Journal of Sociology, academic L. Alex Swan attributes the riot to a disparity between the promoted values of American democracy and the conditions of black citizens, in both the North and the South.Swan 1971, p. 77 Swan cites, for example, that the segregation of blacks in the armed forces continued while the United States fought for \\"freedom.\\"Swan 1971, p. 79 Charles Lawrence of Fisk University described \\"resentment of status given Negro members of the armed forces\\" as \\"perhaps the greatest single psychological factor in the making of the Harlem riot\\", as Bandy came to represent black soldiers and Collins came to represent white suppression.Lawrence 1947, p. 244 When Franklin D. Roosevelt gave his Four Freedoms speech, calling for freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear for people \\"everywhere in the world\\", many African Americans felt they never had such freedoms themselves. They became willing to fight for them domestically.Swan 1971, p. 78 Michael Harrington described the black resident of Harlem as a \\"second-class citizen in his own neighborhood\\". Black soldiers also enlisted from the South, where blacks suffered under Jim Crow and most had been disenfranchised since the turn of the century, excluded from the political system altogether. After the Harlem Riot of 1935 caused widespread destruction, La Guardia ordered a commission to pinpoint its underlying causes. He appointed the historian E. Franklin Frazier as head of the commission, who wrote that \\"economic and social forces created a state of emotional tension which sought release upon the slightest provocation\\". The report listed several \\"economic and social forces\\" that worked against blacks, including discrimination in employment and city services, overcrowding in housing, and police brutality. Specifically, it criticized New York City Police Commissioner Lewis Joseph Valentine and New York City Hospitals Commissioner Sigismund S. Goldwater, both of whom responded with criticisms of the report. Conflicted, La Guardia asked academic Alain LeRoy Locke to analyze both accounts and assess the situation. Locke wrote confidentially to La Guardia that Valentine was blameworthy and listed several areas for immediate improvement, such as health and education. Publicly, Locke published an article in the Survey Graphic which blamed the 1935 riot on the state of affairs in New York that La Guardia inherited.Capeci 1977, pp. 5‚Äì7 Communally, conditions for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued to discriminate against blacks.Capeci 1977, p. 7Lawrence 1947, pp. 243‚Äì244 Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.Swan 1971, p. 82 Cultural depictions William Johnson depicted the riot in his 1943‚Äì1944 painting Moon Over Harlem. Several authors and artists have depicted the event in their respective works. African-American novelist James Baldwin wrote of the riot, which occurred on the same day as his father's funeral and his nineteenth birthday, in Notes of a Native Son. \\"It seemed to me\\", Baldwin wrote, \\"that God himself had devised, to mark my father's end, the most sustained and brutally dissonant of codas\\". In a commentary piece for The New York Times, Langston Hughes called the chapter \\"superb\\", and particularly quoted Baldwin's observation that \\"to smash something is the ghetto's chronic need\\". Hughes wrote \\"The Ballad of Margie Polite\\", a poem on the riot published in New York Amsterdam News. According to Laurie Leach in her 2007 article published in Studies in the Literary Imagination, the poem \\"seems to honor rather than censure Polite for her role as a catalyst\\" . Ralph Ellison drew upon his experiences covering the riot for the New York Post as inspiration for the \\"theatrical climax\\" of Invisible Man, winner of the 1953 National Book Award. Artist William Johnson used images taken from news reports as inspiration for his 1943‚Äì1944 painting Moon Over Harlem. According to critic Richard Powell, writing in 1991, after \\"[stripping them] of their melodramatic quality\\", Johnson \\"creates in their place a kind of expressive distortion and calculated rawness.\\" Powell notes that the central figure in Moon Over Harlem, an upside-down African American woman harassed by three officers, represents \\"an oppressed and debased community, whose frustrations and self-destruction prompted an authoritative abuse of power\\".

Dwan continued to work as a lighterman, but with severance at the docks, he decided to work for himself and withdrew from lighterage and rowing at the same time. For a while he worked on the building of the Thames Barrier, and then on pleasure boats on the River Thames. He then went into business with Bill Ludgrove and set up their own company Thames Cruises.

The disaster was found by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch to have been caused by the poor visibility from each ship's wheelhouse, the fact that both vessels were using the centre of the river, and that no clear instructions were given to the look-out at the bow of the Bowbelle.

Mitchell was on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most wanted list for the Stopwatch Gang's bank robberies across the United States. Background Mitchell, working with fellow Canadians Stephen Reid, and Lionel Wright stole approximately $15 million‚Äîmainly in the 1970s and 1980s‚Äîfrom more than 140 banks and other sites across Canada and the U.S. The Stopwatch Gang, which was famous for its speedy heists, was named for a stopwatch Reid wore around his neck. They successfully completed a $750,000 gold heist in 1974 from the Ottawa airport. They were arrested after that robbery and all escaped from prison by 1979. They were known for non-violent methods and politeness to victims. The gang's story is recorded in several television documentaries and books, including Mitchell's autobiography, This Bank Robber's Life, which he wrote from prison. He escaped from prison three times, one of the times he purposely induced heart-attack related symptoms by consuming enough nicotine from cigarettes; he was taken to hospital, having gang members pick him up in a stolen ambulance. The gang's biggest heist took place at a Bank of America branch in San Diego on September 23, 1980, when the US$283,000 they stole set a San Diego record. On October 31, 1980, FBI agents arrested Wright and Mitchell in the Sedona, Arizona area near Slide Rock State Park. Wright and Mitchell had a hideout in Forest Houses in Oak Creek Canyon and Mitchell rented a house about three miles north. Mitchell later moved to the Philippines for 15 years, where he remarried and had a son. During that time, he often flew back to the United States. While at large, Mitchell's case was featured on Unsolved Mysteries. On November 23, 1990, Mitchell was added to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's most wanted list. Finally, on February 22, 1994, he was arrested just after a solo robbery in Southaven, Mississippi, convicted of bank robbery, and sentenced to a 65-year prison sentence. Mitchell was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2006, and died on January 14, 2007, in the Federal Medical Center in Butner, N.C. in the prison hospital at the age of 64.

In algebraic geometry, the prime spectrum of the semigroup algebra of such a semigroup is, by definition, an affine toric variety; thus, the lemma says an affine toric variety is indeed an algebraic variety. The lemma is named after the German mathematician Paul Gordan (1837‚Äì1912).  Proof  There are topological and algebraic proofs. = Topological proof = Let \\\\sigma be the cone as given in the lemma. Let u_1, \\\\dots, u_r be the integral vectors so that \\\\sigma = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\mid \\\\langle u_i, x \\\\rangle \\\\ge 0, 1 \\\\le i \\\\le r \\\\\\\\}. Then the u_i's generate the dual cone \\\\sigma^{\\\\vee}; indeed, writing C for the cone generated by u_i's, we have: \\\\sigma \\\\subset C^{\\\\vee}, which must be the equality. Now, if x is in the semigroup :S_\\\\sigma = \\\\sigma^\\\\vee \\\\cap \\\\mathbb{Z}^d, then it can be written as :x = \\\\sum_i n_i u_i + \\\\sum_i r_i u_i where n_i are nonnegative integers and 0 \\\\le r_i \\\\le 1. But since x and the first sum on the right-hand side are integral, the second sum is also integral and thus there can only be finitely many possibilities for the second sum (the topological reason). Hence, S_{\\\\sigma} is finitely generated. = Algebraic proof = The proof is based on a fact that a semigroup S is finitely generated if and only if its semigroup algebra \\\\mathbb{C}[S] is finitely generated algebra over \\\\mathbb{C}. To prove Gordan's lemma, by induction (cf. the proof above), it is enough to prove the statement: for any unital subsemigroup S of \\\\mathbb{Z}^d, : If S is finitely generated, then S^+ = S \\\\cap \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\mid \\\\langle x, v \\\\rangle \\\\ge 0 \\\\\\\\}, v an integral vector, is finitely generated. Put A = \\\\mathbb{C}[S], which has a basis \\\\chi^a, \\\\, a \\\\in S. It has \\\\mathbb{Z}-grading given by :A_n = \\\\operatorname{span} \\\\\\\\{ \\\\chi^a \\\\mid a \\\\in S, \\\\langle a, v \\\\rangle = n \\\\\\\\}. By assumption, A is finitely generated and thus is Noetherian. It follows from the algebraic lemma below that \\\\mathbb{C}[S^+] = \\\\oplus_0^\\\\infty A_n is a finitely generated algebra over A_0. Now, the semigroup S_0 = S \\\\cap \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\mid \\\\langle x, v \\\\rangle = 0 \\\\\\\\} is the image of S under a linear projection, thus finitely generated and so A_0 = \\\\mathbb{C}[S_0] is finitely generated. Hence, S^+ is finitely generated then. Lemma: Let A be a \\\\mathbb{Z}-graded ring. If A is a Noetherian ring, then A^+ = \\\\oplus_0^{\\\\infty} A_n is a finitely generated A_0-algebra. Proof: Let I be the ideal of A generated by all homogeneous elements of A of positive degree. Since A is Noetherian, I is actually generated by finitely many f_i's, homogeneous of positive degree. If f is homogeneous of positive degree, then we can write f = \\\\sum_i g_i f_i with g_i homogeneous. If f has sufficiently large degree, then each g_i has degree positive and strictly less than that of f. Also, each degree piece A_n is a finitely generated A_0-module. (Proof: Let N_i be an increasing chain of finitely generated submodules of A_n with union A_n. Then the chain of the ideals N_i A stabilizes in finite steps; so does the chain N_i = N_i A \\\\cap A_n.) Thus, by induction on degree, we see A^+ is a finitely generated A_0-algebra.

Kispest, formerly a suburb was administratively attached to Budapest in 1950 along with several other settlements of Greater Budapest. Wekerle estate was named after S√°ndor Wekerle, then Hungarian prime minister, who supported the idea of building comfortable, human-scale housing estates for government employees, and was instrumental in launching the project of creating a garden city habitat. Location The Wekerle estate lies on a flat area on the W-NW part of Kispest. Highest point is a small, artificial knoll on K√≥s K√°roly Square. The estate is bounded by the following streets: Nagyk≈ër√∂si St., Hat√°r St., Ady Endre St., Bercs√©nyi St. History=Background= During the last quarter of the 19th century, Greater Budapest's population grew almost threefold to nearly a million. Commercial property development (although exceptionally fast) could not keep up with the demand for lodging, thus, resulting in government intervention to fund housing projects for government employees. =The Garden city movement in Central Europe= Commercial developers built densely packed large, multi-story apartment houses on narrow streets for new inhabitants of Budapest. Most of these people were coming from villages and small towns, and did not feel comfortable in a big, crowded city without greenery and fresh air. J√≥zsef Fleischl, a popular architect at the time, proposed building planned housing estates, similar to the ideas of the Ebenezer Howard's Garden city movement. The government of S√°ndor Wekerle, then prime minister of Hungary supported these plans and invited tenders to implement such a housing estate. Many successful architects of the time submitted \\"conception plans\\" for one or two- story houses, ranging from duplexes to 12-flat apartment houses. All designs followed the \\"Transylvanian style\\" established by K√°roly K√≥s with high roofs and generous use of wooden structures (e.g. staircases). All the houses provided spacious gardens and the street layout was envisioned with comfortable, tree-lined avenues. Wekerle estate K√≥s K. square =Construction= Construction began in 1908, and until 1925 when the Great Depression forced to abandon further development, 1007 houses were built containing 4412 apartments. One-story buildings placed along smaller streets had 2,3 or 4 individual apartments, and two-storey 6,8, and 12-apartment houses lined wider streets, forming a unique \\"spider web\\" street layout, centered on a round square with a large park in the middle. K√≥s K√°roly Square, Wekerle estate Between 1911 and 1914, four schools and two kindergartens were completed with 48 classrooms, 18 kindergarten rooms and 2 gymnasiums. The police headquarters and barracks for mounted police were finished in 1912. Priority was given to government employees among rent applicants, but the estate, being very popular from the beginning already had 25% of its population from the privately employed, mostly workers of nearby factories. According to the government's concept (most of the renters would be young, often unmarried clerks and low-level government officials), the majority of the houses include small apartments. The most common arrangement is the 45 m2 two-room apartment in 12-apartment complexes. 3-room 59 m2 apartments are also common. Larger units are rare, there are a few larger apartments in the 2-storey buildings on the central square. There's a handful of distinct, almost villa-like housings with larger apartments, referred popularly as \\"headmaster's house\\" or \\"doctor's apartment\\", the name probably stemming from their originally intended function. The main, central square was very important for the concept of \\"building for the community\\", thus planning of the main square was a separate project, won by K√°roly K√≥s one of the star architects of the period. He designed the arrangement with the radial street layout and also one of the trademark wooden gates (the eastern one). Many of the famed architects of the era (e.g. Lajos Schodits, B√©la Eberling, Dezs≈ë Zrumeczky, Gyula W√§lder and D√©nes Gy√∂rgyi) designed houses on the square. =Garden city layout= Fifty thousand trees were planted during the construction, mainly along the spacious avenues. The estate had its own gardening service, who not only took care of the many plants, flowers and trees of the community spaces, but also helped renters to groom their own gardens as well. Four fruit trees were planted for each apartment (altogether 16.000), and thanks to the favorable sandy soil and to the care of the new dwellers, various kinds of drupes bloomed. It was noted that in 1917 redcurrant harvest was so rich that renters could earn almost four times the yearly rent just by selling their fruits. The estate today Thanks to the garden city atmosphere, the estate remains very popular up to today. Contemporary inhabitants value the multitude of century-old trees, the greenery and spacious (by big city standards) gardens. In its early days, Wekerle spawned co-operatives and community associations, but under the Communist regime, the community association was closed and the estate began to decay. Now the community association is active again and there has been a renaissance of community action, environmental ventures and volunteering by residents. The clever layout of streets also makes it very quiet as the radial main streets route vehicular traffic efficiently onto the heavily used, multiple-lane streets surrounding the area. The exterior of one of the buildings on the central K√≥s K√°roly Square is used as the central location of the popular Hungarian daily soap opera \\"Bar√°tok k√∂zt\\".

On Sunday, August 2, 2009, while carrying fifteen people over Papua, the aircraft went missing en route.The JakartaPost Its wreckage was found a few miles from Oksibil two days later. All 12 passengers and 3 crew members were killed in the accident. Indonesian Investigation Agency, NTSC released the final report and concluded that the cause of the crash was controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). The pilots did not maintain visual flight rules while flying below lowest safe altitude, thus impacting terrain. NTSC stated that the crash was \\"not survivable\\". Flight Merpati Flight 9760 took off at 10:15 (local time) with an estimated time of arrival at Oksibil of 11:05. It was the second flight using the same aircraft with the first flight departed at 06.50 A.M local time. The flight was planned to use Visual Flight Rules instead of Instrument Flight Rules. Fuel was sufficient for at least 2 hours and 50 minutes. Flight crews did not report any problems related to the aircraft as the plane took off from Sentani Airport. But then, at 10:28, the plane had lost contact.AFP Control Tower frantically tried to contact the missing plane, but no response was received. The plane later missed the scheduled arrival. An INCERFA was later declared by the tower. The plane still missing on 13:05 P.M. At this point, the plane should have run out of fuel. A search team was assembled by Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS). Two days later the wreckage of the plane found at the elevation of . All fifteen people on board were fatally injured. The plane was found disintegrated due to massive impact force when it hit terrain. The impact force was so big that no one could survive the crash. The plane had apparently crashed in a good weather. Another aircraft in the vicinity informed Flight 9760 that the weather around Oksibil Airport was partly cloudy. The aircraft, a DHC-6-300 with tail number PK-NVC was a 30-year-old airframe and was not equipped with a flight data recorder. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 registered as PK-NVC with serial number 626. The aircraft was manufactured in 1979 and was acquired in 2007. It has over 30,000 flying hours and was equipped with a turbo propeller from Pratt & Whitney Canada, manufactured by Hartzell. Passengers and crew Fifteen people were aboard the doomed flight, including three crew and twelve passengers. All of them were Indonesian. The passengers consisted of ten adults and two infants, while the crews consisted of two pilots and one flight engineer. The Captain, Qodryanova, had logged 8,387 hours of flying experience. The First Officer had logged in 1,207 hours of flying experience. Investigation The wreckage of Flight 9760 after the crash The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) opened an investigation into the accident. The cause was found to be controlled flight into terrain. In the report, Merpati Nusantara Airlines were stated not to have fully co-operated with the NTSC as they had not provided the investigators full details of the crew's line checks and training undertaken. The National Transportation Safety Committee found that there were no maintenance defects found on the aircraft. The aircraft was also loaded with cargo within limit, ruled out overloading. The weather in the area of the flight was reported by local villagers to have been mostly clear in the valleys, with cloud on the mountains and slopes. About 25 minutes prior to the accident, the crews contacted with another crew from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft owned by Indonesian Air Force which flying from Oksibil to Sentani, and said that they were 100 miles from Jayapura, en route to Oksibil. The pilot of the Hercules informed the crew of Flight 9760 that over Oksibil the cloud base was low, with cloud tops between . As the cloud tops to , the Hercules pilot informed that the crew of Flight 9760 had to detour via Kiriwok to avoid the cloud. The aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder (FDR). Indonesian regulations did not require a FDR to be fitted to the Twin Otter aircraft. However, the aircraft was equipped with a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Indonesian Civil Aviation regulations required that a serviceable CVR was to be fitted to the Twin Otter aircraft. Search and Rescue personnel recovered the CVR from the wreckage and handed it over to NTSC investigators. The outer box had minor damage, but the contents were undamaged. About 20 minutes before the impact, the pilots were discussing the area they were flying over, and made comments about the local inhabitants. Fifteen minutes before impact, the pilot in command said to the copilot \\"Let's fly direct Oksibil\\". The copilot asked \\"Direct brother?\\" The PIC replied \\"Direct, the sky is blue over there and the layer of the cloud is 10,000 feet\\". One minute later the copilot gave a position report to ATC stating: One two three zero traffic, Merpati nine seven six zero delay, Sentani to Oksibil, position approaching Melam maintain nine thousand five hundred, estimate Abmisibil zero two zero one, arrival zero two zero eight. This transmission was blocked by other transmissions and there was no evidence on recorded communications that the position report was acknowledged by ATC. During the 20 minutes before the impact there was no discussion about aircraft problems or navigation difficulties. However, ten minutes before impact the pilot in command mentioned climbing to , and stated \\"if we cannot go visual I will turn left\\". The cockpit conversations did not exhibit any signs of stress or concern until 2 minutes before the impact, when the copilot mentioned haze and asked the pilot in command if he could see. Fifty seconds before impact, the copilot expressed further concern and asked about the pilot in command‚Äôs intentions, and the pilot in command said \\"climb, to the left\\". Forty-two seconds before impact the copilot asked if it was safe on the left. The copilot became increasingly uncertain about the safety of the flight, specifically mentioning visibility and speed. From the recorded sounds, it is apparent that 13 seconds before impact, engine power was increased symmetrically to a high power setting. From the pilots‚Äô comments and the wreckage trail, the investigation determined that the aircraft was banking left at the time of impact. The investigation was unable to determine if the aircraft reached 10,000 feet.

Always wanting to hang out with the older crowd, she meets and falls in love with Chris, a 19-year-old guy who was rejected by his family. He is now hoping to attend college and go into forestry once he is out of the military reserve force. When her recently divorced and overly protective mother, Donna, finds out about their relationship, she is outraged, forbidding her from ever seeing him again.

He demanded removal of Jews from Polish cities and liquidation of Polish intelligentsia; only 150.000 Kashubs were suitable for Reich citizenship after a probation period.

Early life Oren Harari was born to Herbert and Rut Harari in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 30, 1949. His family moved to San Diego in 1965, where Harari later earned his B.S. degree from San Diego State University and then his doctorate in industrial psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1978. Career Soon after obtaining his degree, Harari began teaching at the University of San Francisco. In addition to teaching, Harari worked with Tom Peters to begin lecturing about leadership and business strategy. In 1989, Harari travelled to Africa for 6 months to live and work. It was this experience that fueled his first book titled Lessons from South Africa, which provided instructions for companies and governments to drive growth in developing countries.http://www.harari.com/ In the 1990s, Harari was teaching global and strategic management at University of San Francisco when he met Nicholas Imperato, his co-author of the book Jumping the Curve: Innovation and Strategic Choice in an Age of Transition. This was a book on business strategy that was later named by Library Journal as one of the best books of 1994. In 1996, Harari launched an independent career of writing and speaking with Leading Authorities, Inc., a Washington, D.C. based lecture agency and publisher. Here, Harari became one of the firm's most desired public speakers. It was one year later when his third book, Leapfrogging the Competition: Five Giant Steps to Becoming a Market Leader, was rated as one of the Top Ten business books of 1997 by Management General. Harari became a columnist for the American Management Association's monthly magazine, Management Review, where he wrote the column Harari at Large. One of his most popular articles was about the leadership principles of Colin Powell. The high demand for reprints as well as a personal phone call of praise from Powell led to a book project.

Serving Christian IV, he was commander of the Danish-Scottish force in the Battle of Stralsund in 1628, defending the besieged town of Stralsund against Wallenstein's imperial army. When Christian was forced into a peace with Wallenstein in 1629, Holk entered the latter's service. In 1632, he was given a cavalry command. His unit, referred to as \\"Holk's Horse\\", was known for their fierce attitude not only in battle, but also in pillage and rape - \\"notorious even in an age of atrocities\\". He took part in the devastation and looting of the Electorate of Saxony, and faced Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden's cavalry in the Battle of L√ºtzen.

He briefly served as a governor in the Battle of Stralsund and as an admiral in the Torstenson War. Biography Contemporary broadsheet describing the Battle of Stralsund (1628). Seaton was the defending governor in June and in July. The leaflet was drawn during the battle, when Seaton's predecessor Heinrich Holk (\\"Obrist Holky\\") was still in command, but mentions the arrival of Seaton's regiment (\\"1,200 Schotten\\"). Neither the place nor the date of Alexander Seaton's birth are recorded. Though his parents remain unknown, it has been proposed that either Alexander Seton of Lathrisk or George Seton of Cariston be his father. Alexander Seaton entered the service of Christian IV of Denmark, and advanced to the rank of a captain of infantry on 8 April 1626. Upon request by the Danish king, the Scottish Privy Council allowed Seaton to levy 500 Scottish soldiers on 30 June. On 28 February 1627, he advanced to the rank of a lieutenant colonel. In September, he was wounded in battle near Oldenburg, while securing Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar's rear against Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly's forces during the Battle of Heiligenhafen.The battle took place between 23 and 27 September. A Danish force of 6,000 troops, commanded by Baden, Mitzlaff and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, landed at Heiligenhafen and was intercepted by imperial forces commanded by Schlick. Of the Danish troops, 1,000 were killed and 4,000 surrendered, only 1,000 succeeded in boarding vessels and escape with Saxe-Weimar. Among these were the surviving Scots.

He succeeded the Danish-German mercenary Heinrich Holk as Stralsund's governor.Mackillop (2003), pp.16-17 During the time he was in command, the town withstood the siege of Albrecht von Wallenstein's imperial army. He was succeeded as the governor in July by Alexander Leslie, a Scot in Swedish service who arrived with a contingent of Scots, Swedes and Germans.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), pp.47-51 Wallenstein lifted the siege on 4 August,Heitz (1995), p.219 forced to accept his first check in the Thirty Years' War.Heckel (1983), p.143 Seaton did not stay with his regiment when it entered Swedish service, and instead joined the Norwegian infantry as a captain in 1628 - having left Mackay's troops as a lieutenant colonel. For the next 17 years, no records of Seaton's life are known. By 1645, he had advanced to the rank of a colonel in the Norwegian army and navy again. In 1645, Seaton took over eight ships of the Danish navy to fight Sweden as an admiral - the last appointment of a British in Christian IV's service.Murdoch (2000), p.199 With these ships, he took part in the \\"Norwegian response\\" by attacking Gothenburg (G√∂teborg) from the sea.Mackillop (2003), p.20Murdoch (2000), p.237 Seaton's assault took place in August,Murdoch (2000), p.236 just before the Treaty of Br√∂msebro ended the Danish-Swedish war in favour of Sweden on 13/23 August 1645.In the 17th century, the Julian calendar was used in the region, which then was ten days late compared to the Gregorian calendar; 13 August - Julian, 23 August - Gregorian.Theologische Realenzyklop√§die I, p.182Engels (2001), p.297 The last record of Seaton is of 19 April 1649, when he was a colonel in the Norwegian army.

It is part of the Illinois Community College System (ICCS). History Rend Lake College was founded in 1955 as Mt. Vernon Community College to allow students from High School District No. 201 the opportunity to receive post-secondary education similar to university curriculum. Authorized by the Illinois General Assembly and signed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner, Jr. in 1961, the legislation enacted created the Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE). The IBHE was tasked by statute with formulating a Master Plan for Higher Education in the state of Illinois. In July 1964 the higher education master plan was published by the IBHE, which led to the Junior College Act of 1965. Soon thereafter, the institution was officially renamed Rend Lake College when it was organized December 20, 1966. The Mt. Vernon Township High School and its faculty served as the initial facilities for the college when it began in 1967. The college began with a staff of 29 full-time and eight part-time faculty members, two full-time administrators and a librarian. Soon after its organization, the RLC Board of Trustees selected a site near Ina, Illinois, located between Interstate 57 and Rend Lake, and began planning a new campus. Voters approved a bond issue of $3.1 million in 1967, to provide for the districts local share of the $9.5 million total cost. Groundbreaking ceremonies for construction were held March 27, 1969, coinciding with the day the college received word of its first North Central Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation. The first five buildings of the campus, including Academic, Science, Gymnasium, the South Oasis and Maintenance buildings were ready for occupancy by August 1970, with classes beginning that fall. Phase II and III construction, which included five more buildings began in the Spring of 1971. Phase II and III construction were complete by 1975, which led to RLC becoming the first community college in Illinois to complete its entire facilities master plan. Major remodeling of the Administration Building took place during 1999-2000 and nearly doubled its size while centralizing almost all student service functions in one building. In 2002, off-campus changes occurred with the addition of the Rend Lake College MarketPlace in Mt. Vernon and the Rend Lake College Murphy-Wall Pinckneyville Campus. In Fall 2005, the Applied Science Center opened on the southwest corner of campus. This facility houses the Agricultural Business, Agricultural Production, Agricultural Mechanics, Heavy Equipment and Diesel Technology programs. On August 7, 2008, RLC broke ground on the new Coal Mining Training Center, a training facility located next to the Mark Kern Applied Science Center. The college received $1.07 million in grant funding from Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity for the construction of the facility, alongside a $1.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor to train students in the mining industry. One year later on August 11, 2009, the new facility held its first open house to the public. Campus Rend Lake College currently has its main campus in Ina, Illinois. A second learning center for classes, known as the RLC Murphy-Wall Pinckneyville Campus was opened in Pinckneyville, Illinois. In addition to RLC's two credit learning campuses, the college holds non-credit classes at its RLC Marketplace location. Located in Mt. Vernon, Illinois, the RLC Marketplace houses shops and businesses as a part of RLC curriculum. In addition to the degrees it offers at its two campuses, Rend Lake College currently operates two satellite campuses at local correctional facilities under contract with the Illinois Department of Corrections. RLC holds vocational and rehabilitative classes at IDOC facilities, which are closed to the public. Academics and demographics Rend Lake College is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) to offer certificates, diplomas and associate degrees. It received the maximum ten-year accreditation approval by the Higher Learning Commission of the NCA during its last review. Rend Lake College partners with area four-year colleges and universities, such as Southern Illinous University, Carbondale, Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and the Western Illinois University as a part of the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide transfer agreement which ensures general education credits are transferable among more than 100 participating college or universities in Illinois. In addition to the IAI, RLC offers students \\"two-plus-two\\" programs that guarantee students that the courses completed at the college will transfer to their majors at four-year baccalaureate institutions. There are seven primary divisions at Rend Lake College: Advanced Technology, Math/Science/Education, Allied Health, Health & P.E., Applied Science, Skills Center, Liberal Arts, and Special Programs. The divisions offer a total of 43 associate degree programs, and 80 certificate programs. =Enrollment= As of the Fall, 2015 semester, enrollment at RLC was 2,295, of which 1,198 were enrolled full-time, and 1,105 were enrolled part-time. During the prior fall semester in 2014, student head count at the college was at 2,970 (1,367 full- time, 1,603 part-time). In addition, dual-credit enrollees obtaining college credit while attending high school stood at 3,014 (duplicated) students in the 2015‚Äì16 school year. The student body was about 42% male, 58% female (960-1335). 91.3% of the student population was Caucasian, 6.4% African- American, 1.0% Hispanic, 0.8% Asian, and 0.4% all other races. =Libraries= Rend Lake College provides a library within its Learning Resources Center at its main Ina, Illinois Campus. The library has 21,000 volumes, and 145 periodical and newspaper titles alongside online resources and a media learning area. It has facilities for study, research, leisure reading, class preparation, and wireless Internet access for students. Endowment The Rend Lake College Foundation, an Illinois registered not-for-profit organization, is a separate but cooperative entity alongside Rend Lake College. The goal of the foundation is to support Rend Lake College activities through fundraising and endowment management. Through a combination of fundraising events, investment, and donations, the foundation's endowment grew from $1.3 million in 1997, to $4.9 million in 2007. In 2007, the Foundation began is \\"Friends of the Theater\\" campaign. the campaign set out to raise $50,000, one-quarter of the $200,000 needed to make a theatre renovation requested by the school. The campaign raised $72,700 by mid-March 2008. The $282,000 renovation was completed to the theater by the end of March 2009. The renovations included wider seats, wall-to-wall carpeting, acoustic wall treatments and handicapped- accessible seating. The foundation also assists the school by providing scholarships for students. A recent scholarship drive between local business and the foundation raised $44,000 for local area high school students. Student life=Academic clubs= RLC has an active student population, with over 25 registered student clubs involved in academic, competitive, and cultural-based activities. The RLC College Bowl, an academic club, competes with other schools in the Southern Illinois Collegiate Common Market (SICCM) conference. Having won the state championships several years in a row, the College Bowl team recently went to the Illinois state academic finals after being undefeated for the entire 2008-2009 season. In addition, the campus has an active chapter of Phi Theta Kappa Œ¶ŒòŒö the international honor society for two-year colleges and academic programs. =Student athletics= Rend Land College fields teams known as the Warriors which compete in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) in the following sports: Men's Intercollegiate Sports * Baseball * Basketball * Golf Women's Intercollegiate Sports * Basketball * Golf * Softball * Tennis * Volleyball The Warriors were one of the dominant programs of the early 21st Century in men's cross country, winning the NJCAA Division II championship in 2001-03 and the Division I title in 2006 & 2009, and hosted the 2007 and 2012 NJCAA Division I Championships. Rend Lake was also the 2008 NJCAA Indoor Track and Field National Champion Rend Lake recorded 5 national champions in men's cross-country: Ian Hornabrook (2001 and 2002), Ben Cheruiyot (2007), and Stephen Sambu (2008 and 2009) and a number of other individual champions in track, along with numerous All- Americans in both cross-country and track. However, both the track and cross- country programs were suspended effective March 10, 2015 due to high travel costs and the inability to find nearby competitors. In other sports, the Warriors won the NJCAA Division II title in men's basketball in 2013 and qualified for the national championships in women's golf 11 times between 2000 and 2012, with a best finish of 4th place in 2005. Rend Lake formerly had a wrestling program, but that was suspended on May 7, 2013 due to a lack of funding from the state, high costs of running the program, and the inability to find nearby community colleges that also offered wrestling. =Cultural activities= The Rend Lake College Cultural Events Committee is a campus organization dedicated to bringing artists in multiple disciplines to both the college and the surrounding area. The main campus also houses an active Theater, which hosts numerous student-organized productions throughout the year.

The concept of the infomediary was first suggested by former McKinsey consultant John Hagel III and former Harvard Business School professor Jeffrey Rayport in their article The Coming Battle for Customer Information. The concept was explored in greater depth in Hagel's book (co- authored with McKinsey partner Marc Singer) Net Worth: Shaping Markets When Customers Make the Rules. Infomediaries operate on the assumption that personal information is the property of the individual described, not necessarily the property of the one who gathers it. The infomediary business model recognizes that there is value in this personal data and the infomediary seeks to act as a trusted agent, providing the opportunity and means for clients to monetize and profit from their own information profiles. One of the first focused implementations of the infomediary concept was an online advertising company called AllAdvantage launched in 1999. While that company did not survive the bursting of the \\"dot-com bubble,\\" in more recent years there has been renewed interest in the infomediary concept, with entrepreneurs and investors building companies to identify and leverage the market value of consumers' information. In the policy realm, a related concept known as the \\"information fiduciary\\" has been proposed by legal scholar Jack Balkin in which a set of legal and ethical obligations apply directly to the companies who hold data, rather than relying on an independent trusted third- party.Information Fiduciaries and the First Amendment 49 U.C.

It uses a modern graphical style, reflecting the production's break with the past. The 1970 Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production of A Midsummer Night's Dream was directed by Peter Brook, and is often known simply as Peter Brook's Dream. It opened in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon and then moved to the Aldwych Theatre in London's West End in 1971. It was taken on a world tour in 1972‚Äì1973. Brook's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream for the RSC is often described as one of the 20th century's most influential productions of Shakespeare, as it rejected many traditional ideas about the staging of classic drama. Concept Shakespeare's play is set in Athens and a fairy-inhabited forest nearby. Brook's aim was to reject the 19th-century traditions of realism and illusionism in the theatre, and focus instead on locating the play in \\"the heightened realm of metaphor\\".Gary Jay Williams, Our Moonlight Revels, (University of Iowa Press, 1997), 225. He also wanted to liberate the play from encrusted \\"bad tradition\\" so that the actors could feel that they were encountering the text for the first time.Brook, quoted by R.A. Foakes, ed. A Midsummer Night's Dream (Cambridge UP, 1984), 22‚Äì3. As such, he avoided any realist scenery or props. Instead, the set, designed by Sally Jacobs, was a simple white box, with no ceiling and two doors. In Stratford, black drapes were hung above the box to hide the stage machinery; on tour, Brook decided to remove them, leaving stagehands and lighting technicians visible.Williams, 224. The purpose of this was to return the stage to the simplicity of the Elizabethan theatre, in which there was little scenery and the sense of location was generated by the poet's words. However, this approach was blended with modern elements: the trees of the forest were represented by giant slinky toys, and Titania's bower was a huge red feather.Williams, 224-5; Holland, 108. The fairy magic was represented by circus tricks. For example, the fairies entered on trapeze bars, and the love potion that Puck fetches was a spinning plate on a rod, which Puck handed to Theseus from a trapeze fifteen feet above the stage.Williams, 226. When Bottom turned into an ass, he acquired not the traditional ass's head, but a clown's red nose.Foakes, 22; Williams 227. The costumes were non-Athenian and non-English Renaissance. Instead, they were a colourful mixture of elements from different times and places. Oberon wore a purple satin gown.Williams, 224. Puck wore a yellow jumpsuit from the Chinese circus.Williams, 224. The mechanicals were dressed as 20th-century factory workers.Williams, 225. The young lovers looked like 1960s \\"flower children\\" in tie-dye shirts and ankle-length dresses.Williams, 226, 229. There were also unusual casting choices. It had been traditional for the fairies to be played by children or women, but Brook cast adult men instead, an effect described as \\"disconcertingly strange and threatening\\",Peter Holland, ed. A Midsummer Night's Dream (OUP, 1994), 24. and which made the forest a more frightening, adult place than in earlier productions.Foakes, 23. Brook also decided to double the roles of Theseus/Oberon, Hippolyta/Titania, Philostrate/Puck and Egeus/Quince. This was partly to create a smaller, more intimate company, but also to suggest that the fairies were not so much different characters, as different aspects of the human characters' personalities,Williams, 224. an idea signified when Theseus and Hippolyta 'became' Oberon and Titania simply by putting on robes.Foakes, 23. Brook believed that Theseus and Hippolyta have failed to achieve \\"the true union as a couple\\" and work through their quarrels as Oberon and Titania.Qtd. by Foakes, 23. Amid the blank white set, with its two doors, a red feather on a trapeze represents Titania's bower. Oberon (left) is anointing Titania's eyes with the love potion, while Puck looks on. The production emphasized, to a level never before seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents of the story of Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into an ass. Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary, in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality.Brook, quoted by Foakes, 23. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom thrust his upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, a piece of music originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play.Williams, 227; Holland, 72-3. Despite the disturbing undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s permissiveness.Foakes, 23; Williams 227. The end of the production stressed the idea of community between audience and actors. As Oberon spoke his final lines about sunrise, the house lights slowly rose, so that the audience was visible to each other while Puck spoke the play's closing speech. Upon the line \\"Give me your hands, if we be friends\\", the entire cast rushed into the auditorium to shake hands with the audience, turning the theatre into a \\"lovefest\\".Williams, 231. Responses The production was extremely popular, both in terms of box office and reviews. On the opening night, the audience gave a standing ovation at the interval.Foakes, 21. The majority of critics were in raptures over the production. It was a box office success, and was instantly recognized as a theatrical landmark, and the product of a great artist: the Sunday Times reviewer called it \\"the sort of thing one only sees once in a lifetime, and then only from a man of genius\\".Williams, 231. There were naysayers, and the commonest criticism was that the production distracted the viewer from the play by prioritizing Brook's cleverness over Shakespeare's;Williams, 232. one reviewer called it a \\"self-indulgent display of directorial gimmickry\\".Kenneth Hurren in The Spectator, quoted by Foakes, 23. Theatre historian John Russell Brown felt that the play was constrained by Brook's eccentric personal interpretations.Foakes, 23. However, even those critics who disliked the staging choices praised the verse-speaking for its clarity and freshness. One Shakespearean scholar supposedly watched it with his eyes shut, loving the acting, but hating the visuals.Williams, 226. Theatre historian Gary Jay Williams says the production was so influential that it became \\"the reference point for Shakespearean performance practice in general over the next decade\\".Williams, 233. It encouraged the exploration of the play's darker, adult themes, which had been overshadowed by the tradition treating it as a play for children.Foakes, 24. So innovative and distinctive was the production that it almost became a problem for directors, because \\"the burden of reinventing the play now fell on every director.\\"Williams, 234. However, it opened the door to much greater experimentation, so that \\"twenty- five years after Brook's staging, the diversity of approaches is staggering to review\\".Williams, 234.

It occasionally shows an abundant stromal reticulin network and presents a high frequency of TP53 gene mutations. Symptoms and signs are similar to those of the ordinary glioblastoma. Methodology of diagnosis and treatment are the same. Prognosis is similar to the ordinary glioblastoma (about 12 months). Some authors (see later) refer cases with a slightly better outcome. Historical annotation The giant-cell glioblastoma was originally termed \\"monstrocellular sarcoma\\", because of its stromal reticulin network, but the astrocytic nature of the tumor was firmly established through the consistent GFAP expression analysis. Epidemiology=Incidence= The giant-cell glioblastoma is a rare neoplasia: its incidence is less than 1% of all brain tumors. It represents up to 5% of glioblastomas. =Age and sex distribution= The mean age at clinical presentation is 42. The age distribution includes children and has a wider range than other diffuse astrocytomas (diffuse WHO grade II astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, ordinary glioblastoma). The giant-cell glioblastoma affects males more frequently. (The M/F ratio is 1.6.) Prognosis Most patients with giant-cell glioblastoma have unfavourable prognosis, but some authors report clinical results slightly better than the ordinary glioblastoma, in all probability because this variant seems less infiltrative, due to the nature of giant cells of this type.

Examples of living hypocarnivores are the grizzly bear (Ursus horribilis), black bear (Ursus americanus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), and kinkajou (Potos flavus). The evolutionary division of carnivory into three groups, including hypercarnivore and mesocarnivore, appears to have occurred about 40 million years ago (mya). The term hypocarnivory is used with increasing frequency in describing early Canidae evolution, and reliance upon that survival strategy has a documented history in North American Borophaginae during the Miocene (23.03 to 5.33 mya). Twenty-five species of hypocarnivore co-occurred on the North American continent 30 mya. A shift from hyper- to hypo- occurred at least three times among Oligocene and Miocene canids Oxetocyon, Phlaocyon, and Cynarctus. Large hypocarnivores (Ursus) were rare and developed in the mid-to-late Miocene-Pliocene as Borophaginae became extinct.  Dentition  Examination of dentition shows that post-carnassial molar volume expands with hypocarnivores while decreasing in hypercarnivores.

The non-auditioned chorus maintains the vision of its founding members to foster increased recognition, understanding and acceptance of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender persons.  History  The Columbus Gay Men's Chorus was conceived at a Christmas party for the group GAP, Gay and Professional, hosted by Mark Cooke and Dan Huff. As attendees sang Christmas carols around the piano being played by Cooke the idea arose that Columbus needed its own gay men's chorus so the Columbus Gay Men's Chorus was founded in January 1990 by five individuals: Doug Althauser, Kevin Gary, Bob Germain, Phil Martin, and Jack Wisniewski. After months of discussion and research, the five incorporated the Chorus and began rehearsals in September of that year. Rehearsals were held at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church and the debut concert took place on December 9, 1990 at the Thurber Theater on the Ohio State University campus. Fifty-one men sang in that first concert. In 1990, the Chorus hired David Price as its inaugural Artistic Director. Price served 7 years directing the chorus and helping establish strong traditions and musical performances. During this time, Price took the Chorus to its very first GALA Festival performance in Denver, Colorado. During this time, the Chorus released its first CD, Stepping Out. The Chorus again went to GALA with Price in 1996. In 1997, the chorus hired David Monseur as the new Artistic Director. Monseur served as the director of the Chorus until 2010. Under his guidance, the Chorus held its first Joy! Concert at the King Avenue United Methodist Church. Over the years there have been several highlights of note for the Chorus. Monseur expanded the Chorus by founding Illuminati, which internationally debuted at the GALA Festival in Montreal, Canada. CGMC released another CD: Joy! In 1999, Ann Hampton Calloway performed with the Chorus and dedicated one of her songs in memory of the Chorus's accompanist, Robin Rakes. The Chorus has also performed with other arts groups including: ProMusica, Ballet Met, Opera Columbus, Anna and the Annadroids, Cincinnati Men's Chorus, and other established singing groups. The Chorus has also performed for the Ohio Democratic Party Fundraising dinner where the Governor Ted Strickland accepted and proudly wore a Chorus pin! In 2010, CGMC hired Dr. Timothy Sarsany as its Artistic Director, succeeding David Monseur. In this role, Sarsany handles all artistic and programming aspects of the organization and works to increase the organization's presence in the community. In June 2015, Broadway Diva impressionist Christine Pedi performed with the chorus on \\"Divas: Dead or Alive\\". On July 4, 2015, CGMC performed with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra on their \\"Patriotic Pops\\" concert, not only the first time CGMC teamed up with the CSO, but also the first time a chorus was featured on their July 4 program.  Performances and music  The full Columbus Gay Men's Chorus and ensembles typically performs five concerts per season: * Vox full Concert (October) * Holiday Joy! Concert (December) * Spring Concert (Mid March) * Illuminati's full concert (May) * Summer Concert (Late June) Each concert includes a variety of musical pieces performed by the full Chorus and ensembles; the spring and summer concerts usually involve significant elements of choreography. =Recordings= * Stepping Out; 1995 * Joy! - Holiday CD; 2005 * Rocket Man - The music of Elton John; 2008 * Joy! to the World - Holiday CD; 2013 * Joy! 2018 - Holiday CD; 2018 Membership types and requirements Membership is open to all people regardless of vocal talent, musical abilities, race, gender, religion, age, physical abilities, sexual orientation, gender identity or economic means. Singers must be at least 18 years of age and must be able to sing in the tenor or bass ranges. Small Ensembles=Vox= Vox Alterna was founded in 1991 and established its reputation as an advanced vocal ensemble, performing challenging literature, featuring complex vocal harmonies and a cappella arrangements. Vox later shortened its name and is typically limited to an 18-member ensemble. In addition to performing with the Chorus, the group often performs at numerous events outside of the performance schedule of the Chorus as well as in its own concert. =Illuminati= Referring to the Latin phrase \\"the Enlightened Ones\\", Illuminati was created to respond to the community's expressed desire for performances of a sacred or spiritual context, and is the world's first sacred-only GLBT ensemble. The group seeks to increase CGMC outreach performances, particularly to religious organizations, while respecting the members‚Äô spiritual beliefs. Illuminati is a non-auditioned ensemble. Participation in Illuminati is open to all members in good standing and, unlike Vox, does not require joint participation in the full Chorus.

The history of the street can be traced back to the times of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534). Location Qushuiting Street is located in the Lixia District of the historical urban center of Jinan. It is about long and on average wide.Qushuiting Street - Baike online encyclopedia The street follows the course of the Winding Water Creek (Qu Shui Creek) that flows northwards from the Palace Pool (spring pool of the Zhuoying Spring) into the Daming Lake. On it course, Qushuiting Street passes by the Fuxue Confucian Temple and the Hundred Flower Pond, before it ends on Daming Lake Road just south of the Daming Lake. The creek and hence the street are lined with willow trees along almost the entire length of the street. History The street was the site of an annual festival that has been documented since the times of the Northern Wei Dynasty and continued until the beginning of the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912): On the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the old Chinese calendar, scholar-bureaucrats gathered at the Palace Pool to ritually cleanse themselves. This was followed by a banquet along Qushuiting Street/Qushui Creek. Cups of alcohol were floated on trays along Qushui Creek. The scholars would sit next to the creek and compose poetry. If a participant's poem displeased the other guests, he would be obliged to drink more alcohol. Cultural Significance With its open, spring fed water course and willow trees, Qushuiting Street is a symbol of the historical city scape of Jinan that has been described by the late-Qing author Liu E in his novel \\"The Travels of Lao Can\\", written 1903-04, published in 1907).

Early life and education  His family moved to New York City, where he studied art at the National Academy of Design. He rose to prominence during the Harlem Renaissance. He was \\"the youngest member of the Harlem Renaissance artists...migrated to New York with his family at an early age...where he was influenced by French Impressionism and Cubism.\\"Ogden Museum of Southern Art  Career  Malvin \\"was one of the most far-reaching and versatile artists of his period.

Lewis, African American Art and Artists, University of California Press; 2003, p. 74. His work is often labeled as Symbolic Abstractionist, being one of the first African-American artists to paint in the Cubist style.Student Britannica entry Elements of his art seem also to derive from studies of African sculpture. He concerned himself with technical aspects of light, composition, and form, and a desire to express the experience of the spirituals in terms of abstract symbolism. Like many other artists, Johnson worked on the Federal Arts Project during the Depression. His work was displayed in many of the Harmon Exhibits in 1929 and the early thirties. In 1931 some of his work was hung in the Anderson gallery and the following year, the Salon of America displayed several of his paintings. In 1928 he won a prize at a Harmon exhibition, and in 1929 he won the Otto H. Kahn prize for painting.Malvin Gray Johnson , State of Florida's Task Force on African American History. \\"Johnson's painting 'Swing low sweet chariot' was awarded the 1929 exhibition prize for best picture in the second Harmon group show.\\" (Calo, p. 140) Johnson was featured in the 1930s film A Study of Negro Artists, along with Richmond Barth√©, James Latimer Allen, Palmer Hayden, Aaron Douglas, William Ellisworth Artis, Augusta Savage, Lois Mailou Jones, Georgette Seabrooke, and others associated with the Harlem Renaissance.A Study of Negro Artists at Internet Archive.\\"A Study of Negro Artists (1937)\\" at TCM. Towards the end of his life, Johnson produced a group of watercolors of urban and rural blacks, many of which were set in Brightwood, Virginia. These paintings from his final period, are more widely regarded as some of his finest works. In The Negro in American Culture, Margaret Just Butcher, argued that some of Johnson's paintings \\"are among the most significant commentaries on the American Negro scene.\\" Alain LeRoy Locke said that Johnson captured the cynical humor and mythical desolation in the moods of blacks better than most artists. Viewing Johnson as a maturing experimentalist, James A. Porter wrote that his later work was expressed in terse, pregnant patches of color.Malvin Gray Johnson (1896-1934) Symbolic Abstractionist , State of Florida's Task Force on African American History.

Starting as a secretary at Abraham & Straus after completing high school, where she moved up the ladder to higher posts in advertising and training. She moved to McCreery's department store on Fifth Avenue where she moved up to a senior merchandising post.

Seeing the anxiety of her children on visits to the doctor due to ill health or for vaccinations, she created the Doctor Bag in 1956‚Äîwhich included a stethoscope, syringe and other pretend medical supplies‚Äîto help kids deal with their fears. A Nurse Bag followed shortly thereafter, and this was extended with a Ken Doctor Bag and a Barbie Nurse Bag licensed in 1962. With the rise of The Mickey Mouse Club, first broadcast in 1955, a series of toys were licensed from the Walt Disney Company, including Mouskatennis table tennis, a Mickey Mouse Counting Jump Rope and Fun Tray, a board game based on the Davy Crockett television series and other toys inspired by Disney. Other games featured tie-ins to the Lone Ranger and Superman. Jack Pressman's deteriorating health led Lynn to assume more responsibility in managing the firm, and she took over as president following his death in 1959. She had all of her company's toys made in the United States and set up a policy prohibiting sale of rifles and other military gear at a time when toy guns were a childhood staple, stating in the mid-1960s that \\"under no circumstances will I ever knowingly manufacture a bayonet, a hand grenade or any of the dreadful weapons that can destroy life as playthings for children\\".Cook, Joan. \\"Dolls Are Ambassadors for Peace; Foreign Costumes Lead Little Girl to Pen Pals\\", The New York Times, May 8, 1965.

She used her fashion sense and marketing skills to create more appealing packaging for games and was an early user of television to advertise the firm's products. She had a knack for understanding games offered to the firm and offering ways to simplify and improve game play. She brought in an elephant in front of the Toy Center at 23rd Street and Broadway for the annual toy fair to promote two new memory games. She signed Roger Maris at the height of his fame to promote Pressman's Big League Action Baseball, later signing Tom Seaver and Carl Yastrzemski.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.  Description  Rock Harbor Lighthouse (center bottom) is located in Rock Harbor on Isle Royale (right-click image to enlarge). The Rock Harbor Lighthouse is a cylindrical tower with a base, constructed of randomly placed stone and brick, capped with an octagonal beacon with a copper roof. A one-and-a-half-story keeper's house with gabled roof is connected to the tower on one end.  History  In 1852, due to the increase in shipping in Lake Superior, it was recommended that a new light be constructed on Isle Royale; the next year, Congress appropriated $5,000 to construct a light at Rock Harbor. Construction began in 1855, and was completed in 1856. The Rock Island Light was the first lighthouse constructed on Isle Royale. The first keeper arrived at the station on October 24, 1856, and the lighthouse went into operation a short time later. The light had been manned for less than three years when it was determined that, due to the decrease in mining traffic, it was no longer required. It was extinguished on August 1, 1859, and the lighthouse was abandoned. During the American Civil War, copper mining increased once more, and in 1873 renovations began on the station, leading to the reactivation of the light on August 5, 1874. However, after another drop in copper prices, and following the activation in 1875 of the Isle Royale Light at Menagerie Island, the Rock Harbor Light was rendered less useful. On October 4, 1879, the Rock Harbor lighthouse was deactivated for the second and last time, having been in service for a total of only eight years since its construction. In 1910, the keeper's house was altered, including the addition of dormers. In the 1950s, the tower began to tilt, and an emergency stabilization was undertaken; the tower still leans approximately 2 degrees. The original wooden roof of the structure was replaced with asphalt in 1962, and the foundation was stabilized in 1969. The station is currently unmanned.

Fort Laramie was a 19th-century military post in eastern Wyoming. It became notorious as a place for gambling and drinking, and for prostitution, with at least ten prostitutes always in residence. The location is notable as an example of one of only a few military bordellos still standing in the United States by 1974, the time of its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places The Fort Laramie site was one of a number of so-called \\"hog ranches\\" that appeared along trails in Wyoming. Located about from old Fort Laramie, the ranch was established in 1873 by Jules Ecoffey and Adolph Cuny as a trading post and saloon. The next year prostitution was added as a further attraction. One of the young prostitutes was said to be Martha Jane Cannary, more popularly known in later years as Calamity Jane. Both Ecoffey and Cuny had died by 1877. However, the site remained important as a social, commercial and transportation center, the nearest town of any size being Cheyenne, away. The Cheyenne and Black Hills Stagecoach Company operated a hotel for stagecoach passengers, which apparently coexisted with the bordello, both operating until the stage line was abandoned in 1887. The ranch was described by U.S. Army Lieutenant John Gregory Bourke: > ... tenanted by as hardened and depraved set of witches as could be found on > the face of the globe. It [was] a rum mill of the worst kind [with] half a > dozen Cyprians, virgins whose lamps were always burning brightly in > expectancy of the coming of the bridegroom, and who lured to destruction the > soldiers of the garrison. In all my experience I have never seen a lower, > more beastly set of people of both sexes. Two structures remain: a \\"U\\"-shaped lime-grout building that housed the bar and had several rooms and a cellar, and a wooden barn. (Lime-grout was used as an early form of concrete.) Other buildings, now vanished, included a barn with loopholes for defense, eight \\"cribs\\" or two-room cabins for prostitutes, shops, and a pool hall.

A third baseman, his career lasted for 18 seasons (1926‚Äì43) and included all or parts of six years (1931‚Äì36) in Major League Baseball and extensive service in the Pacific Coast League. Born in Oakland, California, to French immigrants, he graduated from nearby Alameda High School and attended Saint Mary's College of California. Vergez threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Vergez achieved early success in 1929‚Äì30 with his hometown team, the Oakland Oaks, hitting over .300 each season, and smashing 46 and 29 home runs. He was the PCL's All-Star third baseman in 1929. Acquired by the New York Giants, he succeeded Hall of Famer Freddie Lindstrom as the Giants' regular third baseman in . Starting in 152 games as a rookie, Vergez reached career highs in hits, batting average (.278) and runs batted in (81). But was a year marred by personal tragedy. Just prior to the start of the regular season, his infant son, John Louis, was stricken with poliomyelitis and died. Although Vergez was able to play in 118 games, his production declined considerably. His manager, Bill Terry, assured the grieving Vergez a place on his roster. That season, Vergez rebounded to hit a career-high 16 home runs in 123 games. But, suffering from appendicitis, he could not play during the September stretch drive nor in the 1933 World Series, won by the Giants in five games with Travis Jackson at the hot corner.Oakland Tribune article on Vergez, July 14, 2008 The following season, , saw a sharp fall-off in Vergez' play. He batted only .200 in 320 at bats in what would be his final campaign as a New York Giant. On November 1, 1934, he was traded to the second-division Philadelphia Phillies with Pretzel Pezzullo, Blondy Ryan and George Watkins for shortstop Dick Bartell. He played in 148 games for the 1935 Phillies and led National League third basemen in double plays. But he hit only .249, and after appearing in only 15 games for the Phils in , he was sold to the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals gave him a nine-game trial, then sent him to the minor-league Sacramento Solons. His MLB career at an end, Vergez played for almost eight full seasons in the Pacific Coast League with Sacramento (1936‚Äì38) and then, from 1939‚Äì43, as the player-manager of the Oakland Oaks. He later scouted for the Giants and was the head baseball coach at Saint Mary's College, where he tutored future MLB third baseman Andy Carey. He died in 1991 at age 85 in Oroville, California.

Demographics As of 2011 Indian Census, Balasinor had a total population of 39,330, of which 20,282 were males and 19,048 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 4,946. The total number of literates in Balasinor was 30,314, which constituted 77.1% of the population with male literacy of 81.3% and female literacy of 72.5%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Balasinor was 88.2%, of which male literacy rate was 93.8% and female literacy rate was 82.2%.

It had a literacy rate of 70.5% and a ratio of 940 women for every 1000 men. 12.6% of the population was between the ages 0 to 6. According to Chambers's Concise Gazetteer Of The World from 1914, the population of Balasinor town was approximately 9,000 at the time. India's Jurassic Park In the early 1980s, palaeontologists stumbled upon dinosaur bones and fossils during a regular geological survey of this mineral-rich area. They found dinosaur egg hatcheries and fossils of at least 13 species of which the most important discovery was that of a carnivorous abelisaurid theropod named Rajasaurus narmadensis which lived in the Late Cretaceous period. The news of the find was welcomed in the neighbouring villages. Many residents brought the fossilised eggs home and worshipped them. Since then excavations have turned up a veritable trove of dinosaur remains‚Äîeggs, bones, a skeleton which is now kept in a Calcutta (Kolkata) museum‚Äîbringing hordes of scientists and tourists to Balasinor. Researchers, after piecing together the evidence in Raiyoli, believe that Gujarat is home to one of the largest clutch of dinosaur hatcheries in the world. At least 13 species of dinosaurs lived there, for more than 100 million years until their extinction 65 million years ago. The soft soil made hatching and protecting eggs easier for the animals. Many researchers call them the best-preserved eggs in the world after the ones found in Aix-en-Provence in France.

From 1912, he was married to songwriter and musician Alice Nadine Morrison (1892-1978).Peter Blecha, Morrison, \\"Morrie\\" and Alice -- Northwest Music Industry Pioneers, HistoryLink, November 20, 2005. Accessed online 2009-08-02. Life Born in Alabama, Morrison moved with his family to Marysville, Washington in 1900. His older brothers played in a variety of bands and he traveled with circuses for a while. By 1907 he was a dance instructor and a drummer in a local dance band. He met the young Alice Nadine Lanterman, who accompanied silent films in Anacortes, Washington- area theaters; they married in 1912, had a son, Lew, in 1913, and moved to Bellingham, Washington in 1914, where he started a dancing school. The couple started the Morrison Music Company to promote Alice's 1919 waltz \\"My Love Is All For You.\\" The song was picked up by Chicago's Forster Publishing, and became a national hit, the first of several for Alice. The Morrisons formed Morrison‚Äôs Marimba Xylophone Orchestra, and briefly expanded the dance school, before moving to San Francisco in 1922. There they took a suite 502 in that city's Pantages Theatre Building and began a series of musical ventures. While Alice worked as a song-plugger and performer, Morrie opened another dancehall/school and produced a successful stage show King of Melody Land. However, success in San Francisco did not last. Their orchestra became a touring group \\"performing,\\" Peter Blecha writes, \\"in upended barns, grange halls, open fields, anywhere and everywhere.\\" Home was successively Sacramento, California, Weed, Roseville, Dunsmuir, and finally, with somewhat rising fortunes, back to Seattle in 1931. Over the next decade, the Morrisons (now including son Lew) would tour around Washington State, and slowly expand an empire of dance halls that would become the G.T.M. Corporation. By 1940, the G.T.M. Corporation had 128 other dancehalls in the Western United States, six of them in Seattle. Two more hits for Alice provided the money for a US$20,000 musical extravaganza Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow at Seattle's Metropolitan Theatre; it was a flop. In the same period, with more success, he founded Morrison Records. Initially selling dance-oriented songs to his dance students, the label went on to record many local amateurs and eventually professionals such as Paul Tutmarc and Bonnie Guitar. An inheritance around 1954 allowed the Morrisons to purchase a mansion at 1025 1st Avenue W on Queen Anne Hill, the pre-World War II residence of the Japanese Consul in Seattle. Morrison records, although always a bit of a mom-and-pop business, expanded to handle all aspects of the record-making process except for cutting pressing masters from tape. By the mid-1950s Morrison was selling \\"motion picture reels and prerecorded tapes\\" of his dance lessons. In 1955 he issued a 75-page booklet Morrie Morrison‚Äôs Dance Book: A Journey In The Land of Terpsichore, a work Peter Blecha describes as \\"eccentric.\\" A later venture into film‚ÄîMorrie Morrison‚Äôs Unique and Colorful Motion Picture, the Discovery of the Elysian Phenomena and A Show Of Shows was, according to Blecha \\"seemingly based on a charmingly eccentric blend of mystifyingly cosmic concepts and straight-up aerobic principles.\\" In 1975, roughly a decade into production of the film, the Morrisons sold their mansion. The film was eventually completed; it did not find any substantial audience. Alice died in 1978, Morrie in 1984. Their son Lew played professionally until about 1994, son Ken (professionally a freelance television producer) remained a locally active musician as of 2005.

A mesocarnivore is an animal whose diet consists of 50‚Äì70% meat with the balance consisting of non-vertebrate foods which may include insects, fungi, fruits, other plant material and any food that is available to them. Mesocarnivores are from a large family group of mammalian carnivores and vary from small to medium sized, which are less than fifteen kilograms. Mesocarnivores are seen today among the Canidae (coyotes, foxes), Viverridae (civets), Mustelidae (martens, tayra), Procyonidae (ringtail, raccoon), Mephitidae (skunks), and Herpestidae (some mongooses). The red fox is also the most common of the mesocarnivores in Europe and has a high population density in the areas they reside. In North America, though some mesocarnivores, such as otters, lynx, or marten, are in danger of being over hunted for their pelts.Ray, Justina C.

These animals play an essential role in the function and system of the ecosystem, since the elimination of apex predators. The American Institute of Biological Sciences states that due to the fact that mesocarnivores are smaller than large carnivore, they are more abundant, and therefore have a diversity of mesocarnivore species.Gary W. Roemer, Matthew E. Gompper, Blaire Van Valkenburgh, \\"The Ecological Role of the Mammalian Mesocarnivore\\", BioScience, Volume 59, Issue 2, February 2009, Pages 165‚Äì173, https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2009.59.2.9 Due to their smaller size, mesocarnivores play a part in the ecosystem of dispersing seeds in open spaces, as well as driving community structure. Mesocarnivores are also very diverse in comparison to larger carnivores in their behaviour and ecology, from being reclusive to highly social. Their diversity and small size allows them to thrive in a range of habitats than larger carnivores are able to. The population of these smaller carnivores also increases when the presence of a larger carnivore decline. This is known as the 'mesocarnivore release.' According to the National Park Service, \\"Mesocarnivore release is defined as the expansion in range and/or abundance of a smaller predator following the reduction or removal of a larger predator.\\"\\"Scavenging and Landscape Use of Mesocarnivores in Denali (U.S. National Park Service)\\". National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, 2019, www.nps.gov/articles/denali-crp- mesocarnivore.htm. One impact of this is that these mesocarnivores can act as scavengers cleaning up dead animal carcasses discarded by humans in urban areas.ƒÜiroviƒá, Du≈°ko & Peneziƒá, Aleksandra & Krofel, Miha. (2016). Jackals as cleaners: Ecosystem services provided by a mesocarnivore in human-dominated landscapes. Biological Conservation. 199. 51-55. 10.1016/j.biocon.2016.04.027. Mesocarnivores' habitat have shifted and changed, due to urbanisation, leading to habitat fragmentation and disturbance, resulting in habitat loss for animals.  Evolution  Mesocarnivores, as a part of the mammalian carnivore family, play a large role in the ecosystem, due to their prey-drive effects and impact on its functionality and structure. They are an important part of the ecological function, as their size to medium size allows them to disperse seeds, that, hypercarnivores cannot. Mesocarnivores transport seeds in open spaces, as far as one kilometre and disperse seeds within 600 to 750 metres of each other. They can influence other native carnivores by predation and competition in the ecosystem, and can lead to a reduction or possible extinction of prey species and effect geographical distribution, changing the structure of the ecosystem. Mesocarnivores also serve other ecological roles such as its position in the food web and disease mitigation. Mesocarnivores' habitats are rapidly changing due to urbanisation, habitat fragmentation and deforestation, which is a threat to survival for these animals, due to habitat loss and can cause a decrease in species. Some mesocarnivores have adapted very quickly to the constantly changing habitat conditions, compared to other mesocarnivores, for example the coyote (canis latrans) in Northeast North America. Many carnivores have different locomotor movements and are easily adaptable to a range of habitats and source various foods.  Characteristics = Behaviour and Activity = Some mesocarnivores including the masked palm civet, hog badger and leopard cat activity patterns peaked during the night. Mesocarnivores activity levels change within different seasons and climates. Different temperatures and the rate of plant growth may affect the activity patterns in mesocarnivores. Masked palm civets in China do not appear often in the winter months (December to February) and are not as active. Mesocarnivores‚Äô behaviour and characteristics are individual to their species. For example, coyotes are pack animals and form strong family relations. The way mesocarnivores communicate with each other is through their behaviours that are able to organise mating systems, distinguish parental care and other behaviours. Carnivores also use their senses to communicate with other animals and in the pack, especially their olfactory senses. Mesocarnivores perform a wide range of different movements. Different species of mesocarnivores can achieve different types of locomotor movements. For example, otters (Lutrinae) are specialised in swimming in water, however find it difficult to move on land. Other carnivores can improve their locomotor movements by behaviour modifications, for example, the African lion and gray wolf demonstrate group hunting behaviour where it allows them to run and hunt prey as a pack, that can not be done individually. Carnivores with limbs that are adapted for running may run, gallop or pace to go at a fast pace and cover long distances. These carnivorous mammals use their gait which is dependent on their species and size. The structure of a carnivore is designed to catch prey and kill it. = Feeding behaviours = Mesocarnivores are found to be nocturnal and are hunting for prey when they are most active during the nighttime. Mesocarnivores‚Äô feeding behaviours mainly consist of prey availability. They feed on small mammals which include a range of different mice and squirrels, such as the northern grasshopper mice, ord‚Äôs kangaroo rat and thirteen-lined ground squirrels. Some other examples of mesocarnivores‚Äô prey are the blacktailed jackrabbit and the desert cottontail. Large and small mammals are considered as prey to these mesocarnivores, as well as different herbivores, depending on what food is most readily available to these animals. Without apex predators, there is a decreased level of inter-specific competition in the food chain between mesocarnivores, allowing them to increase their scavenging options for different food. As mesocarnivores are scavengers, they will eat any food that is accessible to them. For example, the yellow-throated marten and Siberian weasel change their feeding behaviours in winter when limited fruits are available and convert to small mammal prey. Mesocarnivores are closely related to other mammals in regards to competition and intraguild predation. Interspecific competition is a vital part of the ecological species and community structure, as a result can lead to \\"exploitation competition\\" and \\"interference competition\\" with other species. =Dentition= Dentition Mesocarnivore cheek teeth are heterodont and their different shapes reflect distinct functions. Incisors and canines are used to apprehend food and kill prey, pointed premolars pierce and hold prey, and molars are involved in both slicing and crushing functions. The slicing function of the molars is produced by occlusion between the carnassials, the lower first molar, and the upper fourth premolar. Mesocarnivores are first represented by the Miacidae. They are best represented by Prohesperocyon, with three incisors, one canine tooth, four premolars above. The jaw has three molars below, and two molars above on each side.  Taxonomy  There are many animals in the wild that are considered as mesocarnivores, such as species of lynx, bobcat, American marten, fisher, river otter, American mink, coyote, red fox, gray fox, raccoon, striped skunk, weasels. Individual species' diets may vary, depending on the season and what food can be sourced. Mesocarnivore mammals have a large role in the ecosystem that impacts ecological community and system in the environment. = Example species = Coyote (Canis latrans)  The coyote (Canis latrans) is a native species to North America. They can live up to a lifespan of fourteen years, with their size ranging from 81-94 cm (32 to 37 inch) head to body, and weigh 9-23 kg (20-50 pounds). Coyotes‚Äô diet mostly consists of mammals, fruits, birds, grass and insects. They are also hunters and will eat anything of readily available prey including rabbits, fish, lamb. The coyotes in the wild enjoy intense smells of adventure and prey, as well as having an excellent sense of vision. They are pack animals and hunt prey and food in a pack, especially in the fall and winter.  River otter (Lontra canadensis)  The river otter is one of North America‚Äôs native animals. They have an average lifespan of 8 to 9 years, with a body length ranging from 56-80 cm (22-32 inch) head to body and weigh 5-13 kg (11-30 pounds). The river otter‚Äôs habitat is in water and on land. They create a burrow near the water as their den and easily adapt to other aquatic habitats. They hunt during the night, and find food that is readily available to them. River otters have great swimming abilities and stay active during winter.  Raccoon (Procyon lotor)  There are several raccoon species which are also known as ringtail, all originated from the United States. Their physical characteristics include short limbs, a pointed snout and small upright ears, with a body length of 75-90 cm (30-35 inch) long. Raccoons weight varies from 10-20 kg (22-44 pounds) and have a furry coat that resembles black, grey and brown shades. These mesocarnivores catch majority of their food in water, including crayfish, frogs and other marine animals, as well as feeding on rodents and other plant material. Some species of the raccoon include the Barbados raccoon (P. gloveralleni), Tres Mar√≠as raccoon (P. insularis), Bahaman raccoon (P. maynardi), Guadeloupe raccoon (P. minor) and Cozumel raccoon (P. pygmaeus).  Mongoose (Herpestidae)  The mongoose is a species of mesocarnivores which are mainly located in Africa, southern Asia and southern Europe. They are known for their predatory attacks on snakes.

He has more than 30 years of experience playing both nationally and internationally, has been featured on nine CD's, authored an educational book on music management, and started his own entertainment management company, Washington's Entertainment Connection/Bigshot Records. Choper manages and plays in five bands working in different genres, including jazz, rock, funk, klezmer and Israeli music. His groups include ‚ÄúBreathe‚Äú, ‚ÄúKol Haruach Klezmer Band / Klezmer Voices‚Äú, ‚ÄúThe Brian Choper Jazz Project with Peter Canella‚Äú, and ‚ÄúMulberry Street‚Äù. Musical background From the early 1980s through the late 1990s, Choper was primarily known as a klezmer and rock drummer. By the mid 1990s Choper had emerged as an American drummer, and later as a band manager, business owner and consultant. By the late 1990s, he was working with many bands in genres including rock, funk, jazz and Latin. In 1983, he won first prize at the Vienna International Music Festival for classical timpani. He studied with notable teachers including George Huttlin, Marshall Maley and Buddy Rich. During the 1980s, Choper became the first drummer to play with the folk band Capital Klezmers. In 1992, he was selected to participate in the International Music Festival in Safed, Israel, as part of the Machaya Klezmer Band. He produced and is featured on the band's second CD titled What a Machaya! that became a best-selling folk album in 1997, reaching number two on the Moment magazine folk chart. Author and business leader In 2002, Choper wrote the Entertainment Connection Career Guidebook, a manual for artists that outlines the steps for starting and managing a band and finding work as a professional musician. The book provides advice based on Choper‚Äôs years of experience as a performer, band manager, agent, consultant and business owner. A year later, Choper founded Entertainment Connection, an artist management and booking firm where he could sign and manage artists and bands under his own wing. In 2005, the company became Washington's Entertainment Connection (WEC), a firm that not only manages and books artists and bands, but also coaches and develops them through his new label, Bigshot Records. The ‚ÄúGigs For You‚Äù division advises artists and bands on how to find career opportunities. In 2007, Choper expanded the Klezmer concept from the wedding and party scene to concert halls. To reach people of all ethnic backgrounds, he created a sister band to his original Kol Haruach Orchestra called the New Klezmer Quintet. The band regularly sells out major concert venues, performing traditional Klezmer music in its own style, while also presenting original, neo-Klezmer tunes that blend other musical genres, including rock, jazz and their most popular genre, bluegrass. This success led to the band performing for the 2009 Presidential Inaugural festivities in Washington, D.C., with performances simulcast on NPR. Choper uses WEC's record label, Mulberry Music, to look for new and original musical talent to sign, develop and book on tour. The label's rock/pop/funk house band Mulberry Street blends (and is influenced by) rock, funk, blues, pop and other genres. In the past, Choper has worked with major artists, including Prince, Buddy Rich, Louis Bellson, Sammy Davis Jr., Steve Marcus, Mel Torme, James Taylor, Jersey Boys, and Wynton Marsalis. Choper founded the project Gigs For Good. He is also owner of the BigShot Records Label, WEC, and Authority Records. All companies are music divisions under The Mulberry Music Group, of which Choper is a founding member. Choper is currently the founder and CEO of The Mulberry Music Musician‚Äôs Network.

Animal tarots (German: Tiertarock) are a subgenre of tarot decks that were most commonly found in northern Europe, from Belgium to Russia. A theme of animals, real and/or fantastic, replaces the traditional trump scenes found in the Italian-suited Tarot of Besan√ßon. The Sk√ºs plays a musical instrument while the Pagat is represented by Hans Wurst, a carnival stock character who carries his sausage, drink, slap stick, or hat. They constitute the first generation of French- suited tarot patterns. Prior to their introduction, tarot card games were confined to Italy, France, and Switzerland. During the 17th century, the game's popularity in these three countries declined and was forgotten in many regions. The rapid expansion of the game into the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia after the appearance of animal tarots may not be a coincidence. In the 19th century, most animal tarots were replaced with tarots that have genre scenes, veduta, opera, architecture, or ethnological motifs on the trumps such as the Industrie und Gl√ºck of Austria-Hungary. Single-figured Belgian animal tarot After being introduced from Alsace, Besan√ßon pattern tarots were made in Germany as early as the 1720s but were likely not popular as German rule books did not mention tarot until after 1750. The earliest animal tarots, utilizing Lyonnais face cards, were made around 1740 in Strasbourg with production also in Germany, Belgium, and Sweden up to the early 19th century.portrait d'Allemagne at the International Playing-Card Society.

He replaced the Lyonnais face cards with the Bavarian version of the Paris pattern.Bavarian animal tarot at the International Playing-Card Society. Retrieved 21 January 2018.

The Belgian animal tarot has the same trumps as the ones above but with unique court cards such as the queens and shin-exposed kings draped in cloaks.

It began as an email newsletter and in the fall of 2000 evolved into a news-oriented weblog with a New York focus. In October 2002, Baldwin and Womack launched The Morning News as a daily- published online magazine. The Morning News publishes short pieces of humor, commentary, and personal essays. Other featured sections include Headlines, a twice-daily column of links to interesting, relevant, and obscure news stories and websites; Galleries, which highlights the work of contemporary artists and authors; and the Non-Expert, a satirical advice column. TMN also features a variety of themed blogs, including an interview series called TMN Talks and a book blog, Our Man in Boston, by Robert Birnbaum. Time listed the magazine in the 2006 edition of its \\"50 Coolest Websites\\" and the Utne Reader called the site \\"more nourishing than the newsprint diet that has previously dominated your breakfast.\\"  Books  The Morning News content has inspired the publication of several books. =Gary Benchley, Rock Star= In September 2003, The Morning News published the first of 27 installments of a serial titled Gary Benchley, Rock Star, written from the perspective of \\"a Williamsburg wannabe-indie-rocker\\" named Gary Benchley. When the collected Gary Benchley series was published by Plume in September 2005, it was revealed that Gary Benchley was really TMN contributor and Harper's Magazine webmaster Paul Ford. However, many were fooled by Ford's charade, including the New York Times, which called his book \\"a sort of Dickens-esque flourish for the digital age.\\" On the day of the novel's publication, The Morning News published an essay by Ford explaining the story of Gary Benchley, from inspiration to publication. =Four Seasons in Rome: On Twins, Insomnia, and the Biggest Funeral in the History of the World= Between February and August 2005, The Morning News published five essays by Anthony Doerr, who was living in Rome for a year after winning the Rome Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Doerr's essays addressed his and his wife's challenges living abroad with their infant sons; his many perspectives on Rome; and the funeral of Pope John Paul II. In June 2007, Doerr published a book, Four Seasons in Rome: On Twins, Insomnia, and the Biggest Funeral in the History of the World, based on the Letters From Rome series. =The Morning News Annual= In 2008, The Morning News began publishing a yearly book of new content and selected online material called The Morning News Annual. =Paris, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down= While living and working in Paris, The Morning News co- founder Rosecrans Baldwin wrote a series of letters for the magazine that later inspired a travel memoir. Paris, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in May 2012.  Events =The Tournament of Books= In 2005, The Morning News launched the Tournament of Books, an annual literary contest structured like and coinciding with the NCAA basketball tournament. The Tournament culminates in the Rooster prize‚Äînamed in honor of writer David Sedaris's brother in the short story \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster.\\" The inspiration for the Tournament of Books came from the idea that while \\"arbitrariness is inherent in book awards,\\" the Rooster could at least be transparent. Sixteen books published in the previous year are chosen and matched against each other, with a different judge for each match. Judges read their two assigned books and select one to advance to the next round in written decisions that are published daily on the site. Past judges include Elliot Ackerman, Monica Ali, Nicole Cliffe, Helen DeWitt, Junot D√≠az, Sasha Frere-Jones, Amanda Hesser, John Hodgman, Nick Hornby, Karl Iagnemma, Tayari Jones, Sam Lipsyte, Colin Meloy, Celeste Ng, Dale Peck, David Rees, Mary Roach, Gary Shteyngart, Jeff VanderMeer, and Meg Wolitzer. During the 2009 event, Baldwin and Womack were interviewed on NPR's All Things Considered. In the interview, Baldwin described Tournament contenders as: \\"books that have received a lot of hype‚Ä¶ books that we've had recommended to us by readers, by friends, by family; books that have won awards, books that maybe got unrecognized or are coming from the independent publishing world.\\" In 2014, the tournament celebrated its 10th edition and featured notable judges such as John Green, Roxane Gay, John Darnielle, and Roger Hodge. The Tournament has two rounds, followed by semifinals, followed by a \\"Zombie Round\\" in which two books that were eliminated in the first round are re-matched against the two winners of the semifinals. In the final round, there is a head judge, but all the Tournament's judges vote for the winner. Throughout the Tournament, authors Kevin Guilfoile and John Warner provide commentary on each decision.

Out of 54 entrants, Bonnie Furlong was chosen the winner of the contest for her story The Parlourmaid's Tale, or, MS in a Dustbin, which, according to Gawker.com, \\"served Kaavya her weak ass on a plate.\\" =Infinite Summer= Starting in June 2009, The Morning News sponsored Infinite Summer, a summer- long reading expedition of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest.

From August 13 to October 17, 1967, a total of 7,696 people were killed while 1,397 people were forced to commit suicide. An additional 2,146 people were permanently injured and disabled. Most of the victims were labelled as \\"class enemies\\", belonging to the Five Black Categories, while at least 14,000 people participated in the massacre. The Daoxian massacre had a direct impact on the Shaoyang County Massacre in 1968. After the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party of China (CPC) considered the Daoxian incident as one of the \\"unjust, false, erroneous\\" cases of the Revolution and the victims were rehabilitated, but only a small number of the perpetrators were ever punished during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period.Hunan, 1994 Several leaders of the massacre were either expelled from the CPC or received various terms of imprisonment; in Dao County itself, only 11 people were prosecuted, and were sentenced to 3‚Äì10 years in prison, respectively. In total, twelve people were sentenced to life imprisonment, but none received death penalty. The mild punishments for the perpetrators sparked public outrage in the 1980s, with many local residents visiting Beijing in person, petitioning for justice.  Historical background = Cultural Revolution = During the Cultural Revolution in China which lasted from 1966 to 1976, millions of people deemed \\"counter-revolutionaries\\" or who did not side with Mao Zedong were persecuted. Mao endorsed the revolutionary discourse and the attacks on authority figures, who he believed had grown complacent, bureaucratic, and anti-revolutionary. Local Red Guards attacked anyone who they believed lacked revolutionary credentials, and then eventually turned on those who simply failed to wholeheartedly support their efforts and intentions. In August 1966, the Central Committee issued a directive entitled the ‚ÄúDecision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution‚Äù (a.k.a. the Sixteen Points) in an effort to define the revolution's goals. Later that month, Mao began to greet huge parades of Red Guards holding aloft his Little Red Book. The movement grew but also splintered into independent movements and Red Guard factions, each with its own vision of the movement. Despite official directives and encouragement from the Party leadership, local forces were left to act according to their own definitions of the Revolution's goals, and many of them ended up inflicting violence upon their communities and clashing with each other. Nobody wanted to be considered a ‚Äúreactionary,‚Äù but in the absence of official guidelines for identifying ‚Äútrue Communists,‚Äù almost everyone became a target of abuse. People tried to protect themselves and escape persecution by attacking friends and even their own families. The result was a bewildering series of attacks and counterattacks, factional fighting, unpredictable violence, and the breakdown of authority throughout China. = The build-up to massacre = By the time of the massacre, Dao County had not yet established its own local revolutionary committee to deal with \\"counter-revolutionaries\\". Thus, local army officers were the administrators of the county's leading group for ‚Äúgrasping revolution and promoting production‚Äù. At two countywide meetings on August 5 and August 11, Liu Shibing, the Political Commissar of the county's militia headquarters, spread a conspiracy rumor: Chiang Kai- shek‚Äôs Nationalist troops were going to attack mainland China, and the county‚Äôs class enemies, particularly the Five Black Categories, planned to rise in rebellion in cooperation with Chiang‚Äôs war plan. In addition, Liu claimed that a number of people under the Five Black Categories\\" in Dao County \\"had plotted to kill all Communist party members and poor- and lower-middle peasant leaders in the county.\\" Liu Shibing, along with Xiong Binen, Deputy- Secretariat of the Dao County CPC Committee, ordered all levels of militia personnel and security officers to start an urgent preemptive attack against the class enemies. Although they did not specifically state the word ‚Äúkill‚Äù, all levels of party leadership understood the meaning of this strong signal. There is no doubt that those government officials at the highest county rank were the decision-makers. They not only manufactured an imminent threat to justify the approaching massacre but instructed their subordinates to execute the killing as well.  Massacre = Target population = Almost everyone could be a target during the massacre. Victims ranged in age from a ten-day- old infant to a 78-year-old grandfather. Those killed or driven to suicide not only included people deemed \\"Five Black Categories\\", but sometimes were killed due to personal resentment and a history of conflicts from local authorities and residents, who often abused their power to settle personal disputes. = Organization = The district and commune level instigators created their own brutal and lawless way of organizing the massacres in their areas. Prior to the executions they would often hold a short ‚Äútrial‚Äù (lasting only a few minutes) in the lawlessly created ‚ÄúSupreme Court of the Poor and Lower-middle Peasants‚Äù. The ‚Äújudges‚Äù were unsurprisingly the local leaders who prearranged the killings. If the victims were sentenced to death (and they almost always were amid the corruption and lawlessness), they were trussed up by armed militia and taken to a mass rally for denouncing their ‚Äúcrimes.‚Äù Then, they were killed in public or by the public. Sometimes the local CPC and militia officials considered that it might be dangerous to take the victims to the public. They would then quietly send a team of armed militia to the victims' homes to carry out the slaughter. The victims would often be informed while away from home that an issue had risen requiring them to return, in order to lure the victims back home where their killers would be waiting. Those directly involved in the \\"executions\\" were rewarded for their work with higher salaries than they earned by their regular employment in the commune or district, an incentive that was a major factor for the high number of people who participated in the killings; a number of local CPC and militia officials personally led the killings. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the lack of law enforcement, local criminals also joined in the violence. Most of those in the militias were social outcasts and little respected people who sought to earn honor by participating in the killings. = Methods of killing = Victims were killed in a number of ways, including shooting, beating, drowning, explosion (with dynamites), decapitation, hanging, burning, and so on. = Death toll = The episode of mass violence in Daoxian eventually spread to other counties in Hunan province as other groups wanted to cleanse their own areas of \\"counter-revolutionaries\\". Eventually, after receiving serious complaints from survivors of the massacre, on August 29 the CPC Central Committee and the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee sent the 47th Field Army to force all local CPC and militia members to stop the killing. However, sporadic killings occurred up until October 17. * In Dao County alone, 4,519 people were recorded as having been killed (4,193) or driven to suicide (326), and over 14,000 were said to have participated in the killings. * In all counties and cities involved, 7,696 people were killed and 1,397 people were forced to commit suicide. An additional 2,146 people were permanently injured and disabled.  Rehabilitation  After the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party of China (CPC) considered the Daoxian incident as one of the \\"unjust, false, erroneous\\" cases of the Revolution. During the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period, CPC leaders such as Hu Yaobang and Jiang Hua visited the region from 1980‚Äì1982, instructing local officials to take this incident seriously and impose harsh punishments on perpetrators. However, only a small number of the perpetrators were ever punished, and none were sentenced to death. Several leaders of the massacre were either expelled from the Communist Party of China (CPC) or received various terms of imprisonment. In Dao County itself, 43 people who involved in the massacre were punished, with only 11 people being prosecuted, receiving 3‚Äì10 years in prison, respectively.

Background During the interwar period, Drohobych was a provincial town in the Lw√≥w Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic with 80,000 inhabitants, the seat of Drohobycz county with an area of and population of around 194,400 people. Drohobycz belonged to the Lw√≥w region of south-eastern Kresy, with a sizable Jewish population; exceeding that of Ukrainian and Polish. After the 1939 German-Soviet invasion of Poland, interwar Poland was divided in September 1939 between Nazi Germany and the USSR (see map). The town was annexed to the Soviet Ukraine. Drohobych became a centre of the newly expanded Drohobych Oblast in the Soviet zone of occupation. The repression of Poles and Polish citizens by the NKVD circled around the mass deportations of men, women and children to Siberia. History In early July 1941, during the first weeks of the German Operation Barbarossa, the city was captured by the Wehrmacht, and the District of Galicia was created. Drohobych had a petrol-producing plant essential for the German war effort. In September 1942, Drohobych became the site of a large, open type ghetto, holding around 10,000 Jews in anticipation of the final deportations to killing centres in Operation Reinhard. Jewish men of working age remained at the local refinery. Memorial Wall at former ghetto The first deportation action of 2,000 Jews from Drohobych to the Belzec extermination camp took place in late March 1942 as soon as the killing centre became operational. The next deportation lasted for nine days in 8-17 August 1942 with 2,500 more Jews loaded onto freight trains and sent away for gassing. Another 600 Jews were shot on the spot while attempting to hide or trying to flee. The ghetto was declared closed from the outside in late September. In October and November 1942 some 5,800 Jews were deported to Belzec. During these round-ups about 1,200 Jews attempting to flee were killed in the streets with the aid of the newly formed Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. The remaining slave-workers were transferred to labor facilities, with about 450 people murdered in February 1943. The last of the Drohobycz Jews were transported in groups to Bronicki Forest (las bronicki, i.e. Bronica Forest) and massacred over execution pits between 21 and 30 May 1943. One of the most notable inmates of the Drohobych Ghetto was Bruno Schulz, educator, graphic artist and author of popular books Street of Crocodiles and the Cinnamon Shops. \\"Hitler's Furies\\" by Wendy Lower. He painted murals for the children's room of one of the German officials before being shot, and after the war, became the most famous Polish writer detained and killed in the Ghetto. The mathematicians Juliusz Schauder and J√≥zef Schreier lived in the ghetto before their deaths in 1943.

The protagonist of the novel is Halli Sveinsson, a boy from a village nestled atop a mountain. Development Development for the book began in 2006, following the end of Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy, and finished in the summer of 2008. Stroud has stated that: > \\"I‚Äôve always liked reading Norse myths and legends, and the Icelandic Sagas, > written in the Middle Ages by the descendents of Vikings. The Sagas are > interesting because they mix ordinary domestic stories about farms and > families with sudden bits of supernatural stuff, featuring ghosts and > trolls. The fantasy never takes over, but it never goes away either; it‚Äôs > just taken for granted by the people as something on the margin of their > lives. I was keen to try a saga of my own, which would explore themes of > story-telling and family life, and began jotting down a few fragments of > story.\\" Plot Halli Sveinsson loves to hear stories from the days when the valley was a wild and dangerous place, besieged by the bloodthirsty Trow. Now farming has taken over from fighting Trows, and to Halli's disappointment, heroics seem a thing of the past. But when a practical joke rekindles an old blood feud, he sees a chance for a daring quest of his own. The tale begins with the Battle of the Rock being told to a child. This was when twelve heroes of the valley joined together to fight the ruthless Trows (man eating monsters) who were devastating the land. Taking up positions on a large rock, they were finally attacked at dusk by the Trows, who they fended off all night. In the morning, when the people returned to see what had happened, all were dead, Trows and Heroes, including Svein, their leader. The heroes were buried under cairns along the borders of the valley with their swords, so that, even in death, they could guard the boundaries from the Trows. As long as no one crosses the cairn border, the legends say, no Trows can enter the Valley. Many years later, Halli is born. He is a very short, stout, and headstrong boy who longs for the days of the Heroes, when a man could fight for what he wanted and take what he could win. He longs to leave the valley, which is now ruled by a Council of women who demand peace and equality in the land. They have outlawed swords and other weapons to discourage wars. Halli looks very much like his uncle Brodir, whom he adores. He is the third and last child in his family, who are Arnkel, his father and Arbiter of Svein's House, Astrid, his mother and Law-Giver of Svein's House, Leif, his older brother who is immediately in line for the Arbiter after Arnkel, Gudny, his sister and Brodir, who is the only relative who seems to get along with him. When his uncle is murdered by the rival house of Hakonssons, Halli sets off to avenge him. Finally, he thinks that he will have a hero's quest of his own. But during his journey, Halli realizes that he isn't the pitiless avenging killer that he thought he could be. His interference and thirst for revenge leads two men to their deaths, and he becomes sick with guilt. He returns home to his relieved yet angry family, and his distrusting and fearful fellow villagers. His actions eventually lead to an attack by the House of Hakon, and he alone can accept responsibility and take charge of his defenseless village. The enemy arrives and they have an obvious advantage--swords. Halli realizes that his peoples' only hope is if he lures the enemy in the dark past the cairn boundaries. He does so with the help of his friend, Aud Arnsdottir, and to his relief, it works. The Hakonssons are eaten by monsters in the moorlands. However, Halli and Aud also come under attack. Much like the heroes of old, they take their last stand on a large rock and await the unseen monsters.

He had little success and lost with great frequency to top boxers such as Sam Langford, Joe Jeanette, Sam McVey, Harry Wills and Kid Norfolk. In spite of this, Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, gave him a title shot. When they fought in Paris in August 1913, it was the first time that two black boxers had fought for the world heavyweight title. Battling Jim was the only black fighter Johnson faced during his reign as heavyweight champ from 1908 to 1915. Title Shot Battling Jim fought former colored champ Joe Jeanette four times between 19 July 1912 and 21 January 1912 and lost all four fights. The only fighter of note he did beat in that period was future colored champ Big Bill Tate, whom he K.O.-ed in the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout. It was Tate's third pro fight. In November 1913, the International Boxing Union had declared the world heavyweight title held by Jack Johnson to be vacant. The heavyweight title fight between the two Johnsons, scheduled for 10 rounds, was held on 19 December 1913 in Paris. It was the first time in history that two blacks had fought for the world heavyweight championship. Johnson v. Johnson While the Johnson v. Johnson fight had been billed as a world heavyweight title match, in many ways, it resembled an exhibition. A sportswriter from the Indianapolis Star reported that the fight crowd became unruly when it was apparent that neither boxer was putting up a fight. > \\"Jack Johnson, the heavyweight champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another > colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, met in a 10-round contest here > tonight, which ended in a draw.

The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting > that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no > confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence > at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was > obviously playing with his opponent. After that it was observed that he was > only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his > arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight > fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm > was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight > caused the fracture of the bone.\\" Because of the draw, Jack Johnson kept his championship. After the fight, he explained that his left arm was injured in the third round and he could not use it. Later career Battling Jim's next fight, four months later, also was a title match. On 27 March 1914 in New York City, Sam Langford won a newspaper decision in a ten-rounder with Johnson. According to the New York Times, the colored heavyweight champ \\"won by a wide margin\\" because Johnson \\"failed to show anything remotely resembling championship ability.\\" Battling Jim fought Langford ten more times (including two more colored title matches). Two of the fights were draws, including their last fight on 22 September 1918, which was also Battling Jim's last pro bout. He faced Joe Jeanette five more times and did not win a single contest. Two of their fights were draws and their last fight on 20 August 1918, Battling Jim's penultimate pro fight, was a no decision. Of the other colored heavyweight champs that Battling Jim battled, he won only one fight, against Harry Wills, because he broke his wrist blocking a punch in a non-title match and Johnson won by a technical knockout. Battling Jim lost his other two fights with Wills and lost the five fights he had with ex-colored heavyweight champ Sam McVey in the post-Jack Johnson title shot period. Illness and death Jim was signed to fight Sam Langford in a 12-round fight at the Crescent Athletic Club in Lowell, Massachusetts. However, the fight was postponed due to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. While waiting for the bout to be rescheduled, Johnson contracted the disease. After he was removed from the hospital, he died after a few days of pneumonia. Record and legacy Battling Jim ended with a career record of 30 wins against 31 losses and six draws when his newspaper decisions are factored in. Looking at his dismal performance with the top black heavyweights of his era and his inability to best a one-armed Jack Johnson, Battling Jim Johnson cannot be considered a top contender of his era or a worthy opponent when Jack Johnson awarded him the sole title shot given to a black boxer in the 29 years between Jack and Joe Louis winning the heavyweight crown.

She spent 21 years in various locations on the west of Scotland and 20 years at Rathlin Island, Northern Island before moving to Arranmore. History MV Canna was the seventh of eight Island Class ferry built for Caledonian MacBrayne. In November 2000, she was re-engined at Timbacraft, Shandon. In May 2009, MV Canna became the first CMAL (Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd) ship to receive its Inventory of Hazardous Materials (Green Passport). Layout The eight Island Class ferries, built between 1972 and 1976, were a very simple design, based on World War II landing craft. They had a two-part folding ramp at the bow, an open plan car deck incorporating a small turntable immediately aft and a sheltered area of passenger accommodation at the stern. The wheelhouse was above the passenger accommodation and the main mast above the ramp at the bow. A radar mast sat on top of the bridge, just forward of the small funnel and engine exhaust. Service MV Canna entered service with Calmac on the Raasay route in January 1976, initially from Portree, but this soon changed to a shorter crossing from Sconser. After only 3 months she was moved to the Lochaline crossing to Mull, where she remained for the next ten years. In 1986 MV Loch Linnhe and then the larger replaced Canna. After two years as spare vessel, Canna spent seven years crossing between Kyles Scalpay on Harris and the slipway on Scalpay - a crossing of just three minutes. In April 1997 she took over the Ballycastle - Rathlin Island crossing in Northern Ireland, replacing . She was operated by Calmac until 2008, when Rathlin Island Ferry Ltd took over the service, leasing the vessel from Caledonian Maritime Assets. After 20 years, in 2017, Canna was replaced by a new vessel, Spirit of Rathlin. Her future became uncertain and she was laid up at Burtonport, alongside her sisters, and . She was bought for service at Arranmore in County Donegal, Ireland before April 2018.

Along the coast towards Dawlish where the railway runs through the Parson's tunnel can be seen the twin stacks of the Parson and Clerk. Geology Parson's Tunnel The Parson and Clerk are composed of relatively friable sedimentary Teignmouth Breccia of Permian age, as are all the nearby cliffs. Their soft rock layers are preserved from erosion by the harder \\"caprock\\" that was deposited above their strata A further outer rock, Shag Rock, lost most of its height in a storm in 1984, and then lost its \\"head\\" in a storm in January 2003.\\"Rocks that inspired legend to vanish?\\" Western Morning News (Plymouth, England), 22 January 2003 The Parson and Clerk and the cliffs are easily viewed from the South West Coast Path which follows the Exeter to Newton Abbot railway line along the coast between Parson's Tunnel and Teignmouth. Legend Many versions of the story exist. Robert Hunt (in 1881) and Sarah Hewett (1900) relates that a certain Bishop of Exeter fell ill and came to Dawlish to restore his health. However, an ambitious local priest aimed to succeed to the See in the event of his superior's demise. The priest's guide was his clerk, and they often made the journey to check on the condition of the bishop. One night, in a terrible storm, whilst crossing Haldon moor they lost their way and found themselves miles from the correct path. The priest in his frustration abused his clerk with the words I would rather have the devil himself, than you, for a guide. At that moment a horseman rode by and volunteered to be their guide. After a few miles they came across a brilliantly lit mansion and were invited by their guide to enter and partake of his hospitality. They enjoyed a sumptuous repast and in the midst of the merriment the news arrived that the bishop was dead. Eager to secure his chance for promotion the priest prepared to leave, together with the clerk and the guide; however the horses refused to move. After liberal use of his whip and spurs the priest cried Devil take the brutes, upon which the guide exclaimed Thank you, sir and shouted Gee up. The horses galloped over the cliff, carrying the parson and the clerk with them. The devil turned them both to stone, facing forever seaward, monuments to greed and disappointed ambition. A slightly different version of the tale can be found in Legends of Devon, published by Leonard Avat Westcott in 1848. An unidentified elderly and still ambitious clergyman, who had acted as chaplain to a Royal Duke, had a stall at Wells, a prebend at Norwich, and a precentorship in Ireland was promised, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the next vacant See. The Parson took up residence at a house in East Devon, knowing that the Bishop of Exeter was old and in poor health. On a journey to the Bishop's Palace at Dawlish in a storm the Parson and his clerk (identified as Roger) are disappointed to hear that the Bishop is well and has been hunting deer. They come to a place where the road divides into five lanes and realise they are lost. In Westcott's version it is a footman who comes to their aid offering to guide them to Dawlish after the Parson shouts out, \\"I wish the Devil, I wish the Devil would put me on the short road to Dawlish\\". Despite being unmounted their guide is able to keep-up with the horses. When they reach the Bishop's parlour they hear the Bishop has only a few weeks to live. They are offered a feast of seafood, by a character called the Leech. The seafood is alive, and the other guests at the feast are at first unrecognised by the Parson, and then he realises that they are all deceased clergymen that the Parson once knew. After taking eight grains of opium the Parson and Clerk depart for Teignmouth in a direction suggested by the Leech, who promises them, \\"Safe lodgings and warm, I warrent ye\\", if they keep the rocks on their right. Suddenly the Bishop's Palace disappears and they find themselves on the beach, trapped between an incoming tide and the sandstone rocks. At this point in the story they dismount from their horses. The next day the carcases of their mounts are found. The Parson and clerk have disappeared. Two huge pillars of sandstone are found to have appeared on the shoreline though, with one topped with a rock formation resembling a cauliflower wig. In the version published in \\"Popular romances of the west of England; or, The drolls, traditions, and superstitions of old Cornwall\\" the guests at the feast turn into demons. The horses are found alive the next day and the bodies of the Parson and clerk are found clinging to two rocks which have the appearance of horses. Origin The story appears in 1848 in the anonymously-written Legends of Devon collection.Legends of Devon, 1848, London: Whittaker and Company, Exeter: Holden - Wallis, Dawlish LA Westcott. Google Books A correspondent to Notes and Queries in 1868 said that all the stories in the collection were original fiction without basis in folklore. > \\"The legends in question were severally composed by members of a very > agreeable little private society, some thirty years ago, of whom I was one. > The lady who collected and printed them, and was also one of the > contributors, is dead, and so are some of her associates; and to give the > names (even if I had permission), would interest few now.

In 1937, he began the Revolution of Ajloun by forming the Arab anti-colonial militant group Rebels of Ajloun. Until his death in 1957, he was associated with Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam. History of Aljoun King Ibn Saud and Al-Khuzai Al-Khuzai with his followers (supporters of Jordanian leaders) in 1933 Before the victory of the Turkish Empire (Ottomans) over the Mamluks in the battle of Marj Dabek, Ajloun Mountain (Jabal Ajloun in Arabic) was a base for emirates which controlled Jordan and portions of Palestine. The strength of the principality and its rulers led the Ottomans to name Ajloun the Emirates of Ajloun (a sanjak) in 1517. The town of Kufranjah is the seat of tribal and emirate governance through the al-Fraihat family, who ruled the region for hundreds of years and protected pilgrims to the Levant. The Ajloun region and Prince Rashed Al- Khuzai are known to the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership. The city of Ajloun, in Jordan's Hashemite Kingdom, has supplied liberation movements. Its government, formed at the 1920 foundation of the Emirate of East Jordan, struggled against colonialism. Before 1920, the emirate of Ajloun was governed by the Ottoman sultan Prince Rashid bin Khuzai Alfraihat, ruler of the southern Levant (Jordan and portions of Palestine). Before the 1920 formation of the Ajloun Governorate, Rashid appointed Ali Niazi Al-Tal as governor and Abdullah Rehani chief of security and police; al-Khuzai represented the Ottoman sultan as prince. At the beginning of Ottoman rule in the sandjak in 1517, Ajloun included the Houran plains, present-day Jordan and the city of Nablus. Al-Khuzai was known as the Prince of Ajloun Mountain, Father of Ajloun, Father of the (1937) Ajloun revolution, and Godfather of Ajloun. Jordanian prince In 1945, a group of Jordanian and Levantine leaders welcomed al-Khuzai and his family's return after eight years in Saudi Arabia as guests of King Ibn Saud. Al-Khuzai was born in Kufranjeh in 1850, the son of Prince Khuzai bin Durgham bin Fayyad bin Prince Mustafa bin Salameh Al- Fraihat. His ancestors had ruled the region for generations, and he made the Mountain of Ajloun its capital. The region included the Houran plains, Dur‚Äôaa, Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun, and the city of Nablus. He ruled the southern Levant before King Abdullah I, who established Transjordan with the support of the British Mandate and its allies. Al-Khuzai's family had focused on leading the Ajloun clan through literacy and religious education. He received his education in the home of his father, Prince Khuzai, which was an administrative gathering place. Prince Khuzai, who commanded an army of thousands, allied with the al-Adawn tribe; Al-Fraihat Castle was held by that tribe until 1922, when it was taken by the Jordanian leadership of Crown Prince Abdullah I and renamed Alrabad and (later) Ajloun Castle. Al-Khuzai was the only Jordanian who supported Omar Mukhtar's revolution against Italian colonialism in Libya, financially, with ammunition and weapons, and by supplying manpower. Religious unity When sectarian strife erupted in Lebanon and Syria near the end of the Ottoman Empire, al-Khuzai accepted Christians refugees and protected Christians in eastern Jordan. He said that any assault or abuse directed at a Christian would be considered an attack on him, his tribe and all tribes under his rule, and would be punished. Al-Khuzai received a gift from the pope in 1887, the first Arab leader to do so. He and Muhammad Ali of Egypt were the only two leaders given the title of pasha by the Ottoman sultan. Palestine and exile 1937 article in the Egyptian newspaper Al Sabah reporting Saudi King Ibn Saud's offer of political asylum to al-Khuzai, his family and followers Before the formation of the Emirate of East Jordan and the emergence of local governments (such as the government of Ajloun) in 1920, al-Khuzai ruled the plains of Houran, Irbid, Ajloun, Jarash, and the city of Nablus. He supported Palestinian revolutions in 1935 and 1936, protecting and supplying the rebels and meeting with other Palestinian leaders. Supporters of al-Khuzai confronted the Jordanian regime led by King Abdullah I and the British Mandate, who bombed his positions and killed many of his supporters. In 1937, al-Khuzai and a group of fellow Jordanian leaders of Jordan in 1937 left Jordan for Saudi Arabia. After nearly eight years as a guest of King Ibn Saud, they were welcomed back by the Jordanian tribes and Arab rebels and nationalists. During al-Khuzai's exile, supporters blew up a Jordanian oil pipeline from Iraq. A number of Palestinian guerrillas in the 1982 war in Lebanon had pictures of al-Khuzai in their pockets with their ammunition. Nationalism Al-Khuzai suggested a Jordanian national conference, which he led in 1928. It opposed giving Palestine to the Jews and resisted what it saw as traitors in eastern Jordan and Arab leaders who wanted to broker Palestine. He supported Arab liberation movements such as the Syrian revolution, and supported Kufranjeh when hundreds of activists fled there from Syria on July 25, 1920. Al-Khuzai made his birthplace a major location for members of the Independence Party, while Syrian revolutionary leaders used his home as a communications base. He transformed Kufranjeh and Ajloun into bases of struggle against colonialism and joined the Arab nationalists. Al-Khuzai led a number of demonstrations, including one in Irbid which protested the June 17, 1930 execution of Palestinian activists Fuad Hijazi, Atta Al-Zeer, and Mohammad Khaleel Jamjoum by the British. After the Buraq revolution which began in Jerusalem on August 9, 1929, he had a prominent role in the Islamic conference held in that city. Al-Khuzai's main goals were Arab unity and freedom from colonialism, exemplified by his participation in the Bloudan Conference of 1937. Al-Khuzai's revolution reflected Jordanian needs for freedom, democracy, and unity with the Palestinian people, and much information about him was hidden by the Jordanian regime. Death and legacy A photo taken 06 March 1989 of Sh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces during a visit to Sh Hassan Rashed Al-Khuzai at his house in Amman, the capital of Jordan He died in Kufranjeh in 1957, and poems have commemorated him.

From 1908 to 1910 he attended Brandon College in Manitoba, and in 1911 he joined the school board under the late Hugh McClellan, then building superintendent. In 1912, Mr. Branton became his assistant and eight years later rose to the position of building superintendent and architect; positions he held until his retirement. He was responsible for the construction of 60 plus schools during his tenure. About the School The school was built in 1955 and is situated on 10.092 acres. In 1986 it was significantly damaged by fire at its south end, and much of it was rebuilt to the original plan. The 31 classroom spaces in the building include 3 portables located west of the main building, 1 computer lab, 4 science labs, 2 home economics facilities (cooking, fashion), a drama room, industrial arts facility and a music room. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, some upgrading of the school occurred to science labs, the computer lab and the library (now referred to as the Alf Boldt Resource Centre in recognition of one of its previous principals). The school has a main gymnasium and stage on the main floor, a well-equipped fitness room and a smaller gymnasium below. There is a lunch/kitchen area there as well, and during the lunch hours, the entire lower concourse, gym, and lunchroom provide space for up to 550 students who stay for lunch. The school is famous for its \\"earthworm,\\" an indoor track facility built by removing earthfill in the crawl spaces below the main building. The initiative was begun in 1960 with the leadership of R.B. Wilberg, physical education instructor and E.M. Borgal, the principal. The area is no longer used (because of poor air quality), as it once was, to train track teams during the winter months. Beginning in the 2019-2020 school year, due to school board-wide changes, Branton includes students from four grades (Grades 6 to 9) rather than the traditional three for Junior High School (Grade 7 to 9). Options There are quite a few options in here. Only 7 are offered to grade 7's, but more will be added on for later grades. The options include: *Dance *Art *Drama *Cooking *Fashion *Graphics *Leadership *Applied Technology *Animation *Photography *Multimedia *Industrial Arts or Construction or Woodshop *Band-This is a full year option, so it will take up 2 of the 4 slots for options, since you get 4 options a year, 2 per semester. When band is taken, you get one other option per semester, but Late Immersion grade 7 must take FSL+ (French Second Language Plus) for the first semester Band This school offers a wide selection of instruments, one of the largest for junior high in Calgary. Currently there are 10 instruments. *Oboe *Clarinet *Flute *Trumpet *Bassoon *Trombone *French Horn *Bass Clarinet *Tuba *Baritone or Euphonium Band is the largest option in school, with 134 grade 7's in 2010-11. Immersions Late Immersion- This is an immersion where students are having grade 7 as their first year having a French school. They will have separate teachers and curriculum to the Continuing Immersion, who have been in French since Kindergarten/Grade 1. They will learn all the terminology needed for the class. All French classes include- *Social Studies *Math *Science *FLA (French Language Arts) Continuing Immersion- Are with students that are continuing on with French after 6‚Äì7 years in school as the main language. They will do the Provincial curriculum but in French. By grade 9, both immersions will be put together in mixed classes.

Historically there were two parts: Gornja (Upper) Drenova and Donja (Lower) Drenova, nowadays united in one. Drenova has the largest cemetery and park area of the city. The motto of the local board is \\"Drenova - green lung of the city\\".  Geography  Drenova is located above Rijeka and includes a plateau and the area bordered in the north with Rjeƒçina river and local districts: Bra≈°ƒáine-Pulac and Pa≈°ac in the east, ≈†kurinje in the west, ≈†kurinjska Draga in the south. Drenova is also bordered with the municipalities: Vi≈°kovo in the northwest, Jelenje in the north and ƒåavle in the east.  Population  According to the 2011 census,MO Drenova Drenova has 7624 inhabitants.  The Council of the Local Board  The Council of the Local Board has seven members, and the President is Sa≈°a Jure≈°iƒá (SDP, HNS, PGS, SDSS).  History  The settlement Drenova originated approximately 300 to 400 years ago. There were formed hamlets Podbreg, Macani, Klanjac, Kablari, Brdina and others. The residents of these small, scattered settlements were called Drenovƒçani. The name was derived from the cornel (dren), the forest fruit, which grows in the Drenova's forests. The settlement stretched from today's Shooting range to Benƒçani and covered the area of Lopaƒça, by the Rjeƒçina valley including Grohovo. Significant year in the history of Drenova, especially for the literacy of the inhabitants, is certainly in 1838 when the vicar Ivan Cvetko founded a church parish and began to gather and teach the children. By his advocacy in 1844 began construction of a school that was completed and start working in 1852. By the new City Statut in 1872 Drenova becomes a municipality, and the citizens of Drenova equal in rights and duties with the citizens of Rijeka. Significant persons who attended Drenova's school are: writer and journalist Ivo Grohovac Rijeƒçanin and Fran_Frankoviƒá, father of teaching and education of Istria, professor and director of the Teacher's School in Kastav, professor at the Teacher's School in Kopar, author of the first Croatian Spelling Book issued in Vienna in 1911, founder of the Croatian Public Reading Room on Drenova in 1908. Under the Roman Treaty of 1924, Drenova was divided by the border. This division created the localities of Donja and Gornja Drenova, whose names have been preserved until today. Donja (lok. Dolnja) Drenova was part of Italy and Gornja Drenova of Yugoslavia at that time. Because of division, Gornja Drenova remained without school, church, cemetery and many people employed in Italian Rijeka without work and bread. People from Gornja Drenova wanted - if they were already separated from Rijeka - to be associated to Su≈°ak, which was also part of Yugoslavia. But, at the end Gornja Drenova was joined to Kastav. In the period before and after the First World War, in the time of political struggles around Rijeka, the work of the Drenova's Public Reading Room played an important role in gathering locals and spreading activities in culture as well as in preserving national consciousness. The work of the elementary school in Gornja Drenova began in 1924 in the private house of Fran Frankoviƒá (Toniƒái) and in 1930 a new school was built at Tuniƒá, in which the distinguished teacher Ivan Ribariƒá - Istranin worked. The school worked until the beginning of World War II. The Germans burned it in 1943. In 1929, the old idea and desire of Drenovƒçani was realized and the National House in Lokva was built, which became the center of Drenova's cultural and national life. The beginning of the Second World War takes place in special circumstances. The locals were organized and included in the National Liberation Movement. Organizers and leaders of these activities were young people. Drenova had a tough time. For such a small community, forty-five dead locals were a big victim. With intense social housing construction in the late 1970s, Drenova became urban and residential area within Rijeka.

Anger‚Äôs work is noted for its impressionistic atmosphere, his use of light and bold application of colours. Biography From 1945 Heinz attended elementary and primary school in Favoriten, a district of Vienna, Austria. In 1955 he started studying at the Graphische Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt (\\"Die Graphische\\"), the college for graphics and media in Vienna. His teachers included Professor Karl Zecho (1896‚Äì1965) and Rudolf Reinkenhof (1905‚Äì1980). From 1959 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna where he worked with Professor Sergius Pauser (1896‚Äì1970). In 1960 he joined the class of Albert Paris G√ºtersloh (1887‚Äì1973). Portrait Leonie Rysanek, Oil 1962 After leaving academy he launched a career as a graphic artist and then freelance illustrator working for leading marketing agencies. In 1962 Anger was commissioned to paint a portrait of Viennese soprano Leonie Rysanek. In search of his own artistic expression he was influenced by different movements during the following years; his 1960s‚Äô paintings reflected the spirit of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. From 1970 he created a range of panels and drawings in a kind of Austrian Pop Art, oriented on the works of Richard Lindner and Hans Bellmer; they were shown in an exhibition in Galleria Viotti in Turin, Italy in 1976. From 1979 he gradually developed a new painting style he today considers to be ‚Äúreally his‚Äù, and managed the transition from graphic artist to full-time painter. In 1986 Prof. Dr. Hans Bankl offered him an opportunity to create drawings within the Department of Pathology at his hospital. From 1994 Anger made regular visits to Venice where he found motifs for a range of water colours and oils. In 1987 Anger had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Zentrum in Vienna. It was followed by two further exhibitions, in 1989 and 1992. In 2000 his first solo exhibition at Galerie Tulbingerkogel, near Vienna, was staged, followed by a second in 2002. Anger's work has since been showcased at a number of venues in and around Vienna. Painting Heinz Anger's paintings belong to representational (non-abstract) art. Anger main works are water colours and lithographies, predominantly representing landscapes, as well as oil paintings which include portraits, figurative art and still lifes in addition to landscapes.

The Witch fears a prophecy which states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned kings and queens of Narnia, which will not only mean the end of her reign but of her life.

Due to the air raids on London, thousands of children are evacuated from the capital to rural Britain. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are siblings aged between 8 and 14. They are sent to live with Professor Digory Kirke at his large house in the countryside. Soon after arriving, the children decide to explore the house on a rainy day. Lucy, who is the youngest, discovers a mysterious wardrobe and on entering it, finds herself in the middle of a snowy wood with a lamp post. She meets a faun who introduces himself as Mr. Tumnus and reveals that Lucy has entered the land of Narnia. The faun invites Lucy to his cave for some tea and plays a tune on his flute which forces her into a deep sleep where she sees visions of what Narnia was like before winter arrived many years before. Lucy suddenly wakes up and realises she must go home but Mr. Tumnus breaks down and reveals that he is employed (albeit unwillingly) by the evil White Witch, who makes it \\"always winter but never Christmas\\" in Narnia. The Witch has ordered all Narnians to hand over any humans (or 'Sons of Adam' and ' Daughters of Eve' as they are known) should they spot any in Narnia. The faun realises he cannot hand over Lucy to the evil Witch, as he hadn't known what humans were like until he met Lucy. He guides her back to the lamp post and she returns through the Wardrobe. Lucy tells her siblings of what she discovered in the wardrobe but they find nothing when they look. This, along with the fact that no time passed on Earth when Lucy entered the wardrobe, lead her siblings to believe that Lucy has been lying. Peter and Susan kindly try to get Lucy to admit that it was \\"just a story\\", while Edmund makes spiteful comments like \\"found any new countries in the wardrobe?\\". A few days later, during a game of hide and seek, Lucy returns to the wardrobe and Edmund follows her. To Edmund's shock, he finds that Lucy was telling the truth about the country in the back of the wardrobe, but Lucy is nowhere to be seen when he enters Narnia. He carries on walking and calling out through the forest, when suddenly he hears a jingling of bells, and is approached by a great white-skinned lady on a horse-drawn sledge driven by a dwarf. =Episode 2= The white-skinned lady introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia and demands to know what Edmund is. On learning that Edmund is a son of Adam, she invites him to set on her sledge, and gives him a hot drink and Turkish delight. During their conversation, Edmund informs the Queen that he has a brother and two sisters and that Lucy had previously been to Narnia and met a faun. The Queen asks Edmund to return to his own world and bring his siblings to her house in Narnia, saying she will give him more Turkish delight if he does. She also makes him the offer of becoming a prince and then king of Narnia. Edmund is delighted by the Queen's offers. After the Queen leaves, Edmund heads back to the lamp post and is approached by an excited Lucy, who reveals that she has been with Mr. Tumnus, who has not been caught by the White Witch. When Lucy describes the White Witch, Edmund shockingly realises that she is none other than the lady he had just befriended - however, he does not tell Lucy of his encounter with her. Lucy is too excited to be alarmed by Edmund's facial expressions when he realises who the White Witch is, and does not question him when he asks what the White Witch looks like - which could be seen as a likely hint that he has met or at least seen the White Witch. Back in their own country, Lucy tells Peter and Susan that Edmund has also got into Narnia, but Edmund lies saying that he and Lucy were only pretending that Narnia existed. Peter is furious with Edmund for setting Lucy off, especially after Edmund had been treating Lucy cruelly over her 'false' stories of Narnia. Peter and Susan seek advice from Professor Kirke who is completely convinced that logically, Lucy is telling the truth - as she clearly isn't a liar and is obviously not \\"mad\\". A few days pass and the four children are on the run from the Professor's housekeeper who is hosting a tour of the house. They end up hiding in the wardrobe and all find themselves in Narnia, realising that Lucy was indeed right. Lucy guides them to Mr. Tumnus's cave, but find him gone and his cave ransacked. They discover a note, signed by Maugrim - captain of the secret police - saying that Mr. Tumnus has been arrested for high treason against the Queen of Narnia, which includes fraternising with humans. =Episode 3= Lucy tells the others that the Queen is really the White Witch and convinces them to do something to save Mr. Tumnus, as she feels responsible for him being arrested. They travel on and soon encounter Mr. Beaver, who proves to be a friend by showing them a handkerchief which Lucy had given to Mr. Tumnus earlier. Mr. Beaver informs the children that Aslan is on the move - the name Aslan invokes an odd feeling in all four children. Mr. Beaver takes the children to his home. There, he and his wife Mrs. Beaver reveal that Mr. Tumnus was taken to the Witch's house and that he would have been turned into stone, as are most Narnians who go there. The children are given more information on Aslan, who is the Great Lion and the true king of Narnia who will save Mr. Tumnus. The Beavers also reveal that the children are part of a prophecy that states that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will be crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, which means that it will be not only the end of the White Witch's reign, but of her life. It is for this reason that the White Witch is always looking out for humans in Narnia. Lucy suddenly realises that Edmund has disappeared - Mr. Beaver instantly realises that he has betrayed them to the White Witch. He is more convinced of this when he learns that Edmund had previously been to Narnia alone and not told his siblings what he had done or who he had met. He first had his suspicions about Edmund when first seeing him, as he \\"had the look of one who had been with the witch\\". The Beavers realise that the Witch will soon come after them and prepare for their journey to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. Edmund arrives at the Witch's house - the Witch is furious that he came alone and even more furious when he tells her that Aslan has come to Narnia. =Episode 4= The Witch sends Maugrim to kill the Beavers and Edmund's siblings. When Maugrim and another wolf arrive at the Beaver's house, they discover it empty and on the Witch's orders, make their way to the Stone Table, with the harsh weather meaning that they have no tracks or scent to follow. The Witch, Edmund and her dwarf head for the Stone Table on her sledge, while the beavers and the other three children set off on foot and eventually reach a cave. Mr. Beaver explains that it is an old hiding place for beavers in bad times, and that they need to stop for a few hours of sleep. The next morning, the Beavers and the children hear sleigh bells and think it is the Witch. Mr Beaver leaves the cave to investigate. However, to their delight, it is not the Witch but Father Christmas, who gives gifts to the children - for Peter, a sword and shield, for Susan a horn and bow and arrow and for Lucy a cordial and a dagger. Meanwhile, the Witch comes across a group of animals sharing a Christmas feast and demands to know where they got it. A fox reveals that Father Christmas gave it to them for which they are turned into stone. Signs of the Witch's magic being weakened are evident when the snow melts, turning into spring. The spring forces the Witch to travel on foot with Edmund to the stone table. =Episode 5= The children and the Beavers arrive safely at the Stone Table and are greeted warmly by Aslan and his followers. They inform Aslan of Edmund's betrayal and Aslan promises to do all he can to save Edmund. Peter is shown a far-off sight of Cair Paravel, the castle where he and his siblings will be crowned. Susan soon blows her horn (something Father Christmas advised her to do when she is in danger). Maugrim has arrived and scares the followers of Aslan and engages Peter in a battle, which the latter wins, being crowned Sir Peter Wolf's Bane by Aslan. Aslan also sends many of his followers to rescue Edmund when he sees one of Maugrim's wolves running to inform the White Witch. They manage to rescue Edmund, just as the Witch is about to kill him. Edmund is safely returned where he patches up with his siblings. The Witch approaches the Stone Table, demanding right over Edmund's life, as according to the deep magic all traitors belong to her. In a private conversation with the Witch, Aslan convinces her to spare Edmund. He advises Peter on the upcoming battle against the Witch and her army and informs him that he himself cannot promise to be there. Later that night, Susan and Lucy who have noticed Aslan's sorrowful state since his conversation with the Witch, accompany Aslan out of the camp. They reach the Stone Table where Aslan tells them to stay hidden. The Witch and her army are waiting there where they bind Aslan to the stone table, shave and muzzle him. The Witch then reveals that Aslan had agreed to be killed instead of Edmund and tells Aslan, that nothing can stop her from killing Edmund once Aslan is dead. She then kills Aslan with her knife and leads her followers into war. =Episode 6= After the Witch and her army leave the camp, Susan and Lucy tearfully stay by Aslan's body. In the morning, they hear a loud crash and discover the Table has cracked and that Aslan's body is gone. Aslan soon reveals that he is alive and well, much to the happiness of Susan and Lucy who joyfully embrace him. Aslan reveals that he was saved from death due to a deeper magic which the Witch did not know, having only entered Narnia at the dawn of time. The deeper magic states that when a willing victim who has committed no crime offers his life in place of a traitor, the Stone Table will crack, reversing death. Aslan brings the girls to the Witch's castle where he restores all the stone victims of the Witch, including Mr. Tumnus. Meanwhile, the battle is in full swing with the Witch having turned many of Aslan's army into stone. Edmund destroys her wand, but is wounded in the process. Aslan arrives with those he saved at the Witch's castle. He roars so loudly that the ground the Witch is standing on begins to shake, forcing her to fall to her death. Lucy uses her magic cordial to restore all those injured, including Edmund who is knighted by Aslan. The next day, Aslan leads his followers to Cair Paravel where he crowns the Pevensie children as kings and queens of Narnia. He then leaves, much to the dismay of the Pevensie children. Mr. Beaver informs them that Aslan will come and go, as he has other countries to attend to. He also tells them that Aslan is wild and not a tame lion. The Pevensie children rule Narnia many years, keeping peace. One day, they are travelling through the forest and discover the same lamp post which they passed on entering Narnia through the wardrobe as children. They ponder over what the object is whilst they walk further on. They soon find themselves back through the wardrobe, children once again. They realise that no time has gone by since they entered Narnia. They tell the Professor of their adventures in Narnia and he easily believes them, implying that they are not the only children to have experienced such an adventure.

The film presents an overview of French life and politics though the changes within one family in southwestern France from the 1930s through the 1970s. Plot At the beginning of the 20th century, P√©dret, a Spanish immigrant, arrives in the southwest French country side. He becomes a blacksmith and marries Augustine, the daughter of the village baker. By 1936 P√©dret‚Äôs forge has become a foundry where his three sons are the managers. Years later when Augustine, now a bourgeois matriarch, realizes that her son Hector is having an affair with Berthe, a lowly seamstress, she tries to ruin Berthe‚Äôs business and drive her out of town even if it means bribing her. But old P√©dret, who knows that his sons have their spirits broken, can see that Berthe has the blunt good sense they lack, and he arranges for Bethe and Hector to be married. While the bourgeois wives of the two other sons mope and become peevish, Berthe makes herself useful. In the war, she is a heroine of the Resistance; when the business is imperiled by a strike, she settles it by acceding to the workers demands. She takes over the dominant role in management, and becomes the new matriarch as well. In contrast with the practical Berthe, Regina, her sister in law, is flighty. Dark and beautiful, Regina is married to Prosper, P√©dret‚Äôs youngest son and the only one with a college education. But Regina and the handsome, refined Prosper are a mismatch. A rapacious dreamer, Regina, fed up with the dull austerity of provincial society, runs off with an American soldier. Eventually, Berthe comes to control the family's fortunes, but economic challenges in the 1950s force her to turn to an unlikely source for financial help: her obnoxious sister-in-law Regina who has come back, more stunning than ever, with an American industrialist lover. Regina may now be willing to aid Berthe in exchange for her freedom.

The film traces the lives of its characters through the period of Nazi occupation to the present day, but their story is secondary. The focus of the film is the family-owned factory. We see its birth, its maturing, and its decline, as if it were a living thing. Around it, times change, the people change, social attitudes and hair-styles change, but the factory remains there, immutable and indifferent.

The International Prototype of the Kilogram (referred to by metrologists as the IPK; sometimes called the ur-kilogram, or urkilogram, particularly by German-language authors writing in English:30) is an object that was used to define the magnitude of the mass of the kilogram from 1889, when it replaced the Kilogramme des Archives, until 2019, when it was replaced by a new definition of the kilogram based on physical constants. During that time, the IPK and its duplicates were used to calibrate all other kilogram mass standards on Earth. The IPK is a roughly golfball-sized object made of a platinum alloy known as \\"Pt10Ir\\", which is 90% platinum and 10% iridium (by mass) and is machined into a right- circular cylinder with height equal to its diameter of about 39millimetres to reduce its surface area. The addition of 10% iridium improved upon the all- platinum Kilogramme des Archives by greatly increasing hardness while still retaining platinum's many virtues: extreme resistance to oxidation, extremely high density (almost twice as dense as lead and more than 21 times as dense as water), satisfactory electrical and thermal conductivities, and low magnetic susceptibility. The IPK and its six sister copies are stored at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (known by its French-language initials BIPM) in an environmentally monitored safe in the lower vault located in the basement of the BIPM's Pavillon de Breteuil in Saint-CloudThe Pavillon's (and hence the BIPM's) postal address is in the neighboring commune of S√®vres, so it is often reported as being located there, but the grounds are in the commune of Saint-Cloud (OpenStreetMap). on the outskirts of Paris (see External images, below, for photographs). Three independently controlled keys are required to open the vault. Official copies of the IPK were made available to other nations to serve as their national standards. These were compared to the IPK roughly every 40 years, thereby providing traceability of local measurements back to the IPK.The International Bureau of Weights and Measures official site: Verifications, retrieved August 4, 2013  Creation  The Metre Convention was signed on 20 May 1875 and further formalised the metric system (a predecessor to the SI), quickly leading to the production of the IPK.

Colonnetti in Turin (62).  Stability of the IPK  Before 2019, by definition, the error in the measured value of the IPK's mass was exactly zero; the mass of the IPK was the kilogram. However, any changes in the IPK's mass over time could be deduced by comparing its mass to that of its official copies stored throughout the world, a rarely undertaken process called \\"periodic verification\\". The only three verifications occurred in 1889, 1948, and 1989. For instance, the US owns five 10%iridium (Pt10Ir) kilogram standards, two of which, K4 and K20, are from the original batch of 40 replicas delivered in 1884.The other two Pt10Ir standards owned by the US are K79, from a new series of prototypes that were diamond-turned directly to a finish mass, and K85, which is used for Kibble balance experiments. The K20 prototype was designated as the primary national standard of mass for the US. Both of these, as well as those from other nations, are periodically returned to the BIPM for verification. Great care is exercised when transporting prototypes. In 1984, the K4 and K20 prototypes were hand-carried in the passenger section of separate commercial airliners. Note that none of the replicas has a mass precisely equal to that of the IPK; their masses are calibrated and documented as offset values. For instance, K20, the US's primary standard, originally had an official mass of (micrograms) in 1889; that is to say, K20 was 39Œºg less than the IPK. A verification performed in 1948 showed a mass of . The latest verification performed in 1989 shows a mass precisely identical to its original 1889 value. Quite unlike transient variations such as this, the US's check standard, K4, has persistently declined in mass relative to the IPK‚Äîand for an identifiable reason: check standards are used much more often than primary standards and are prone to scratches and other wear. K4 was originally delivered with an official mass of in 1889, but as of 1989 was officially calibrated at and ten years later was Over a period of 110 years, K4 lost 41Œºg relative to the IPK. Mass drift over time of national prototypes , plus two of the IPK's sister copies: K32 and K8(41).Prototype No. 8(41) was accidentally stamped with the number 41, but its accessories carry the proper number 8. Since there is no prototype marked 8, this prototype is referred to as 8(41). All mass changes are relative to the IPK. The initial 1889 starting-value offsets relative to the IPK have been nulled. The above are all relative measurements; no historical mass- measurement data is available to determine which of the prototypes has been most stable relative to an invariant of nature. There is the distinct possibility that all the prototypes gained mass over 100 years and that K21, K35, K40, and the IPK simply gained less than the others. Beyond the simple wear that check standards can experience, the mass of even the carefully stored national prototypes can drift relative to the IPK for a variety of reasons, some known and some unknown. Since the IPK and its replicas are stored in air (albeit under two or more nested bell jars), they gain mass through adsorption of atmospheric contamination onto their surfaces. Accordingly, they are cleaned in a process the BIPM developed between 1939 and 1946 known as \\"the BIPM cleaning method\\" that comprises firmly rubbing with a chamois soaked in equal parts ether and ethanol, followed by steam cleaning with bi-distilled water, and allowing the prototypes to settle for days before verification. Before the BIPM's published report in 1994 detailing the relative change in mass of the prototypes, different standard bodies used different techniques to clean their prototypes. The NIST's practice before then was to soak and rinse its two prototypes first in benzene, then in ethanol, and to then clean them with a jet of bi-distilled water steam. Cleaning the prototypes removes between 5 and 60Œºg of contamination depending largely on the time elapsed since the last cleaning. Further, a second cleaning can remove up to 10Œºg more. After cleaning‚Äîeven when they are stored under their bell jars‚Äîthe IPK and its replicas immediately begin gaining mass again. The BIPM even developed a model of this gain and concluded that it averaged 1.11Œºg per month for the first 3 months after cleaning and then decreased to an average of about 1Œºg per year thereafter. Since check standards like K4 are not cleaned for routine calibrations of other mass standards‚Äîa precaution to minimise the potential for wear and handling damage‚Äîthe BIPM's model of time-dependent mass gain has been used as an \\"after cleaning\\" correction factor. Because the first forty official copies are made of the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using a large number of replicas‚Äîespecially the national primary standards, which are rarely used‚Äîcan convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50Œºg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies. The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world.Conjecture why the IPK drifts, R. Steiner, NIST, Sep 11, 2007. Moreover, there are no technical means available to determine whether or not the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass \\"relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000Œºg over a period of 100 or even 50 years\\". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25Œºg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.The mean change in mass of the first batch of replicas relative to the IPK over one hundred years is +23.5Œºg with a standard deviation of 30Œºg. Per The Third Periodic Verification of National Prototypes of the Kilogram , G.Girard, Metrologia 31 (1994) Pg.323, Table3. Data is for prototypes K1, K5, K6, K7, K8(41), K12, K16, K18, K20, K21, K24, K32, K34, K35, K36, K37, K38, and K40; and excludes K2, K23, and K39, which are treated as outliers. This is a larger data set than is shown in the chart at the top of this section, which corresponds to Figure7 of G.Girard's paper. What is known specifically about the IPK is that it exhibits a short-term instability of about 30Œºg over a period of about a month in its after-cleaned mass.Report to the CGPM, 14th meeting of the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), April 2001, 2. (ii); General Conference on Weights and Measures, 22nd Meeting, October 2003, which stated \\"The kilogram is in need of a new definition because the mass of the prototype is known to vary by several parts in 108 over periods of time of the order of a month ...\\" (3.2MB ZIP file, here). The precise reason for this short-term instability is not understood but is thought to entail surface effects: microscopic differences between the prototypes' polished surfaces, possibly aggravated by hydrogen absorption due to catalysis of the volatile organic compounds that slowly deposit onto the prototypes as well as the hydrocarbon-based solvents used to clean them.BBC, Getting the measure of a kilogram It has been possible to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence is dependent on the amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the prototype or its copies have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury thermometer since at least as far back as the late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250Œºg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world's prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK prompted research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using diamond turning on newly manufactured replicas and was one of the reasons that led to the redefinition of the Kilogram.General section citations: Recalibration of the US National Prototype Kilogram, R.S.Davis, Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards, 90 (4): 263-281, 1985 (5.5MB PDF, here); and The Kilogram and Measurements of Mass and Force, Z.J.Jabbour et al., Journal of research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology 106, 2001, (3.5MB PDF, here) Dependency of the SI on the IPK Until May 2019, the magnitude of many of the units comprising the SI system of measurement, including most of those used in the measurement of electricity and light, were highly dependent upon the stability of a -year- old, golf-ball-sized cylinder of metal stored in a vault in France. The stability of the IPK was crucial because the kilogram underpinned much of the SI system of measurement as it was defined and structured until 2019. For instance, the newton is defined as the force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly then the newton would also change proportionally. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. Until May 2019, the ampere was also defined relative to the newton. With the magnitude of the primary units of electricity thus determined by the kilogram, so followed many others, namely the coulomb, volt, tesla, and weber. Even units used in the measure of light would be affected; the candela‚Äîfollowing the change in the would in turn affect the lumen andlux. Because the magnitude of many of the units comprising the SI system of measurement was until 2019 defined by its mass, the quality of the IPK was diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. However, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another Œºg since the third periodic verification years ago.Assuming the past trend continues, whereby the mean change in mass of the first batch of replicas relative to the IPK over one hundred years was +23.5œÉ30Œºg. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted. = Insulating effects of practical realisations = Fortunately, definitions of the SI units are quite different from their practical realisations. For instance, the metre is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum during a time interval of of a second. However, the metre's practical realisation typically takes the form of a helium‚Äìneon laser, and the metre's length is delineated‚Äînot defined‚Äîas wavelengths of light from this laser. Now suppose that the official measurement of the second was found to have drifted by a few parts per billion (it is actually extremely stable with a reproducibility of a few parts in 1015). There would be no automatic effect on the metre because the second‚Äîand thus the metre's length‚Äîis abstracted via the laser comprising the metre's practical realisation. Scientists performing metre calibrations would simply continue to measure out the same number of laser wavelengths until an agreement was reached to do otherwise. The same is true with regard to the real-world dependency on the kilogram: if the mass of the IPK was found to have changed slightly, there would be no automatic effect upon the other units of measure because their practical realisations provide an insulating layer of abstraction. Any discrepancy would eventually have to be reconciled though, because the virtue of the SI system is its precise mathematical and logical harmony amongst its units. If the IPK's value were to have been definitively proven to have changed, one solution would have been to simply redefine the kilogram as being equal to the mass of the IPK plus an offset value, similarly to what had previously been done with its replicas; e.g., \\"the kilogram is equal to the mass of the (equivalent to 42Œºg). The long-term solution to this problem, however, was to liberate the SI system's dependency on the IPK by developing a practical realisation of the kilogram that can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. The units of measure in such a practical realisation would have their magnitudes precisely defined and expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants. While major portions of the SI system are still based on the kilogram, the kilogram is now in turn based on invariant, universal constants of nature.

His college education was completed at Harvard, where he dedicated forty years to mycological and botanical research. His five-volume series on fungi in the order Laboulbeniales laid a solid foundation of research on these insect ectoparasites. He also contributed to the field of Plant Pathology. Biography Roland Thaxter was born in Newtonville, Massachusetts, 1858, the third and youngest child in the family. His parents were Levi Thaxter and Celia Thaxter. He married Mabel Gray Thaxter in 1887. Thaxter's personality was influenced greatly by his literary family. His father was a lawyer and an authority who brought the works of the poet Robert Browning to the American public. His mother, Celia Thaxter, was a distinguished poet, most well known for her book ‚ÄúAn Island Garden‚Äù. In addition to this literary background, Roland was inspired by nature in his youth, fostering in him an unusual aesthetic sensibility that he brought to his scientific works. Education and research career Roland Thaxter entered Harvard in 1878 and completed an A.B. degree in 1882. In 1883, he attended the Harvard Medical School for doctoral study in medicine. One year later, a two-year Harris Fellowship led him to leave the medical school and join the Graduate School of Art and Science, a turning point in Thaxter's career. He conducted studies of cryptogamic botany under William Gilson Farlow. Farlow was an important mentor to Thaxter in both his scientific work and his private life. He pursued a doctoral degree and served as a research assistant under Farlow from 1886 to 1888. During this period, Thaxter published an important Gymnosporangium paper, ‚ÄúOn Certain Cultures of Gymnosporangium with Notes on their Roesteliae‚Äù, in which he described relationships between Gymnosporangium and Roestelia species. In 1888, Thaxter received the degrees of M.A. and Ph.D., with his thesis monographing ‚ÄúThe Entomophthoreae of the United States‚Äù. From 1888 to 1891, he took a position as the first plant pathologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. He set up a third department in the Station and named it ‚ÄúMycology‚Äù. During his brief time at the Station, his research led to valuable discoveries in Phytopathology. He described the pathogen of potato scab, Oospora scabies, the mildew of lima beans (Phytophthora phaseoli), the onion smut (Urocystis cepulae), and pioneered the use of fungicide sprays to control fungal diseases. In 1891, Thaxter accepted the call and returned to Harvard, where he combined his interest in Entomology and Mycology to work on insect parasitic fungi in the order Laboulbeniales. His research was published from 1896 to 1931 in five volumes that included 103 genera, approximately 1200 species, and 13 varieties. The five volumes included over 3000 meticulous and elegant pen-and-ink illustrations arranged in 166 plates. In 1901, Thaxter was promoted to the position of Full Professor of Cryptogamic Botany. After the death of Farlow in 1919, Thaxter retired and became Professor Emeritus and Honorary Curator of the Farlow Herbarium, where he focused on his own research. Other scientific contributions In addition to his intensive studies on Laboulbeniales, Thaxter's research covered topics in Entomology, Botany, Bacteriology, and other groups of fungi. Entomology was his early interest on which he published his first six research papers. His doctoral thesis, ‚ÄúMonograph of Entomophthoraceae‚Äù, was the first American study of these insect parasitic fungi. He described Myxobacteria in 1892, based on their peculiar life stages and structural developments. In 1922, Thaxter published ‚ÄúA revision of the Endogonaceae‚Äù, the first monograph of that family in which the morphology and development of Endogone, Glaziella, Sclerocystis, and Sphaerocreas were described and illustrated in detail. Anecdotes Thaxter was nicknamed ‚Äúsquirt gun botanist‚Äù, likely a result of his introduction of fungicide spray methods to American agriculture. His interests in science were ‚Äúpure‚Äù rather than ‚Äúpractical,‚Äù as revealed in a letter he wrote to Dr. Farlow during his work at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station: \\"looking back at my year's work with a sickish feeling when I balance my practical accomplishment with my cash recompense.\\" Thaxter was a big traveler. He made several collecting tours in the Americas and in European countries. His most extensive expedition was during his sabbatical year in 1905‚Äì1906. He sailed from Liverpool, New York to Buenos Aires, then traveled to the Falkland Islands and the Strait of Magellan to the southernmost tip of South America. Honors and rewards His eminence in both botany and mycology led Thaxter to participate in many American and European scientific societies.

Killworth (27 March 1946 ‚Äì 28 January 2008) was an English scientist known for his work on oceanography and on the study of social networks. A prolific writer, he published more than 160 scientific papers over the course of his career. He was also known for his work as a pioneering author of text interactive fiction games during the early 1980s. Peter Killworth died in 2008 from motor neurone disease. Oceanography Oyashio and Kuroshio currents) collide, they create eddies ‚Äì modelling this sort of event was a key part of Peter Killworth's career. The major part of Peter Killworth's career was spent as an oceanographer, using applied mathematics to understand ocean dynamics. He had varied interests across the whole of physical oceanography, including the study of ice, polynyas, Rossby waves, instabilities and eddies. He completed his doctorate in Numerical studies in Dynamical Oceanography at Trinity College, Cambridge University in 1972. After a year conducting research in California, he returned to Cambridge to work with his former PhD supervisor, Adrian Gill and spent the next twelve years at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, the latter part of this being spent as a Research Fellow of Clare Hall College.. He maintained close ties to the US during this period, including teaching at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In 1985 he moved to Oxford to join the Robert Hooke Institute, also serving as a Research Fellow of Wolfson College, and later as a Fellow of St Cross College. In Oxford he \\"built and led a research team at the forefront of numerical ocean modelling\\". With the closure of the Institute, by then the NERC Oceanography Unit, he moved to Southampton in 1995 to build up a team at the Southampton Oceanography Centre, now the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, focusing on ocean process modelling. During these years he established the journal Ocean Modelling, which rapidly became one of the leading oceanographic journals, achieving the highest impact factor of any physical oceanographic journal in 2005. Killworth's work was marked by several awards, including a Fellowship from the American Geophysical Union in 2000; the Fridtjof Nansen Medal from the European Geophysical Society in 2002; and the Stommel Research Medal from the American Meteorological Society in 2008 for his \\"many important contributions to ocean modelling and theoretical oceanography\\". After his death in 2008, the UK National Oceanography Centre established the Peter Killworth Memorial Fund to \\"provide an annual award to students to support their research, studies and professional development\\" and \\"to honour Peter's commitment to fostering and encouraging the careers of budding scientists.\\" Social networks The small world theory model. Killworth was also known for his work on social networks, applying mathematical modelling to anthropological empirical research. His work in this area began in 1972, when he met American anthropologist H. Russell Bernard, whilst both men were working at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. Bernard had been conducting research on an oceanographic ship, examining how different social actors interrelated and knew one another. Killworth proposed applying the 'Baltimore traffic problem algorithm' to the research challenges this presented. Over the next few years, the partnership would work extensively on the so-called \\"small world\\", examining differences in the answers to questions such as \\"how many people does the average person think they know?\\" and \\"how many people does the average person really know?\\" Killworth's interest in social networks increasingly focused on answering challenging questions about issues on which responses from individuals in questionnaires could not be trusted or were unlikely to be reliable, and where direct empirical data was lacking ‚Äì \\"apparently uncountable populations\\". He was keen to stress the practical implications of this sort of anthropology, highlighting that before \\"we decide how much money to spend on a social problem, we need to know how big the problem is. It may not matter to anyone but scientists whether the typical American knows 290 people or 2,900, but it matters a lot if we can tell whether populations like the homeless are increasing or decreasing.\\" Killworth was proud of his modelling's contribution to accurately measuring key issues such as the real size of the HIV+ community, or the number of rape victims in given communities. One academic outcome from this work was a challenge to Dunbar's number theorem. Dunbar's number theorem suggests a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. Dunbar's number is not derived from systematic observation of the number of relationships that people living in the contemporary world have. Killworth and his associates did a number of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties ‚Äì 290 ‚Äì that is roughly double Dunbar's estimate. This was not an average of study averages or a theoretical hypothesis but a repeated finding.McCarty,C., Killworth, P.D., Bernard, H.R., Johnsen, E. and Shelley, G. \\"Comparing Two Methods for Estimating Network Size\\", Human Organization 60:28‚Äì39. (2000). In 1997, Killworth and Bernard formed the keynote speakers at the International Network for Social Network Analysis annual \\"Sunbelt\\" meeting, presenting on this accumulated work. Although perhaps best known for his work with Bernard, Killworth also conducted a range of work with social network researchers Chris McCarty, Gene Shelley and Gene Johnsen. Software design During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in Cambridge was the centre of much early interactive fiction text adventure software in the UK, using the Phoenix computer system there. Peter Killworth wrote the groundbreaking mainframe computer game Brand X with fellow mathematician Jonathan Mestel.Nick Montfort (2005). Twisty Little Passages: An Approach To Interactive Fiction. MIT Press. pp. 115‚Äì116. . With the software arm of Acorn Computers based just around the corner from his Cambridge department, it was not long before Acornsoft acquired the rights to Brand X, which was released commercially for the BBC Micro computer as Philosopher's Quest. Other games followed, including Castle of Riddles, Countdown to Doom, Return to Doom and Last Days of Doom, the latter games released through Topologika. Killworth described these games as \\"unashamed puzzlefests, you can die in lots of (hopefully funny) ways ‚Äì but undo will cure that ‚Äì and it's very easy to get stuck.\\" Killworth published a book on the writing and theory of text adventure games in 1984.Killworth, Peter. How to Write Adventure Games. Penguin Books: London, 1984. . Killworth also turned his hand to other programming applications, and \\"worked on top RISC OS graph plotting program Tau after taking over the software from original author Tim Birks. He was also a frequent contributor to the ongoing design of the EasiWriter and TechWriter packages, published by Icon Technology. Other interests Peter Killworth was also a keen amateur magician, and a member of the Cambridge University Pentacle Club for many years. He authored the Paul Daniels' Magic Show release under the Acornsoft Graphics brand for the BBC Micro computer in 1984, which provided a range of magical illusions to be conducted using early micro-computers.

Reviewer Andre Cliche says of Beaujon's designs that they are \\"beautifully simple\\". Design The Enduro's wing and tail structure include wooden aircraft-grade spruce spars with polystyrene foam ribs. The constant- chord, wooden-framed wing and the tail surfaces are covered with poplar plywood. The wing is strut-braced. The tricycle landing gear features a fixed tail skid just behind the cockpit, steel-sprung main-gear suspension and a nose skid. Like many pusher ultralight aircraft the Enduro sits on its tail skid when unoccupied and on its nose skid when a pilot is sitting in the seat. No brakes are specified in the design. The controls are three-axis, with an overhead-mounted control column. The rudder and ailerons are designed to be interconnected and controlled via the control wheel. The open frame fuselage consists of 6061T6 aluminum tubing and a single open pilot's seat. The powerplant is installed behind the pilot and above the fuel tank.

It currently houses the Fountain & Tallman Museum, which is owned and operated by the El Dorado County Historical Society. The rustic vernacular Victorian stone and brick building, of the Gold Country, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1984. The two-story masonry structure was built as a soda water factory by John Fountain & Benjamin Tallman in 1852. The stone walls of the building are more than thick so ice and soda supplies could be kept cool. These construction materials also have protected it from fires that destroyed surrounding buildings (3 fires occurred in 1856 alone), and as a result it is one of the oldest buildings in Placerville.Ford and Ellen Osborn, Day Trip #1 - Exploring Main Street Placerville , El Dorado County Visitors Authority, May 2002, Accessed August 2, 2009. Water was pulled through a small wood framed hole in the wall from a spring out back in the hillside. An odd-looking contraption (a small pressure vessel) housed inside the building, added carbon dioxide () to the water. A replica is currently on display. Bottles were then filled and pressure caps added with wire twists to hold the caps in place. After the close of the soda water factory, the building served many different purposes for many different owners. At one time it was the town jail, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company office (1927-1961), and has had other associated uses and owners. When the building was donated to the El Dorado County Historical Society in 1981 by Fay Ripley Cannon, it became a museum upon the contingency that it be preserved for public benefit as a historical landmark, which was an earlier stipulation originating with the PG&E;'s sale. When the building was renovated, lifting up the stone floor revealed a bowie knife (handle long since rotted away), flakes of gold, and pieces of broken glass soda bottles with the original building owner's mark intact. These items are still on display inside. The building was converted into a museum by the generosity of many donors including using funds from the estate of Placerville native Stella Tracy. Originally called the Placerville Historical Museum, it contains some of Tracy's turn-of-the-century furniture and photos as well as other exhibits of 19th- and 20th-century memorabilia.Marlene Goldman, Placerville: Old Hangtown, SF Gate, October 22, 1999, Accessed August 2, 2009.

He was the founder and president of the now defunct Fayette Manufacturing Corporation, a Fortune 500 company. His is the 1979 recipient of the Arthur S. Flemming Award for Excellence in Government Service and the first member of the CIA to receive this recognition. Early life and personal life John was the second of three sons of Stockton natives; Ellis E. Eckland, an engineer and Yardley Moore Eckland, artist. He was raised in the nearby farming community of Linden, and attended Linden High School, class of 1960. After being awarded the Bank of America scholarship prizes in Science and Mathematics, he attended Tulane University, earning a degree in Economics. He has a Master's in Economics and started a doctoral program at the University of Florida but dropped out before completion. While attending Tulane, he met Susan H. Weinfield, a graduate student at the School of Social Work. After a brief courtship, they married February 21, 1965. They have three grown children: Ellis A. Eckland, Economist (1971-), Kristin L. Eckland Gustafson, Nurse Practitioner, [Author] (b. 1974) and Thomas Eckland (b. 1976), who manages a small hotel. John and Susan Eckland currently divide their time between Nevada and British Columbia. Early career John Eckland later joined the Central Intelligence Agency as an alternative energy analyst. During this time, he designed and built a home in the (at that time) rural D.C. suburb of Great Falls, Virginia. This home was equipped with prototype solar panels, and a small windmill as part of his interest in alternative energy sources (Mother Earth, 1981). Fayette Following his formation of a small alternative energy company with a co-worker, Mr. Eckland resigned from federal service and temporarily relocated to central Pennsylvania. Mr. Eckland later returned to central California where he established the first commercial wind farm in the United States. The first windmills were placed on the Altamont Pass on land leased from a local rancher, Joe Jess, Sr. The purpose of this project was to promote wind energy as a viable source of clean, renewable energy. Conflicts and controversies affect wind energy=Windmills and the media= When the first windfarms appeared in 1981, on the Altamont hills alongside the Altamont Pass portion of the I-580 freeway, the appearance of the modern windmill generated media excitement and public interest. This portion of the freeway was an increasingly used corridor for growing the bedroom communities of Tracy, Lodi and Modesto serving the Bay Area of California (Oakland, San Francisco and Pleasanton). Daily commuters crowded past the otherwise barren cattle ranches for several hours each day. By 1985, the Altamont Pass was crowded with over 26 different windfarms. The increased visibility from the nearby I-580 freeway, which had once sparked the media and community's interest, was now widely regarded as a growing eyesore. Successful windfarms at the Altamont Pass encouraged the development of further industrial wind areas in southern California. These windfarms, in the Tehachapi Pass, led to wider recognition, after windmills played a role as a prominent backdrop in several feature films of the mid- and late 1980s including a 1985 film based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero, featuring Andrew McCarthy and Robert Downey, Jr. =Environmental concerns= Wind energy was initially considered to be a boon to environmentalists, as a source of clean, renewable energy. However, as wind energy became more prominent and visible in central California, several outspoken environmentalists made claims that windmills were damaging the local ecology. They reported that several thousands of birds, particularly several endangered species, were enticed into the turbine blades which then destroyed the birds. The debate on this issue remains heated, with one prominent researcher stating that more birds are killed by cars from the nearby freeway that turbines, and another activist labeling turbines as a \\"Cuisinart of death [for birds]\\". Research results are mixed, and widespread publicity on this issue has resulted in several wind companies being limited in their development and expansion of wind energy. Notes * Kupfer, A.

It is located in the Niger Delta about southeast of Lagos. The plant converts natural gas into liquid petroleum products. History A pre- feasibility study of Escravos GTL was conducted in April 1998, followed by an engineering feasibility study. The Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) was completed in 2002. At the same year, agreements between Sasol, Chevron Corporation and Nigerian National Petroleum Company were signed. The construction contract was awarded in April 2005 to a consortium of JGC, KBR and Snamprogetti. Description The GTL plant cost US$10 billion and started up in summer 2014; its original cost started out at US$1.9 billion in 2005, rising to US$5.9 billion in 2009 but continued to escalate. It has an initial capacity of of synfuel. The plant uses the Fischer-Tropsch process technology and Chevron's ISOCRACKING technology. Partners The project was developed by Chevron Nigeria Limited (75%) and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (15%). Sasol gained interest in the project early on, acquiring half of Chevron Nigeria's stake; however, due to increased cost and delays, Sasol reduced its stake to 10% in late 2008.

Juvenile cellulitis, also known as puppy strangles or juvenile pyoderma, is an uncommon disease of dogs. Symptoms include dermatitis, lethargy, depression and lameness. When puppies are first presented with what appears to be staphylococcal pyoderma, juvenile cellulitis, a relatively rare condition, may not be considered.  Symptoms  The first symptom is a sudden onset of swelling of the face, which develops within two days into papules and pustules on the lips, nose, and around the eyes. These pustules release a purulent discharge, causing a crust to form on the skin. There is also lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes) in the main lymph nodes of the head. The feet, body, prepuce or perianal area may be affected. Pustular otitis externa can occur, with the pinnae (ear flaps) becoming thickened by edema. Affected areas are painful but not itchy. Approximately half of affected puppies have lethargy and depression. Less common symptoms include pyrexia, anorexia, and joint pain caused by sterile suppurative arthritis.  Causes  The cause of juvenile cellulitis is unknown. Cytologic examination of aspirates of affected lymph nodes, pustules, abscesses, and joint fluid rarely reveal bacteria, and culture results of intact lesion are always negative for bacterial growth, suggesting a nonbacterial etiology. As signs resolve following treatment with glucocorticoids, the cause is likely to be an immune disorder.  Diagnosis  Puppies are first presented with what appears to be staphylococcal pyoderma. Definitive diagnosis requires cytologic and histopathologic evaluations. Cytologic examination of papulopustular lesions of juvenile cellulitis reveals pyogranulomatous inflammation with no microorganisms and carefully performed cultures are negative. Biopsies of early lesions reveal multiple discrete or confluent granulomas and pyogranulomas consisting of clusters of large epithelioid macrophages with variably sized cores of neutrophils. Cytological analysis of joint fluid often reveals sterile suppurative arthritis.  Treatment  Large doses of glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, and are administered until the signs have resolved. In uncomplicated cases, this can take up to a month. If dogs are not treated promptly and with high doses of steroids, severe scarring may occur. If there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection, treatment with antibiotics is required.

He lived in mountain city of Montpellier, in the Provence section of France. Towards the end of his life he moved to Carpentras and became a member of the Beth Din of Rabbi Mordechai ben Josepha, (author of Shaarei Nedarim). He was a contemporary and friend of Menachem Meiri. Both are known to have been followers to the Maimonidean approach to halacha, often explaining Talmudic passages according to the halachic conclusions codified by Maimonides. Works His commentary on tractate Kiddushin was erroneously published in some editions of the Talmud Bavli as the Tosafos Ri HaZaken, an error noted by the editors of the Vilna Edition Shas, who prove that the commentary could not have been written by the Ri Hazaken. Rabbi Abraham's commentaries to tractates Yevamos, Nedarim, Nazir, Rosh HaShannah, Yoma, and Sukkah have been published in recent years. Additionally his commentary on Chullin is currently under production. His commentaries on Hullin and Ketubot are quoted by Jacob ben Moses of Bagnols, who wrote between 1357‚Äì61, and by Menachem di Lonzano, who lived in the second half of the sixteenth century. He has been mistaken for the father of the celebrated anti-Maimonist Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier, who flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century. Isaac de Lattes, in his \\"Sha'are Zion\\" (ed. Buber, p. 42), names Rabbi Abraham among the scholars of the generation succeeding Solomon, of whose father he speaks simply as \\"Abraham,\\" without the title of rabbi.

History The foundation of the College of Education in 1970 and Nasser‚Äôs College for Agricultural Sciences in 1972 was the launching point of the University of Aden. The two colleges were under the jurisdiction and authority of the Minister of Education. In 1974 the College of Economics was founded. Every college constitutes an administrative unit. When necessity arose for the foundation more colleges, a ministerial decree was issued providing for the formation of a ministerial committee for the University Town presided by the prime minister. On 10 September 1975, statute No. 22 for 1975 was issued pertaining to the foundation of the University of Aden as a scientific establishment. The statute determines the goals of the University of Aden as follows: * Preparing and qualifying scientific cadres in specializations. * Performance of scientific researches that serve social and economic development. * Presentation of technical consultations for various state foundations. In the year of its foundation, the university had already embraced the following colleges: * College of Education * Nasser's College for Agricultural Sciences * College of Economics * College of Medicine From 1975 to 1999 a number of colleges and affiliate colleges were founded: * College of Law in 1978. * College of Engineering in 1978. * College of Education, Zingibar in 1979(Abyan Governorate). * College of Education, Saber in 1980 (Lahj Governorate). * College of Education, Mukalla, 1974 (nucleus for Hadhramout University). * College of Education, Shabwa, 1994. * College of Education, Yafa', 1998. * College of Education, Radfan, 1998. * College of Education, Dhala', 1998. * College of Education, Lodar, 1998 * College of Oil and Mineralogy, Shabwa, 1996.

The airport is 17 nautical miles (31 km) west of the central business district of Austin. It is privately owned by Lakeway Airpark, Inc. and is located in Lakeway, Texas.  History and Management  From 1939 to 1946 it was called Airfield Ranch. In the late 1960s the Ranch was purchased to develop an all encompassing getaway resort with golf, marina, lakeside hotel accommodations and airstrip for visitors. The Lakeway Company upgraded and lengthened the runway and the Airpark was considered an amenity for the community. After the original development failed the project was purchased by Ross Perot. Perot's development company broke up the original properties and sold them off. The golf property is today's Live Oak course, the hotel/resort is the Lakeway Inn. In 1995 the airstrip property was sold to a group who established Lakeway Airpark LLC, a not for profit corporation established for the purpose of managing the airpark. Under the terms of the original sale the property may revert to Perot in the event the property is not used as an airport. The airport briefly had scheduled passenger airline service during the mid 1970s when Bee Line, a small commuter air carrier based in the Houston area, was operating flights on the weekends with small twin prop aircraft from both Houston Hobby Airport and Andrau Airpark in the west Houston area and the Lakeway Airpark.http://www.timetableimages.com/ttimages/bee70s.htm  Facilities and aircraft  Lakeway Airpark covers an area of at an elevation of 909 feet (277 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 16/34 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,930 by 70 feet (1,198 x 21 m). A runway was made in 1936. In 1989 it was expanded to a and runway. The runway end zones were extended in 2003. As of 2010 there are 29 residences surrounding the airpark with attached hangars on residential properties. In addition there are 4 freestanding condo style hangars on the airpark property and 1 large non residential hangar on AV zoned adjoining property not owned by the Airpark. For the 12-month period ending February 29, 2008, the airport had 9,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 24 per day. At that time there were 58 aircraft based at this airport: 95% single-engine and 5% multi- engine.  References External links * Lakeway Airpark, Inc.

The structure held other businesses until the Pearson family sold the building in 1972 to antique collector Roger John Douvres, who restored the structure over a period of four years, using the lower section as an old-fashioned soda fountain and the upper portion as an elegant dining hall decorated in early 20th-century style.

Among the better known NPHIs are the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Typical core functions of NPHIs include surveillance for diseases and injuries, as well as risk factors; epidemiologic investigations of health problems; public health research; and response to public health emergencies.Binder, S., Adigun, L., Dusenbury, C., Greenspan, A., & Tanhuanpaa, P. (2008). National public health institutes: contributing to the public good. Journal of Public Health Policy, 29, 3-21. Recent public health challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may have significant impacts on the missions and structures of NPHIs. Although these functions are in many countries dispersed among several agencies, in recent years some countries have reorganized their public health systems to consolidate functions. For example, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Canadian government created the Public Health Agency of Canada in order to ensure a more efficient and effective response in future outbreaks.Binder, S., Adigun, L.E., & Greenspan, A.

Van Roggen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. After graduating in law from the University of British Columbia, Van Roggen went to Whitehorse, Yukon in 1949 becoming the town's only practicing lawyer. He later became future Conservative MP Eric Nielsen's law partner. He returned to Vancouver in 1957 to practice corporate law\\"Died this day: George van Roggen, 1992\\", Globe and Mail, June 6, 2006 specializing in corporate real estate. He was a Liberal Party activist and served as British Columbia campaign chair for the Liberals under Lester Pearson and served in the same role under Pierre Trudeau for the 1968 and 1972 federal elections. The issue of free trade with the United States had been a dead letter in Canadian politics since the defeat of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's government in the 1911 federal election on the issue of what was called \\"reciprocity\\" with the United States. In 1966, Van Roggen spearheaded the approval of a pro-free trade resolution at a national Liberal Party conference. The motion passed but Prime Minister Pearson responded by saying the issue should not be considered \\"at this time.\\" He was appointed to the Senate in 1971. In 1974, he became chairman of the Senate's Committee of Foreign Affairs and had the committee conduct a study of free trade with the United States which recommended the negotiation of a free trade agreement. This recommendation was endorsed by the Senate in 1982 and was adopted by the Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada in 1985. In turn, the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney accepted the Commission's recommendation and proceeded to negotiate the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in 1987 which was ratified in 1988. By this time, the Liberals under leader John Turner had come out against free trade putting Van Roggen in an awkward position. He resigned as chairman of the Senate Foreign Committee in 1986 rather than vote against what had been his idea. When the Senate stalled passage of the Free Trade Agreement, Prime Minister Mulroney called the 1988 federal election and campaigned on the issue and was re-elected. After the election, Van Roggen voted with Conservative Senators to approve the Free Trade Agreement while his fellow Liberal senators abstained. The Agreement passed and came into effect on January 1, 1989. Van Roggen was described as a \\"C.D. Howe Liberal\\" and considered an economic conservative but a social liberal who supported a social safety net. Van Roggen died of liver cancer in Vancouver in 1992.\\"OBITUARY: George van Roggen Senator promoted free trade\\", Globe and Mail, June 10, 1992 ReferencesExternal links * 1921 births 1992 deaths Canadian senators from British Columbia Liberal Party of Canada senators Lawyers in British Columbia Politicians from Vancouver 20th-century Canadian lawyers ","title":"George Van Roggen"},{"id":"23838434","text":"Yeshiva World News (YWN) is an Orthodox Jewish online news publication.

An industrial safety system is a countermeasure crucial in any hazardous plants such as oil and gas plants and nuclear plants. They are used to protect human, industrial plant, and the environment in case of the process going beyond the allowed control margins. As the name suggests, these systems are not intended for controlling the process itself but rather protection. Process control is performed by means of process control systems (PCS) and is interlocked by the safety systems so that immediate actions are taken should the process control systems fail. Process control and safety systems are usually merged under one system, called Integrated Control and Safety System (ICSS). Industrial safety systems typically use dedicated systems that are SIL 2 certified at minimum; whereas control systems can start with SIL 1. SIL applies to both hardware and software requirements such as cards, processors redundancy and voting functions. Types There are 2 main types of industrial safety systems in process industry:Most of this article is summarized from some Yemen LNG documentation on safety systems, No. YE-001-30-POC-JBS-25300 and YE-001-30-POC-JBS-25200. * Process Safety System or Process Shutdown System, (PSS). * Safety Shutdown System (SSS): This includes Emergency Shutdown-(ESD) and Emergency Depressurization-(EDP) Systems. A third system also exists which acts as a barrier and contains the spray out of hot oil & gases from flanges, valves & pipe joints. These systems are popularly known as safety spray shields and flange guards. The use of spray guards is mandated by OSHA.  ESD  These systems may also be redefined in terms of ESD/EDP levels as: * ESD level 1: In charge of general plant area shutdown, can activate ESD level 2 if necessary. This level can only be activated from main control room in the process industrial plants. * ESD level 2: This level shuts down and isolates individual ESD zones and activates if necessary EDP. * ESD level 3: provides \\"liquid inventory containment\\". =SSS= The safety shutdown system (SSS) shall shut down the facilities to a safe state in case of an emergency situation, thus protecting personnel, the environment and the asset. The safety shutdown system shall manage all inputs and outputs relative to emergency shutdown (ESD) functions (environment and personnel protection). This system might also be fed by signals from the main fire and gas system. =FGS= The main objectives of the fire and gas system are to protect personnel, environment, and plant (including equipment and structures). The FGS shall achieve these objectives by: * Detecting at an early stage, the presence of flammable gas, * Detecting at an early stage, the liquid spill (LPG and LNG), * Detecting incipient fire and the presence of fire, * Providing automatic and/or facilities for manual activation of the fire protection system as required, * Initiating environmental changes to keep liquids below their flash point * Initiating signals, both audible and visible as required, to warn of the detected hazards, * Initiating automatic shutdown of equipment and ventilation if 2 out of 2 or 2 out of 3 detectors are triggered, * Initiating the exhausting system.  EDP  Due to closing ESD valves in a process, there may be some trapped flammable fluids, and these must be released in order to avoid any undesired consequences (such as pressure increase in vessels and piping). For this, emergency depressurization (EDP) systems are used in conjunction with the ESD systems to release (to a safe location and in a safe manner) such trapped fluids.  Pressure safety valves  Pressure safety valves or PSVs are usually used as a final safety solution when all previous systems fail to prevent any further pressure accumulation and protect vessels from rupture due to overpressure by their designed action.

Previously known as Netagamu River, the place was renamed in 1971 after captain Jean-Baptiste Chevery who in 1747 sailed along the coast visiting numerous posts. Chevery was the site of an early French fur trading post in the mid-17th century, but after that fort was abandoned, there was no further development on the site until the 1930s, when an experimental farm was established on the Cross River by William Anderson. Residents of several isolated communities in the area, including Gull Cliff Island and Aylmer Sound, subsequently moved to Chevery due to the need for improved access to government services.Tourism Lower North Shore: Chevery A view of Chevery from the air The community of Chevery on the Gulf Saint Lawrence and boasts a vast network of inland wetlands, forest and tundra. The area is an ideal location for wilderness exploration, artistic inspiration and cultural discovery. From Chevery, one can access extensive trails and beaches through the unique northern landscape of the MRC du Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent. Chevery is renowned for the Netagamiou River and its 50 foot high falls that can be accessed from the Bob Nunez Misty River Trail. Another renowned natural feature at the western end of Chevery is the \\"Sterant Island\\" Tern Colony. Only 100 meters off the beach, Sterant Island is easily visible for avid and budding conservationists and ornithologists who wish to observe, study and photograph the impressive tern colony for which the island gets its name. Locals speculate that the name \\"Sterant Island\\" is an anglicized version of a French name \\"√éle au Sterne\\". Local records confirm that the Terns return annually to Chevery the third week of May and remain there to hatch and raise their young in the bait rich waters of Chevery during the summer. The terns leave gradually in early September and the colony is usually deserted by the mid- September each year.

He built upon the techniques of his mentor, Dr. Radford Tanzer of the Mary Hitchcock Clinic at Dartmouth Medical School and repaired ear defects in 1,800 patients, most of them children born with ear deformities such as microtia. He also reconstructed ears lost or due to some form of trauma. Biography=Youth= Brent grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and was highly influenced by his maternal grandfather who taught him cabinetry and woodworking. Although he considered a career in art, he was always surrounded by medicine, because his father was a physician who had an office in the basement of their home. Eventually his father influenced him to pursue a career in medicine, and Brent decided to study Plastic Surgery so that he could employ his artistic background within that field. He received his B.S. degree at Wayne State University in Detroit and his M.D. degree at Chicago Medical School. Following his internship at the University of Michigan, Brent entered the U.S. Army as a General Medical Officer and served one year with the 101st Airborne Division. The following year, he transferred to Panama where he served two more years as a medical officer with the Special Forces (‚ÄúGreen Berets‚Äù). It was at this time that he became fluent in Spanish, which served him well in helping many Latino patients. =Artist= As an avid naturalist, Brent is a member of the Society of Animal Artists and has created sculptures of numerous of birds and mammals. Some of these are large bronze sculptures which he has donated for his young patients and other children to enjoy in the San Diego Zoo and San Francisco Zoo. =Publications= Brent published more than 60 scientific articles and textbook chapters in the medical literature. He has coauthored, edited, and/or collaborated on several books: *Earl Scruggs and the Five-String Banjo, Peer International Music Corporation, New York, 1968; 2nd Edition, Hal Leonard Music Corporation, Milwaukee, 2005. *Brent, B. (Ed.): The Artistry of Reconstructive Surgery, C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis, 1987. Medical practice Brent specialized in ear reconstruction and had a private practice in Woodside, California. He was also on the teaching faculty at Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California. Brent, who learned sculpture before studying medicine, built upon and refined techniques developed by Dr. Radford Tanzer, who was a surgical professor at Dartmouth Medical College He performed ear reconstruction surgery for more than 1,800 patients, most of them children born with ear deformities such as microtia. He also reconstructed ears lost due to some form of trauma. Due to his commitment and tenure in this practice he saw children of previous patients, who have a higher risk of having children with similar deformities. He was named Clinician of the Year in 2005 by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons Several of Brent‚Äôs earliest and notable patients were famous kidnap victims who had their ears amputated and sent along with ransom notes. Reconstruction of their ears resulted in a Time Magazine article entitled ‚ÄúSurgery as Sculpture‚Äù and was instrumental in launching public awareness of Brent‚Äôs work to parents of children with congenital birth deformities of the ear.

They are the eukaryotic rolling-circle transposable elements which are hypothesized to transpose by a rolling circle replication mechanism via a single-stranded DNA intermediate. They were first discovered in plants (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa) and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and now they have been identified in a diverse range of species, from protists to mammals. Helitrons make up a substantial fraction of many genomes where non-autonomous elements frequently outnumber the putative autonomous partner. Helitrons seem to have a major role in the evolution of host genomes. They frequently capture diverse host genes, some of which can evolve into novel host genes or become essential for Helitron transposition. History Helitrons were the first group of TEs to be discovered by computational analysis of whole genome sequences. The first Helitrons described were called Aie, AthE1, Atrep and Basho which are Non- autonomous Helitrons found in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant. Despite these discoveries, the classification of Helitrons was unknown until 2001 when the discovery of protein coding-elements which were predicted to be the autonomous partners. Kapitonov and Jurka investigated the coding capacity of Helitrons in A. thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Caenorhabditis elegan using in silico studies of repetitive DNA of these organisms, computational analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. They described the structure and coding potential of canonical Helitrons and proposed the rolling-circle mechanism of transposition as well as the possibility that some of the encoded genes captured from the host are now used for replication. Their survey of the genome of these organisms showed that Helitron activity could contribute to a significant fraction (‚àº 2%) of the plant and invertebrate genomes where they were found, but the extent of their distribution elsewhere was not clear. In 2003, a group of investigators studied the structure of proteins related to Helitrons and the different coding domains within them by looking for Helitron-like elements in vertebrates, specifically zebra fish, Danio rerio and a puffer fish, Sphoeroides nephelus. The Rep/Helicase proteins were predicted to be 500 to 700 amino acids longer because of a C-terminal fusion of a domain with homology to apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease. Previous phylogenetic studies showed that the AP endonuclease is nested within the Chicken Repeat 1 (CR1) clade of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons. This relationship suggested that AP endonuclease originated from a retrotransposon insertion either nearby or within a Helitron. These investigators were not able to identify the ends of the Rep/Helicase/Endonuclease unit of Helitrons. In recent years, Helitrons have been identified in all eukaryotic kingdoms but their genomic copy numbers are highly variable, even among closely related species. They make up 1‚Äì5% of the genomic DNA in different fruit flies, 0‚Äì3% in mammals, >0.5% in the frog. In most mammals Helitron's presence is negligible and limited to remnants of old transposons, with the exception of bat genomes, which are populated by numerous young elements. However, many years after the description autonomous Helitrons, no mechanistic studies have been published and therefore the rolling-circle mechanism of transposition remains a well-supported but not yet tested hypothesis. Structure Structure and coding capacity of canonical animal and plant Helitrons Helitrons are structurally asymmetric and are the only class of DNA transposons that do not generate duplications of target sites during transposition. Canonical Helitrons typically begin with a 5‚Ä≤ T (C/T) and terminate with the nucleotides CTRR (most frequently CTAG, but occasionally variation has been noted) but do not contain terminal inverted repeats. In addition, they frequently have a short palindromic sequence (16 to 20 nucleotides) hairpin about ‚àº 11 bp from the 3‚Ä≤ end. They integrate between an AT host dinucleotide. Some families of Helitrons also carry tandem repeats, like microsatellites and minisatellites which are generally highly mutable sequences. Most Helitrons are non-autonomous elements and share common termini and other structural hallmarks with autonomous Helitrons, but they do not encode any complete set of proteins encoded by the autonomous elements. The main enzymatic hallmarks of Helitrons are the rolling-circle (RC) replication initiator (Rep) and DNA helicase (Hel) domains, which are present in a protein comprising 1000‚Äì3000 amino acids (aa) (Rep/Hel) encoded by all autonomous Helitron elements. The Rep/Helicase protein includes zinc finger motifs, the Rep domain (which is a ~100-aa and has HUH endonuclease activity), and an eight-domain PiF1 family helicase (SuperFamily1) which are universally conserved in Helitrons. The zinc finger-like-motifs have been associated with DNA binding. The ~400-aa Hel domain is classified as a 5‚Äô to 3‚Äô DNA Hel which is involved in the breaking and joining of single-stranded DNA and are characterized by both the presence of the HUH motif (two histidine residues separated by a hydrophobic residue) and the Y motif (one or two tyrosine residues that are separated by several amino acids). The PiF1 family of helicases (Hel) has 5‚Ä≤ to 3‚Ä≤ unwinding activity which for many rolling-circle entities this activity is host encoded. Plant Helitrons also encode an open reading frame with homology to single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (RPA). Typically, the RPA proteins in Helitrons are 150 ‚Äì 500-aa long and are encoded by several exons. In all Helitrons, the Rep domain precedes the Hel domain. Mechanisms of rolling-circle transposition Helitrons are proposed to transpose by a mechanism similar to rolling-circle replication via a single- stranded DNA intermediate. Two models are proposed for the transposition mechanism: the concerted and the sequential. In the concerted model, the donor strand cleavage and ligation occurs simultaneously while in the sequential model they occur in a stepwise fashion. The concerted model does not require a circular intermediate although they could occur if a step fails or is bypassed during transposition. The sequential model differs in that a circular intermediate is a required step of transposition and because, until very recently, circular intermediates were not known for Helitrons, the concerted model was adapted to explain transposition. In either case, using reconstituted Helraiser transposons to study Helitron transposition, it was shown that the donor site must be double-stranded and that single-stranded donors will not suffice. = The concerted model = Rolling-Circle Mechanism for Helitron transposition and gene acquisition in the concerted modelHelitron could be either autonomous or non-autonomous. One transposase molecule cleaves at the donor (by the first tyrosine (Y1) residue of the Rep protein) and target sites (by the second tyrosine (Y2) residue) and binds to the resulting 5' ends. The free 3' OH in the target DNA attacks the DNA‚ÄìY1 bond and forms a bond with the donor strand resulting in strand transfer. Replication at the cleaved donor site initiates at the free 3' OH where the donor strand serves as a primer for DNA synthesis by host DNA polymerase and replication proceeds to displace one strand of the helitron. If the palindrome and 3' end of the element are recognized correctly, cleavage occurs after the CTRR sequence and the one Helitron strand is transferred to the donor site where DNA replication resolves the heteroduplex. = The sequential model = a) Plasmid containing the helitron: the antibiotic resistance gene (kanamycin) is inserted between the left and right terminal sequences (LTS and RTS respectively) ; b) Circular intermediate of transposition: the terminal sequences are joined together (grey arrow indicates promoter of the gene) In 2016, one of the first mechanistic studies of helitron transposition was published in order to shed light on the different steps of transposition. Based on a consensus sequence, it reconstructed the likely ancestor of the Helibat family of helitrons present in the genome of the little brown bat (Myotis Lucifugus), the only group of mammals possessing an important number of helitrons in their genome. This active transposon was inserted into a plasmid acting as the helitron donor. An antibiotic resistance gene was included between the two terminal sequences of the helitron to enable isolation of the cells where transposition occurred. During transposition of the helitron, a circular intermediate is formed which was isolated in the cells transfected with the plasmid. It is formed by the joining of the terminal ends and suggests a rolling-circle model of transposition during which the cleavage of both the donor and the target strands do not occur at the same time since a single-stranded circular DNA is first formed with one of the strands of the helitron. This model is supported by the fact that the deletion of one of the two tyrosines (Y727) of the Rep domain thought to be involved in cleavage of the strands doesn't actually affect the efficiency of helitron transposition. Only one of the tryosines would be required, in order to ensure a two-step process: 1) the cleavage of the donor DNA and 2) the integration into the target site. Donor sequence (black) and target sequence (blue) ; helitron divided into three parts (LTS in blue, coding sequnce in grey and RTS in purple). a) tyrosine of the Rep-Hel protein cleaves 5‚Äô end of the LTS in the donor sequence ; b) using helicase activity from 5‚Äô to 3‚Äô, Rep-Hel rolls to the 3‚Äô end of the RTS ; c) cleavage of the 3‚Äô end after detection of the RTS ; d) joining of the end sequences and formation of circle intermediate ; e) cleavage of the target strand and integration of the helitron after passive resolution Mechanisms of gene capture The presence of contiguous exons and introns within the host DNA carried by Helitrons suggested a DNA based mechanism of acquisition. Helitron gene capture was proposed to occur in a stepwise or sequential manner, i.e., gene capture occurs during one transposition and capture of a second gene occurs during a subsequent transposition event. Stepwise capture would result in Helitrons that contain gene fragments from different locations. The sequential capture model may explain Helitrons carrying multiple gene fragments observed in other organisms. There are three major models proposed in order to explain the mechanism of gene capture at the DNA level in Helitrons. = End bypass model = Also known as \\"transduction\\" or \\"read-through\\" model 1 (RTM1). Transposition initiates at the 5‚Ä≤ end and gene capture occurs if the 3‚Ä≤ termination signal is missed. A cryptic downstream palindrome could furnish a new terminator if the normal terminator was bypassed and all intervening sequence would be captured. In this regard, Helitrons can be viewed as an exon shuffling machines. As a random sequence provides the novel termination signal, this model does not require a high density of Helitrons in the genome. Indeed, in the one-ended-type fusions, the inserted fragment of donor DNA is flanked at one end (constant end) by IRR and at the other end by the CTTG or GTTC sequence present in the donor (variable end) in a way that usually results in multiple tandem insertions of the donor plasmid or capture of flanking sequence in the target site. This failure to recognize the termination signal for Helitron transposition may result in the DNA flanking the 3' end of the Helitron being transferred along with the Helitron to the donor site as well (gene capture). This may be how Helitrons have acquired additional coding sequences. Despite this hypothesis, further experiments are necessary to verify the mechanism of transposition. = Chimeric transposition model = Also known as \\"read-through\\" model 2 (RTM2). In this model, transposition initiates at the 5‚Ä≤ end of a Helitron and if the 3‚Ä≤ end of that Helitron is missing, so transposition is terminated at the next 3‚Ä≤ end of a Helitron in the correct orientation, gene capture would occur. The result is that all intervening sequence is captured. = Filler DNA (FDNA) model = In this model, portions of genes or non-coding regions can accidentally serve as templates during repair of double stranded breaks (DSBs) occurring in Helitrons during their transposition. Low-fidelity repair of DSB by Non-Homologous End Joining is more frequent in plants and mammals than repair through homologous recombination, and is often accompanied by insertions of 100‚Äì4000 bp long ‚Äúfiller DNA‚Äù copied from diverse genomic or extra-chromosomal DNA regions into DSB. This model predicts that 2 to 8 bp regions of microhomology exist between the regions that flank the DSB in the Helitron and that flank the original host sequence captured by the Helitron. = Others = There are also other gene capture mechanism models proposed for Helitrons: Site-specific recombination model which is based on the shared features between Helitrons and Integrons; Transposable element capture which is based on the integration of TEs via transposition into other TEs, also called TE nesting. Despite all these proposed models, there is a lack of examples to limit the mechanism of gene capture to a single model. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism behind gene capture and how it favors the survival of Helitrons. Evidence supporting the \\"read- through\\" models seems to lie in the relative lack of importance of the 3' RTS when compared to the 5' LTS: deletion of the LTS leads to a severe reduction in the efficiency of helitron transposition, whereas the complete deletion of the RTS still leads to significant transposition despite a reduced number of copies. The RTS indicates to the Rep-Hel protein the end of the helitron and thus the end of transposition. The whole of this information lies in the hairpin structure formed by the palindromic sequence of DNA in the 3' end. Such a small structure is likely to be modified over time, enabling to by-pass the helitron's end during its transposition and to capture neighbouring gene sequence. Impact on gene expression Helitrons, like all other TEs, are potential insertional mutagens. They might get inserted within the promoter region of a gene that results in the abolition of measurable transcripts and the observed phenotypes. In some cases it has been seen that a Helitron insertion has provided regulatory motifs necessary for transcription initiation. Investigators presented evidence that Helitrons have contributed putative promoters, exons, splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and microRNA binding sites to transcripts otherwise conserved across mammals. Helitrons drive the expression and provides de novo regulatory elements such as CAAT- box, GCbox, octamer motif, and TATA box sites. Helitrons also can alter the length and sequence of both 5‚Ä≤ UTRs and 3‚Ä≤ UTRs of the coding transcripts. Another way Helitrons can control gene expression is through contributing to novel splice variants by promoting alternative splicing and by providing cryptic splice sites. A number of spontaneous mutations have been reported in plants that are caused by intronic Helitron insertions that result in the generation of chimeric transcript species. Genome-wide identification Pipeline for genome-wide identification of candidate Helitrons and their verification The atypical structure, lack of target site modification, and sequence heterogeneity of Helitrons have made automated identification of Helitrons difficult. For genome-wide analysis there are two approaches that have been applied to find canonical Helitrons: De novo repeat identification approaches which can be used to build consensus libraries of all repeated sequences, but De novo repeat finding approaches will only identify Helitrons that are present in multiple relatively homogeneous copies in the genome. Therefore, the low copy and older Helitrons will tend to be fragmented and have poorly defined ends. These approaches are limited by the quality of the genome assembly and the homogeneity of the repeats. Another approach is structure based which relies on the structural features of canonical Helitrons and utilizes programs such as Helitronfinder, HelSearch, Helraizer, and HelitronScanner. As these programs are trained on known Helitron elements, they may not be efficient at identifying divergent families and they generate many false positives. This approach does not create consensus sequences of the candidate Helitrons, resulting in large data sets. The sensitivity of the structure based approach (correctly identified/(correctly identified + false negatives)) is 93%, and the specificity (correctly identified/(correctly identified + false positives)) is 99%. There are several reasons why all other techniques for Helitron discovery have been less sensitive and/or more error prone: A Rep/helicase protein-based search yields a large number of false negatives, because the majority of Helitrons are non-autonomous elements. A similarity-based search will not identify any new families and will thus work poorly in newly studied genomes. A repeat-based search requires extensive manual curation to identify Helitron families, an overwhelming task in large genomes with substantial DNA repetition. On the basis of the overall sensitivity and specificity, the structure-based approach to identify Helitron elements is quite successful and especially useful to identify Helitron elements in a newly characterized genome. However, because at least 2 copies are needed to make an alignment, single copy Helitrons will be missed. Vertical inheritance and horizontal transfer Inheritance: Genome-wide analyses showed that the bulk of Helitrons tend to be quite recent. The young age of Helitron families is of course biased by the genomes that have been examined carefully, which are predominately plant and insect where the unconstrained DNA half-life (the average amount of time when half of DNA not conserved for function is lost) is quite rapid. In contrast to other DNA transposons, Helitrons from some species have been reported to exhibit long- term activity probably due to the mechanism of transposition or inability of the host to recognize Helitrons because of either sequence heterogeneity or host gene capture. In contrast, to the relatively faster unconstrained DNA half-life (2.5‚Äì14 my) of the plant and insect genomes, the mammalian DNA half- life is estimated to be much slower (884 my) which along with the minimal requirements of Helitron transposition and the slow rate of decay in mammals have caused this pattern of vertical persistence. Horizontal Transfer: The impact of horizontal transfer (HT) of transposable elements may be significant due to their mutagenic potential, inherent mobility, and abundance. Researchers found evidence for the repeated HT of four different families of Helitrons in an unprecedented array of organisms, including mammals, reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and insect viruses. The Helitrons present in these species have a patchy distribution and are closely related (80‚Äì98% sequence identity), despite the deep divergence times among hosts. In contrast to genes, Helitrons that have horizontally transferred into new host genomes can amplify, in some cases reaching up to several hundred copies and representing a substantial fraction of the genome. As Helitrons are known to frequently capture and amplify gene fragments, HT of this unique group of DNA transposons could lead to horizontal gene transfer and incur dramatic shifts in the trajectory of genome evolution. Evolutionary implication Two different scenarios describe the most likely fate of a host gene captured by Helitrons: 1. The captured gene would be destroyed by multiple mutations if it did not provide any selective advantage to the transposons. 2. It would be kept as a gene related to the original host gene if its capture is beneficial for the transposon, which is tolerated by the host. Helitrons, as most of other mobile elements in the A. thaliana and C. elegans genomes are present in the genomes in multiple highly diverged families. Considering the young age of these families and the extent of protein conservation, it is highly unlikely that the divergence observed is resulted from mutations accumulated by the transposons integrated in the host genome, proving that Helitrons work as a powerful tool of evolution. They have recruited host genes, modified them to an extent that is unreachable by the Mendelian process, and multiplied them in the host genomes. Future Although it is generally accepted that Helitrons are RC transposons and through numerous investigations, the role of Helitron transposition in gene duplication and shaping the genetic architecture has been proven, but neither the various mechanisms by which this occurs nor the frequency is well understood. At this point, it is even unclear whether the 3' terminus in a Helitron transposon initiates or terminates the Helitron replicative transposition. An important step towards investigating this mechanism would be the isolation of autonomous Helitrons active in vitro and in vivo. This can be done by computational identification of complete young Helitrons. In a near future, detailed computer-assisted sequence studies allow investigators to understand the evolutionary history of Helitrons, together with their mechanism of gene capture and their overall significance for gene evolution.

As part of Operation Avalanche, the Allied invasion of Italy, the 316th dropped paratroops over the beachhead south of the Sele River on the night of 14 September 1943. Later during Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of France, the group dropped paratroops near Ste-Mere-Eglise a few hours before the main landings on 6 June 1944. It also dropped paratroops and released gliders carrying reinforcements during the airborne invasion of the Netherlands, Operation Market-Garden in September 1944. By the end of the war, the 316th Troop Carrier Group was awarded three Distinguished Unit Citations. Overview The group was tasked with the operations of the 1st Helicopter Squadron, which supports Washington D.C. capital area airlift for the Executive Branch, high-ranking dignitaries, high-ranking military leaders and other VIPs.

In February 1943 the 316th TCG became a part of the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing of the Northwest African Troop Carrier Command in the official Allied air force organization in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO). In May 1943, the group began training for the invasion of Sicily where they dropped paratroopers over the assault area on the night of 9 July, and carried reinforcements on 11 July, receiving DUC for carrying out that mission although severely attacked by ground and naval forces. They received another DUC for supporting aerial and ground operations in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Sicily, 25 November 1942 ‚Äì 25 August 1943, by transporting reinforcements and supplies. During this period, the group was under the command of Colonel Jerome McCauley. The 316th was assigned to Twelfth AF and moved to Sicily to take part in the invasion of Italy, where it dropped paratroops over the beachhead south of the Sele River on the night of 14 September 1943. They transported cargo in the theater until February 1944, then joined Ninth AF in England and prepared for the invasion of France. The unit dropped paratroops near Ste-Mere-Eglise on D‚ÄîDay 1944 and flew a reinforcement mission on 7 June, receiving a third DUC for these operations. During Operation Market Garden, they dropped paratroops and released gliders carrying reinforcements. Again they dropped paratroops near Wesel on 24 March 1945 when the Allies made the airborne assault across the Rhine. They also provided transport services in Europe while not engaged in airborne operations, hauling supplies such as ammunition, gasoline, water, and rations; along with evacuating wounded personnel to rear-zone hospitals. =Cold War= Returned to the US in May 1945.

Construction  Ballaj√° Barracks in Old San Juan at night The Ballaj√° Barracks were built by the Spanish militia from 1854 to 1864. To build it, six blocks from the Ballaj√° ward were expropriated from the Dominican Order and demolished in 1853. The three-story structure was completed in 1864, occupying an area of . It could accommodate over 1,000 citizens, originally Spanish soldiers and their families. Its vast interior patio is one of the best examples of 19th-century Spanish architecture. Other than the housing facilities, the barracks had storage rooms, kitchens, mess halls, dungeons, and horse stables.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  The barracks were heavily used during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War near the end of the 19th century. On May 12, 1898, during the American bombing of San Juan, the fleet led by Admiral William T. Sampson damaged the northeast side of the barracks. After the war ended, and with the change of sovereignty, the barracks became the quarters for the United States Army until 1939.  World War II  During World War II, the barracks were used as a military hospital, under the name of Army General Hospital of Fort Brooke. On August 31, 1944, the United States Department of War issued General Order No. 71 which renamed the hospital as Rodriguez (161st) General Hospital, in honor of Major Fernando E. Rodr√≠guez Vargas.  Government acquisition  The Government of Puerto Rico acquired the building in 1976 through a transfer from the Government of the United States with the commitment of restoring it and using it for cultural, educative, and touristic purposes. In 1986, a reform plan for the San Juan Historic Zone was sketched and the building was restored from 1990 to 1993.  Today  Today, the Ballaj√° Barracks houses several educational and cultural organizations, namely the Museo de Las Am√©ricas on the second floor of the building since 1992.

It was designed in a brutalist style in 1968 by Neave Brown of Camden Council's Architects Department. Construction work commenced in 1972 and was completed in 1978. It is constructed from site-cast, board-marked white, unpainted reinforced concrete. Along with 520 apartments, the site also includes a school, community centre, youth club, heating complex, and parkland.  Estate  The estate consists of three parallel east-west blocks, and occupies a crescent-shaped site bounded on the south by Boundary Road, Loudoun Road on the east, Abbey Road on the west, and by the West Coast Main Line to the north. The desire to control the sound and vibration from passing trains was a major consideration in the layout of the estate.Great Buildings Online. Two rows of terraced apartments are aligned along the tracks. The higher, eight- story block directly adjacent to the railway line is organised in the form of a ziggurat, and acts as a noise barrier that blocks the noise of the trains from reaching the interior portion of the site, and its foundations rest on rubber pads that eliminate vibration.Wu Wei's Housing terraces in the UK (Part II) A lower, four-storey block runs along the other side of a continuous pedestrian walkway, known as Rowley Way, serving both terraced rows of buildings. The third row of buildings, along the southern edge of the site, parallels another public walkway, Langtry Walk, between this row and the existing earlier buildings of the Ainsworth Estate and defines a public park with play areas between the second and third row of dwellings. The lower four- storey building along Rowley Way contains maisonettes with shared access, terraces, and gardens over-looking the park at the rear. Maisonettes also occupy the top two levels of the larger eight-storey building opposite, with entrance from a walkway on the 7th floor that runs the entire length of the structure. Dwellings in the lower floor in this block are entered from open stairs serving two dwellings per floor. The flat roofs of the stepped elevation provides private outdoor areas for every home. Garage parking is located beneath the building, and underneath the building at the rear alongside the railway tracks.  Development and history  Since the early 1950s, tower blocks surrounded by public open space had been the method of choice for councils to replace terraced housing in poor condition while keeping the same high population density. However, by the mid-1960s, even before the collapse of Ronan Point, the shortcomings of that method were becoming apparent. Neave Brown believed that ziggurat style terraces, little higher than the terraces they replaced, could provide a better solution. Vehicular traffic could be restricted to basement level. Family-sized flats, bright and airy due to the set-back upper floors, could open, via their own \\"defensible\\" front garden, onto ground floor streets/play areas, whilst the higher levels could be used for smaller flats, each with a private balcony. The Alexandra Road Estate may be seen as Brown's culminating, and largest scale, effort to apply these principles to the design of high-density public housing. Five houses on Winscombe Street, built in 1967, were his first experiment with the terrace type. The Fleet Road project, begun about the same time and consisting of 71 houses, a shop, and a studio, arranged in parallel terraced rows, was a further application of the idea. = Public enquiry = The estate received much criticism during and after its construction because of its very high cost (particularly compared with tower blocks), caused by the complicated nature of its construction, unforeseen foundation problems, and the delays caused by those at a time of very high inflation, reaching 20% per year at one point in the 1970s. In 1978 a public enquiry was launched by the Labour-run council to investigate the reasons for overshooting the budget and timetable. Although there were indeed a significant delay and an increase in cost of approximately four times of the originally commissioned tender, the enquiry may have been politically motivated. Mark Swenarton cites several factors for its launch: The campaigning Conservatives tried to allege that Labour was incompetent in managing the council and an increasingly pressured Labour hoping to relieve itself from the public anger of the spending by raising the transparency and potentially find the roots of the problem with the Conservative leadership 1968‚Äì1971. The outcome of the enquiry published in seven reports mainly made \\"the apparent failure of the councillors to understand the contractual obligations that they had undertaken\\" responsible for the mismanagement and was not successful in blaming the architect as had been hoped by some. Despite there were no findings of a mismanagement on his part being the subject of a public enquiry however destroyed Neave Brown's reputation in the UK where he never built again. = Alexandra Road Estate today = The estate has suffered less vandalism than many Camden estates, and it was granted Grade II* listed status on 18 August 1993, the first post-war council housing estate to be listed.English Heritage Images of England. It was described by Peter Brooke, then Heritage Secretary, as \\"one of the most distinguished groups of buildings in England since the Second World War.\\" After a continuing career including international town planning and post- graduate teaching, Brown retrained as a fine artist, to which occupation he devoted his retirement. In October 2017, Brown won the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects.Oliver Wainwright, \\"'I'm dumbfounded!' ‚Ä¶ Neave Brown on bagging an award for the building that killed his career\\".

He was the son of illustrator George Johann Scharf and brother to Sir George Scharf, the first director of the National Portrait Gallery in London. Biography Scharf was born in London, England in 1822 to Elizabeth and George Scharf. He trained as an artist, and most likely studied under his father along with his brother, George. He went on the stage and for a few years he acted with some success in England in Shakespearean plays. Henry Scharf made his London debut in November 1844 as a member of Samuel Phelps's company at Sadler's Wells, where Phelps had produced King John a month or two earlier. On 6 June 1848, Scharf performed with the Amateurs in Birmingham as Master Matthew in Every Man in his Humour. The original actor scheduled to play the role was Charles Dickens' friend, the artist John Leech, who was unable to be there because of the serious illness of his only child. At some point, Scharf moved to the United States and settled in New York, for on 19 August 1850, he played Moses in The School for Scandal in New York city, Henry Scharf left the stage in 1852 and became a professor of elocution and anatomical drawing at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and remained employed in Virginia for twenty five years. This following entry regarding Scharf's drawings was made in a history of the University of Virginia: > These colored drawings for the Medical Department were executed by an > accomplished artist, Mr. Henry Scharf, who labored for six years, and > \\"accumulated an unequalled collection of plates, executed with an exquisite > truth to nature, making them invaluable.\\" These rare plates, on which at > least $3000 had been expended, were unfortunately destroyed in the fire that > consumed the interior of the Medical Hall about 1886. Scharf also taught at the Virginia Female Institute, which opened on 1 January 1844 in Staunton. Known as Professor Scharf, he attended a meeting as Instructor of Elocution in early February, 1872. Scharf returned to the stage from 5 May through 10 May 1884, at the National Theatre (Washington, D.C.), where he was cast in Dewdrop, a romantic comedy by Con.T. Murphy and C.E. Callahan, which starred Miss Lizzie Evans.[5] Around 1882-83 he became a member of a travelling dramatic company for four or five seasons, and towards the end of his career he played \\"leading old men parts\\" in Miss Lizzie Evans's Company. Almost bald and stoutly built towards the end of his life, his last role was as an old gentleman in Fogg's Ferry. He arrived in New York penniless early in June 1887. In July, after borrowing $30 to purchase a suit of clothes, he disappeared. Scharf had a bad heart and it was conjectured that he had died at the age of sixty-five.

History Congress authorized Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point on July 9, 1941, with an initial appropriation of $14,990,000 for construction and clearing of an 8,000 acre (32 km¬≤) tract of swamps, farms and timberland. Actual clearing of the site began on August 6, 1941, with extensive drainage and malaria control work. Construction began in November just 17 days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. On May 20, 1942, the facility was commissioned Cunningham Field, named in honor of the Marine Corps' first aviator, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred A. Cunningham. The completed facility was later renamed Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, after a local post office situated among cherry trees. Cherry Point's primary World War II mission was to train units and individual Marines for service to the Pacific theater. The air station also served as a base for anti-submarine operations, with an Army Air Corps (22d Antisubmarine Squadron) and later a Navy squadron each being responsible for the sinking of a German U-boat just off the North Carolina coast during 1943. Cherry Point's contribution to the Korean War effort was to provide a steady stream of trained aviators and air crewmen as well as maintenance and support personnel as replacements to forward deployed aviation units. During the Vietnam War, Cherry Point deployed three A-6 Intruder squadrons to the Far East and again provided a constant source of replacements for aircrews and enlisted aviation personnel. In Operation Desert Storm, Cherry Point was a major contributor to the victory in Southwest Asia by supporting the deployment of three AV-8B Harrier squadrons, two A-6E Intruder squadrons, one KC-130 Hercules squadron, one EA-6B Prowler squadron, and headquarters detachments from Marine Aircraft Group 14, Marine Aircraft Group 32, and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. Cherry Point Marines and Sailors participated in strike missions and follow-on operations in Afghanistan and its surrounding region during Operation Enduring Freedom, which was initiated on October 7, 2001. On September 8, 2007, the headquarters building (198) was gutted by a fire. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new Headquarters Building was on 29 July 2009, with completion planned for sometime in 2011. The air station and its associated support locations occupy more than 29,000 acres (120 km¬≤). Its runway system is large enough that the air station served as an alternate emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle launches out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.AirStaO 3121.1A MARINE CORPS AIR STATION (MCAS) CHERRY POINT SPACE SHUTTLE SUPPORT PLAN (SSSP) In 2013, Cherry Point hosted warfighters, technology teams and testers under the flags of 10 nations and each of the U.S. military services for the 11th Bold Quest coalition demonstration. The Joint Staff, J6 Joint Deployable Analysis Team (JDAT) led the test plan design, execution control, and emplaced the necessary infrastructure to connect the numerous geographic sites across seven states. Cherry Point was chosen for its ideal location for hosting East Coast military assets, two Navy ships, Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109) and Ticonderoga-class cruiser USS San Jacinto (CG-56). =USAF use= On 1 July 1957 the United States Air Force 614th Airborne Control and Warning Squadron established an Air Defense Command Phase I Mobile Radar station (M-116) at Cherry Point. This station was part of the planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations. The Air Force activated an AN/FPS-6 and two AN/FPS-8 radars located adjacent to Base Flight Operations. These radars were placed on top of towers without radomes, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In addition to the radars on the air station, two unmanned AN/FPS-14 \\"Gap Filler\\" sites, one at Engelhard, NC (M-116B) and one at Holly Ridge, NC (M-116C) were set up for additional coverage. One of the AN/FPS-8s was damaged by Hurricane Donna in 1960. The radars were turned over to the Navy on 30 April 1960, and the Marine Corps retained the other undamaged AN/FPS-8 radar for a number of years for base air traffic control. During 1961 M-116 joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 614th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 March 1963. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Air Force radar operations continued at MCAS Cherry Point until 1 August 1963 when budget reductions and a general draw-down of antiaircraft radar sites closed the facility.Winkler, David F.

Horn was born in Germany, but fled Nazism and spent most of his academic career at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became the university system's first art historian and co-founded the History of Art department. A naturalized citizen of the United States, Horn served in the U.S. Army during World War II and then in the special intelligence unit that tracked down art works plundered by the Nazis. His most celebrated exploit was the recovery of the crown jewels of the Holy Roman Empire, also known as Charlemagne's Imperial Regalia.W. Eugene Kleinbauer, James Marrow and Ruth Mellinkoff, \\"Memoirs of Fellows and Corresponding Fellows of the Medieval Academy of America: Walter W. Horn,\\" Speculum 71 (1996), p. 800 (\\"his most important piece of detective work led to the recovery of the coronation regalia of the Holy Roman Empire\\"); \\"Walter Horn,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 30 December 1995, obituary; University of California (System) Academic Senate, \\"1996, University of California: In Memoriam,\\" \\"Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley\\" (\\"his most spectacular feat was the recovery of Charlemagne's ceremonial regalia\\"). As a scholar, Horn is most noted for his work on the medieval architectural drawing known as the Plan of Saint Gall. Additions: for recovery of Imperial Regalia, see Sidney Kirkpatrick, Hitler‚Äôs Holy Relics, Simon and Schuster, 2010. Horn was present as a guest of Austria at the reopening of the rooms dedicated to the Reglia at the Hofburg Museum in 1987. Early life Horn was born in the town of Waldangelloch in rural Baden as Walther Wilhelm Adolf Horn. His mother was Matilde Peters; she married Karl Horn, a Lutheran minister. Walter attended a Gymnasium in nearby Heidelberg and went on to study art history at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Berlin. He earned his doctorate in 1934 at the University of Hamburg, studying under Erwin Panofsky. His dissertation, Die Fassade von Saint-Gilles, on the fa√ßade of Saint-Gilles, Gard, was published in 1937. World War II era special intelligence officer, Horn recovered the \\"crown of Charlemagne\\", part of the Imperial Regalia hidden by the Nazis Horn fled Germany in opposition to the Nazi regime. He continued his studies from 1934 to 1937 as a research associate at the German Institute for the History of Art in Florence, Italy. In 1938, Horn moved to the United States and began his long association with the University of California, Berkeley, as a lecturer. A year later, he was given a permanent position as the first art historian in the University of California system.UC In Memoriam, p. 87. During this time, he married Ann Binkley Rand. Horn became a naturalized citizen in 1943, dropping the forename Adolf because of its associations with the war. That same year, he volunteered for military duty in the U.S. Army. By 1945, he was a lieutenant in the Third Army under General George S. Patton. Horn's skills as a native speaker of German were put to use in interrogating prisoners of war. After the war, he continued as a special investigator in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, using his expertise as an art historian to track down art that had been stolen or concealed by the Nazis. Horn served until 1946, attaining the rank of captain. In 1945, Horn succeeded in recovering the Imperial Regalia of Charlemagne, the crown, sceptre, and jewels of the Holy Roman Empire. These had been kept hidden by Germans who hoped to return to power even after their defeat by the Allies. The incident has been elaborated, sometimes with inaccuracies, by writers who take particular interest in the Holy Lance, the spear supposed to have pierced the side of Jesus during his crucifixion. This artifact is sometimes called the Spear of Destiny and identified with the Vienna Lance, one of the components of the regalia. In speculative works of non-fiction that endow the lance with occult powers or mystical significance in Nazism,See Trevor Ravenscroft, The Spear of Destiny: The Occult Power behind the Spear Which Pierced the Side of Christ (Red Wheel, 1982). Ravenscroft reproduces a portion of Horn's report on the recovery of the regalia (called there \\"insignia\\"), p. 348. For issues raised by Ravenscroft's methodology, see Holy Lance: Trevor Ravenscroft. Horn appears in narratives about its retrieval from the possession of Adolf Hitler.See E. Randall Floyd, 100 of the World's Greatest Mysteries (Harbor House, 2000), pp. 262‚Äì263; Lionel Fanthorpe and Patricia Fanthorpe, Mysteries and Secrets of the Templars: The Story behind the Da Vinci Code (Dundurn Press Ltd., 2005), p. 57. Usually identified as \\"Lt. Walter William Horn,\\" he is said to have retrieved the lance at the behest of Patton on the very day of Hitler's death, that is, 30 April 1945. The McCarthy era Returning from the war, Horn married Alberta West Parker, a physician, who became a Clinical Professor of Public Health at UC Berkeley.San Francisco Chronicle, March 31, 2012, Alberta Horn, obituary In 1949, Horn and his family became embroiled in the controversy at his university over a loyalty oath requirement. During the era of the Cold War, the Red Scare, and McCarthyism, the Board of Regents at the University of California began to require that all university employees sign an oath affirming their loyalty to the state constitution and denying their membership or belief in organizations advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government. The requirement met with resistance, and in the summer of 1950 thirty-one professorsAlong with a number of other employees. who refused to sign were fired, despite their stature as \\"internationally distinguished scholars.\\"The University Loyalty Oath. Horn's fellow medievalist Ernst Kantorowicz resigned rather than sign the oath, stating his reasons in two letters to the university president that were only published in English decades after the episode. Kantorowicz also presented a letter from Horn, who had signed the oath under protest. In the letter dated 23 August 1950, Horn, then acting chairman of the art department, pointed to his former military service and to his voluntary reactivation that same month as a reservist in the Armed Services. Kantorowicz noted that Horn's letter \\"illustrates the grave conflict of conscience and savage economic coercion to which, after fifteen months of pressure and struggle, he had finally to yield.\\"Horn's letter appears following two letters by Kantorowicz at The University Loyalty Oath: A 50th Anniversary Retrospective, \\"The Fundamental Issue.\\" Academic career and scholarship Horn established methods for dating with his work on the Florence Baptistry Great Coxwell Barn was one of two Cistercian structures studied by Horn and Ernest Born for their first book Horn's early position as research associate in Florence gave him firsthand knowledge of the city's medieval church architecture and produced two important studies, Das Florentiner Baptisterium (1938), an analysis of the fabric and ornamentation of the Florence Baptistry that established new criteria for its dating, and Romanesque Churches in Florence: A Study of Their Chronology and Stylistic Development (1943), which included an examination of the masonry construction of San Miniato al Monte. Throughout his career, he continued to explore the conceptual connections between classical and northern architecture. His specialty was three-aisled timber structures in medieval churches, market halls and manor halls. He was known for arriving at a precise dating of medieval buildings through studying their technologies and observing the physical evidence, drawing on scientific disciplines; he dated timber structures with reference to radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronological tables.Kleinhauer et al., \\"Memoir,\\" p. 801. See, for example, Walter Horn, \\"The Potential and Limitations of Radiocarbon Dating in the Middle Ages,\\" in Scientific Methods in Medieval Archaeology, edited by Rainer Berger (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1970), pp. 23-87. In 1958, Horn published what is considered his most important article,Kleinhauer et al., \\"Memoir,\\" p. 800. \\"On the Origins of the Medieval Bay System\\" in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. He argued that bay-divided medieval churches derived from Germanic timber buildings and represented a continuous tradition of vernacular architecture in transalpine Europe. Horn was the first to assemble the known timber examples, which dated from as early as 1200 BC and extended into the medieval period. Because traces of early wooden structures were often scanty or oblique, Horn used scientific methods to uncover their architectural principles, and demonstrated that these were developed and applied to stone cathedrals in the Romanesque and Gothic periods.Kleinhauer et al., \\"Memoir,\\" p. 800; \\"Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley\\"; Dictionary of Art Historians. The 1958 article was significant also in that it marked Horn's first collaboration with Ernest Born, the San Franciscan architect and draftsman with whom he was to author a series of books and articles over the next twenty years. Their first book was The Barns of the Abbey of Beaulieu at Its Granges of Great Coxwell and Beaulieu St. Leonard (1965), a study of the only two Cistercian tithe barns, dating from the 13th century, that survive in England. But their major project was the three-volume work The Plan of St. Gall: A Study of the Architecture and Economy of, and Life in a Paradigmatic Carolingian Monastery, which has been called \\"one of the greatest monographs on medieval architecture that has ever appeared.\\"Kleinhauer et al., \\"Memoir,\\" p. 801. =Plan of St. Gall= The Plan of Saint Gall The plan of Saint Gall had engaged Horn's imagination and curiosity since he was introduced to it by his mentor Erwin Panofsky.Kleinhauer et al., \\"Memoir,\\" p. 800. In 1957, Horn had participated in an international congress on the plan, and his interest in its guest and service buildings led to his survey of medieval structures in France and England. In 1965, Horn and Born contributed to the creation of a scale model of the 40 buildings rendered on the plan. The model was displayed at the international exhibit Karl der Grosse held at Aachen. Their two decades of collaboration culminated in a work of 1,056 pages with an estimated 1,200 illustrations. The Plan of St. Gall was praised by French historian Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie for its \\"prodigious scholarship,\\" and for its wide-ranging elucidation of Carolingian daily life.William Grimes, \\"Walter Horn, 87, a Historian Of Medieval Cloisters and Barns,\\" New York Times 29 December 1995, obituary The first volume offers a reconstruction of the church and the living quarters for a community of monks numbering about a hundred. The second volume covered the guest and service buildings and the horticultural spaces for growing vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruit and nut trees. The third volume contains supplemental material such as Horn's 88-page catalogue of the plan's explanatory tituli, or captions, and Charles W. Jones' English translation of the Consuetudines Corbienses by Adalhard of the abbey of Corbie.See Charles W. Jones for more on this collaboration. Through meticulous reimagining of the activities that the architecture was meant to facilitate, Horn presents a rich picture of Carolingian life and thought. The most controversial aspect of the work was Horn's major thesis: that the plan was a copy of a lost master plan dating to 816 or 817 that would have been part of documents pertaining to the official monastic reform movement under Louis the Pious at Aachen. The dominant strand of criticism to the contrary holds that the plan was intended to represent an ideal and was never meant to be carried out at a particular site. Horn's last article on the plan, \\"The Medieval Monastery as a Setting for the Production of Manuscripts,\\"Co-authored with Born in the Journal of the Walters Art Gallery 44 (1986) 16‚Äì47. was a response to this criticism. The Plan of St. Gall earned twelve major awards for its scholarship, bookmaking, and typography, including a prize from France's Acad√©mie d'architecture and a 1982 medal from the American Institute of Architects.Kleinhauer et al., \\"Memoir,\\" p. 801; Grimes, NYT obituary. =Later work= In 1974, Horn retired to emeritus status after 36 years at the University of California. His last publication, The Forgotten Hermitage of Skellig Michael (1990), co-authored with Jenny White Marshall and Grellan D. Rourke, resulted from fieldwork begun in 1978 on Ireland's Atlantic offshore islands. His interest in the Celtic roundhouse had been indicated earlier in \\"On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister\\" (1973). =Honors and administrative achievements= Horn worked with classical archaeologist Darrell A. Amyx to establish History of Art as a separate department at the University of California in 1971. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1970) and of the Medieval Academy of America (1980). Horn was an active supporter of arts institutions outside academia, serving as trustee of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and chairman of the museum's acquisitions committee.San Francisco Chronicle, 30 December 1995, obituary \\"Walter Horn.\\" He was on the board of the College Art Association 1950‚Äì54 and 1964‚Äì68 and on the board of the Society of Architectural Historians 1964‚Äì68. Death Horn died at home of pneumonia on Tuesday, 26 December 1995, at Point Richmond, California. He was 87. He was survived by his wife, Alberta; his son, Michael; two daughters, Rebecca and Robin; and grandchildren, Matthew and Dulce. His obituary in the New York Times labeled him \\"historian of medieval cloisters and barns.\\" Horn was remembered by colleagues as one of the university's \\"best-loved and most influential teachers and ... most effective leaders.\\"\\"Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley,\\" Calisphere. He was eulogized for \\"his oratorical skills and uncanny ability to bring the medieval building or pile of ruins vividly to life.

(16 May 1928 ‚Äì 30 July 2008) was an Irish biochemist and Life Fellow of King's College Cambridge. Born in Dublin, the youngest son of Henry Horatio Dixon, he was interested in science from a young age; his discovery of an optical illusion arising from binocular vision was described by his father in Nature Magazine when he was only nine years old. After education at Shrewsbury School he was awarded a scholarship in 1946 to study Natural Sciences at King's College Cambridge where his elder brother Kendal was a fellow, achieving firsts in Part I and Part II and specialising in biochemistry. He remained at King's for his graduate studies on peptide hormones, supervised by Frank Young, and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1954. In 1953 he was elected to a Life Fellowship at King's, where he remained for the whole of his academic career, holding the positions of Financial Tutor (1956‚Äì1959), Director of Studies in Natural Sciences (1961‚Äì1981), Vice Provost (1981‚Äì1986) and Praelector (1989‚Äì1992), as well as co-editor of the College Register. In 1954 he was appointed as University Demonstrator in biochemistry, and in 1959 was promoted to University Lecturer. His research in chemistry and biochemistry led to 136 published papers. From 1964 to 1965, he worked at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Moscow as part of a UK-USSR exchange program. His particular interest in applications of methods from organic chemistry to biochemistry led to a proposed treatment for Wilson's disease. Dixon was an editor of The Biochemical Journal, and was Deputy Chairman of the Editorial Board from 1977 to 1982. He was secretary of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry from 1977 to 1982 and chairman from 1983 to 1988, and after his retirement remained an advisory member. After his death, a set of rooms in the Gibbs' Building in King's College was named the Hal Dixon Rooms in his memory.

He was one of the first thinkers to develop what would later come to be called natural rights theory, and was also one of the first individuals to defend Joan of Arc and proclaim her supernatural vocation as authentic.Richard Tuck, Philosophy and Government 1572-1651 (1993), pp. 25-7. Aged fourteen, he left Gerson-l√®s-Barby to study at the college of Navarre in Paris under Gilles Deschamps, (Aegidius Campensis) and Pierre d'Ailly (Petrus de Alliaco), who became his life-long friend. Early life and education Gerson was born at Gerson-l√®s-Barby, Gerson (paroisse de Barby) a hamlet in the present municipality of Barby, Ardennes in the bishopric of Reims in Champagne. His parents, Arnulphe Charlier and √âlisabeth de la Chardeni√®re, \\"a second Monica,\\" were pious peasants, and seven of their twelve children, four daughters and three sons, devoted themselves to a religious life. Young Gerson was sent to Paris to the famous college of Navarre when fourteen years of age. After a five years' course he obtained the degree of licentiate of arts, and then began his theological studies under two very celebrated teachers, Gilles Deschamps (Aegidius Campensis) and Pierre d'Ailly (Petrus de Alliaco), rector of the college of Navarre, chancellor of the university, and afterwards bishop of Puy, archbishop of Cambrai and cardinal. Pierre d'Ailly remained his lifelong friend, and in later life the pupil seems to have become the teacher (see preface to Liber de vita Spir. Animae).  Gerson and the University of Paris  Gerson very soon attracted the notice of the university. He was elected procurator for the French 'nation' (the French-born Francophone students at the University) in 1383, and again in 1384, in which year he graduated bachelor of theology. Three years later a still higher honour was bestowed upon him; he was sent along with the chancellor and others to represent the university in a case of appeal taken to the pope. John of Montson (Monz√≥n, de Montesono), an Aragonese Dominican who had recently graduated as doctor of theology at Paris, had in 1387 been condemned by the faculty of theology because he had taught that the Virgin Mary, like other ordinary descendants of Adam, was born in original sin; and the Dominicans, who were fierce opponents of the doctrine of the immaculate conception, were expelled from the university. John of Montson appealed to Pope Clement VII at Avignon, and Pierre d'Ailly, Gerson and the other university delegates, while they personally supported the doctrine of the immaculate conception, were content to rest their case upon the legal rights of the university to test in its own way its theological teachers. Gerson's biographers have compared his journey to Avignon with Luther's visit to Rome. It is certain that from this time onwards he was zealous in his endeavours to spiritualize the universities, to reform the morals of the clergy, and to put an end to the schism which then divided the church. In 1392 Gerson was awarded licentiate, receiving his doctorate of theology in 1394; and in 1395, when Pierre d'Ailly was made bishop of Puy, he was, at the early age of thirty-two, elected Chancellor of the University of Paris, and made a canon of Notre Dame. The university was then at the height of its fame, and its chancellor was necessarily a man prominent not only in France but in Europe, sworn to maintain the rights of his university against both king and pope, and entrusted with the conduct and studies of a vast crowd of students attracted from almost every country in Europe. Gerson's writings bear witness to his deep sense of the responsibilities, anxieties and troubles of his position. He was all his days a man of letters, and an analysis of his writings is his best biography. His work has three periods, in which he was engaged in reforming the university studies, maturing plans for overcoming the schism (a task which after 1404 absorbed all his energies), and in the evening of his life writing books of devotion. Gerson's writings Gerson wished to banish scholastic subtleties from the studies of the university, and at the same time to put some evangelical warmth into them, giving them a more spiritual and practical focus. He was called at this period of his life Doctor Christianissimus; later his devotional and pastoral writings brought him the title Doctor Consolatorius. His plan was to make theology plain and simple by adopting a mystical theology that he distinguished from purely scientific theology.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06530c.htm His method was a clear exposition of the principles of theology where clearness was possible, with a due recognition of the place of mystery in the Christian system of doctrine. Like the great nominalist William of Ockham, he saved himself from rationalism by laying hold on mysticism‚Äîthe Christian mysticism of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the school of Richard of St. Victor, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Saint Bonaventure. While scholars have contended that Gerson adopted several nominalist tenets, others have maintained that he was anti-nominalist in his basic outlook.http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social- sciences-magazines/gerson-jean-de In Catholic circles, Gerson's theology is usually held in high esteem, while his ecclesiastical doctrines are sometimes viewed as suspect due to his support for conciliarism.Hays, B. Gregory. ‚ÄúJean Gerson (14 December 1363‚Äì12 July 1429).‚Äù In Literature of the French and Occitan Middle Ages: Eleventh to Fifteenth Centuries. Dictionary of Literary Biography, vol. 208. Edited by Deborah Sinnreich-Levi and Ian S. Laurie, 129‚Äì140. Detroit: Gale Group, 1999. He thought that, by laying hold of mysticism, he would equally guard against the folly of the old scholasticism, and the seductions of such Averroistic pantheism as was preached by heretics like Amalric of Bena. His plans for the reformation of university studies may be learned from his Epistolae de reform. theol. (i. I 21), Epistolae ad studentes Coligii Navarrae, quid et qualiter studere debeat novus ideologiae auditor, et contra curiositatem studentium (i. 106), Lectiones duae contra vanam curiositatem in negotio fidei (i. 86), and De mystica theologia, speculativa et practica. The study of the Bible and of the fathers was to supersede the idle questions of the schools, and in his Tract. contra romantiam de rosa (iii. 297) he warns against the irreverent Roman de la rose of Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun‚Äîa position in which he was joined by Christine de Pizan. He was often weary of the chancellorship‚Äîit involved him in strife and in money difficulties; he grew tired of public life, and longed for learned leisure. To obtain it he accepted the deanery of Bruges from the duke of Burgundy, but after a short sojourn he returned to Paris and to the chancellorship. Gerson's 1402 treatise De Vita Spirituali Animae was one of the first attempts at developing natural rights theory.Richard Tuck, Philosophy and Government 1572-1651 (1993), pp. 25-7. He thought that freedom could be exchanged in the same way as property.David Graeber, Debt: The First 5,000 Years (2011), p. 206. Gerson and the Great Schism Gerson's chief work was toward reconciling the great schism. Gregory XI had died in 1378 in Rome, one year after Gerson went to the college of Navarre, and since his death there were two claimants to the papacy, both elected by the cardinals, one in Rome and one in Avignon. This caused great confusion, as the Church could, at one time, only have one legitimate successor of St. Peter. As the popes had been under French influence so long that it appeared to France a political necessity to have the pope reside in a French area, the French monarchy was quick to side with the Avignon pope, thus helping the schism take root. Due to this, pious Frenchmen felt themselves somewhat responsible for the sins and scandals of the schism. Hence the melancholy piety of Gerson, Pierre d'Ailly and their companions, and the energy with which they strove to bring the schism to an end. During the lifetime of Clement VII, the University of Paris, led by Pierre d'AiIly, Gerson and Nicholas of Cl√©manges, met in deliberation about the state of Christendom, and resolved that the schism could be ended in three ways; by cession, if both popes renounced the office unconditionally, by arbitration, or by a general council. When Clement died, the king of France, urged by the university, sent orders that no new pope should be elected. But, the cardinals held their election first, and only then opened the king's letter. In the new elections, however, both at Rome and Avignon, the influence of Paris was so much felt that each of the new popes swore to cede if his rival would do likewise. Meanwhile in 1395 the French Estates General and the French clergy adopted the programme of the university ‚Äî cession or a general council. The movement gathered strength. By 1398 most of the cardinals and most of the crowned heads in Europe supported the plan. During this period Gerson's literary activity was untiring, and the throb of public expectancy, of hope and fear, is revealed in his multitude of pamphlets. At first there were hopes of a settlement by way of cession. These come out in Protest. super statuni ecclesiae (ii. I), Tractatus de modo habendi se tempore schismatis, De schismate, etc. But soon the popes' intransigence strengthened the movement for a council‚Äîsee De concilio generali unius obedientiae (ii. 24). A council was resolved upon, to meet at Pisa, and Gerson poured forth tract after tract for its guidance. The most important are Trilogus in materia schismatis (ii. 83), and De unitate Ecclesiae (ii. 113), in which, following Pierre d'Ailly (see Paul Tschackert, Peter von Ailli, p. 153), Gerson demonstrates that the ideal unity of the church, based upon Christ, destroyed by the popes, can only be restored by a general council, supreme and legitimate, though unsummoned by a pope. The council met, deposed both antipopes, and elected Alexander V. Gerson officially addressed the new pope on his duties in Sermo coram Alexandro Papa in die ascensionis in concilio Pisano (ii. 131). All hopes of reformation, however, were crushed by the conduct of the new pope, especially his immoderate partiality toward the Franciscan Order, of which he had been a monk. He issued a bull which laid the parish clergy and the universities at the mercy of the mendicants. The University of Paris rose in revolt, headed by its chancellor Gerson, who wrote the fierce pamphlet Censura professorum in theologia circa bullam Alexandri V (ii. 442). The pope died soon after, and John XXIII (Baldassare Cossa), was elected his successor. Instead of peace, the council of Pisa had produced only a third papacy. Pierre d'Ailly despaired of general councils (see his De difficultate reformationis in concilio universali), but Gerson struggled on. Gerson also fought against the murderous discords and cynicism of royal politics. The feuds between the houses of Orleans and Burgundy were ruining France. The king's brother Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, had been murdered by followers of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. This had been publicly justified by a theologian, Jean Petit (c. 1360-1411). Gerson had Petit's \\"eight verities\\" ‚Äî apologias for the murder ‚Äî condemned by the University of Paris, the archbishop, and the grand inquisitor, and the book was publicly burned before Notre Dame. Gerson wished a council to confirm this sentence. His literary labours were as untiring as ever: he wrote that a general council could depose a pope; he drew up indictments against the reigning pontiffs, reiterated the charges against Jean Petit, and exposed the sin of schism‚Äîin short, he did all he could to direct the public mind toward healing the evils in the church. His efforts were powerfully seconded by Emperor Sigismund, and the result was the Council of Constance. Gerson's influence at the council was supreme up to the election of a new pope. It was he who dictated the form of submission and cession made by John XXIII, and directed the condemnation of Jan Hus. Many of Gerson's biographers have found it difficult to reconcile his proceedings against Hus with his own opinions upon the supremacy of the pope; but the difficulty has arisen partly from misunderstanding Gerson's position, partly from supposing him to be the author of a famous tract De modis uniendi et reformandi Ecclesiam in concilio universali. This, and the treatises De modis uniendi et reformandi Ecclesiam, and De difficultate reformationis in concilio universali, long ascribed to Gerson, were proved by Johann Baptist Schwab in his Johannes Gerson not to be his work, and have since been ascribed to Abbot Andreas of Randuf, and with more reason to Dietrich of Nieheim. All Gerson's high-sounding phrases about the supremacy of a council were meant to apply only in times of emergency. He was essentially a trimmer, not a reformer, and he hated Hus with all his heart. The council of Constance, which raised Gerson's prestige to its height, in the end became his downfall. The council, overawed by the duke of Burgundy, would not affirm the censure of Jean Petit. The justification of murder was declared a mere opinion, not a doctrine, and only one of Petit's \\"verities\\" was condemned; and even this censure was annulled by the new pope, Martin V. Gerson dared not return to France for fear of Burgundy, who had taken power. He lived in unofficial exile in Constance, then at Rattenberg in Tirol, where he wrote his famous book De consolatione theologiae. Retirement On returning to France he went to Lyon, where his brother was prior of the Celestine monastery. Although Gerson was retired from active university life, the decade at Lyon was a time of great literary productivity. He produced a harmony of the gospels (the Monotesseron), works on the poems of the bible climaxing in a massive collection of twelve treatises on the Magnificat (Lk. 1:46-55), a commentary on the Song of Songs, as well as an extensive literary correspondence with members of the Carthusian order and others on mysticism and other issues of spiritual life. Shortly before his death he produced a tract in support of Joan of Arc. It is said that he taught a school of boys and girls in Lyon, and his only fee was to make the children promise to repeat the prayer, \\"Lord, have mercy on thy poor servant Gerson\\" (though this story has been questioned by Gerson's most recent biographer). He died at Lyon on the 12 July 1429. Tradition declares that during his sojourn he translated or adapted The Imitation of Christ.

He had a special disdain, however, for schools that specialized in religious studies only, and sought to demonstrate that local schools that held regular academic classes as well as classes in religion were more beneficial to their pupils than religious schools with lopsided curricula. At this time, Qutb developed his bent against the imams and their traditional approach to education. This confrontation would persist throughout his life.Khalidy, Saleh. Sayyid Qutb: From Birth to Martydom. Dar Al-Qalam 3rd edition 1999. Qutb moved to Cairo, where between 1929 and 1933 he received an education based on the British style of schooling before starting his career as a teacher in the Ministry of Public Instruction. During his early career, Qutb devoted himself to literature as an author and critic, writing such novels as Ashwak (Thorns) and even helped to elevate Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz from obscurity. He wrote his very first article in the literary magazine al-Balagh in 1922, and his first book, Muhimmat al-Sha‚Äôir fi al-Haya wa Shi‚Äôr al-Jil al-Hadir (The Mission of the Poet in Life and the Poetry of the Present Generation), in 1932, when he was 25, in his last year at Dar al-Ulum.John Calvert, Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism, Oxford University Press (2009), p. 67 As a literary critic, he was particularly influenced by ‚ÄòAbd al-Qahir al-Jurjani (d. 1078), \\"in his view one of the few mediaeval philologists to have concentrated on meaning and aesthetic value at the expense of form and rhetoric.\\"John Calvert, Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism, Oxford University Press (2009), pp. 106-107 In 1939, he became a functionary in Egypt's Ministry of Education (wizarat al-ma'arif). In the early 1940s, he encountered the work of Nobel Prize-winner French eugenicist Alexis Carrel, who would have a seminal and lasting influence on his criticism of Western civilization, as \\"instead of liberating man, as the post-Enlightenment narrative claimed, he believed that Western modernity enmeshed people in spiritually numbing networks of control and discipline, and that rather than building caring communities, it cultivated attitudes of selfish individualism. Qutb regarded Carrel as a rare sort of Western thinker, one who understood that his civilization ‚Äúdepreciated humanity‚Äù by honouring the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù over the ‚Äúspirit and soul‚Äù (al-nafs wa al-ruh). He saw Carrel‚Äôs critique, coming as it did from within the enemy camp, as providing his discourse with an added measure of legitimacy.\\"John Calvert, Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism, Oxford University Press (2009), pp. 91-92 From 1948 to 1950, he went to the United States on a scholarship to study its educational system, spending several months at Colorado State College of Education (now the University of Northern Colorado) in Greeley, Colorado. Qutb's first major theoretical work of religious social criticism, Al-'adala al-Ijtima'iyya fi-l-Islam (Social Justice in Islam), was published in 1949, during his time in the West. Though Islam gave him much peace and contentment,Sayyed said about the Qur'an: \\"Allah has bestowed upon me with the life in the shades of the Qur'an for a period of time, I have tasted, during it, of his grace and beneficence, what I have never tasted at all in my life.\\" Fi Zilal al-Qur'an, Introduction, 1st Chapter. he suffered from respiratory and other health problems throughout his life and was known for \\"his introvertedness, isolation, depression and concern.\\" In appearance, he was \\"pale with sleepy eyes.\\"Hamudah, Adil, Sayyid Qutb: min al-qarya ila al-mashnaqa (Cairo, Ruz al-Yusuf, 1987), pp. 60‚Äì61, quoted in Moussalli (1992), p. 35 Qutb never married, in part because of his steadfast religious convictions.

She > knows it lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She > knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the > shapely thighs, sleek legs ‚Äì and she shows all this and does not hide it.

His experience in the U.S. is believed to have formed in part the impetus for his rejection of Western values and his move towards Islamism upon returning to Egypt. Resigning from the civil service, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1950s1953 according to Calvert (2000), 1951 according to Kepel (1985) and became editor-in-chief of the Brothers' weekly Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin, and later head of its propaganda\\"Qutb, a one-time literary critic, was not a religious fundamentalist, but a Goebbels-style propagandist for a new totalitarianism to stand side-by-side with fascism and communism.\\" Islamism, fascism and terrorism (Part 2) by Marc Erikson; 8 November 2002, Asia Times Online\\"Others, such as Sayyid Qutb, the Muslim Brotherhood's leading intellectual, or bin Laden's first theological mentor, Abdallah Azzam, a Palestinian Sheikh who first conceptualised global jihad, have laid out the theological tenets of jihadist terrorism better than he [Osama bin Laden].\\" \\"People of the decade: From Osama to Obama\\", 25 December 2009, The National\\"About that time Sayyid Qutb accepted an appointment to head the Muslim Brothers' propaganda department, called the Propagation of the Message Section.\\" \\"Sayyid Qutb: The Karl Marx of the Islamic Revolution\\"\\"It is evidence of ideological continuity with the radical Islamist propaganda coming from wartime Berlin.

Moussalli, Radical Islamic Fundamentalism, (1992), pp. 31‚Äì32 =Nasser and Qutb's death= In July 1952, Egypt's pro-Western government was overthrown by the nationalist Free Officers Movement headed by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Both Qutb and the Muslim Brotherhood welcomed the coup d'√©tat against the monarchist government ‚Äì which they saw as un-Islamic and subservient to British imperialism ‚Äì and enjoyed a close relationship with the movement prior to and immediately following the coup. Nasser would go to the house of Syed Qutb and ask him for ideas about the Revolution. Many members of the Brotherhood expected Nasser to establish an Islamic government. However, the co-operation between the Brotherhood and Free Officers which marked the revolution's success soon soured as it became clear the secular nationalist ideology of Nasserism was incompatible with the Islamism of the Brotherhood. Nasser had secretly set up an organisation that would sufficiently oppose the Muslim Brotherhood once he came to power. This organisation was called \\"Tahreer\\" (\\"freedom\\" in Arabic). It was well known that the Brotherhood were made popular by their extensive social programs in Egypt, and Nasser wanted to be ready once he had taken over. At this time, Qutb did not realize Nasser's alternate plans, and would continue to meet with him, sometimes for 12 hours a day,The Life of Syed Qutb, The Revolution Happens, p. 24 to discuss a post monarchical Egypt. Once Qutb realized that Nasser had taken advantage of the secrecy between the Free Officers and the Brotherhood, he promptly quit. Nasser then tried to persuade Qutb by offering him any position he wanted in Egypt except its Kingship, saying: \\"We will give you whatever position you want in the government, whether it's the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Arts, etc.\\"Hassan elBanna & Syed Qutb, p. 24 Qutb refused every offer, having understood the reality of Nasser's plans. Upset that Nasser would not enforce a government based on Islamic ideology, Qutb and other Brotherhood members plotted to assassinate him in 1954. The attempt was foiled and Qutb was jailed soon afterwards; the Egyptian government used the incident to justify a crackdown on various members of the Muslim Brotherhood for their vocal opposition towards the Nasser administration. During his first three years in prison, conditions were bad and Qutb was tortured. In later years he was allowed more mobility, including the opportunity to write.Berman, Terror and Liberalism, (2003), p. 63 This period saw the composition of his two most important works: a commentary of the Qur'an Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Qur'an), and a manifesto of political Islam called Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones). These works represent the final form of Qutb's thought, encompassing his radically anti-secular and anti-Western claims based on his interpretations of the Qur'an, Islamic history, and the social and political problems of Egypt. The school of thought he inspired has become known as Qutbism. Qutb was let out of prison at the end of 1964 at the behest of the Prime Minister of Iraq, Abdul Salam Arif, for only 8 months before being rearrested in August 1965. He was accused of plotting to overthrow the state and subjected to what some consider a show trial.Hasan, S. Badrul, Syed Qutb Shaheed, Islamic Publications International, 2nd ed. 1982 Many of the charges placed against Qutb in court were taken directly from Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq and he adamantly supported his written statements. The trial culminated in a death sentence for Qutb and six other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was sentenced to death for his part in the conspiracy to assassinate the President and other Egyptian officials and personalities, though he was not the instigator or leader of the actual plot.Sivan (1985) p. 93.Fouad Ajami, \\"In the Pharaoh's Shadow: Religion and Authority in Egypt,\\" Islam in the Political Process, editor James P. Piscatori, Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 25‚Äì26. On 29 August 1966, he was executed by hanging. Evolution of thought, views and statements=Theological stances= Qutb held that belief in matters that cannot be seen (or are imperceptible) was an important sign of man's ability to accept knowledge from fields outside of science: > The concept of the imperceptible is a decisive factor in distinguishing man > from animal. Materialist thinking, ancient as well as modern, has tended to > drag man back to an irrational existence, with no room for the spiritual, > where everything is determined by sensory means alone. What is peddled as > 'progressive thought' is no more than dismal regression.Fi Dhalal al Qur'an, > vol. 1, p. 35 =Secularism= Different theories have been advanced as to why Qutb turned away from his secularist tendencies towards Islamic sharia. One common explanation is that the conditions he witnessed in prison from 1954‚Äì1964, including the torture and murder of the Muslim Brotherhood members, convinced him that only a government bound by Islamic law could prevent such abuses. Another is that Qutb's experiences in America as a darker-skinned person and the insufficiently anti-Western policies of Nasser demonstrated to him the powerful and dangerous allure of ignorance (jahiliyyah) ‚Äì a threat unimaginable, in Qutb's estimation, to the secular mind. In the opening of his book Milestones he presents the following views: In Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq Qutb argued that anything non-Islamic was evil and corrupt, and that following sharia as a complete system extending into all aspects of life, would bring every kind of benefit to humanity, from personal and social peace, to the \\"treasures\\" of the universe.Qutb, Milestones, pp. 90, 32 Qutb's experiences as an Egyptian Muslim ‚Äì his village childhood, professional career, and activism in the Muslim Brotherhood ‚Äì left an indelible mark on his theoretical and religious works. Even Qutb's early, secular writing shows evidence of his later themes. For example, Qutb's autobiography of his childhood Tifl min al- Qarya (A Child From the Village) makes little mention of Islam or political theory and is typically classified as a secular, literary work. However, it is replete with references to village mysticism, superstition, the Qur'an, and incidences of injustice. Qutb's later work developed along similar themes, dealing with Qur'anic exegesis, social justice, and political Islam. Qutb's career as a writer also heavily influenced his philosophy. In al-Taswiir al- Fanni fil-Quran (Artistic Representation in the Qur'an), Qutb developed a literary appreciation of the Qur'an and a complementary methodology for interpreting the text. His hermeneutics were applied in his extensive commentary on the Qur'an, Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Quran), which served as the foundation for the declarations of Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq. Late in his life, Qutb synthesized his personal experiences and intellectual development in the famous Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq, a religious and political manifesto for what he believed was a true Islamic system. It was also in this text that Qutb condemned Muslim governments, such as Abdul Nasser's regime in Egypt, as secular, with their legitimacy based on human (and thus corrupt), rather than divine authority. This work, more than any other, established Qutb as one of the premier Islamists of the 20th century, and perhaps the foremost proponent of Islamist thought in that era. Qutb, dissatisfied with the condition of contemporary Islam, identified its benighted state as having two principal causes. The first was that many Muslims were forsaking their faith in the Qur'an, thereby disturbing the cosmic balance in the world. This had led to the virulent spread of a secular culture within Muslim societies, which, with the assistance of Western imperialism and colonialism that distorted the existing order, was a second important cause of the straying of many Muslims from the right path. Qutb asserted that the Islamic world had sunk into a state of Jahiliyyah (ignorance and foolishness).Sayed Khatab, Hakimiyyah and Jahiliyyah in the Thought of Sayyid Qutb, Taylor & Francis, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 38, No. 3, 2002 p. 162; =Events prompting the move from secularism to Islam= Qutb told people of his shift from secularism to Islam. > His journey started when he studied the Qur'an in a literal way, and he > slowly began to understand the principles lined in the religion. Then > something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; that > while he was going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the > way the boat he was travelling in ‚Äì was rocking in the huge sea ‚Äì all under > the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he > realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart > due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top > of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation in front of him, and > he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a > whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.The Lives of Hassan > elBanna & Syed Qutb, p. 18 Political philosophy Qutb's mature political views always centered on Islam ‚Äì Islam as a complete system of morality, justice and governance, whose sharia laws and principles should be the sole basis of governance and everything else in life ‚Äì though his interpretation of it varied. Qutb's political philosophy has been described as an attempt to instantiate a complex and multilayer eschatological vision, partly grounded in the counter-hegemonic re-articulation of the traditional ideal of Islamic universalism. Following the 1952 coup, he espoused a 'just dictatorship' that would 'grant political liberties to the virtuous alone.'Sivan, Emmanuel, Radical Islam : Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, Yale University Press, 1985, p. 73al-Akhbar, 8 August 1952 Later he wrote that rule by sharia law would require essentially no government at all. In an earlier work,Qutb, Social Justice in Islam Qutb described military jihad as defensive, Islam's campaign to protect itself,Berman, Terror and Liberalism (2003), p. 98 while later he believed jihad must be offensive.Stahl, A.E. \\"'Offensive Jihad' in Sayyid Qutb's Ideology.\\" International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. 24/03/2011. On the issue of Islamic governance, Qutb differed with many modernist and reformist Muslims who claimed that democracy was Islamic because the Quranic institution of Shura supported elections and democracy. Qutb pointed out that the Shura chapter of the Qur'an was revealed during the Mekkan period, and therefore, it does not deal with the problem of government. It makes no reference to elections and calls only for the ruler to consult some of the ruled, as a particular case of the general rule of Shura.Sivan, Radical Islam, 1985, p. 73 Qutb also opposed the then popular ideology of Arab nationalism, having become disillusioned with the 1952 Nasser Revolution after having been exposed to the regime's practices of arbitrary arrest, torture, and deadly violence during his imprisonment. =Antisemitism= Qutb was a staunch antisemite. The Jew Is Not My Enemy: Unveiling the Myths That Fuel Muslim Anti-Semitism by Tarek Fatah, Random House LLC, 2011, pp. 33‚Äì34 In 1950, he published a book Our Struggle against the Jews, which forms a central part of today's Islamist antisemitism. =View on the harmony of man= Qutb felt strongly that the world was meant to serve man if understood properly. He wrote: \\"Islam teaches that God created the physical world and all its forces for man's own use and benefit. Man is specifically taught and directed to study the world around him, discover its potential and utilize all his environment for his own good and the good of his fellow humans. Any harm that man suffers at the hands of nature is a result only of his ignorance or lack of understanding of it and of the laws governing it. The more man learns about nature, the more peaceful and harmonious his relationship with nature and the environment. Hence, the notion of \\"conquering nature\\" can readily be seen as cynical and negative. It is alien to Islamic perceptions and betrays a shameless ignorance of the spirit in which the world has been created and the divine wisdom that underlies it.\\"In the Shade of the Qur'an, Vol. 1, p. 6 =Jahiliyyah versus freedom in Islam= This exposure to abuse of power undoubtedly contributed to the ideas in his famous prison-written Islamic manifesto Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), where he advocated a political system that is the opposite of dictatorship ‚Äî the Sharia, \\"God's rule on earth\\".Qutb, Milestones, pp. 58 Qutb argued: * Much of the Muslim world approaches the Qur'an as a means to simply acquire culture and information, to participate in academic discussions and enjoyment. This evades the real purpose, for rather, it should be approached as orders to be followed (\\"what the Almighty Creator had prescribed for him\\"), as a source of \\"instruction for obedience and action\\".Qutb, Milestones, p. 21 * Rather than support rule by a pious few, (whether a dictator(s) or democratically elected), Qutb believed in what one observer has called \\"a kind of anarcho-Islam\\". Since Muslims would need neither judges nor police to obey divine sharia law (\\"As soon as a command is given, the heads are bowed, and nothing more is required for its implementation except to hear it.\\"),Qutb, Milestones, p.32 there would be no rulers, no \\"servitude to other men\\", which is an un-Islamic violation of God's sovereignty (Hakamiyya) over all of creation.Freedom in MilestonesQutb, Milestones, pp. 85, 32 * The way to bring about this freedom was for a revolutionary vanguard to fight jahiliyyah with a twofold approach: preaching, and using \\"physical power and jihad\\" to \\"abolish\\" the organizations and authorities of the Jahili system\\" * The vanguard movement would grow with preaching and jihad until it formed a truly Islamic community, then spread throughout the Islamic homeland and finally throughout the entire world, attaining leadership of humanity. While those who had been \\"defeated by the attacks of the treacherous Orientalists!\\" might define jihad \\"narrowly\\" as defensive, Islamically correct jihad (according to Qutb) was in fact offensive, not defensive. Qutb emphasized that this struggle would be anything but easy.

Criticisms Although his work has motivated and mobilized some Muslims,major architects and \\"strategists\\" of contemporary Islamic revival Qutb also has critics. Following the publication of Milestones and the aborted plot against the Nasser government, mainstream Muslims took issue with Qutb's contention that \\"physical power\\" and jihad had to be used to overthrow governments, attack societies, and the \\"institutions and traditions\\" of the Muslim ‚Äì but according to Qutb jahili ‚Äì world.Qutbism#Takfir The ulama of Al-Azhar University school took the unusual step following his death of putting Sayyid Qutb on their index of heresy, declaring him a \\"deviant\\" (munharif).Kepel, Jihad, 1986, p. 58 Reformist Muslims, on the other hand, questioned his understanding of sharia, i.e. that it is not only perfect and complete, but completely accessible to people and thus the solution to any of their problems.Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq#ShariaAbou El Fadl, The Great Theft (2005), p. 1982 Also criticized is his dismissal of not only all non-Muslim culture, but many centuries of Muslim learning, culture and beauty following the first four caliphs as un- Islamic and thus worthless.Meddeb, Malady of Islam (2003), p. 104 Conservative criticism went further, condemning Qutb's Islamist/reformist ideas‚Äîsuch as social justice and redistributive economics, banning of slavery, ‚Äì as \\"western\\" and bid‚Äòah or innovative (innovations to Islam being forbidden). They have accused Qutb of amateur scholarship, overuse of ijtihad, innovation in Ijma (which Qutb felt should not be limited to scholars, but should be conducted by all MuslimsMoussalli, Ahmad S., Radical Islamic Fundamentalism: the Ideological and Political Discourse of Sayyid Qutb by Ahmad S.

The iniquitous prince, who had usurped God's sovereignty and made himself the object of worship of his subjects, had the Islamicist theoretician hanged on 29 August 1966. Sazyyid Qutb thereby acquired the status of shahid, or martyr, in the eyes of his admirers.\\" According to authors Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, \\"it was Sayyid Qutb who fused together the core elements of modern Islamism: the Kharijites' takfir, ibn Taymiyya's fatwas and policy prescriptions, Rashid Rida's salafism, Maududi's concept of the contemporary jahiliyya and Hassan al-Banna's political activism.\\"The Age of Sacred Terror by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, p. 62 Qutb's written works are still widely available and have been translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l- Tariq (Milestones), but the majority of Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In the Shade of the Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In the Shade of the Qur‚Äôan, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social process that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.Shahrough Akhavi, The Dialectic in Contemporary Egyptian Social Thought: The Scripturalist and Modernist Discourses of Sayyid Qutb and Hasan Hanafi, Cambridge University Press, International Journal of Middle East Studies, Vol. 29, No. 3, 2007 p. 379; The influence of his work extends to issues such as Westernization, modernization, and political reform and the theory of inevitable ideological conflict between \\"Islam and the West\\" (see Clash of civilizations), the notion of a transnational umma, and the comprehensive application of jihad. Qutb's theoretical work on Islamic advocacy, social justice and education, has left a significant mark not only on the Muslim Brotherhood, but also Muslim scholars from all backgrounds : like the founder of the Syrian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mustafa al-Siba'i, as well as the Indonesian Sunni scholar Hamka and the Iraqi Shia scholar Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr.John Calvert, Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism, Oxford University Press (2009), p. 165 Hekmatyar, one of the most influential Afghan Islamists, says that he precisely turned Islamist in 1966, after hearing the death of Qutb on radio.Gilles Dorronsoro, Revolution Unending: Afghanistan, 1979 to the Present, C.

His influence on al-Qaeda was felt through his writing, his followers and especially through his brother, Muhammad Qutb, who moved to Saudi Arabia following his release from prison in Egypt and became a professor of Islamic Studies and edited, published and promoted his brother Sayyid's work.Kepel, War for Muslim Minds, (2004) pp. 174‚Äì75Kepel, Jihad, (2002), p. 51 One of Muhammad Qutb's students and later an ardent follower was Ayman Zawahiri, who went on to become a member of the Egyptian Islamic JihadSageman, Marc, Understanding Terror Networks, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, p. 63 and later a mentor of Osama bin Laden and a leading member of al-Qaeda. Zawahiri was first introduced to Qutb by his uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, who was very close to Qutb throughout his life. Azzam was Qutb's student, then prot√©g√©, then personal lawyer and executor of his estate ‚Äì one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. According to Lawrence Wright, who interviewed Azzam, \\"young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb's character and the torment he had endured in prison.\\"Wright, Looming Tower, 2006, pp. 36‚Äì7 Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.

A close college friend of bin Laden's, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, told Wright, that bin Laden regularly attended weekly public lectures by Muhammad Qutb, at King Abdulaziz University, and that he and bin Laden both \\"read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.\\"Wright, Looming Tower, 2006, p. 79 While imprisoned in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki became influenced by the works of Qutb. He would read 150‚Äì200 pages a day of Qutb's works, describing himself during the course of his reading as \\"so immersed with the author I would feel Sayyid was with me in my cell speaking to me directly.\\" On the other hand, associate professor of history at Creighton University, John Calvert, states that \\"the al-Qaeda threat\\" has \\"monopolized and distorted our understanding\\" of Qutb's \\"real contribution to contemporary Islamism.\\"Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism By John Calvert = Recognition in The 9/11 Commission Report = Chapter 2 of The 9/11 Commission Report (2004), \\"The Foundation of the New Terrorism,\\" cites Qutb for influencing Osama Bin Laden's worldview in these terms: > [Qutb] dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that > 'nothing will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.'[n. 12] > Content of n. 12: Sayyid Qutb, Milestones (American Trust Publications, > 1990).

It refers either to the hegemony of an imperialist great power over its weaker rivals who then are called sub-imperialisms, or to a comprehensive supra-structure above a set of theoretically equal-righted imperialist states. The latter meaning is the older one and had become rare by the middle of the 20th century.  Origin of the term  The expression super-imperialism first appeared in November 1914 as an inaccurate translation of the newly coined German term Ultra-Imperialismus. William E. Bohn, the translator of Karl Kautsky‚Äôs article \\"Der Imperialismus\\" (\\"The Imperialism\\"),Karl Kautsky: Der Imperialismus. In: Die Neue Zeit. 32 (1914), vol. 2, p. 908‚Äì922. seemed to believe that the terms Kartell and Ultra-Imperialismus were not reasonable for the audience of the International Socialist Review, an American Marxist journal.Vgl.: Karl Kautsky, Imperialism and the War, in: International socialist review, 15 (1914), 286. Bohn faced a double problem as cartels were much less familiar in the United States than the concern-like, tauter organized trust entities and the word ultra, which in English means \\"exaggerated\\" or \\"extreme\\". Thus, he paraphrased Kautsky‚Äôs ideas in terms more familiar to American readers, somewhat distorting Kautsky's statement.  Recent meanings  Together with the revival of the imperialism debates in the 1970s, the term super-imperialism recovered, but was modified in its content. It served now to describe the domination by the super-power United States within a system of imperialism in which the other imperialist powers were set back in their abilities and thus were second-class. Bob Rowthorn, Imperialism in the Seventies: Unity or Rivalry?, in: New Left Review, 59 (1971), 31; Michael Hudson: Super imperialism : the economic strategy of American empire, New York, 1972. Since the same time, the German term Ultraimperialismus was translated into English literally with ultra-imperialism and was now used to describe a rather equal-righted inter-imperialist cooperation.

Two Roman high-ranking commanders were captured, Timostratus and John. This caused Justinian I to send al-Mundhir an embassy for peace consisting of Abraham son of Euphrasius (his son is Nonnosus the historian) and Simeon of Beth Arsham. They were joined by Sergius of Rasafa (who was later sent by Justinian with gifts to al- Mundhir). In 528 al-Mundhir attacked Syria and returned with much booty. The next year (529) he renewed his attacks, firstly taking all the area of frontiers which was Khabour. Afterwards, he marched towards Arzona and Nisibis spoiling and ravaging the cities before continuing to Apamea and Chalcedon. Al-Mundhir was unable to conquer Antioch because Justinian dispatched a large army to protect it. Al-Mundhir returned with much booty, among them 400 nuns, whom he burnt to the goddess al-Uzza. Al-Mundhir was killed in the battle of Yawm Halima with the Ghassanids under Al-Harith ibn Jabalah in June 554. He was succeeded by his three sons, 'Amr III (r. 554‚Äì569), Qabus (r. 569‚Äì573) and al-Mundhir IV (r. 574‚Äì580).

It was first released in Japan under the title Space Puzzle Bobble on December 18, 2008. It was later released in North America under the title Space Bust-A-Move on July 28, 2009, and in Europe under the title Puzzle Bobble Galaxy on August 28, 2009. As with Arkanoid DS, Space Invaders Extreme and Space Invaders Extreme 2, the game is compatible with Taito's paddle controller. Gameplay As with the previous games in the Puzzle Bobble series, the player controls a pointer on the bottom of the screen (with either the gamepad or Taito's paddle controller) that shoots differently-colored bubbles upwards. The object is to shoot bubbles at other bubbles of the same color at the top of the screen. When a group of three or more bubbles that touch each other are formed, then that group disappears. The objective is to clear the screen of all bubbles. Players can pick up various power-ups during the course of gameplay, such as stars that clear the playing field of all bubbles of a specific color or a flame that destroys a group of bubbles, regardless of color, within a certain radius. The levels remains the same, with some levels containing boss battles. The game includes a story mode, in which players go through eight \\"worlds\\" that reveal a story. It also includes a mode in which players can compete against other users via a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Reception The game received some criticism for its controls, which Daemon Hatfield of IGN described as \\"slow and clunky\\", and for its continue system that makes players unable to continue directly at the stage they failed at.

It runs between Kevin Street and Heytesbury Street in Dublin's south inner city. History New Bride Street gets its name from the earlier Bride Street, which was named after a church dedicated to Brigit of Kildare built by the Irish prior to the Norman conquest; the medieval church was replaced by a new St Bridget's (St Bride's) in 1684. By 1757 Rocque's Map shows that Bride Street had been extended and renamed Bridget Street. Wilson‚Äôs Directory Map of 1848 shows the development of the then unnamed New Bride Street from Kevin Street to Long Lane. By 1847 the street had been named New Bride Street and was extended up to the junction with Pleasants Street. Between 1894 and 1901, houses were built from a charitable trust of Edward Cecil Guinness for the labouring poor - three parallel ranges of mostly one and two-room flats with narrow courts between. The 1936 Ordnance Survey map shows the street as it is today ending at the Camden row junction. The street was developed by the 1860s. New Bride Street today St. Kevin's terrace on New Bride Street New Bride Street is a short street with an average width of 14 meters and runs in a north/south direction as a continuation of Bride Street between Kevin Street to the south and Heytesbury Street to the north, largely residential with different house types dating from the 1860s mainly the east side and the 1910s mainly on the west side. Some of the first houses built on the road are a small terrace of four houses on the east side, somewhat around the middle of the street and built in the villa style of the time, that being single story over basement. They are built using stone for the basement level and a Dolphins barn brick for the upper level. Sadly, unsympathetic renovations have taken place along the street, replacement PVC doors and windows, adjustments to window shape, and brickwork rendered over, have affected the uniformity of the terrace. Dublin Institute of Technology occupy the lower half of this side of the street with the National Optometry Centre. Opposite these are the two- story red brick terrace houses built around 1910 and feature granite window and door lintels. At the Kevin Street end sits the Iveagh Flats, built in the same red brick as the rest of the east side and as such complements the east side street scape. Built by the Guinness Trust, it began in 1894 and was finished in 1901. Designed by London architects Joseph and Smithem with Kaye Parry and Ross. There has since been a 21st-century addition to the original design, that being an additional story in a mansard style. At the Heytesbury Street end lies two stone buildings, one on both the east and west sides. Formally schools, they are currently used as offices.

He was educated at Balliol College of Oxford, receiving an MA in 1761. While there he began a long association and friendship with Jeremy BenthamH.L.A. Hart; \\"Essays on Bentham: Jurisprudence and Political Theory\\", New York; Oxford University Press, 1982; page 55. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in November 1773 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Early life He was born on 13 August 1737, the only son of the Rev. Charles Lind, D.D. His father was vicar of West Mersea 1738‚Äì48, rector of Wivenhoe 1750‚Äì1771, and rector of Paglesham 1752‚Äì71, all livings in Essex. He married a Miss Porter of Winchester, and died 6 March 1771, leaving his livings sequestrated and two daughters. John Lind matriculated on 22 May 1753 at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating B.A. 1757, M.A. 1761. About 1758 he took deacon's orders in the Church of England, and a few years later accompanied John Murray on his embassy to Constantinople in the capacity of chaplain, but as \\"too agreeable to his Excellency's mistress\\" was dismissed from his post. In Poland Lind then went to Warsaw, where he dropped his clerical pretensions and became tutor to Prince Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski. He was noticed by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, who made him governor of an institution for educating cadets, and the title of privy councillor. In 1773, after the First Partition of Poland, he returned to England with a pension from the king, and added to his income by reading to Prince Czartoryski, the king's uncle. In England Lind was burdened by his father's debts and by the support of his sisters, Mary and L√¶titia, who had a boarding-school for girls at Colchester. He was received by Lord North, then prime minister, and was a familiar figure at the card-parties of Henrietta Maria North, wife of Brownlow North. The king of Poland had given him letters of introduction to Lord Mansfield, by whom he was employed to advocate his political views, and through whose management he was admitted at Lincoln's Inn 23 June 1773, and called to the bar in 1776. Lind, already an F.S.A., was elected F.R.S. in 1773. Among Lind's close friends was Jeremy Bentham, who gave the bride away on Lind's marriage at St Andrew's, Holborn. Lind wanted to enter parliament, but failed. After some years mainly spent in pamphleteering, he died in Lamb's Conduit Street, London, on 12 January 1781, and was buried in Long Ditton churchyard, in Surrey, where a white marble scroll, with an inscription by Sir Herbert Croft, was placed to his memory on the outside of the north wall of the church. Works Lind's first publication was Letters concerning the Present State of Poland (anon.), 1773, 2nd ed. 1773, against the First Partition of Poland. He was supported in writing it by Lord Mansfield and Viscount Stormont. His other works were: * Remarks on the Principal Acts of the Thirteenth Parliament of Great Britain, vol. i. containing remarks on the acts relating to the American colonies (the Intolerable Acts), with a plan of reconciliation, 1775. Samuel Parr praised this work as a defence of the British case against the colonists, and Bentham claimed to have made its outline. * An Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress (anon.), 1776. On the Declaration of Independence. Bentham's supposed involvement with the content has been seen as evidence of his early commitment against natural rights. * Three Letters to Dr. Price, containing Remarks on his Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, by a Member of Lincoln's Inn, 1776. Abusive attack on Richard Price. * Defence of Lord Pigot (anon.), 1777. On behalf of George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot. * A Letter to the Rt. Hon. Willoughby Bertie, by descent Earl of Abingdon, in which his candid and liberal treatment of the new Earl of Mansfield is fully vindicated (anon.), 1778. A satirical reply to Lord Abingdon's attack on Lord Mansfield. For his works in justification of the American War of Independence a pension is said to have been conferred on each of his Lind's sisters. Two papers on ancient monuments and fortifications in Scotland were communicated to Arch√¶ologia through Lind. His defence of Bentham's Fragment on Government appeared in the Morning Chronicle, 26 July 1776, and was reproduced in Bentham's Works, i. 258‚Äì9. A reply from Sir James Wright on Lord Bute's action and opinions is said by Horace Walpole to have been written by Lind. Family Lind's pension was continued to his widow, and paid regularly until 1794, when delays' were arose. These were solved by Bentham, who entered into correspondence with the czar of Russia on the subject. Lind had brought to England an illegitimate daughter, and at his death she and his two sisters were left destitute. Croft solicited a subscription for them and for the widow, who refused to accept it. Elizabeth, another of his sisters, married Captain William Borthwick, of the artillery, and died 2 May 1764, aged 29.

It was initially founded during the last stages of the Teotihuacan civilization by a group generally referred to as the ‚ÄúTeotenancas.‚Äù Later, the Matlatzincas conquered the city and expanded it. The city existed for about 1,000 years, being abandoned only after the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire. Main entrance to the ancient city The name Teotenango is derived from three Nahuatl words: ‚Äúteotl‚Äù (god, sacred, divine, authentic or original), ‚Äútenamitl‚Äù (wall, fence or fortification) and ‚Äúco‚Äù (place or in) which lends itself to different translations such as ‚Äúin the place of the divine wall,‚Äù or ‚Äúin the place of the original fortification‚Äù or ‚Äúin the place of the all of the gods.‚Äù However, ‚Äúteotl‚Äù began to be used to distinguish this pre-Hispanic site from the town that was constructed in the valley below by the Spanish after the Conquest. This is confirmed by the Teutenanco Chronicles, written in 1582, but the Original Chronicles of Chalco- Amaquemecan state that the site was also known as ‚ÄúCozcuauhtenanco‚Äù (walled place of the buzzards) due to the Teotenaca-Matlatzinca military order that protected the city. Northwest portion of the excavated site At its height, the city was densely population with a main road about 1,400 meters long, pyramidal platforms, palaces, a ballgame court, formidable defenses, drainage and water delivery systems. All around the site there are naturally protruding rocks containing petroglyphs with various signs and symbols. However, only a fraction of the site, mostly the northeast section which contained the ceremonial center, has been excavated and preserved. The site is located on top of a large hill known as Tet√©petl, which is located just west of the modern town of Tenango de Arista at a height of 2,700 meters above sea level. It is 25 km south of the Mexico State capital of Toluca, in a sub-valley of the Valley of Toluca named the ‚ÄúValley of the Matlatzinco‚Äù by the Spanish, due to the dominance of this ethnic group here. Tetepetl Hill less than half of the path leading to the site from the valley below Tetepetl Hill is a sharp rise from the Valley of the Matlatzinco running along the west side of the modern town of Tenango de Arista in the State of Mexico. It forms an elongated mesa, with steep slopes on the north and east sides, varying in height from 70 to 250 meters that serve as natural defenses. While the surface of this mesa is 16.5km2, only about 2km2 in the extreme northeast of the mesa was inhabited. With the exception of this corner of the mesa, the entire hill is covered by a layer of dark gray solidified lava, the result of a volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 10,000 years ago. This makes most of the mesa difficult to cross and impossible to farm. To make the city possible, the northeast corner needed to be significantly modified by terracing and filling in low areas. The mesa contains no rivers, but there are a number of fresh- water springs which served as the ancient city's water supply. History of Teotenango The high plains in the center of modern Mexico, called the ‚Äúaltiplano‚Äù, is one of the most important areas of Mesoamerica. The altiplano extends over what is now the Distrito Federal, most of the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala and Mexico State as well as parts of the states of Morelos and Hidalgo. Sophisticated cultures were developed by peoples such as the Nahuas, the Tlahuicas and the Matlatzincas. The Valley of Toluca is in the altiplano, to the west of the Distrito Federal in Mexico State. From early pre-Hispanic times, this valley was an important settlement area for a number of ethnic groups, whose economic and cultural development was strongly influenced by the natural resources that existed here. The Valley of Toluca was also an important gateway to the tropical lowlands to the south and west. Trade routes through the valley brought valued commodities such as salt, tropical fruits, semiprecious stones and ocean products such as shells. Later, after the conquest of the valley by the Aztec Empire, it became an important point of control for tribute goods coming to the capital of Tenochtitlan. It was also important as a staging area for the regular wars between the Aztecs and the Pur√©pecha (in what is now Michoac√°n) as possession of much of the western valley was in dispute. Teotenango is located in the far southern part of the Valley of Toluca. This area was initially settled and developed during the end years of the Teotihuacan civilization. The site experienced five periods of occupation and development, extending over 1,000 years and ending when the Spanish forced the resettlement of the population to the valley floor below. Occupation of this area did not begin on Tetepetl Hill but rather at a location on the valley floor on the north side of the hill. This settlement has been named Ojo de Agua by archeologists. It was founded by Otom√≠ people who were joined and strongly influenced by emigrants from the falling Teotihuacan civilization. These people are now referred to as the Teotenancas. Objects from this part of the site show very strong similarities with objects from Teotihuacan and date from 650 to 750 C. E. This is considered to be the first stage of the development of Teotenango. The second stage is dated from 750-900 C.E. show simultaneous occupation of both the Ojo de Agua site and the northern edge of Tetepetl Hill, by the same ethnic group. The first constructions of the Teotenango site date from this period, including the temazcal, structures 2C and 3C and some structures that lie under structures in Conjuntos A and C. The reason the settlement moved from the valley floor to the mesa was due to natural defenses that the mesa provided. Constructions here still are mostly of dwellings of adobe and still show strong Teotihuacan influence indicated by two inclined walls supporting a vertical one. Pyramid of Conjunto B During the third stage (900 ‚Äì 1162 CE), most of the currently visible structures of the ceremonial center, such as the pyramidal bases for temples, were built. Of these constructions, the ball court and the Serpent Base stand out. Some residences were also built. The beginning of the fourth stage (1162-1476) is characterized by the conquest and takeover of the city by the Matlatzincas. They added some small constructions to the ceremonial center, and amplified some other structures, but are mostly credited with the construction of the city's massive defenses, such as the wall on the west side. During the time the city's population grew significantly, with residential areas spreading toward the south. The Matlatzincas extended the domain of this city to include the entire Valley of Toluca, which major outposts in Toluca, Calixtlahuaca, Tenancingo. The fifth and final stage (1474-1550 C.E.) is characterized by the conquest of Teotenango by the emperor Axayacatl and subsequent Aztec occupation of the city and the valley. Some Aztec architectural influence is felt with the best examples being Building 1C, and the narrow staircase built into the western defense wall. It also includes the initial stages of resettlement of the population of Teotenango to new Spanish colonial village of Tenango de Valle (also known as ‚ÄúVillage of Teotenango‚Äù) on the valley floor below. This resettlement was completed by 1550, after which the site above was completely abandoned. Excavation of the site The abandoned site remained mostly exposed and vaguely known about locally since colonial times. But it was not until 1969 when archeologist Wanda Tomasi presented a plan to excavate the site. She contacted the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) center for the region, at the time directed by Rom√°n Pi√±a Chan, who decided to convert Tomasi's idea into a state project to gain finance and support from then-governor Carlos Hank Gonzalez. In the 1970s, Pi√±a Chan succeeded in getting five million pesos for investigation, exploration, land purchases and the construction of a site museum, with aims of making the site accessible to the public. Since the State of Mexico invested the money in the project, INAH ceded management rights to the state, with the condition that research and security of the site would continue. The project was able to excavate less than half of the two km2 site, limited to the ceremonial center concentrated on the northeast of the mesa. Little is known of the residential areas that extend to the south and east. Another area that was left unexcavated was the initial Teotenanca settlement, Ojo de Agua, on the valley floor on the north side of Tetepetl Hill. Using sonar in the 1970s, a small platform was detected about two meters underground and a few objects were uncovered and put on display at the site museum. However, lack of funding prevented any serious work here, but did allow for measures to protect the area from damage, although it still remains private property. Excavated structures at the site The site consists of five major groupings of buildings called ‚Äúconjuntos‚Äù labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Conjunto D is more commonly referred to as the Plaza del Serpiente (Plaza of the Serpent). Conjunto E is more commonly referred to as the ball court area. Buildings within each of the conjuntos are denoted with numbers, such as 1A, 1B, etc. The archeological site has more than forty excavated and at least partially restored monuments. Jaguar relief at main entrance to city The main entrance to the city is through the Plaza of the Jaguar, which lies on the hill on the north side just below the level of the rest of the city. From this plaza a series of stone steps takes one up to the city level. The Jaguar Relief shows as seated jaguar, wearing a medallion around its neck and it is in the process of eating a kind of flower or heart. To the left of this image is the representation of the date marker Two Rabbit and to the right is the date marker Nine House. One of the interpretations of this set of reliefs is that it represents the occurrence of an eclipse. The Jaguar represents some kind of earth monster eating the sun, represented by the flower or heart figure. An eclipse did indeed occur on the date Two Rabbit Nine House on the Aztec calendar. Conjuntos A and B each consist of a plaza with a temple pyramid or pyramid base with one or more smaller buildings associated with it. Both are located at the extreme east of the excavated zone, near where the hill's steep slopes to the valley floor begin. Conjunto B contains a nearly complete pyramid with a small altar in front and various platforms for dwellings. Some of the structures here show Otomi architectural influence. Buildings here were roofed with thick layers of mud reinforced with poles and had stucco floors which contain evidence of cooking/heating fires. Conjunto C is a small group of buildings just behind to west of the Jaguar relief and the main stairs entering the city. This area contains some of the oldest exposed structures at the site. On the Serpent Base looking east over the Plaza The Plaza de la Serpiente (Conjunto D) is located in the western part of the excavated area. The largest structure here is the Serpent Base which measures 120 m long by 40 m wide. The name of the plaza and the building come from a sculpted stone found at the northeast corner of the Serpent Base, formed in the shape of a snake's head. A smaller structure, denoted 1D, is a base 90 cm high divided into various rooms with interior patios. These patios are square and contain drainage system for wastewater. The structure also contains an entrance hallway and pits for fires in the interior. The Calle de la Rana (Frog Street) is located in the far northwest of the excavated site. It is a cleared area which lies at a lower level than the structures surrounding it. Through it, access was gained to the Plaza del Serpiente. Its name comes from a sculpture of a frog done in a rock from the hill which juts out. The Matlatzincas built their western defensive wall along this street. The defensive walls of the city were mostly constructed by the Matlatzincas, who conquered the city in 1200 C.E. The largest and most intact are located on the west side of the city which reach heights of 10 meters and are up to 1.5 meters wide. These were constructed without mortar and took advantage of the contours of the land. This wall was about two meters long and stretch from north to south on the west side. Looking over the ball court to the east The ball court area (Conjunto E) lies to the south of the Plaza de la Serpiente and Conjunto C. The court is sunken and I-shaped, with the top and bottom of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù facing east and west. The actual play space is the body of the ‚ÄúI‚Äù which is bordered by walls that first head up vertical from the floor, then steeply incline away from the play area. On the lower, vertical parts of the wall, the stone rings were placed for scoring. Construction denoted as 2E is a grouping of residential structures that are some of the oldest in the city. The temazcal, or ritual/purification steam bath is located on the east side of the ballgame complex. There is a shallow hole in the center of the area where rocks would be heated then sprinkled with water to produce steam. From the center of the sauna, there is a drainage ditch to take away excess and dirty water. Only the sunken foundation remains. The part above the surface was most likely constructed of adobe, with a kind of a thatched roof. The temazcal was built long before the ball court and was partially destroyed with the court was built. Museum Overview of part of one of the permanent collection rooms With the excavation of Teotenango, the Roman Pi√±a Chan Archeological Museum was created to put the artifacts found on display. This museum offers a general overview of the cultural development of the highlands of Mexico, from the first human settlements to the highly stratified societies which characterized the post-classic period, with special emphasis on Teotenango. The museum is operated by the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura (Mexico State Institute of Culture) and is located in Tenango del Valle at the entrance to the archeological site. The museum has three exhibition rooms for its permanent collection, which numbers more than 1,000 pieces. The museum's largest collection is of pieces from the era after the Matlatzinca conquest, including copper utensils, stone tools and sculptures. There are a number of pieces of Aztec origin, including sculptures of Xipe Totec and Chicomecoatl, goddesses of fertility. There are also a few pieces from the era of initial contact with the Spaniards. Lastly, it contains some pieces from other sites, such as stone tools, clay figures and animal-shaped jars from Tlatilco, a small, very early settlement in the Valley of Mexico. The exhibits here show a more complex social organization with more external infludences at Teotenango than is evident at Teotihuacan. One of the famous finds during excavation of the site was the ‚Äúpanhuehuetl‚Äù or musical drum of Teotenango, made of wood and decorated with a buzzard fighting an eagle, representing the struggle between the Teotenancas-Matlatzincas and the Aztecs for dominance in the area. Protection of the site Since formal excavation work was carried out in the 1970s, the site and its museum have been managed by the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura. There are two reasons for this. First, the excavation and restoration work was done by the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura and not by federal Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia as was customary. Second, a series of constitutional reforms since that time has sought to encourage more direct participation of state and local authorities in the preservation and management of archeological sites and other monuments to Mexico's culture and history. However, as the reforms passed, INAH issued warnings about the Teotenango site's vulnerability to encroachment due to the urban development taking place in Tenango del Valle. Of the 600 hectares set aside by the initial project, only two-thirds is still considered to be adequately protected. Urban development in the Tenango del Valle area has accelerated since the year 2000 and many constructions now border the protected area, which is not fenced. Encroachment generally takes the form of these constructions threatening the stability of site structures above and below the surface as well as the unauthorized taking of objects at the site. Almost all of this is occurring at the site's south and west sides, where almost no formal excavation work has been done and about which little is known.

The band were composed of lead singer/composer Louie Louie (real name Louis Rondeau), non musician Marc Fontaine and - for a period - vocalist Anne Marie Cyr. They are best known for their 1983 single ‚ÄúAmour Programm√©‚Äù.\\"On a retrouv√© le premier chanteur punk du Qu√©bec\\". Vice, F√©lix B. Desfoss√©s, Sept. 26 2017 The band achieved moderate success in the French-speaking regions of Canada and Europe releasing 5 singles and achieving regular radio play. The band also appeared on a number of North American TV stations during the early 1980s at the genesis of synthpop and music video. Principally recording in their native French language, they achieved crossover success in Anglophone Canada and Europe often recording English versions of their original songs. Although they ceased recording in the early 1990s, an album of greatest hits was released retrospectively in 2009 on the Musi-Video label. History Louis Rondeau (known by his stage name \\"Louie Louie\\") was originally a drummer and vocalist in 1970s punk band The 222s.www.jam.ca \\"The 222s\\" In early 1981, the 222s were wound up by the original members. Rondeau states that as a result of that, he wanted to \\"explore new dimensions in music, and (the emerging genre of) electro would allow him to do that\\". He teamed up with the 222s assistant manager Marc Fontaine and on 16 June 1982, formed the studio group Nudimension, taking the band's name from his original music concept. Fontaine's father was owner of the Studio Fontaine in Montreal (today known as Lamajeure); therefore access to professional recording equipment was easy for them.Fontaine, Marc interviewed for Quebec Radio - June 2009 Together as Nudimension, Rondeau and Fontaine released a number of francophone singles and made regular appearances on the late night (and sometimes risqu√©) Montr√©al TV show Musi-Video in 1982. It was during recording for the Musi-Video show that they met TV presenter Anne Marie Cyr. Cyr would then become their most prominent female vocalist, appearing on a number of their singles; although a regular contributor, she was never a full member of the band. The release of the single ‚ÄúAmour Programm√©‚Äù became their breakthrough single, becoming their biggest hit charting in the top 20 in the francophone Canadian charts and also achieving their first sales in Europe. It enabled them to graduate from the late night Musi-Video show to primetime TV. In late 1983, Rondeau and Cyr played the track to open Canada's Quebec based TV Saturday night Donald Lautrec Show.Donald Lautrec Show, CFCF, Aug 1983 While it was also featured on heavy rotation on French radio stations in Canada. The follow-up single ‚ÄúObsession‚Äù likewise did well, although \\"Plan√™te Sauvage\\" (Trans: \\"Wild Planet\\") and \\"Big Boy\\" failed to equal that success. A marketing advantage that Nudimension had at the time, was that Fontaine had previously studied film in Los Angeles and would produce the band's own rudimentary music videos. His role in the band was similar to that of the Human League's Philip Adrian Wright being largely visual and not musical. In 1983, in the infancy of music television, having a music video to accompany a release was unusual for all but the biggest bands with major label funding and helped Nudimension acquire prominence. Cyr stopped working with the band after 1985, Patrick Bourgeois went on to form Les BBs in MontrealLes BBs on Quebec Music Information but Rondeau and Fontaine continued into the early 1990s. The start of the end for Nudimension was when their business manager Ben Kaye left to work with (then) emerging French Canadian singer Celine Dion.Montreal Gazette February 11, 2007 Despite the release of the single ‚ÄúI Need Your Loving‚Äù (which did not chart) in 1989, Rondeau felt there was a certain breakdown of inspiration, frustration and professional stagnation. Although not a formal split, Nudimension did not continue after 1990. Revival Some 20 years after the band's disbandment, and with the synthpop genre receiving a general revival, emboldened an interest in the band‚Äôs back catalogue. Fontaine started an official YouTube channel to show the band's old music videos. It was easier to obtain from the various TV stations and publish the music video clips of performances that the band produced in the early 1980s, than to publish recorded music as at the time the whereabouts of master tapes from the long defunct record labels were not known. However in 2009, Fontaine tracked them down and produced The Best of Nudimension as a greatest hits album. It was the band‚Äôs first album, released 26 years after their first single. Also in 2009, Fontaine and Rondeau were interviewed on QBR about the band‚Äôs history.

The genesis of the organization was in protests resulting from the Conscription Crisis of 1917 against the attempt of Robert Borden's federal government to conscript farm youths into the Canadian military during World War I. Quebec farmers organized a large demonstration on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on May 15, 1918 bringing them into contact with the United Farmers national movement. The Quebec farmers organized 20 associations in western Quebec and in September 1918 organized the Interprovincial Union of Farmers as an umbrella group. A conference held in Montreal in January 1920 transformed this group into the United Farmers of Qu√©bec which, by 1921, had 5,000 members in 20 counties. In 1921, the United Farmers and the Union des cultivateurs du Qu√©bec formed the Parti fermier-progressiste du Qu√©bec (Progressive Farmers of Qu√©bec) with the support of Joseph-No√© Ponton and the Bulletin des agriculteurs. The party was inspired by both the program of the Progressive Party of Canada (the political party of the national United Farmers movement) and the nationalism of Henri Bourassa. The party supported 21 candidates, most of whom ran in conjunction with the Progressive Party of Canada in the 1921 federal election, but none were elected. The farmers' candidates won 42,000 votes, or 11% of the total in Quebec. By 1924, the group had been overshadowed by the more conservative Catholic Union of Farmers.

These stories, myths, origins, and legends play a big role in their everyday life, such as their religion, their history, and their beliefs. Only the elders of the Blackfoot tribes are allowed to tell the tales, and are typically difficult to obtain because the elders of the tribes are often reluctant to tell them to strangers who are not of the tribe. People such as George B. Grinnell, John Maclean, D.C. Duvall, Clark Wissler, and James Willard Schultz were able to obtain and record a number of the stories that are told by the tribes. The Myth of Creation There are several creation myths found within Native American culture; one of those is the creation myth involving Napioa. Napioa is mentioned in almost all Blackfoot myths and is considered an important figure in the Blackfoot mythology itself. Napioa is known by many names including the sun, Old man, and Napi (Nah-pee). Napioa is said to have created the earth using the mud from a turtle's mouth that was found on a river upon which Napioa floated. He not only created the earth using the mud, but he also created the men and women as well. Napioa also made the bison as tame as ever for the people to hunt. He is said to also have created the animals and the grass and everything else that is on the earth. Origin of the Wind In Blackfoot mythology, there are legends surrounding the origins of everything because, to them, everything has an origin. Napioa is featured in the origin of the wind. In this legend, Napioa finds two bags containing summer and winter. Napioa was determined to get a hold of these bags so that he could make the two seasons of equal months. Napioa tried to gain possession of the bags without success. He finally sent a little animal, which successfully gained possession of the summer bag. The guardian of the bag chased after the animal and decapitated it. In the chaos, the bag burst open and a strong wind came out of it. =Language on a Mountain= In this story, Napioa is referred to as Old Man. There was a great flood that swept through the land, and after the flood, Old Man made the water different colors. He gathered the people on top of a large mountain where he gave them water of different colors. Old Man then told the people to drink the water, then speak, and so they did. Everyone was speaking a different language except those who received the black water; they were speaking the same language, and they consisted of the Piegans, the Blackfeet, and the Blood Native Americans. This was said to have taken place in the highest mountain in the Montana reservation. Legend of Red Coulee Red Coulee is an actual place located between Mcleod and Benton next to the Marias River in Montana. The Blackfoot Native Americans were told of a medicine stone by the people who inhabited the Montana area at the time. Years later, the Blackfoot tribe gathered a group of men and headed off to find the stone. When they found it, they were laughed at by their leader who said it was a child's story and rolled the stone down the hill. Later, on their way back to the tribe, they became engaged in battle, leaving all dead but one man to tell the story. And that is why they call it Red Coulee. People still stop by there today to give offerings for all who lost their lives.

A relative of Agaricus augustus, known as the prince, A. perobscurus can be differentiated in several aspects. While the prince is widely distributed in North America, the princess is found only in the San Francisco Bay Area. Besides its smaller size, it is distinguished from Agaricus augustus by a darker-brown cap, a patchy fibrillose stipe surface at youth, lacking densely floccose-scaly, and a different fruiting season.Arora, p. 338 Another commonly closely associated Agaricus species, Agaricus praeclaresquamosus, is toxic. It can be differentiated by its dark-grey cap, a phenolic, rather than an anise odor, and a stipe base which yellows immediately when injured.Boa, p. 123Arora, p. 340 Description The cap is broad, and becomes deeply convex to flattened. The surface is dry, with a uniformly dark-brown disc. The disc can be either flattened or depressed, and is appressed fibrillose-squamulose. Towards the margin, it begins to diffuse. It is brown over a pallid ground color. Meanwhile, the margin is incurved in youth, then decurved, and eventually turns straight or slightly raised. The cap cuticle bruises slowly tawny-brown, and yellows in KOH. The flesh is white, soft, and can be up to thick. When injured, it can change to a cream color to tawny. The odor is that of anise, with a mild taste.Boa, p. 147 The gills are free, close, and relatively broad. When young, they have a whitish color, though they turn blackish-brown at maturity. The gills can be either five or six-seried. The stipe can be long, and thick. Often tapered to a bulbous base, it can be stuffed to hollow at maturity. The surface of apex is white, and silky- striate. The lower portion is white, with the fibrils forming scattered appressed squamules. In contrast, the base of the stipe discolors slowly a dull orange-brown where handled. The flesh changes sporadically from a cream- yellow to tawny-brown when injured or cut. The partial veil is white, membranous, and has small brown floccose scales concentrated near the margin. The annulus is thin and pendulous on the stipe.Arora, p. 314 The spores are 6.5‚Äì8.0 Œºm by 4.5‚Äì5.0 Œºm, smooth, thick-walled, and ellipsoid. They are inequilateral in profile, without a conspicuous hilar appendage. Their germ pore is not evident, and the spore print is a blackish-brown color. Habitat Agaricus perobscurus is often solitary or in small groups under conifers and hardwoods. Primarily found in urban parks with trees like Monterey Cypress, Monterey Pine, and Eucalyptus, they fruit in North America from mid to late winter.Arora, p. 339 See also *List of Agaricus species References ;Specific perobscurus Fungi described in 1985 Fungi of North America ","title":"Agaricus perobscurus"},{"id":"23839495","text":"Sean Leo McGoldrick () is an Irish Gaelic footballer who plays for Derry, with whom he has won a National League title.

History The original Citizens National Bank location opened on Main Street in Paintsville on February 16, 1910 and was known as Paintsville Bank and Trust Company. In 1917, a new two-story building was constructed to replace the much smaller frame building that was located just down the street. Then on January 3, 1927, the bank became a national bank and was renamed the Second National Bank of Paintsville. After a few more years, the bank became the principal bank of Paintsville and Johnson County. So on June 30, 1959 to celebrate being the oldest continuously operating and most popular bank in the county, they decided to change the bank's name to Citizens National Bank. One year later on February 15, a new location was opened on the corner of Broadway and Tenth Street. This location was called The Motor Bank Branch because it was the first branch location to have a drive-thru. Then on March 29, 1971, the bank built the Family Banking Center adjacent to the Motor Bank. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Citizens National Bank began to expand rapidly. So to meet the needs of their customers, they opened the Mayo Plaza Branch on November 15, 1978 and the Village Plaza Branch on August 7, 1982. In the latter part of 1982, Citizens National Corporation was created to serve as the holding company of the bank. Then on December 11, 1985, the corporation sold two million dollars in Industrial Revenue Bonds to erect a new main office building next to the Family Banking Center. On January 17, 1988, the new four-story main office building opened and shortly afterwards the no longer needed Motor Bank was torn down.

He managed the 19th century Baltimore Orioles in 1892. He managed the team for eight games, winning two and losing six. He managed his first game April 29, 1892, after replacing George Van Haltren. He managed his last game May 8, 1892, after which he was replaced by Ned Hanlon. Biography Waltz' original family name was \\"Woltz\\". He was born January 12, 1860, in Hagerstown, Maryland. His parents had been successful farmers in Hagerstown, but by 1880 were forced to relocate to Baltimore. After working for a jewelry dealer, Waltz became a successful furniture salesman in the 1880s. He married Bessie Bell in 1882, and had a son and a daughter by her. He purchased shares in the 19th century American Association, then considered a baseball Major League. In December 1887 Waltz, and then-Oriole manager Billy Barnie, purchased minority shares of the American Association Baltimore Orioles from owner Harry Von der Horst, and became a team vice-president. In that role, he signed Joseph Dowie and Will Holland to play for the Orioles. By 1891, the rival Major Leagues, the National League and American Association, were at war. Waltz became a major figure in the war, proposing to put an American Association team in Chicago to challenge the established National League team in that city. He also publicly stated that the American Association would send a delegation to negotiate with the National League at the end of the 1891 season. Ultimately, the leagues agreed to form a single Major League (called the National League) with eight of the former National League teams and four of the former American Association teams (including the Orioles). Before the 1892 season, the Orioles' first in the National League, manager Billy Barnie quit, citing a personality conflict with Waltz. Barnie's duties were split between outfielder George Van Haltren, who was to manage the team on the field, and Waltz, who oversaw financial and scheduling issues. But after the Orioles lost 10 of their first 11 games under Van Haltren, Waltz assumed duties as the team manager despite having no qualifications. The Orioles lost six of the eight games Waltz managed and he recognized that the team needed a real \\"baseball man\\" as manager, and so relinquished these duties to Ned Hanlon, and returned to his role as team vice-president. Waltz remained the Orioles' vice-president through at least 1895, while Hanlon managed the team to National League pennants in 1893, 1894 and 1895. He died of cancer April 27, 1931, in Baltimore.

The Abbey, founded in 1189, was the largest and most important of the Augustinian monasteries in County Clare. History Clare Abbey, originally called the \\"Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul at Kilmony\\", was founded in 1189, under the sponsorship of Domnall M√≥r Ua Briain (Donald O'Brien), the king of Thomond. The Abbey, granted to an order of Augustinian Canons, was the largest and most important of the Augustinian monasteries in County Clare. The other Augustinian monasteries are: the Canon Island Abbey, the Inchicronan Priory, the Killone Nunnery and the Abbey at Kilshanny. The Canons, also known as \\"Canons Regular\\", were an order of priests from Italy who followed the rule of St. Augustine. Their primary focus was parish work and \\"the care of souls\\". They lived simply, much like their parishioners. The Canons adapted easily to Irish medieval life, as it was very similar to their monastic lives back in Italy. The number of Canon orders continued to grow after the twelfth century. By the thirteenth century, they were the largest order in Ireland. The name, Kimony, mentioned in early medieval documents, (\\"the church on the bog\\"), suggests that Clare Abbey was built on the site of an earlier church. The only remains of an older structure are possibly the bullaun in a block of granite and a stone carving over one of the abbey's windows. The monastery was built on a strip of land extending out in the Fergus river flood plain. Archaeologist, Thomas Johnson Westropp in 1900, describes the exposed and less than ideal siting of the abbey as being located in a grassland area, surrounded by marshy land prone to flooding by the River Fergus. He suggested that the site was chosen because it was a sacred site, another indication of an earlier church on in the area. In 1278, Clare Abbey was the site of a legendary battle in the civil war between Toirdhealbhach M√≥r √ì Briain and Thomas de Clare. Donallbeg O'Brien ambushed and massacred Mahon O'Brien and his followers, billeted temporarily at the abbey, as they were making a hasty retreat. The bloody aftermath was described in the medieval chronicle, Caithr√©im Thoirdhealbhaigh (Wars of Torlough): In the thirteenth century, the two leading clans of County Clare, the O‚ÄôBriens and the Macnamaras, changed their family burial places to Ennis Friary and Quin Abbey. Within a few years, most of the local chieftains had abandoned the Augustinian monasteries and the monastic buildings fell into disrepair.\\" After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1543, the abbey and surrounding lands, now the civil parish of Clareabbey, were given to the Barons of Ibrackan by King Henry VIII of England. The monks appeared to have continued to live in the abbey until around 1650. Description Clare Abbey, 2015 Clare Abbey, 1886 Clare Abbey is located on the west bank of the Fergus river, in County Clare, Ireland, and a mile south of the town of Ennis. The abbey remains today consist of a church with a belfry, and several domestic buildings, south and east of the church, and surrounding a cloister. Clare Abbey is unusual for an Augustinian monastery because it has no west range. The single-aisled church, which consists of a long nave and chancel is separated by a tower, and dates to the late twelfth century. The other buildings were constructed in the fifteenth century. The church was originally 39 metres long and about 9.5 metres wide. Important architectural features are three fifteenth-century traceried windows. The church was originally 128 feet (39 m) by 31 feet (9.4 m). The interior was later divided into a nave and chancel by the belfry tower. The west window had collapsed by 1680. When Westropp visited the site in 1886, he noted that the belfry had no staircase and he viewed a large tomb, with no inscription, lying in the north recess under the tower. He mentioned low and badly proportioned battlements of the tower, and also described that many loose stones that were visible in the buildings in the late 1800's were reset and repaired in 1898 and 1899. He also described a well-preserved east window, tower and domestic buildings and one incised post-Norman cross. The oldest legible tombs in 1886 were from the seventeenth century.

On 9 August 1961, 34 boys and 2 members of staff from the school were killed when their plane crashed near Stavanger Airport, Sola, Norway.https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/lanfranc-boys- crash-devastating-plane-16730637 The 50th anniversary was marked by a book published in summer 2011, The Lanfranc Boys by Rosalind Jones sister of Quentin Green, one of the victims. Previously a foundation school administered by Croydon London Borough Council, The Archbishop Lanfranc School converted to academy status in September 2014 and was renamed The Archbishop Lanfranc Academy. However the school continues to coordinate with Croydon London Borough Council for admissions. The Archbishop Lanfranc Academy featured in the 2014 fly on the wall documentary Tough Young Teachers. Description The last OFSTED reportOFSTED report on 2009 inspection, retrieved 2 August 2009 of June 2009 states that the school: is a specialist sports college serving a part of Croydon of considerable ethnic and cultural diversity. The school is average in size and has a significantly higher proportion of boys than girls. The proportion of pupils who have learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including those with a statement of special educational need, is above average. The school holds several national and local awards including the National Association for Able Children in Education (NACE) Award and the Investors in People standard. There is a Nursery overseen by the governing body, and judgements about its effectiveness were included in this report. The privately run Lanfranc Pre-school was inspected and reported on separately. The report stated that the quality of education provided by the school was at least satisfactory in all respects with some key aspects as good and others outstanding.

The canyon is a water gap across the San Joaquin Hills carved out by Aliso Creek, possibly as recently as the last Ice Age. Located in a semi-arid climate, it supports a variety of plant communities ‚Äì mainly chaparral and coastal sage scrub ‚Äì and native animals, some endangered. The canyon's northern divide once formed a formidable boundary between the indigenous Acjachemen and Tongva. Many Acjachemen archaeological sites have been found in the canyon. The fertile alluvial soil and grasslands of Aliso Canyon was used for orchards and grazing from Spanish conquest of the region until the early 20th century. Since the 1970s, the canyon has been the centerpiece of Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park. Aliso Canyon has also suffered environmental damage in recent years. Upstream urban development since the 1950s has increased urban runoff into Aliso Creek, causing severe erosion throughout the valley floor. Pollution has also harmed the area's riparian zones. There have been plans to fix these problems, mainly by constructing drop structures to control erosion. Description=Geography= Aliso Canyon is a massive gap through the south-central part of the San Joaquin Hills. The San Joaquin Hills are a small coastal mountain range in Orange County, about long and wide. The Aliso Canyon is about long measured from where it begins near Laguna Niguel Regional Park to its outlet at Laguna Beach. About deep on average and wide at its widest extent, it is one of the largest gaps through the San Joaquin Hills. Others include the Laguna Canyon and the San Juan Creek canyon. The valley has three distinct sections: the first, upstream one is a broad and comparatively shallow stretch deep and wide; the end of this section is marked by a small summit to the south. The second longest stretch is wide, deep, and about long, stretching from the Wood Canyon Creek confluence to a wastewater treatment plant near the outlet to the Pacific Ocean. The last section of the canyon is a narrow, steep gorge wide, deep and about 1 mile (1.6 km) long. Most of the valley floor is a deep fill of alluvium that is up to thick in the deepest portions. From the valley floor, steep hills rise abruptly to the canyon rim in less than . These hills are dissected by many steep and short side canyons. The major branch of Aliso Canyon is Wood Canyon, a -long, -deep gorge that runs generally southward to join Aliso Canyon about upstream of the ocean. Wood Canyon Creek drains Wood Canyon and joins Aliso Creek downstream of the beginning of the canyon. Cities bounding the canyon are Laguna Beach to the south and west, Laguna Niguel to the east, and Aliso Viejo to the northeast. =Geologic history= Despite its size, Aliso Canyon likely formed as recently as the Wisconsinian glaciation of the last glacial period, a length of time lasting from 60,000‚Äì10,000 years ago. During this time the San Joaquin Hills began to rise to their present-day form. (The uplift had actually begun as early as 1.22 million years ago, but the previous mountains had been eroded.) The Wisconsinian glaciation caused a shift in the entire climate of North America, pushing the cold, rainy climate of the Pacific Northwest south into California. The difference in sea level caused by the Wisconsinian glaciation was likely around - from the previous sea level, in the Sangamonian Satge, which was also about higher than the present-day sea level. The new rainy climate of Southern California received around of rain each year, which caused the rivers and streams to become powerful and with enormous erosive force. Aliso Creek cut a V-shaped river valley through the San Joaquin Hills over this time span. Near the end of the Wisconsinian, the canyon was already a -deep gorge with a narrow, powerful watercourse at the bottom; the valley floor was likely around wide.The present-day valley floor averages wide and considering the slopes of the now-buried canyon walls, the width of the original canyon was calculated. When the Wisconsinian era ended, the glaciers melted and sea levels rose or so to their present level. Water backed up into Aliso Canyon and Wood Canyons, turning them into salt-water inlets. Over time, the creeks deposited enough sediment to fill the inlets with alluvium and create the present-day valley floor. This is the reason why the canyon resembles an aged U-shaped glacial valley instead of a relatively young V-shaped river valley. Man-made modifications Historically, the Aliso Canyon floor was occupied by wide and braided Aliso Creek, which changed course often and flowed in a wide and shallow channel. Although the creek through the canyon remains unchannelized, it has suffered a series of effects from increasing runoff and pollution. Upstream development which has resulted in increased runoff with little sediment content has caused the creek to incise a -deep, -wide channel through the entire length of the valley. The creek now is continuing to incise through the soft alluvial soil and a community of exotic giant reed has established itself throughout the length of the valley. There are two roads through Aliso Canyon, following opposite sides of the creek. One is the paved Aliso Creek trail and one is an unpaved private road that leads to a wastewater treatment plant near the mouth of the canyon, owned by the South Orange Water Conservation Agency (SOCWA). There is one dam and one weir across the creek as it flows through the valley. One is approximately upstream from the ocean, and is about long and high. The weir is located just upstream of the mouth and is about long and 1 foot (0.3 m) high. There are also many drop structures on Wood Canyon Creek and there is a sewer line that follows most of the length of the canyon. Except for some private development at the mouth of the canyon, the entire Aliso Canyon is mostly undeveloped. This private development consists of a hotel and golf course that also has a stretch of channelized creek. This section of canyon, the steepest and narrowest part, is also vulnerable to flooding during wet years. Wildlife and plants The Aliso Canyon has four major vegetation zones; these are riparian, chaparral, coastal sage scrub and grassland. Historically, there were salt marshes at the mouth of Aliso Creek, which sustained a large population of tidewater goby. These marshes, however, have now been eradicated by the construction of a sewage treatment plant at the mouth. Oak and sycamore trees make up the primary large plants along Wood Canyon Creek, and alder (which gave the canyon its name), live oak and other plants line Aliso Creek. Most of the rest of the valley floor, stretching from the edge of the riparian zone to the beginning of the hillside, is grassland. The side canyons and slopes are divided among chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Some non-native plants have begun to establish themselves from the fringes of residential areas on the bordering ridges. Bobcats, mountain lions, lynx and coyotes are some of the large mammals that inhabit the Aliso Canyon area. There are also more than 100 species of birds, some endangered, including the California gnatcatcher and occasionally, the bald eagle. Carp are the only remaining fish that inhabit the lower Aliso Creek. It has been proven by a local NGO, CLEAN WATER NOW, that historically the Endangered Species Act listed Southern steelhead trout in 1997 as having spawned and resided in the creek. This was sustained by NOAA (NMFS), CDFW, and USF&W.; It disappeared in the early 1970s according to local fishermen. The bald eagles that once resided here fed upon the steelhead as did the Native American tribes. History Evidence suggests that Aliso Creek was once the boundary of the Acjachemen and Tongva tribes, but Aliso Canyon likely lay completely on Acjachemen land. The mountains to the north and west of the canyon rise more sharply and rise higher than those on the south and east. The northern drainage divide of the gorge marked the boundary in this area, and the Acjachemen settled in small villages all along the valley floor. Fed by springs in the Santa Ana Mountains and some in the canyon itself, Aliso Creek ran year round through the canyon and supported a lush riparian ecosystem with many tall trees and smaller undergrowth. Aerial view of Laguna Beach at the mouth of Aliso Canyon. Aliso Creek flows into the Pacific Ocean at bottom left. When the Spanish established missions along nearby larger rivers, they forced most of the Native Americans to live at the missions, and Aliso Canyon lay abandoned for many years following the 1770s. The canyon then came under the ownership of Juan Avila in 1842, who operated Rancho Niguel that encompassed most of the canyon, an area of about . The fertile alluvium and extensive grasslands of the canyon floor were used primarily for grazing cattle. Several corrals still stand in the Wood Canyon area today. In 1871, pioneer Eugene Salter settled at the canyon mouth, but one year after, sold it to the Thurstons, who cultivated the present-day golf course area as an orchard. Eventually when the city of Laguna Beach was founded in 1926, the area at the mouth of Aliso Canyon, including Laguna Beach, became a popular camping area. The inn and golf course was begun in the 1960s and grew throughout the remainder of the 20th century. A proposal to extend the golf course into the canyon and expand it to 18 holes was eventually stopped. In the 1960s, Orange County began to fall victim to heavy urbanization, and to protect the canyon from further development, Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park was established in 1979 and expanded to its present size by 1990. A later project to restore a riparian zone in the canyon, the Aliso Creek Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project (ACWHEP) involved damming the creek and constructing pipelines from the impoundment to irrigate artificial creekside terraces of native plants, as well as prevent further erosion of the canyon floor by urban runoff. Due to a flaw in the design, the dam actually caused further erosion, and the irrigation pipes are now broken and the terraces lie fallow. Archaeology and paleontology=Marine fossils= The Pecten Reef in the northeast section of the canyon area is an above-ground exposure of the Monterey Formation, which dates back to the Miocene period. Thousands of fossils and specimens of marine mammals, fish, reptiles and coastal birds have been discovered at the site, implying that the site was once underwater. Preserved invertebrates, plankton, bryozoa, and rare red, blue and brown algae have also been found there. Much of the scientific understanding for evolution, paleoenvironments and paleoclimates during the Miocene period in Orange County is based on the specimens collected from the Pecten Reef. =Evidence of human habitation= About 70 archaeological sites have been discovered along the length of the canyon.

Pick, is an historical novel about the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). The story occurs from September 1637 to March 1638, and centres on two men ‚Äì a mercenary soldier and an intellectual ‚Äì who are fleeing the destruction and starvation wrought by religious war. In southern Germany, each man stumbles upon a fertile valley untouched by the war. Soldier and intellectual, man of arms and man of mind, must collaborate to preserve the peace and plenty of the last valley from the stress and strain of the religious bigotry that caused thirty years of war in Europe. In Britain, the novel originally was published as The Fat Valley. James Clavell adapted and directed the novel as The Last Valley (1970), with Michael Caine and Omar Sharif, respectively the mercenary captain and the philosopher. Plot summary The story opens with a man named Vogel, starving and exhausted, running from a burnt-out, plague-ridden village. After several days, he stumbles into the Valley. At its centre, Vogel discovers a well-maintained, obviously inhabited village but with no people or domesticated animals. He falls asleep in an abandoned home but is awakened by the sound of horses and instinctively flies out of the home, only to be quickly tackled by two soldiers. The two prove to be of a company of mercenaries that arrived in The Valley while Vogel slept. Vogel is dragged to the leader of the group, a man identified as the Captain. It is the Captain's intention to pillage the Valley, burn the village to the ground, and return the plunder to the Protestant army of Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar for whom they are fighting. Vogel intuitively senses that the Captain is battle fatigued and hastily hatches a plan to save the Valley. Accompanied by a soldier named Korski, his main rival within the group, the Captain draws Vogel aside from the other mercenaries who have begun to break into the buildings. Vogel convinces the Captain to spare the Valley and guard its existence from other soldiers to survive the coming winter. \\"Live well,\\" he tells him, \\"while other villages are trampled flat.\\" The Captain quickly surmises the rationality of Vogel's suggestion and, with equal quickness, kills the unsuspecting Korski. He then proceeds to inform the company of the change in plans and arranges the elimination of several other troopers who might object (allies of Korski and those with women back at the army's encampment). Vogel insures his own survival in this arrangement by offering to be a type of buffer between the peasants and the soldiers as he is a member of neither group. Believing the mercenaries have departed, the villagers eventually return from their hiding place only to be surprised when the soldiers spring from their own places of concealment. Vogel discovers that the leader of the village is a man named Gruber who has yet to arrive. The Captain orders another peasant leader to take Vogel to Gruber to negotiate. Vogel accomplishes his mission: Gruber agrees‚Äîover the objection of the village priest, Fr. Wendt‚Äî that the soldiers are to be fed and quartered in return for their protecting the Valley. Sick and still suffering from his years of wandering the devastated countryside, Vogel promptly collapses. While recovering, Vogel and the Captain discuss the situation in the Valley‚Äîthe internal rivalry between Gruber and Fr. Wendt, the status of the peasantry‚Äîand the outside world in general. Through a series of intellectual conversations and arguments the two slowly begin to form a bond of mutual respect and, by the end of the story, friendship. Vogel is quartered on Martin Hoffman, another leading peasant in the village whose young, strong- willed daughter, Inge, develops an attraction for him that he finds painful to resist. An immediate point of contention erupts when both Gruber and the Captain agree that the village's beloved shrine should be moved to prevent other roving patrols from finding the Valley. Fr. Wendt is diametrically opposed to this as a direct threat to the authority of the church. The peasantry are hostile to the idea believing that the shrine has protected the Valley exactly where it is. Even some of the Catholics among the mercenaries express misgivings‚Äîin particular, Pirelli, one of the Captain‚Äôs chief lieutenants, who tells Gruber at one point: \\"Other villages have mountains. Mountains didn't save them. You have the shrine, and this village has been spared.\\" To which Gruber retorts: \\"Other villages have shrines.\\" The following day the shrine is moved. Vogel and Graf, the Captain's right-hand man, intercept Fr. Wendt who is on his way to see what has happened with the shrine, accompanied by a few peasants including a young hothead, Andreas Hoffmeyr. The confrontation turns physical as Andreas unsuccessfully attacks Graf. Vogel prevents Graf from killing the youngster who flees along with the others. During this fight, the raging Wendt is revealed as a former Calvinist minister. Vogel then must act quickly to prevent a massacre between a large group of peasants en route to the shrine and the soldiers who have arrived to block their path. By relating a dream that he claimed he had but in actuality made-up on the spot, Vogel convinces them that the move had divine sanction. A disheartened and disillusioned Fr. Wendt storms off. With the peasantry mollified, the Captain, Vogel, and Graf go after Wendt but at that moment an attempted assassination of the Captain takes place by Svensen, a partisan of Korski. Svensen's shot goes awry and the priest is killed. As the Captain and Graf set off in pursuit, Vogel drags Wendt's body into a nearby barn. He is there confronted by a gleeful Gruber who believes Vogel has killed him‚Äîan action Gruber had himself earlier urged upon Vogel ostensibly to help maintain peace with the soldiers but in actuality to eliminate his own main rival in the Valley (Vogel, as an outsider, was the only person capable of committing the deed without arousing a general uprising against the soldiers or Gruber). Gruber tells Vogel that he must now flee to escape the wrath of the peasants, a suggestion that the Captain later regretfully backs although he knows the truth of the situation. During his flight from the Valley, Vogel comes across a wandering priest whose own village had been destroyed and immediately comes up with a new plan. He intends to take this priest back to the Valley to atone, in the eyes of the peasants, for the death of Fr. Wendt. \\"I owe the valley a priest for a priest,\\" he reflects. However, back en route to the Valley, the pair encounter a patrol of Croats, the irregular cavalry of the Imperialist forces. Realizing that the Croats would destroy the village despite being Catholic, Vogel instructs the priest to take his own horse, ride to the Imperialists, and lure them away to a nearby abandoned village while he goes back to warn the Captain. He is then to slip away and rejoin Vogel in the Valley. The priest hesitantly agrees. In the meantime, Vogel comes across Andreas, still in exile after his confrontation with Graf, and likewise urges him to act on behalf of the Valley, spy out the Croats, and report back. Vogel is then picked up by one of the Captain's roving patrols and brought back to the Valley where he learns that the truth about Fr. Wendt's death is known to the peasants and that he is not a wanted man after all. He warns the Captain about the Imperialist patrol. The Croats still arrive at the Valley, but its inhabitants are waiting. Acting as the bait, Vogel lures the Imperialists into an ambush where they are entirely destroyed. Andreas, having been captured, bound, and tortured by the Croats, is recovered and forgiven his earlier transgression. Peace returns to the Valley and an admiring Captain makes Vogel a judge of all incidents between soldier and peasant‚Äîa position unwanted by Vogel. His first case, however, concerns the wandering priest who turns up in the Valley after the battle with the Croats. Vogel accepts the priest's story that he attempted to do as Vogel had suggested and had not betrayed the Valley. He becomes the new priest for the villagers after agreeing to remain apolitical. The Captain also agrees to Vogel's suggestion of training some of the villagers as a type of militia to assist with protecting the Valley after the defection of Hansen, another of Korski's partisans, along with two other mercenaries. Tension begins rising again in the Valley and Vogel narrowly prevents the rape of Inge. Andreas tells Vogel that some of the militiamen are conspiring with Hansen and leads him to a place where they transact business. Instead, Andreas attempts to kill Vogel, jealous of Inge's infatuation with him and the general situation of the mercenaries presence in the Valley. At the last minute, however, he changes his mind, realizing the futility of his action, and saves Vogel. Vogel proceeds to inform the Captain of the plot, only to discover that it is already known to him and that Graf has been feeding disinformation to the traitors. Based on what they perceive to be Hansen's plan, the Captain and Graf plan accordingly, assigning three mercenaries to Vogel to protect the villagers in a hidden hedge while the rest set an ambush. Hansen's attack is thwarted but several mercenaries are killed and many are wounded. Peace returns again to the Valley. The soldiers become more peasant-like, the peasants grow to accept the soldiers, and one mercenary marries a local girl. The reverie is interrupted by a travelling merchant who warns that the warring parties, Prince Bernard and Imperialist general Johann von Werth, are drawing closer to their location. Finally, a local man informs a patrol that the armies have arrived at the Rhine, two days away. Faced with impending doom, the Captain and Gruber agree that the company will leave the Valley and rejoin the Protestant army in order lure away other patrols and keep the Valley safe. Taking with him the remains of his original force as well as the bulk of the peasant militia, the Captain and company head off to the army encampment at Rheinfelden. He leaves behind Vogel and two wounded mercenaries to maintain order. Gruber immediately plots against the Captain's plans. He arranges the death of the two remaining soldiers, has Vogel confined, and, expecting the Captain‚Äôs imminent return after the Protestant victory at Rheinfelden, sets up an ambush for the him. Warned by Andreas via the new priest, Vogel escapes in the night in an attempt to warn the Captain but is shot and mortally wounded. As he lay dying, the Captain approaches alone, likewise mortally wounded, slips from his horse, and lies next to Vogel. The Captain reveals that in the confusion of the battle, his company had joined the wrong side in the conflict and had been wiped out, leaving him as the sole survivor. The two contemplate the final irony of the war in which Catholics and Protestants fought on both sides of the war, changing sides frequently, and the overall futility of warfare: \\"You might put it that in the confusion we joined the wrong army,\\" the Captain says. \\"You might put it that one always does join the wrong army,\\" Vogel replies. In the morning, the ambush party finds the two dead. Character sketches=The mercenaries= The exact number of mercenary soldiers who arrive with the Captain is never specifically stated. However, a careful reading of the text reveals that their numbers most likely lie between 25 and 30. Based on the Captain's dispositions before the battle with the Croats (combined with those known already to have died), the company numbered 18 men by that time and had entered the Valley with no less than 22. Many, if not all, had fought at various times on both sides of the conflict by the time of the story. The following are those who are actually named as well as what is known of their individual histories: * The Captain- the leader of the group; of aristocratic origins, speaks excellent German and highly educated; trained as a swordsman and was a \\"younger son;\\" has been a soldier for fifteen years and fought at the battles of Breitenfield and N√∂rdlingen * Korski- a Slav with great influence in the company as the main rival of the Captain; was one of the two troopers who first discovered Vogel and the first man eliminated by the Captain with the change in plans. * Graf- a German, the Captain's main ally, and chief lieutenant; a disillusioned Catholic who fought under the generals Mansfeld and Pappenheim prior to joining the Captain; was present at the siege of Magdeburg. * Pirelli- an Italian and one of the Captain's three section leaders; a devoted Catholic, he is opposed to the moving of the Valley's shrine but is shamed by the Captain on his hypocrisy with regards to his attitude toward the Catholic peasants. * Geddes- a Scotsman and strict Calvinist; although secretly married, he remained loyal to the Captain; bonds with Inge Hoffman; killed defending the hedge during Hansen's attack. * Tub- a Netherlander and Protestant; sponsored by Vogel, he enthusiastically embraces the idea of training young villagers to form a militia; wounded in the battle against Hansen and left behind with Vogel when the Captain leaves for Rheinfelden; killed on patrol presumably by his own militia under orders from Gruber. * Hansen- possibly a Swede; an ally of Korski who remained loyal to the Captain initially; lost an arm at Nordlingen; became disgruntled with the Captain's policies in the Valley and mutinies in a failed attempt to take over and is killed. * Stoffel- the company's bugler; bonds with the peasants and marries one of the Valley's girls; wounded during Hansen's attack and left behind with Vogel when the Captain leaves for Rheinfelden; disappears and presumably killed by Gruber's men. * Svensen- a Swede; distinguished himself at Breitenfield; an ally of Korski who initially remained loyal to the Captain; attempts to assassinate him after the shrine incident but kills Fr. Wendt instead; killed by the Captain. * Carus- one of the Captain's three section leaders; assigned to protect the hedge during Hansen's attack. * Keller- one of the Captain's three section leaders. * Schutz- a German and an ally of Korski who speaks out against the Captain's new plan; killed by Graf, Geddes, and Tub. * Schenk- a Hessian and ally of Korski who speaks out against the Captain's new plan; killed by Graf, Geddes, and Tub. * Altringer- a Bavarian who attempts to rape Inge but is stopped by Vogel; killed during Hansen's attack. * Leyden- one of Hansen's lieutenants in the mutiny; leads the attack on the hedge but is killed by Carus. * Francois- a Frenchman; assigned to protect the hedge during Hansen's attack. * The Polack- presumably a Pole; mutinies with Hansen; killed during his attack on the Valley. * Heinrich- one of Graf's men. Except where noted, all perished in the Battle of Rheinfelden. =The peasants= The Valley and its village are technically loyal to the Catholic cause in the war and located two days ride from Rheinfelden. * Gruber- headman of the village; richest and most powerful man in the Valley before the arrival of the Captain. * Fr. Wendt- a former Calvinist minister and strict village priest; rival of Gruber; killed accidentally by Svensen. * Zollner- well-off and influential peasant farmer; the peasant leader who leads Vogel to Gruber. * Martin Hoffman- well-off and influential peasant farmer upon whom Vogel is quartered. * Andreas Hoffmeyr- brooding youth who hates Gruber and the soldiers alike; initially hates Vogel as a facilitator of the soldiers and love interest of Inge. * Inge Hoffman- Martin Hoffman's sixteen-year-old, independent-minded daughter; betrothed to Andreas but attracted to Vogel. * Albrecht Arnold- an older peasant who reluctantly goes to work for the Captain after being mistreated by his sons. * Clara Arnold- Arnold's wife who likewise works for the Captain, cooking and cleaning. * Matthias Arnold- the Arnold's eldest son; becomes one of Tub's peasant soldiers; betrays the Valley with Hansen and is killed during his attack. * Hans Arnold- the Arnold's second son; becomes one of Tub's peasant soldiers and stays loyal; leaves with the Captain for Rheinfelden. * Ritter- an older peasant who was previously a soldier under the generals Tilly, Arnim, and Wallenstein; returned to the Valley after the Battle of Wolgast; with Tub, trains the village militia. * Grandmother Hoffman- Martin Hoffman's mother (Inge's grandmother); a devout Catholic and perceptive woman who looks out for Vogel. * Hoffmeyr's mother- a woman knowledgeable of herbs who helps the new priest care for the wounded after Hansen's attack. * Big, slouched-shouldered peasant- one of Gruber's henchman who tries to kill Vogel in conjunction with Andreas. =The outsiders= * Vogel- a highly educated man; it is never established with absolute certainty what his profession was- the dense Korski believed him to be a preacher while the very perceptive Captain suspected him to be a lawyer; he himself seems to imply that he was some type of a scholar: \\"I've wandered a long way since scholars began to starve for a living.\\" * The traveller- a travelling merchant who updates the Valley residents of the status of the war. * The wandering priest- a wandering priest discovered by Vogel during his brief exile; from a destroyed village; becomes the new priest of the Valley. * Heinrich Bachmann- a man from a neighbouring valley who warns Stoffel of the arrival of the warring armies. Writing style The author uses a number of writing devices to heighten the tension of the story as well as enrich its historical backdrop. Throughout the novel, characters at all socioeconomic levels can be found discussing greater events in Germany as they understand them as well as relating their own experiences. Additionally, Pick has a penchant for withholding names for a considerable space or even indefinitely, adding to the dynamism of the writing. The name of the Captain, for example, is never revealed, his rank used instead like a name and as a constant reminder of his relevance in the story as well as the Valley- an outsider, but still the main power. The Hoffman grandmother, on the other hand, is equally important to the story as a stabilising force for Vogel's constantly swinging mood, yet her name is never revealed nor a title beyond the lower case \\"grandmother\\" ever assigned. Others have their names revealed long after they have become a participant in the story. Inge is introduced on page 20 as a force to be reckoned with, but her name is not learned by the reader until page 30. Fr. Wendt is introduced on page 26, another considerable presence, yet his name does not appear for another twelve pages. The brooding youth Andreas Hofmeyr, one of the most important characters, has a whopping 33 page interlude between the introduction of his character and that of his name (pages 21 and 54, respectively). All of this can be contrasted to that of the central character, Vogel, whose name and appearance begin on page one.

From 1896 to 1920, he was Chairman of the Association of Artists (Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet).  Biography  His father was a police commissioner. He grew up in Stenkyrka Parish on the island of Tj√∂rn until he was twenty, when he went to Stockholm to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, where his primary instructor was Edvard Pers√©us (1841-1890). From 1880 to 1882, he studied on his own in France, visited museums in Antwerp and Brussels and became influenced by Impressionism after seeing their Seventh Exhibition at Paris during 1882. He was able to get two paintings displayed at the Salon. Then, after a stay in Normandy, he returned home and remained there until 1886. In 1885, he was one of a group of 85 Swedish artists who became known as the opponents (Opponenterna). They were signatories of a written request to the Royal Academy of Arts for a modernization and reform of the art education, exhibition activities and artist support. In 1885, he married the engraver, Tekla Lindestr√∂m (1856-1937) whom he had met at the Swedish artists' colony in Grez-sur-Loing in north- central France. Their daughter, Elsa Nordstr√∂m (1889-1952) also became a painter. In 1889, he exhibited at the Exposition Universelle and one of his paintings was purchased by Prince Eugen (1865‚Äì1947), a notable patron of the arts. Later, they went back to Tj√∂rn, then lived in Skansen until 1892. After that, they once more returned to Tj√∂rn and spent the summers at the resort town of Apelviken, south of Varberg. There, together with Nils Kreuger (1858-1930) and Richard Bergh (1858-1919), they developed an art style what came to be known as the Varberg School (Varbergsskolan). He was also one of the founders of the Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet and served as Chairman from 1896 to 1920. In the early 1900s, he was a teacher at their school, the Association of Artists Schoiol (Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundets m√•larskola) which was in operation for 1890-1908. After 1910, he began to switch from Impressionism to SynthetismGunnar Carlquist, Svensk uppslagsbok, Vol.20, Malm√∂, pgs. 101-102, possibly influenced by Van Gogh and Gauguin, whose works he had seen in Paris, as well as by the Japanese art he saw there. In 1913, he began to have health problems, beginning with gallbladder surgery. In 1914, he started a diary. The following years were not happy. In quick succession he lost his mother (aged almost one hundred) and his best friend, Bergh. In 1920, after the Konstn√§rsf√∂rbundet was dissolved, he and his wife paid a nostalgic visit to France. He died at Drottningholm during 1923 and was buried at the Norra begravningsplatsen.Karl-Axel Bj√∂rnberg: Kungliga och Norra begravningsplatsen (B√§ckstr√∂ms f√∂rlag 1998) pgs.175-176 His works may be seen at the Nationalmuseum,Nationalmuseum Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde,Prins Eugens Waldemarsudde Thiel Gallery, and the G√∂teborgs konstmuseum.G√∂teborgs konstmuseum The street, \\"Karl Nordstr√∂ms v√§g\\" in S√∂dra √Ñngby is named after him, as is the \\"Karl Nordstr√∂ms v√§g\\" in Varberg.

Cerro. He formerly played for the Uruguay U-20 team. Early life Joaquin was born in Montevideo on 19 June 1987 to an Armenian father and a Spanish mother. Club career He began his career at Club Cerro. In 2005, he debuted in the first division and four years later, due to his great talent and goalscoring ability, he moved to Argentina. In the Uruguayan league, he scored 23 goals in 55 matches and helped \\"Club Cerro\\" to qualification in the next Copa Libertadores, becoming the top scorer. In 2009, he joined Newell's Old Boys. In the 2009 Argentinian Apertura, he scored 11 goals in 18 matches, becoming the team's top goalscorer and one of the best strikers in the championship. Newell's fought against Banfield for the championship until the very last round, with a disappointing 0‚Äì2 home defeat to San Lorenzo in the final match. Despite it being only his first season in Argentina, the Uruguayan striker won the love of the fans. His outstanding aerial game and his excellent goalscoring record made Boghossi√°n recognised by fans as a replacement to their last top goalscorer: Oscar \\"Tacuara\\" Cardozo. In the summer of 2010, after his spell on loan in Newell's Old Boys, Boghossi√°n was transferred to Red Bull Salzburg, the defending champion of the Austrian Bundesliga, where he signed a four-year contract. However, for the season held in Salzburg, Boghossi√°n showed no activity, which was present at a performance in the previous club. In 18 matches, he scored only one goal. Therefore, the leadership of the club decided to send the player on rent. Boghossi√°n's services were interested in clubs such as Paraguayan club Club Olimpia, Uruguayan club Nacional and Greek club PAOK. Later, information from a number of Uruguayan media reported that the player will soon be joining PAOK. The club reportedly offered 350,000 euros and a one-year contract with the continuation of the wages that Boghossian received from Red Bull. The information was incorrect, however, and Boghossi√°n was loaned to Nacional, where he was on the end of the season 2011‚Äì12. In January 2013, he was put on loan for six months to Cercle Brugge. International career Boghossi√°n played for Uruguay U-20 youth team in the Sudamericano of 2007. He has yet to play for the national team of Uruguay. While facing strong competition in Diego Forl√°n, Luis Su√°rez and Edinson Cavani, Boghossian could well be the next striker for Uruguay. According to him, if the head coach of Uruguay did not call him to the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, he will play for the national team of Armenia. However, it was later revealed that he had tried to sway the coach of Uruguay, and he is not going to play for Armenia.

In 1877, to mark its fiftieth anniversary, the Class was renamed the Nikolaev Naval Academy (Nikolayevskaya Morskaya Akademiya) and in 1910 was completely detached from the Naval Cadet Corps.

The mission of the Advanced Officers' Class was to improve the theoretical training of the most promising naval officers in exact and applied sciences. As a result of the revolution in naval affairs brought about by the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56) and the clear end of the age of sail the future of naval education in Russia and its transformation was reviewed by a special commission in 1862.Voyenno-Morskaya Akademiya, Leningrad, 1991, V.N.

To please both was not an easy task. > Could the artists face both ways at once, and take both sets of viewers > seriously? That split in attention, I shall argue, led to a wide public > being successfully courted but not seriously addressed. It has left a large > audience for high art lite intrigued but unsatisfied, puzzled at the work's > meaning and wanting explanations that are never vouchsafed: the aim of this > book is to suggest the direction some of those answers might take and to do > so in a style that is as accessible as the art it examines.\\"See: > \\"Introduction.\\" In, Julian Stallabrass, High Art Lite (London: Verso, 1999), > p. 11, emphasis added.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.  History  Brandon Hall, 1937 Brandon Hall was formally a large working cotton plantation located on the scenic Natchez Trace. The land on which Brandon Hall now stands first passed into private ownership as a royal grant from the Spanish King Carlos III in 1788. In 1809 the property was sold at public auction to William Lock Chew for the sum of $7,000. Chew constructed the first permanent dwelling consisting of a three- room brick house about twenty by sixty feet, built sometime between 1809 and 1820. This structure still exists as the \\"basement\\" of the present house known as Brandon Hall. In 1833 Chew sold the property to Nathaniel Hoggatt, a successful planter whose daughter Charlotte inherited the land after his death. On October 29, 1840, Charlotte Hoggatt married Gerard Brandon III, who was the son of an early Governor of Mississippi and the grandson of a Revolutionary War Hero of the same name. They lived in this original dwelling until 1853, when they began construction of Brandon Hall which was completed in 1856. In January 1914, the plantation, house, and land was sold to George Hightower as a result of a default on a promissory note, thus ending an 81-year chain of ownership by the Brandon and Hoggatt families. These 81 years extended from Mississippi's frontier days during the period of grace and plenty before the Civil War, and through the South's darkest hours after the war. From 1914 until the present, Brandon Hall Plantation has had ten owners. In 1987 the home was completely renovated and restored, perfectly duplicating the original construction. In 2009 the owners of the house, Edward L. and James R. Diefenthal of New Orleans, Louisiana, donated the house to the Historic Natchez Foundation.The Clarion-Ledger: Historic house donated to Natchez foundation Archived at WebCite In December 2009 the home was purchased by Ron and Kathy Garber of Lafayette, Louisiana, who opened it for Bed and Breakfast accommodation.

We are Thine, and Thine we wish to be; but, to be more surely united with Thee, behold each one of us freely consecrates himself today to Thy most Sacred Heart. Many indeed have never known Thee; many too, despising Thy precepts, have rejected Thee. Have mercy on them all, most merciful Jesus, and draw them to Thy sacred Heart. Be Thou King, O Lord, not only of the faithful who have never forsaken Thee, but also of the prodigal children who have abandoned Thee; grant that they may quickly return to Thy Father's house lest they die of wretchedness and hunger. Be Thou King of those who are deceived by erroneous opinions, or whom discord keeps aloof, and call them back to the harbor of truth and unity of faith, so that there may be but one flock and one Shepherd. Be Thou King of all those who are still involved in the darkness of idolatry or of Islamism, and refuse not to draw them into the light and kingdom of God. Turn Thine eyes of mercy towards the children of the race, once Thy chosen people: of old they called down upon themselves the Blood of the Savior; may it now descend upon them a laver of redemption and of life. Grant, O Lord, to Thy Church assurance of freedom and immunity from harm; give peace and order to all nations, and make the earth resound from pole to pole with one cry: \\"Praise be to the divine Heart that wrought our salvation; to it be glory and honor for ever.\\" Amen.

He was born in Aberdeen in 1940 into a Traveller family which had settled there. His family background was rich in tradition, and from his aunt, folk singer Jeannie Robertson, he inherited a huge repertoire of northeast ballads. He was the keyworker for the Heritage Lottery-funded \\"Oral and Cultural Traditions of Scottish Travellers\\" project at the Elphinstone Institute, University of Aberdeen, from April 2002 until April 2005. As an acknowledged expert and member of the Traveller community, Robertson documented his own lore and that of other members of this group, and promoted the cultural traditions of Scottish Travellers among young people in schools and community groups. Stanley's storytelling was affected by the different trades at which he worked, including his long years spent filleting in the Aberdeen fish houses, where he gathered many contemporary stories. In June 2003, he represented the University of Aberdeen and Scotland at the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. He published three successful plays and seven books, some written in his local Scots dialect. He was featured in more than 100 radio programmes and 50 television appearances and made numerous personal appearances on stage and in theatres, schools and colleges. On 27 November 2008, at age 68, Stanley Robertson, who was an Honorary Research Associate at the University of Aberdeen's Elphinstone Institute, was conferred an honorary degree of Master of the University (MUniv), in recognition for the work he had done. He was a frequent broadcaster and appeared regularly at storytelling festivals. He was an Honorary Founder of the Scottish Storytelling Forum. Stanley died at his home in Aberdeen on Sunday, 2 August 2009. A musical about Robertson's life by Kyle Jarrow and Bright Lights, Big City composer Paul Scott Goodman tentatively titled Reek Roon is currently under development, reportedly commissioned by Fela! producer Steve Hendel. In 2016, in memory of Robertson's significant influence as a storyteller, the Grampian Association of Storytellers commissioned the 'Stanley Robertson Award for Traditional Storytelling' to be given out at the Aberdeen Traditional Music and Song Association's yearly competitions. The trophy was created by glassmaker Shelagh Swanson and its first winner was Jane Chalmers.

It was last assigned to the 316th Troop Carrier Group at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, where it was inactivated on 18 June 1957. The unit was first activated during as a Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport unit that saw combat with the 435th Troop Carrier Group in Western Europe. The squadron flew paratroopers on airborne assaults on Normandy (Operation Overlord); Southern France (Operation Dragoon); the Netherlands (Operation Market Garden), and Germany (Operation Varsity). It also flew combat resupply missions in the relief of Bastogne in 1945. The 75th was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions during the Normandy invasion. Following VE Day, the 75th returned to the United States, where it was reassigned to the 316th Group. It participated in joint airborne training, glider training and in exercises with Curtiss C-46 Commandos and Fairchild C-82 Packets until 1949 when it was inactivated as a result of budget reductions. The squadron was activated again in December 1952 with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars and moved on paper to Japan in November 1954 when its parent 316th Troop Carrier Group replaced the 314th Troop Carrier Group at Ashiya.  History=World War II= 78th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47 landing The squadron was first activated at Bowman Field, Kentucky in February 1943, as one of the original squadrons of the 435th Troop Carrier Group. The group used Douglas C-47 Skytrains and Douglas C-53 Skytrooopers in preparing for duty overseas with Ninth Air Force.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 306‚Äì307 The 75th left the United States in October 1943, arriving at RAF Langar (AAF-490), England, in early November. In January 1944, the 75th TCS along with the rest of the 435th Troop Carrier Group moved to RAF Welford (AAF-474). While in the ETO the 75th TCS wore first the Sqdn code \\"SH\\" and then in late Spring 1944, it was changed to \\"CK.\\" After its arrival in the UK, the Squadron began training for participation in the airborne operation over Normandy. The squadron flew its first combat missions on D-Day by dropping paratroopers of 101st Airborne Division near Cherbourg. The unit towed Waco CG-4A and Airspeed Horsa gliders carrying reinforcements to the same location that afternoon and on the following morning. The squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its part in Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion. The squadron began transport services following the landings in France and intermittently engaged in missions of this type until V-E Day In these operations the 75th hauled supplies such as serum, blood plasma, radar sets, clothing, rations, and ammunition. It also evacuated wounded personnel to Allied hospitals. The squadron interrupted these supply and evacuation missions to train for and participate in three major airborne assaults. It was part of a detachment of three squadrons from the 435th Group that moved to Tarquinia Airfield, Italy in July 1944 for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France.Citus et Certus. p. 25 The detachment dropped paratroopers over the assault area on 15 August and also released gliders carrying troops and equipment such as jeeps, guns, and ammunition. The following day it flew a resupply mission over France, then transported supplies to bases in Italy before returning to England at the end of the month. In September 1944 the squadron participated in Operation Market Garden the unsuccessful airborne operation intended to seize bridges across the Meuse River in the Netherlands, dropping paratroops of the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions and releasing gliders carrying reinforcements. During the Battle of the Bulge, the unit delivered supplies to isolated combat positions of the 101st Airborne and 7th Armored Divisions in Bastogne and Marcouray, Belgium.Citus et Certus, p. 26 The unit moved to Bretigny Airfield, France in February 1945 to prepare for Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine River. Each squadron aircraft participating in this operation towed two gliders transporting troops and equipment to the east bank of the Rhine near Wesel on 24 March. The unit then flew resupply missions to Germany in support of ground forces. The squadron transported supplies to occupation forces in Germany and evacuated Allied prisoners of war after V-E Day. The squadron and the 435th Group returned to the United States in August and the group was inactivated on 15 November 1945. =Post war troop carrier operations= C-82s of the 316th Troop Carrier Group Shortly after the 435th Troop Carrier Group was inactivated, the squadron was moved to Lawson Field, Georgia, where it became part of the 316th Troop Carrier Group. The squadron initially operated Curtiss C-46 Commandos with the 316th. By 1947 it had converted to Fairchild C-82 Packet transports. With both aircraft it participated in joint airborne training, glider training and in exercises. The squadron also ferried aircraft to overseas locations.Ravenstein, pp. 165‚Äì166 President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force.Knaack, p. 25 As a result, the squadron's parent 316th Troop Carrier WingThe 316th Troop Carrier Wing had been formed in 1947 as part of the Air Force's wing base organization, which placed the 316th Troop Carrier Group and the various units supporting it under a single wing organization. Ravenstein, pp. 10 (Explanatory Notes), 165‚Äì166 was inactivated in October, while its 316th Group moved to Smyrna Air Force Base, Tennessee in November, where it was absorbed into another wing.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 193‚Äì195 Shortly after arriving at Smyrna, the group was reduced to two squadrons and the 75th was inactivated. =Troop carrier operations in Japan= The squadron was reactivated in December 1952 at Smyrna (now Sewart Air Force Base) as the expansion of the Air Force during the Korean War permitted the 316th Group to expand to three squadrons of Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars.The group also had a squadron equipped with Chase YC-122 Avitrucs, experimenting with assault airlift techniques. In November 1954, the squadron moved without personnel or equipment to Ashiya Air Base, Japan, where it assumed the aircraft, personnel and mission of the 62d Troop Carrier Squadron.The move of the 316th Group and its C-119 squadrons was essentially a swap of numbers with the 314th Troop Carrier Group, which simultaneously moved without personnel or equipment from Ashiya to Sewart. The 314th Group had deployed to Japan for the Korean War in 1950, while its parent 314th Troop Carrier Wing had remained behind at Sewart, with other groups attached as its operational elements. Ravenstein, pp. 161‚Äì163, Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 190‚Äì192 It remained in Japan and performed theater airlift missions primarily to Japan, Okinawa, Philippines and South Korea until it was inactivated in 1957.

The homeland of the ancient Epirotes was bordered by the Aetolian League to the south, Thessaly and Macedonia to the east, and Illyrian tribes to the north. For a brief period (280‚Äì275 BC), the Epirote king Pyrrhus managed to make Epirus a powerful state in the Greek world, comparable to the likes of Macedon and Rome. His armies marched against Rome during an unsuccessful campaign in Italy. History=Prehistory= Epirus has been occupied since at least Neolithic times by seafarers along the coast and by hunters and shepherds in the interior who brought with them the Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large tumuli containing shaft graves, similar to the Mycenaean tombs, indicating an ancestral link between Epirus and the Mycenaean civilization. A number of Mycenaean remains have been found in Epirus, especially at the most important ancient religious sites in the region, the Necromanteion (Oracle of the Dead) on the Acheron river, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona.. Epirus had strong links to other Greek regions such as Macedonia, Thessaly, Aetolia and Acarnania.. The Dorians invaded Greece from Epirus and Macedonia at the end of the 2nd millennium BC (circa 1100‚Äì1000 BC), though the reasons for their migration are obscure. The region's original inhabitants were driven southward into the Greek mainland by the invasion and by the early 1st millennium BC three principal clusters of Greek-speaking tribes emerged in Epirus. These were the Chaonians of northwestern Epirus, the Molossians in the center, and the Thesprotians in the south.. The region inhabited by each of these ethne had its own name (Chaonia, Molossia, Thesprotia), thus there was no single name for the entire region originally. The Greek toponym Epirus (), meaning \\"mainland\\" or \\"continent\\", first appears in the work of Hecataeus of Miletus in the 6th century BC and is one of the few Greek names from the view of an external observer with a maritime- geographical perspective. Although not originally a native Epirote name, it later came to be adopted by the inhabitants of the area. =Molossian expansion (470‚Äì330 BC)= The Molossian Aeacidae dynasty managed to create the first centralized state in Epirus from about 370 BC onwards, expanding their power at the expense of rival tribes. The Aeacids allied themselves with the increasingly powerful kingdom of Macedon, in part against the common threat of Illyrian raids,. and in 359 BC the Molossian princess Olympias, niece of Arybbas of Epirus, married King Philip II of Macedon (r. 359‚Äì336 BC). She was to become the mother of Alexander the Great. On the death of Arybbas, Alexander the Molossian, uncle of Alexander the Great of Macedon, succeeded to the throne with the title King of Epirus.. In 334 BC, the time Alexander the Great crossed into Asia, Alexander I the Molossian led an expedition in southern Italy in support of the Greek cities of Magna Graecia against the nearby Italian tribes and the emerging Roman Republic. After some successes on the battlefield, he was defeated by a coalition of Italic tribes at the Battle of Pandosia in 331 BC. =Kingdom of Epirus (330‚Äì231 BC)= Campaigns of Pyrrhus of Epirus in Italy. In 330 BC, upon Alexander the Molossian's death, the term \\"Epirus\\" appears as a single political unit in the ancient Greek records for the first time, under the leadership of the Molossian dynasty. Subsequently, the coinages of the three major Epirote tribal groups came to an end, and a new coinage was issued with the legend Epirotes.. After Alexander's I death, Aeacides of Epirus, who succeeded him, espoused the cause of Olympias against Cassander, but was dethroned in 313 BC. Aeacides's son Pyrrhus came to the throne in 295 BC. Pyrrhus, being a skillful general, was encouraged to aid the Greeks of Tarentum and decided to initiate a major offensive in the Italian peninsula and Sicily. Due to its superior martial abilities, the Epirote army defeated the Romans in the Battle of Heraclea (280 BC). Subsequently, Pyrrhus's forces nearly reached the outskirts of Rome, but had to retreat to avoid an unequal conflict with a more numerous Roman army. The following year, Pyrrhus invaded Apulia (279 BC) and the two armies met in the Battle of Asculum where the Epirotes won the eponymous Pyrrhic victory, at a high cost.. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured the Carthaginian fortress in Eryx, Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus. Meanwhile, he had begun to display despotic behavior towards the Sicilian Greeks and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Though he defeated the Carthaginians in battle, he was forced to abandon Sicily.. Pyrrhus's Italian campaign came to an end following the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum (275 BC). Having lost the vast majority of his army, he decided to return to Epirus, which finally resulted in the loss of all his Italian holdings. Because of his costly victories, the term \\"Pyrrhic victory\\" is often used for a victory with devastating cost to the victor.. =Epirote League (231‚Äì167 BC)= Coin of the Epirote League, depicting Zeus (left) and a lightning bolt with the word \\"ŒëŒ†ŒïŒôŒ°Œ©Œ§ŒëŒù\\" , \\"of the Epirotes\\" (right). In 233 BC, the last surviving member of the Aeacid royal house, Deidamia, was murdered. Her death brought the Epirote royal family to an abrupt extinction and a federal republic was set up, though with diminished territory, since western Acarnania had asserted its independence, and the Aetolians seized Ambracia, Amphilochia, and the remaining land north of the Ambracian Gulf. The new Epirote capital was therefore established at Phoenice, the political center of the Chaonians. The reasons for the swift fall of the Aeacid dynasty were probably complex. Aetolian pressure must have played a part, and the alliance with Macedonia may have been unpopular; in addition, there were perhaps social tensions.. However, Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament (or synedrion). In the following years, Epirus faced the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars with Macedonia. The League remained neutral in the first two Macedonian Wars but split in the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians siding with Rome. The outcome was disastrous for Epirus; Molossia fell to Rome in 167 BC and 150,000 of its inhabitants were enslaved. Organization Political structure of the ancient Greek world (8th‚Äì5th centuries BC). In antiquity, Epirus was settled by the same nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle the rest of Greece.; . Unlike most other Greeks of the time, who lived in or around city-states such as Athens or Sparta, the Epirotes lived in small villages and their way of life was foreign to that of polis of southern Greeks. Their region lay on the edge of the Greek world and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a frontier area contested with the Illyrian peoples of the Adriatic coast and interior. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than might have been expected given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at Dodona ‚Äì regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at Delphi.. Culture At least since classical antiquity, the Epirotes were speakers of an epichoric Northwest Greek dialect, different from the Dorian of the Greek colonies on the Ionian islands, and bearers of mostly Greek names, as evidenced by epigraphy.; . Nicholas Hammond argues that the principal social structure of the Epirotes was the tribe and that they spoke a West-Greek dialect.: \\"Epirus was a land of milk and animal products [...] The social unit was a small tribe, consisting of several nomadic or semi-nomadic groups, and these tribes, of which more than seventy names are known, coalesced into large tribal coalitions, three in number: Thesprotians, Molossians and Chaonians [...] We know from the discovery of inscriptions that these tribes were speaking the Greek language (in a West-Greek dialect).\\" Tom Winnifrith (1983) argues that the Epirotes became culturally more closely connected to the rest of the Greek world during the centuries that preceded the Roman conquest of the region (3rd-2nd century BC), while hellenisation process continued even after the conquest. As such their rulers claimed Greek descent. On the other hand, Johannes Engels (2010), argues that genealogical links through the Trojan cycle and other myths strongly connected Epirus with the rest of Greece, precluding serious debate about the Greekness of the Epirotes. The language they spoke was regarded as a primitive Northwestern Greek dialect, but there was no question that it was Greek. The way of life in Epirus was more archaic than that in the Corinthian and Corcyrean colonies on the coast, but there was never a discussion about their Greekness. The Epirotes seem to have been regarded with some disdain by some ancient Greek writers in classical antiquity. The 5th century BC Athenian historian Thucydides describes them as \\"barbarians\\" in his History of the Peloponnesian War,Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War, 1.8. as does Strabo in his Geography.Strabo. Geography, 7.7.1. Other writers, such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus,Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Roman Antiquities, 20.10 (19.11). Pausanias,Pausanias. Description of Greece, 1.11.7‚Äì1.12.2. and Eutropius,Eutropius. Abridgment of Roman History (Historiae Romanae Breviarium), 2.11.13. describe them as Greeks. Simon Hornblower interprets the vague, and sometimes even antithetical, comments of Thucydides on the Epirotes as implying that they were neither completely \\"barbarian\\" nor completely Greek, but akin to the latter. Notably, Thucydides had similar views of the neighboring Aetolians and Acarnians, even though the evidence leaves no doubt that they were Greek. The term \\"barbarian\\" may have denoted not only clearly non-Greek populations, but also Greek populations on the fringe of the Greek world with peculiar dialects.. A far more reliable source on the views of the Greeks is the list of sacred envoys () in Epidaurus, which includes the Epirotes.. The list which was compiled in 360 BC includes the sacred envoys (members of the ruling family of each tribe or subtribe) of the Molossians, Kassopeans, Chaonians and Thesprotians. In terms of religion they worshipped the same gods like the rest of the Greeks. No traces of non-Greek deities were found until the Hellenistic age (with the introduction of oriental deities in the Greek world). Their supreme deity was Zeus and the Oracle of Dodona found in the land of the Molossians attracted pilgrims from all over the Greek world. As with the rest of the Epirotes they were included in the thearodokoi catalogues where only Greeks were allowed in order to participated in Panhellenic Games and festivals. Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of Hellas and the region where the Hellenes originated.: \\"The original home of the Hellenes was 'Hellas', the area round Dodona in Epirus, according to Aristotle. In the Iliad it was the home of Achilles' Hellenes.\\" Plutarch mentions an interesting cultural element of the Epirotes regarding the Greek hero Achilles. In his biography of King Pyrrhus, he states that Achilles \\"had a divine status in Epirus and in the local dialect he was called Aspetos\\" (meaning \\"unspeakable\\" or \\"unspeakably great\\" in Homeric Greek).Plutarch.

Go For What You Know is a live album by the Pat Travers Band, released in 1979 on Polydor Records. It reached platinum status in the US, and was re- released on CD in 1993. Background The album was recorded on tour in the US in early 1979, and featured the guitar tandem of Travers and Pat Thrall, who had joined the Pat Travers band in 1977 and had recorded Heat In The Street (1978) with them. According to Legends of Rock Guitar, on this album and the follow-up, Crash and Burn (1980), the duo of Travers and Thrall bridged the gap between what it calls \\"dramatic changes\\" in metal in the late 1970s: Travers emblematized \\"the blues-rock sound of sixties and seventies metal\\" whereas Thrall's playing represents the newer wave in metal (represented by Eddie van Halen): \\"The combining of the two players' solos during this time showed a rare detente between two generations of hard rockers and, although short-lived, it was extremely exciting.\\" The album was produced by Tom Allom, who had worked on the first five Black Sabbath albums as a sound engineer, had produced two albums by The Tourists, and would afterward produce nine albums by Judas Priest and the debut album On Through the Night by Def Leppard. Besides praising the guitar playing of Travers and Thrall, critics have also hailed Tommy Aldridge, a drumming pioneer who after leaving the Pat Travers Band played with Ozzy Osbourne; one critic called him \\"the definitive double bass drummer\\" on the basis of this album. Critical reception The album garnered positive reviews. It came recommended by Billboard magazine, and received positive reviews in the Los Angeles Times and The Daily Collegian.

Contrary to what the name might suggest, it is a performance venue, not a gambling house. The closest m√©tro/RER stations are Li√®ge, Trinit√© ‚Äì d'Estienne d'Orves, and Haussmann ‚Äì Saint-Lazare. The first building at this location where shows could be mounted was erected by the Duc de Richelieu around 1730, while after the Revolution the site was renamed Jardin de Tivoli and was the venue for fireworks displays. In 1880 it became the Palace Theatre, which housed shows of different types, including wrestling. It was at the beginning of the First World War, however, that the modern Casino de Paris began to take shape, when the venue was converted into a cinema and music hall. The bombardments of the First World War caused performances to be interrupted, and it is when they resumed that the revue format which lasted through a good part of the twentieth century was established. Over the decades, performers who have played the Casino de Paris have included Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, Josephine Baker, Micheline Bernardini, Tino Rossi, Line Renaud, Shakin' Stevens, Carla Bruni, Violetta Villas, and Zizi Jeanmaire; writers who have contributed work have included Serge Gainsbourg and Jean Ferrat; Yves Saint Laurent designed for the Casino in the 1970s, and poster artists have included Ert√© and Jules Ch√©ret.

In the late 1890s, at a temperance meeting in Kiel, he stated that, \\"Alcohol is the great foe of our country.\\" On his flagship SMS Stein on 4 September 1894 as Rear Admiral and chief of the Second Squadron, he took part in a Fleet Review before the Kaiser at Swinem√ºnde. In 1899 he was involved in contingency planning for a war against the United States. He objected to the original plan of sailing directly to attack New York City, suggesting instead an attack on Puerto Rico which would pull the American ships away from their Atlantic coastal bases.Target America: Hitler's plan to attack the United States by James P. Duffy; Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, 178 pages, p.3. As a member of the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club he met with representatives of the Eastern Yacht Club of Boston in September 1905 to arrange for the establishment of an American- German Challenge Cup.New York Times, September 9, 1905 p. 6. As commander of the Marinestation der Nordsee, he oversaw the building (1905‚Äì08) of a heavy gun fortress installation at Cuxhaven at the mouth of the Elbe River to protect the Elbe estuary, Hamburg and the North-Baltic Sea Canal (Kiel Canal) from enemy raids from the North Sea. Kaiser Wilhelm II named the fortress in his honor (Fort Thomsen). It is today a residential area of Cuxhaven. Grand Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia called him the \\"Reformer of sea Warfare Management.

Philbin, III; John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1982 1900 In 1900, he objected, along with his counterpart Hans von Koester, commander of the Second Division (Baltic Sea Naval Station) in Kiel, to the poor preparation and staffing of the German Imperial Admiralty Staff under Otto von Diederichs. Again like Koester, he opposed the use of resources as Diederichs proposed for a major increase in the size of the Admiralty Staff, the creation of a separate intelligence section, and, especially, the removal of the Naval War College (Marineacademie) to Berlin.By order of the Kaiser, p. 241 He supported the activities of the German Navy League (Flottenverein) to build public support for building and paying for a large navy, and was its second-vice president in 1906. During World War I he came to oppose the \\"soft\\" policy of Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg toward Britain and came to support a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against Britain. On 30 July 1916 he spoke along these lines at a meeting in Munich.8 German Anglophobia and the Great War, 1914-1918 by Matthew Stibbe; Cambridge University Press, 284 pages. He was honored in 1916 by being raised to the Prussian nobility (knighted), and in 1918 an auxiliary patrol ship (215 ton Trawler FV) built by Unterweser in Bremerhaven was named Admiral von Thomsen in his honor.Miramar Ship Index - Admiral von Thomsen August von Thomsen spent his last years in Kiel in his house 'Villa Barbara', named after Saint Barbara, the patroness of artillerymen.

Their style of music has been described (in the liner notes of their own releases) as Oi! punk. History SA was originally formed by vocalist Taisei Mabuchi in Gifu Prefecture in 1984. Their first release was the five-song EP I Get Position (1985) from the independent label Club the Star. This limited-run (2000 copies) release quickly sold out, and the punk rock magazine Doll placed it at the top of its list of \\"brightest-hope domestic releases of 1985.\\" http://sa-web.jp/releases/2010/02/i-get-position.html They also contributed two tracks to the album Oi of Japan (1986), which was compiled by Yosu-ko of Cobra and released from the independent AA Records (founded by the punk band Laughin' Nose). In 1987, having decided to move to Tokyo, Taisei brought SA to an end, with their last show (in Nagoya) breaking the attendance record for the venue. In Tokyo, Taisei formed a band called Bad Messiah, which released four albums and 10 singles from Epic Sony before dissolving in 1996.http://sa- web.jp/band SA was reunited in 1999, and in 2000 released the album You Must Stand Up My Comrades, consisting of remastered versions of the tracks on I Get Position and newly recorded songs.http://sa-web.jp/releases/2010/01/you-must- stand-up-my-comrades.html At the reunited SA's first show, Taisei met guitarist Naoki from Cobra, which was appearing as a guest. When eventually asked by Taisei to join SA, Naoki agreed on the condition that the rest of the band's lineup also be changed. This led to the current lineup of the band, including bassist Ken (who had played with Naoki in the band Dog Fight) and drummer Shohei (who had once auditioned for Cobra). The first album with this new lineup was Great Operation, self-released on the band's own label, Pineapple Records, in July 2002. This album led off with what would become the band's signature song, the hyper-energetic \\"Don't Deny, Give It A Try!!\\"; other notable tracks included \\"Die With Honor,\\" \\"Drawing Your Flag,\\" and \\"For Who, For What.\\" A CD single, Who's The Next Upstart?, was released later the same year, which aside from the title track featured a cover of the classic Sham 69 song \\"Borstal Breakout\\" as well as an extended-electronica remix of \\"Don't Deny, Give It A Try!!\\". A mini-LP entitled Stiff Upper Lip was released in March 2003, followed by the band's third full-length, Matchless Attack, in June 2004. Later that same year, the British label Anagram Records licensed a selection of songs from all of the band's Pineapple Records releases to date and compiled them onto a 20-track CD, entitled simply S.A. \\"Samurai Attack!\\". This was the first (and, as of mid-2009, only) of the band's recordings to be distributed widely outside Japan. A fourth full-length LP, Primal Yell, was released in 2006. In 2007, SA opened up for the platinum-selling American punk band Rancid during their tour of Japan. A mini-LP, Beyond I, was released on Pineapple in 2007, followed by another full-length album, Vandals Bop, in 2008. SA joined several other Japanese artists and bands for the 2009 edition of the Japan Nite tour (dubbed the \\"Attack From Japan\\" tour by SA), which started at the SXSW music festival in Austin and visited seven other major cities throughout the United States. A documentary about this tour, which originally aired on a satellite TV channel in Japan, was later released in expanded form as the DVD Make More Noize. SA opened for Rancid again during a portion of their Japan tour in fall 2009. Austin-based punk band Lower Class Brats opened for them during their Revolt'n' Roll Tour of February 2010. SA's music, though clearly rooted in Oi! and late-70's/early-80's punk rock, is characterized by often-breakneck tempos that are often fast enough to be considered hardcore, as well as a musical adventurousness that is rather unusual for the genre; abrupt timing changes are quite frequent, several of their songs have utilized instruments such as horns, accordions, and banjos, and they have even recorded a few ballads. As is typical for Japanese rock artists outside of the pop genre, SA's songs typically mix both Japanese- and English-language lyrics, often with partly Japanese verses and primarily or entirely English choruses. The artwork of the band's releases is notable both for its garishness and for its frequent use of fascistic imagery‚Äîparticularly on the cover of Matchless Attack, which appears to depict a Nuremberg-style rally with the four members of the band as its focal point. The band's logo is quite similar, though not identical, to the official logo of Nazi Germany's Sturmabteilung (commonly abbreviated to \\"SA\\"), the paramilitary organization that helped to put Hitler's Third Reich into power and that was later purged by Hitler in the Night of the Long Knives. (In the FAQ section of the band's former official website, Taisei stated that when he came up with the name \\"SA\\" he did not intend for it to stand for anything in particular, and that he was not aware of the association between the name and Nazi Germany.) However, a fascistic outlook is not at all evident in the lyrics of SA. These are characterized by a pro-action, pro-unity, positivist outlook not unlike that espoused by American hardcore bands such as Minor Threat or 7 Seconds. Here's an example from \\"Don't Deny, Give It A Try!!\\": (second verse) \\"We've been seeing the 'depths of misery'/We already know what 'hurt' is/The time we spend was not wasted./That's is all, I can say now!

It is the first part of a trilogy that is followed by Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich and concludes with Tsar Boris. All three plays were banned by the censor.Hartnoll (1983, 831). It dramatises the story of Ivan IV of Russia and is written in blank verse.Eriksen, MacLeod, and Wisneski (1960, 832). Tolstoy was influenced by the work of William Shakespeare in writing the trilogy, which formed the core of his reputation as a writer in the Russia of his day and as a dramatist to this day.Banham (1998, 1115), Eriksen, MacLeod, and Wisneski (1960, 832), and Moser (1992, 270). Background In the early 1863 Aleksey Tolstoy informed Yakov Polonsky in a letter from Dresden that he was working upon \\"a large poem in verse The Death of Ioann Grozny‚Ä¶ Two acts of it are being finished and, as people tell me, are good\\", he added. The deterioration of health hindered the creative process, but Act 3 has been completed by the summer of that year and in the end of 1863 the play was virtually ready. Some details as to the original draft of it have been traced through Tolstoy's correspondence with Karolina Pavlova who was translating the text into German, and was being asked to make changes according to those Tolstoy was making to his original text. Some of the scenes that have been excluded by the author from the final version of the play looked significant, one being Boris Godunov's conversation with tsarina Anastasia Romanovna about her granting him trusteeship right over Dmitry after Ioann and Fyodor's respective deaths. Also cut has been the scene of Godunov's talk with Dmitry's nanny. Both, according to Tolstoy, precipitated Tsar Fiodor Ioannovich, the second play of the trilogy and both have made their way into it later, although, as critics noticed, some fragments of which exactly the same could be said, have been kept in the original text. Making preparations for the first separate edition of the play, which came in November, 1866, Tolstoy again made changes. In the magazine version in both scenes of Act 1 there's been no mention of any negotiations with the British ambassador. The final Zakharyin's words (\\"Forgive us all! Here's the price we have to pay for edinovlastye,–ï–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏–µ (Russian): Absolute, uncontrolled rule of one person. for our own corruption\\") also appeared for the first time in the book version, summing up what was obviously the drama‚Äôs main idea. Tolstoy was taking into account other people‚Äôs opinions he was becoming aware of. In the Act 5 he dropped some archaisms and also several of the skomorokhs‚Äô couplets, so as to avoid the unwanted comic effect. =Sources= Ivan the Terrible by Viktor Vasnetsov, 1897 The major source for Tolstoy as he was working upon the drama (as it was with the whole trilogy) was History of the Russian State by Nikolay Karamzin. The whole of the Act 1 is based upon one small fragment in Vol.IX of it describing Ioann's feelings after the killing of his son, his relinquishing the throne, boyars' reaction to this and his consent to (as he put it) \\"bear this burden of rule for some more time\\" –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ö–∞—Ä–∞–º–∑–∏–Ω. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ, –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥., 1821, —Ç–æ–º IX, —Å—Ç—Ä. 355. Details of this fragment of History have been expanded by Tolstoy into full-blown scenes: Zakharyev addressing boyars, Ioann's musing on the possibility of taking a schema oath, his conversation with boyars. The messenger—çs tale in the Scene 2, Act 1 was based upon Karamzin's description of the Pskov siegeHistory, Vol.IX, pp 322-344 which Tolstoy has taken numerous details from, moving them together, chronologically. The Garaburda scene (exceptionally important for the play's structure, according to the author's \\"Production plan\\") has been totally made up, but again, some details involved have been taken from Karamzin (Mikhail Garaburda's negotiations with Grozny in 1573, among others). Apart from Karamzin's History Tolstoy used, albeit to a lesser extent, Tales of Prince Kurbsky, published in 1831 by N.Ustryalov. Kurbsky's letters in Scene 2, Act 1, present a mosaic of his real letters, the 1679 one featuring most prominently.–°–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏—è, –¢.2, 103-104, 128-139, 141-143 In the Act 4 the Ivan Grozny synodic text reading quotes a real document. The play's major characters are historical figures, most of the minor ones (servants, stolniks) are fictional. One notable exception is a Pskovian messenger, a figure featuring in historical chronicles. The Boyar duma members have names of real people, one exception being Sitsky, a totally fictitious part. Inaccuracies and inventions According to Tolstoy, the action of drama takes place in 1584, the year of Ioann's death. Yet, Ivan's murdering his son, the abdication, the siege of Pskov, the fire in Aleksandrovskaya sloboda all relate to the second half of 1581. Tolstoy was improvising a lot when it came to motives and undercurrents, occasionally creating links between things historians thought were unrelated. Having greatly increased the historical role of Boris Godunov, he's made him take part in several events had no bearing to. According to I.Yampolsky, Boris' speech in Duma, the clash with Sitsky, addressing Tsar Ivan on behalf of Duma asking for his return to the throne, his opposition to the monarch's marrying Princess of Hastings and unwilling support for tsarina Maria, Ivan's advise for Fyodor to always listen to what Boris would say, - were all author's artistic inventions. The idea of expanding it into a trilogy came to Tolstoy while he was working on Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich, but, as I.Yampolsky notes, The Death of Ioann the Terrible gives the impression some future development of Godunov's character already having been on author‚Äôs mind. The appearance of Mikhail Bityagovsky in the play, the figure which according to historical sources would come upon the scene many years later, could be seen as pointing to this, too. Besides, Tolstoy created new logical threads between Bityagovsky's taking part in the conflict between Boris and boyars, his agitation of people against Shuisky and Belsky - to the murder of Dmitry. Production history The Death of Ivan the Terrible was first performed at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 1867.Banham (1998, 1115) and Moser (1992, 270). It was not a success, due to the lead role having been given to a comic actor.Banham (1998, 1115). The world-famous Moscow Art Theatre began its second season with a production of the play, which opened on 29 September 1899.Benedetti (1999, 386) and Worrall (1996, 112). It was directed by the seminal theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski, who also played the lead role initially. When Stanislavski fell ill after the first few performances, he was replaced by Vsevolod Meyerhold.Braun (1995, 11) and Worrall (1996, 112). The play received its first New York production in 1904, which opened on 1 March at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway in a translation by S. R. DeMeissner.See the play's article on the IBDB and the entry for archival material on Worldcat.org. ReferencesSources * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.

The park property is now known as Black Turn Brook State Forest, owned by the State of Vermont. Map of Earth People's Park People's Park in Berkeley, California Purchase of the Norton parcel was inspired by the People's Park in Berkeley, California, with some donations for the down payment raised at the 1969 Woodstock Music & Art Festival in Bethel, NY. The Vermont parcel was purchased and managed as a non-profit trust (Earth Peoples Park Inc.), with the land deed officially recorded so as to convey the trusts' \\"ownership\\" of the land (the only real asset of the trust), to \\"all of the peoples of the earth\\". Due to land surveying errors going back to the settling of that region of the United States and Canada in the late 18th century, the 45th parallel (which was the boundary line set by treaty) actually passes through the acreage several hundred feet to the south of the present-day international boundary vista line, somewhere in the vicinity of the large hay field. History In early 1970, the partially logged area, its northern property line running along the international boundary with Canada, as well as prime Coaticook River frontage on the east, was purchased sight-unseen from a 'Strout Realty' mail-order land catalog for $38,000. Criteria included finding as large a property as cheaply as possible, with the remoteness considered a plus (fewer neighbors to bother). It was an unlikely, snow-bound, out of the way location, with little else drawing most folks to that sparsely populated corner of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, the population of all of Essex County less than 5000 residents at that time. Unlike the original People's Park in Berkeley, which is owned by the University of California, the underlying principle was that the Vermont trust land would be legally open to anyone who wished to visit, camp, or homestead upon it, rent-free for as long as one desired. The land purchase originally included a separate parcel nearer town upon which an A-frame was erected as a sort of welcoming center, access at that time was via a shared gravel driveway and through farm fields to the actual land holdings. Locally it became known as 'the last left turn(s) in America', requiring a series of unmarked left turns starting less than south of the US Customs station. Many uninformed visitors often missed the left turn, and suddenly found themselves entering Canada by mistake. In 1974, the shared access was traded for construction of a new, private road leading directly west from State Route 114. The land swap negotiated between the trust and neighboring farmers included construction of a concrete bridge crossing the Coaticook River at the southern edge of the land near Number Six Brook, that access is now known locally as Black Turn Brook Rd. Living conditions Living conditions were primitive, particularly in the early years when few permanent structures existed suitable for surviving the harsh winter environment. No utilities such as power, water or telephone ran to the land; heating and cooking was by wood, kerosene or bottled propane, and lighting by candles or kerosene lantern. Drinking and bathing water was drawn from Black Turn Brook, or directly from the Coaticook River. Winter access was particularly challenging; once off the plowed state highway, the unmaintained dirt logging trails were frequently blocked by heavy, drifting snowfall accumulations, adding a half-mile hike in from the highway, with snowshoes, toboggans and cross-country skis much-desired items. Despite the harsh environment, many people thrived both in the isolation and in their newfound ability to \\"disconnect\\" from the noise and distractions of mainstream society, with a number of winter-livable structures added as more people moved in over time. In the period of 1973‚Äì75, there were perhaps 25 year-round residents living in dispersed cabins, A-frames, canvas teepees, old school buses, geodesic domes, a 1950s vintage travel trailer, as well as an impressive 8-sided log cabin constructed by one family over the course of several years. Additional living and auxiliary structures were constructed throughout the 1980s. Warmer months traditionally saw increased visitors, such as summer solstice and fall equinox gatherings, or other word-of-mouth events. The remote location with thickly forested lands included several secluded beaver ponds, along with access to the Coaticook River, providing an idealistic, counter-culture gathering mecca during the short months of summer. Benefit concerts and gatherings took place at the property in an effort to help pay for the property taxes and mortgage payments. Legal issues leading to seizure of land by federal government As with much of society throughout the 1970‚Äì80s, demographics of park residents changed as well, with many of the earlier (i.e.: long established) 'elders' moving away due to advancing age, declining health, or other personal reasons. Some newer residents were perhaps less 'back to the land' oriented, creating at times problematic situations never envisioned by the land trust created in its vision of a 'free land with no rules' hippy utopia. Years of intensified government intelligence gathering, coupled with a series of arrests conducted by state and federal law enforcement, led to the seizure of the land by the federal government in October 1990. A pair of park residents purportedly sold ten ounces of park-grown marijuana to an undercover narcotics agent for $500. This event gave the federal government probable cause to seize the land, ultimately evicting everyone still living there, later destroying any structures on the property as well. After drug forfeiture proceedings filed in US District Court (Burlington Vt. 1990) pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Sec. 881(a)(7), the was eventually conveyed to the State of Vermont for use as publicly owned state forest lands. Originally destined for sale by the federal government, substantial unique natural resources were discovered, allowing the land to escape sale under an obscure provision in the forfeiture laws. After negotiations with the US Attorney's office state officials, including the office of then-governor Howard Dean, the Vermont Land Trust, and other agencies, an agreement was signed to give the land to the state of Vermont. This respected the park founder's original intention of \\"public\\" ownership of the land. Land turned over to State of Vermont, now Black Turn Brook State Forest On October 5, 1994, in a ceremony attended by then-Governor of Vermont Howard Dean, Wavy Gravy (Hugh Romney), Ben Cohen (of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream), along with representatives of other groups, including early park resident Laura Kross (on behalf of Earth Peoples Park Inc.), title to the property was formally transferred to the state. Video of the 1994 ceremony is available on Youtube as well as on Facebook. Today, the former park remains open to recreational visitors for hunting, fishing, and undeveloped hike-in camping activities. It is now shown on area maps as Black Turn Brook State Forest, managed by the Vermont Dept. of Forests and Parks. Presently camping and other recreational activities are permitted under Vermont's \\"primitive use\\" camping rules, however, vehicle access from the state highway is restricted, and no permanent structures are permitted. Earth Peoples Park land in Del Norte County California During the mid-1970s, the non-profit trust Earth Peoples Park Inc. also purchased a remote parcel of forest lands situated in Del Norte County, California. Located on Chrystal Mountain within Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, that piece of property apparently remains open to visitors. References=Legal references of interest= 1) 'United States v.

Although the Ardabil area is prone to numerous earthquakes and was struck by a major earthquake in 1997, the 893 event is, in fact, considered to be a \\"mistaken\\" earthquake, derived from misreadings of the original Armenian writings about the 893 earthquake in Dvin, Armenia; the Arabic name for Dvin is Dabil.  \\"Mistaken\\" earthquake  At about midnight on 28 December 893, the night after a lunar eclipse, Dvin, then the capital of Armenia, was devastated by an earthquake. Most buildings were destroyed, and at least 30,000 people died. This event was recorded by contemporary Armenian and Arabic chroniclers, including Ibn al-Jawzi. However, the Arabic name for the city is Dabil, and this led the 14th-century writer Ibn Kathir to place the earthquake in Ardabil in Azerbaijan. Ibn Kathir was then quoted by al-Suyuti in the 15th century. Further writers also placed the earthquake in Ardabil, and added some details, such as waters drying up, while changing others, such as making the eclipse preceding the earthquake solar instead of lunar.

Going On is a comedy play by Charles Dennis, set in a dressing room of a Broadway theatre. It concerns the relationship between two understudies waiting backstage during the run of a Broadway hit and hoping for their chance to go on. The characters are called Alfred and Lynn, a tribute to the legendary Lunts and the long-vanished theater they represented. The play was originally produced at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1989 and starred Charles Dennis as Alfred and Gwendolyn Humble as Lynn. It was nominated for the Daily Express Award for best new play. The Guardian wrote: \\"Robust dialogue and carefully managed shifts of mood between the comic and the sad have you constantly uncertain whether to laugh or cry.\\" The Scotsman wrote: \\"It's funny, moving and intelligent but, most of all, a celebration of what it means to be cursed by a thespian calling.\\" In 1990 Dennis played Alfred again opposite Maria O'Brien's Lynn at the Callboard Theatre in Los Angeles. In 1991, the celebrated critic Sheridan Morley wrote about a British touring production featuring Giselle Wolf as Lynn and Tim Earle as Alfred in the International Herald Tribune: \\"Let us cheer the arrival at the Latchmere in Battersea of Charles Dennis's Going On... It's a love story about two latter-day Broadway understudies, torn between a fervent desire to get onstage and a deep terror that they may suddenly be called on to do so. But 'Going On' does not only mean going on stage: It also means going on with lives that seem often hopelessly bereft of love or purpose or success. The major triumph of Dennis has been to write a very conventional odd-couple love story within the unconventional frame of understudy lives. These people are forever imitating their Hollywood and Broadway betters, because that is what they are paid to do. They also live, like Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, on the fringes of reality until they are suddenly thrown into the blazing lights, albeit as unprepared and under-rehearsed for their show as they are for their own awakening feelings of love. Having made self-absorption into an art form, having lived within the conventions of a horror movie where parents crucify themselves on satellite dishes, they lurch from Ibsen and Strindberg into Coward and Shaffer stereotypes, all the while waiting for the prompter to come to the rescue.\\" Dennis later played Alfred opposite Lane Binkley's Lynn at The National Arts Club in New York City in 1997. The play was performed again in 2011 at the Pensacola Shakespeare Theatre in Pensacola, Florida with Geraint Wyn Davies as Alfred and Claire Lautier as Lynn.

Along this path there were a number of trading posts, also called trading forts. History Reproduction of Pike's Stockade, a fortification near Sanford in Conejos County, Colorado. Built by the expedition of Zebulon Pike in 1807, the fort has been reconstructed by the Colorado Historical Society, and the site is a National Historic Landmark. In 1802, after the Spanish territory of Louisiana was given back to France through treaty in 1800, trappers began entering the Louisiana Territory and trapped beavers in the mountains. In 1803, the United States purchased the land which encompassed the present state of Colorado with the Louisiana Purchase and explorers came to the area to survey the land. The trail was an important trade route for fur trappers and traders in the North American fur trade from about 1820 and into the Pikes Peak Gold Rush beginning 1859. Trapper's Trail was first known to be used in 1820 for Stephen H. Long‚Äôs expedition. Colonel Henry Dodge used it in 1835 for the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition or First Dragoon Expedition. Trapper‚Äôs Trail was also used by John C. Fremont (1843-1844) and General Stephen W. Kearney (1845). In 1846 it was used by a group of Mormon immigrants who established a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints near the southern end of the trail. The sick detachments of the Mormon Battalion used this trail to return to the Mormon pioneers on the Mormon Trail.Trapper‚Äôs Trail information from the city of Greeley, Colorado. It was also used during the gold rush of 1859. Route description From north to south, the main legs and stops along the trail are: =Fort Laramie to Denver area = The trail starts at Fort Laramie in Wyoming, which is located along the North Platte River. The trail follows Crow Creek to the Latham, Colorado area, where it traversed along the South Platte River. Traveling along the river, four trading posts were built in the late 1830s and are located and are part of the South Platte Trail. The most northern trading post is Fort Saint Vrain. The following are: Fort Vasquez, Fort Jackson, and Fort Lupton, first called Fort Lancaster. The trail continues along the South Platte River to an area near Denver =Denver area to Colorado Springs area= Denver in 1859 There are three trails between these areas. The oldest route, runs the closest to the mountains. It follows along the East Plum, Monument and Fountain Creeks and roughly ran along what is now I-25. The Cherry Creek Trail follows Cherry Creek and runs essentially along the current Highway 83 between present day Denver and northern Colorado Springs near I-25. There are two stops along the Cherry Creek Trail. Twenty Mile House, located at the junction of Parker Road and Highway 83 in Parker, has a historical marker noting it was a stop on Trapper's Trail. California Ranch was a stage station and stockade at the junction of Highways 83 and 86 near Franktown. It also has a historical marker its role on the trail. The Jimmy Camp Trail joins the Cherry Creek Trail near the present town of Franktown, runs through Falcon, and down Highway 24. The trail runs between the Arkansas and Platte Rivers. Jimmy's Camp site (now a ghost town in El Paso County) is east of Highway 24 at Jimmy Camp Creek. The Charles Fagan Grave, also called Fagan's Grave, is about 12.5 miles due north of Falcon. =Colorado Springs area to El Pueblo= From the present Colorado Springs area to El Pueblo, the route is similar to the I-25 route. =South and east of El Pueblo= James William Abert, Bent's Fort, 1848 From El Pueblo, also called Fort Pueblo, there are two routes. One is east to Bent's Old Fort, the trading post historical site is along the Arkansas River, and the trail follows Highway 50 and the Arkansas River from Pueblo.

A sales pitch is essentially designed to be either an introduction of a product or service to an audience who knows nothing about it, or a descriptive expansion of a product or service that an audience has already expressed interest in. Sales professionals prepare and give a sales pitch, which can be either formal or informal, and might be delivered in any number of ways. Elements=First impression= Billy Mays was well known for his sales pitches on American television The first visual and audible impression upon a market or client can appeal any of the five senses in order to initiate excellent chemistry between the buyer and seller. A way of luring in the potential candidate to ensure the overall advertisement is emphasized. Not necessarily an exchange of currency must be made but an official deal of trade or contract is desired from the pitching party. With a wide variety of selling techniques used to \\"pitch\\", it is possible to apply one or a combination in a single attempt. Inspired by what has worked in the past from successful contributors to the art of the pitch, at least a slight modification is always required in order for it to be an authentic and most of all an effective pitch, otherwise the tone would not fit the sellers outfit and in critical situations be spotted as a fake by the candidate and in such a case defying the purpose. For a strikingly good pitch, one must know exactly what the other party wants and doesn't want. Be informed of as much information as possible about the candidate being pitched to. Focus on a virtual balance of the candidate's needs and wants to maximize one's leverage when in the process of a pitch. Overall meaning: one gets only one chance to make a good first impression. At least two senses must connect: vision, and hearing. But the more one can connect at a single point of impact, the better.Endorsements: How Sports Stars Get Inside Your Head by Dan Peterson (January 12, 2009) livescience.com Beginning statement Usually the first sentence of a sales pitch is supposed to be either an attention-grabbing statement or a positive statement introducing the best information about the provider of goods or service. A method is usually selected depending on available attention span from the prospective client. There are certain groups with a lower attention span (for example children) for whom a sales pitch must capture their attention within the first few seconds to be effective. Frequently used methods for this are beginning a talk with a surprising or even shocking statement which the targets then stay to see the conclusion of. Normally people with children, shopkeepers, and people in a hurry are not able to give much attention especially if the explanation is not immediately intriguing or it is in broken English. Sellers of low-value, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are usually known to deploy the first method. In the second strategy, 'positive statement begins' is adopted in solution selling usually in direct selling to corporate and or high value and or capital goods selling. Here, the purpose of the positive statement is to emphasize a particular positive aspect of a provider to brand it according to seller's situational need.

Hunt's Hill was located in the Sierra Nevada foothills about 6 miles in a straight line southeast of Nevada City and about 2 miles northwest of You Bet, on the north side of Greenhorn Creek, not far from the present intersection of Red Dog and Buckeye Roads. Hunt's Hill was founded in 1852 by a miner named Hunt. It was located on one of the deepest parts of the rich Blue Lead channel of gold-bearing gravel.Clark, William B., Gold Districts of California, (1970), p. 115; MacBoyle, Errol, Mines and Mineral Resources of Nevada County, (1918), p. 65. In 1855, one of the mining claims established by some French miners, was ‚Äújumped\\". During the fight, one of the French miners lost an eye. Thereafter, that mine, and sometimes the town, were called Gouge Eye. By 1857, the town boasted two saloons, a hotel, a blacksmith and stable, a butcher shop, a boot and shoe store, and several grocery stores.Nevada Journal, Oct. 23, 1857. In 1858, a stage line from Nevada City arrived.Nevada Journal, June 25, 1858. In 1866, seven cement mills for extracting gold from the ‚Äúblue cement‚Äù were operating in the area.Raymond, Rossiter W., Statistics of Mines and Mining in the States and Territories West of the Rocky Mountains, (1872), p. 466. By 1880, the town was reduced to a combined store and saloon and a few houses.

As The Economist points out, solar energy is a logical development since \\"Israel is a country with plenty of sunshine, lots of sand and quite a few clever physicists and chemists.\\" Solar energy in Israel; It's a knockout, Jul 23rd 2009, The Economist print edition Process Traditional photovoltaic cells are made from thin sheets of silicon covered by glass plates. In the GreenSun process, it is only the outer edges of the glass plates that are covered by thin strips of silicon. The physicists and chemists at GreenSun, led by Renata Reisfeld, coat the glass with metallic nanoparticles and dyes to cause the sunlight falling on the glass to diffuse sideways toward the edges where the silicon strips turn it into electricity. A mixture of dyes is used to capture and absorb a wide spectrum of available light. Having absorbed the sunlight, the fluorescent dyes then re-radiate it. Interaction with the metallic nanoparticles turns light into a form of electromagnetic radiation known as surface plasmons. The surface plasmons propagate over the glass surface and are intercepted by the silicon strips at the edges. The company would not reveal which metals are used in the process. Because the process uses less silicon, it is far less expensive than conventional photovoltaic modules. It is also more efficient. In a conventional photovoltaic cell, much of the sun's energy is lost as heat because the energy of light varies across the spectrum (red light is less energetic than blue, for example). Only a particular amount of energy is needed to knock an electron free from the silicon atoms. If the sunlight is more energetic than necessary, more energy than usual is lost as heat. Sunlight scatters its energy, but the dye/nanoparticle mix in the GreenSun process delivers plasmons and photons of the right energy to knock electrons free more efficiently. Economics GreenEnergy CEO Amnon Leikovich claims that the process, once put into production, could deliver electricity at about double the cost of a conventional power station. Traditional photovoltaic modules deliver electricity at about five times the cost of a conventional power plant. Leikovich hopes that costs can be brought down even further. According to corporate spokesmen Eitan Shmueli, GreenSun's photovoltaic panels are capable of producing electricity from low-intensity sunlight on cloudy days and from sunlight that reaches them from any angle. The company claims that can turn the windows or walls of buildings into electricity-generating photovoltaic panels.New tech could coat buildings in efficient solar-energy panels, Avi Bar-Eli, HaAretz, July 30, 2009 ReferencesExternal links *Green Sun Energy company website *Audio interview with Renata Reisfeld, CTO and Chief Scientist Photovoltaics manufacturers Manufacturing companies of Israel Solar energy in Israel Renewable energy technology companies Companies based in Jerusalem Israeli brands ","title":"GreenSun Energy"},{"id":"23841278","text":"Das Ende des 20.

The crescent consists of elegant stuccoed terraced houses by the architect John Nash, which form a semicircle. The crescent is part of Nash's and wider town-planning visions of Roman-inspired imperial West End approaches to Regent's Park. It was originally conceived as a circus (circle) to be named Regent's Circus but instead Park Square was built to the north. The only buildings on the Regent's Park side of the square are small garden buildings, enabling higher floors of the Park Crescent buildings to have a longer, green northern view. It was built under the patronage of the Prince Regent. As the freeholder, the Crown Estate co-organises repairs, maintains the gardens and has a minor, overarching interest, entitled to lease renewal premiums and any agreed ground rents. Both terraces and the communal garden have statutory protection in the highest, rarest categories. This is Grade I listed status: on the National Heritage List for England and on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens (as part of Regent's Park). History At an early stage, Nash proposed the construction of a \\"circus\\" (meaning a circular development), entailing another crescent to the north, but Park Square was constructed instead. Work on Park Crescent started in 1806, but in the difficult economic conditions of the Napoleonic Wars, the builder Charles Mayor went bankrupt after six houses had been built. It was completed only in 1819 to 1821.page 183, John Nash A complete catalogue, Michael Mansbridge, 1991, Phaidon Press Famous residents in the nineteenth century included Lord Lister, who, prior to his elevation to the peerage was created a baronet, of Park Crescent in the Parish of St Marylebone in the County of Middlesex. The interiors of the buildings have been completely rebuilt. After the Second World War, Park Crescent was in poor condition (as were other Nash terraces near Regent's Park). The Gorell Report on the future of the Regent's Park terraces recommended that the facades of Park Crescent should be saved. They were restored in the 1960s when the leases came up for renewal, and they are protected as grade I listed buildings. However, behind the curve of the crescent, the Crown Estate built new structures. Interior features which are visible from the street, such as light fittings, have to respect the Regency design of the facade. Recently terraces have co-housed institutions such as International Students House, London and the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. Many houses are now converted into expensive flats.Park Crescent, London W1 ‚Äî House prices. Garden The semicircle is divided into two halves by Portland Place. Between the arms of the crescent is a private garden, which is recognised as being of historic interest.

The garden is opened each year as part of the London Open Garden Squares Weekend, an initiative of the London Parks & Gardens Trust.

The Act was based on the report of the Davies Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury, created after the Court of Appeal decision in the case of Cartledge v Jopling, and the Committee notably produced their final report before Cartledge had been heard in the House of Lords. The draft bill was presented to Parliament on 6 May 1963; it was given the Royal Assent on 31 July and came into force on the same day. The act allowed an injured party to bring a claim outside the normal statute of limitations period if he could show that he was not aware of the injuries himself until after the limitation period had expired and if he gained the permission of the court. After a series of problems emerged, including vagueness on a point even the House of Lords was unable to clarify and poor draftsmanship, the Act was repealed bit by bit during the 1970s, with the Limitation Act 1980 scrapping the last remaining sections. Background Before the passing of the 1963 Act, the only exceptions to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake.Dworkin (1964) p.47 In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd[1963] 1 All E.R. 341 the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills.Patten (2006) p.351 The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action.Jolowicz (1964) p.199 Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case. Cartledge pursued the claim anyway in an attempt to have the law changed, and decisions were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords.Dworkin (1964) p.48 The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately. Act The Act created exceptions to the normal statute of limitations in addition to the previous ones of fraud and mistake. It introduced an exception if 1) the permission of the court had been gained to bring a case and 2) the \\"material facts\\" of the case included \\"facts of a decisive character\\" which the claimant was not aware of until after the expiry of the statute of limitations. Where these two requirements were fulfilled, a case could be brought as long as it was within twelve months of the claimant finding out the \\"facts of a decisive character\\". The same principles applied if the injured party were dead and the claim was being brought on behalf of his estate or dependants.Jolowicz (1964) p.200 If leave was refused to open a case, the decision could be appealed up to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, but no further. These provisions covered both Cartledge-like situations and cases where the injured party, while aware of his injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until more than three years after the injuries were sustained. The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought.Jolowicz (1964) p.201 If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself. Problem and repeal The main problem with the Act was whether or not the claimant had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply. The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd[1972] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 413 but \\"failed spectacularly\\", making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board[1974] 2 All E.R. 441 said they could not actually find a ratio decidendi anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having \\"a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book\\".Patten (2006) p.366 The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections., pp. 1038-39 ReferencesBibliography 1963 in law United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1963 Statutes of limitations Repealed United Kingdom Acts of Parliament ","title":"Limitation Act 1963"},{"id":"23841404","text":"The German Imperial Admiralty Staff () was one of four command agencies for the administration of the Imperial German Navy from 1899 to 1918. While the German Emperor Wilhelm II as commander-in-chief exercised supreme operational command and control of the naval forces, the military staff was split into the Admiralty, the Naval Office, the Naval Cabinet, and the Inspector-General. The command structure had a negative impact on German naval warfare in World War I, as a professional head of the Imperial Navy, similar to the First Sea Lord, was not established until August 1918. After the war and the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, the Admiralty Staff became subordinate to the Naval Office and was finally disestablished by order of the German President.  History  After the German unification of 1871, a united Imperial Navy was established as successor of the Prussian Navy and the North German Federal Navy, from 1 January 1872 under the authority of the German Imperial Admiralty (Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t) led by Minister of State Albrecht von Stosch. With the accession of Emperor Wilhelm II in 1888, the naval forces strongly gained in importance. Soon after, the command structure was reorganized with the establishment of the Imperial Naval Cabinet, the German Imperial Naval High Command (Kaiserliches Oberkommando der Marine) and the Naval Office, from 1897 under State Secretary Alfred von Tirpitz. In the course of the Anglo-German naval arms race, the Reichstag parliament in 1898 passed a new Naval Law, according to which the High Command was, on 14 March 1899, replaced by the Admiralty Staff responsible for planning, officer training, and naval intelligence. In time of war the Admiralty Staff was to assume overall command of the Imperial Navy, although in peacetime it acted only in an advisory capacity. Direct control of the various elements of the fleet was subordinated to officers commanding those elements, accountable to the Kaiser.Herwig p.22 This reorganization suited Wilhelm II, who wanted to maintain direct control of his ships. A disadvantage was that it split apart the integrated military command structure, which before had balanced the importance of the navy within overall defense considerations. It also suited Tirpitz, because it removed the influence of the admiralty staff from naval planning, but it left him the possibility, in wartime, to reorganise command around himself. Wilhelm II, however, never agreed to relinquish direct control of his fleet.Herwig p.22-23  Chiefs of the Admiralty Staff  (Chefs des Admiralstabs der Kaiserlichen Marine)  References  * Imperial German Navy Staff (military) 1899 establishments in Germany 1918 disestablishments in Germany ","title":"German Imperial Admiralty Staff"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/18.md","filePath":"people/18.md"}'),D={name:"people/18.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,N as default};
