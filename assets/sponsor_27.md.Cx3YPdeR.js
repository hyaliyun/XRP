He made his first on screen appearance on 3 April 1991. Sam remained in Home and Away until 2001. He later returned for brief stints in 2002 and 2005. Casting Clark was seven years old when he secured the role of Sam in 1991. He was only allowed to film Home and Away for three days a week, so he could attend school during the remaining days. Clark was provided with a tutor on set so he could keep up with his schoolwork. In 1996, Clark broke his ankle while playing rugby and was forced to use crutches for six weeks. He returned to filming straight away and producers decided to write his ailment into the scripts; this results in Sam breaking his ankle while playing football. Clark decided to leave the serial in 2000 in order to pursue a surfing career. He returned to the role in 2001. In 2005, Clark reprised the role alongside several past cast members to celebrate the serial's 4000th episode. Character development Sam was introduced into the serial as a foster child of Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). His father, Greg Marshall (Ross Newton) is later introduced into the series and goes onto marry Bobby. However, Bobby dies in a boating accident and Greg abandons him. Sam is subsequently fostered by Pippa (Debra Lawrance) and Michael Ross (Dennis Coard). Sam features in the serial's 1996 \\"disaster\\" storyline in which a storm passes through Summer Bay. Sam is washed into a river and Michael dies after attempting to save him. A columnist for MSN online described the character's tenure stating that \\"with basically everyone parental in his life either dying or skipping town, Sam was moved between families like a young pass-the-parcel.\\" When Pippa departs the series, Sam is placed in Rebecca (Belinda Emmett) and Travis Nash's (Nic Testoni) care. The official Home and Away website stated that Sam's personality changed during this period. He becomes \\"very prickly and rebellious\\". Rebecca and Travis cannot cope with a \\"restless teenager's behaviour\\" and send him to live with Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn). After several years apart, Sam arranges a reunion with Greg. However, Sam is left feeling betrayed and disappointed when Greg fails to show up. Sam returns home to his guardian Donald and he hopes for some comforting words from him, but Donald cannot bring himself to open up. A writer for Inside Soap said Sam and Donald \\"really need to share their feelings and comfort each other\\", but neither one wants to make the first move. In 1998, Jason Herbison from Inside Soap reported that Rebecca O'Dare had signed up to play Sam's new love interest Pam Edmondson. He added that the storyline was scheduled to last a \\"couple of weeks\\" and would not really develop much. In another storyline Sam begins a relationship with Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright). Their relationship takes \\"a battering\\" and he turns into a \\"green-eyed monster\\" when Hayley becomes friends with Mitch McColl (Cameron Welsh). Sam ends his relationship with Hayley because of Mitch. The serial's website also stated that Sam and Hayley \\"had so much in common\\" and \\"were good mates apart from anything else\\". When Clark quit the series in 2000, producers devised an exit storyline which saw Sam entering a surf competition. Donald then gives his permission to let Sam join a pro surfing tour to pursue his \\"true calling\\". When Sam returns in 2002, he reveals that he has become successful on the professional surfing circuit. Storylines Sam is fostered Bobby after his mother Jackie (Erica Williams) struggles to look after him. Sam and Bobby bond but it is short- lived when Jackie gets a new job and returns to collect Sam. After Jackie struggles to cope with Sam again and he goes missing, Bobby permanently fosters him. Sam's father Greg arrives in the bay but Bobby refuses to let him see Sam and they battle over his custody. Bobby relents and grows closer to Greg and they fall in love eventually marry. Bobby decides to adopt Sam. Bobby dies in a boating accident caused by family friend Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson). Sam blames Adam and Greg can no longer cope with Sam and abandons him. Sam is later fostered by Pippa and Michael and has minimal contact with Greg for several years. Sam is generally happy with the Rosses but Michael dies during a flood trying to rescue Sam. Both Sam and Jack Wilson (Daniel Amalm), blame themselves for Michael's death. Following Pippa's departure with her new husband, Ian Routledge (Patrick Dickson) to the Carrington ranges in 1998, Sam cannot get used to his new carers Travis and Rebecca and becomes rebellious. Sam is involved in illegal activities with Rod Sutton (Nick Atkinson) and are both arrested. Sam appears in court and is given a good behaviour bond after Donald gives him a character reference. Donald suggests Sam live with him and he moves out of Summer Bay House. When Hayley arrives in town she and Sam forge a very tight friendship and get into various scrapes. They begin dating in late 1999, but three becomes a crowd when Mitch is interested in Hayley. Hayley and Sam eventually break up. Greg reappears in Sam's life and he is keen to rebuild their relationship but Sam opts to stay in Summer Bay. Sam later drops out of school and leaves the bay to become a professional surfer against Donald's wishes. Sam returns several months later and has resumes a small fling with Hayley. His behaviour is suspicious and it is revealed Sam is smoking marijuana following his failure as surfer. This comes to a head when Sam crashes his car while high. Sam later leaves but returns and becomes involved with a girl called Sandy King (Renee Hodson) who has a daughter, Bella from a previous relationship. They later leave the bay and relocate to the city. Sam returns the following year for Summer Bay's sesquicentennial celebrations and in 2005 for Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) 60th birthday. Reception Chad Watson & Linda Barnier of The Newcastle Herald said that it was \\"no wonder\\" Clark quit the series because Sam was \\"the product of a broken home whose foster mother died after marrying his birth father\\". They also noted that the older Clark grew on-screen the bigger his \\"female fanbase\\" grew. Glenn Wheeler of The Morning Show opined that Sam formed a part of one of Australian television's \\"much loved families\\" for a decade. Sam was popular with teenage female demographic, who would tune into the show daily to watch the character. While the role gave Clark \\"sex symbol\\" status, he said \\"I got more shit from the boys, than praise from the girls back then.\\" MSN online's columnist opined that Clark played \\"one of Australia's very own '90s teen heartthrobs\\".

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 June 1989. He was initially portrayed by Allana Ellis, with actor Lewis Devaney taking over the role from 1990 to 1998. Brendan McKensy assumed the role in 1998 until Duncan's departure in 2001. McKensy later reprised the role in 2004 and 2005 and made his last appearance on 13 July 2005. The character was reintroduced on 19 July 2016, with Benedict Wall cast in the role. Duncan is the son of Ailsa (Judy Nunn) and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). His 2016 reappearance marked the first time in 27 years that he, Alf and his half- sister Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) had been on-screen together. During his time in Summer Bay, Duncan befriends Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee), becoming a love rival for Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor). Casting The character was initially portrayed by Allana Ellis. Lewis Devaney took over the role in 1990 and remained until 1998. The role was then recast to Brendan McKensy. McKensy returned for the serial's 4000th episode, based around Duncan's father Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) 60th birthday, broadcast in Australia on 8 July 2005. Development Actor Benedict Wall (pictured) took over the role of Duncan when the character was reintroduced in 2016. The character departed in 2001. Duncan left Summer Bay in \\"disgrace\\" to live with his aunt Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) in the city. Duncan's father Alf initially refused Duncan's request to leave town, so Morag encouraged Duncan to act up, leaving Alf with no other option but to send him away. Duncan \\"throws himself into the task with gusto\\" and began insulting people. When his half-sister Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) tried to talk to him about his behaviour, Duncan claimed their mother Ailsa (Judy Nunn) never loved her. Alf was \\"furious\\" when he heard what happened and confronted Duncan, who finally admitted that he was unhappy in the Bay because no one liked him. Alf then gave his permission for his son to move to the city. The character returned on 19 July 2016 with New Zealand actor Benedict Wall cast in the role. Wall originally auditioned for the role of Justin Morgan, but the part went to James Stewart. Wall was in New Zealand when the role of Duncan became available. He sent an audition tape to the producers and they offered him the part. Of his casting, Wall said \\"It wasn't lost on me that I wasn't from the right part of the world when I got the job. But you know what's funny is when I'm with Ray, I'm always surprised at how much we do seem alike.\\" Wall worked on his Australian accent, but as the character has been living in the United States, it did not need to be too thick. Shortly after Alf suffers health problems and decides to cut Duncan out of his will, Duncan comes to visit him, but does not receive a warm welcome. Duncan's return marked the first time in 27 years that he, Alf and his half- sister Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) have been on screen together. Duncan also befriends Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) and develops \\"an immediate connection\\" with her, but ends up competing with Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) for her affections. Wall had worked with Pryor before they were cast in the show, and he quipped, \\"now we're competing for the same woman.\\" Storylines Duncan is born to Alf and Ailsa. After his aunt Celia (Fiona Spence) dresses him in the Stewart family's traditional christening gown, he suffers an allergic reaction to it and is hospitalised. Duncan recovers, but Ailsa experiences post-natal depression and nearly smothers him at one point. Ailsa soon begins to bond with him. As Duncan grows older, he befriends Christopher Fletcher (Shaun Wood) and has several surrogate siblings in the form of Blake (Les Hill) and Karen Dean (Belinda Jarrett), Simon Fitzgerald (Richard Norton), Sarah Thompson (Laura Vasquez), Curtis Reed (Shane Ammann) and Aaron Welles (Ritchie Gudgeon), teenagers whom his parents foster. While following some of the local teenagers who are hanging out in some wasteland, Duncan suffers a fall and injures himself. He is hospitalised for several months and when he returns home, his personality drastically changes. When Duncan starts high school his behaviour gets worse as he frequently causes trouble. One incident includes the making of a homemade bomb with his friend Jack, who burns himself in the process. Alf experiences a shock when the bomb goes off and injures his arm. The Stewarts attend counselling mediated by Natalie Nash (Antoinette Byron). On a car journey with Ailsa, Duncan drops a tape and tries to retrieve it. Ailsa loses control of the car and it crashes into a lake. Duncan is able to free himself and calls for help. Travis Nash (Nic Testoni) is on the scene and rescues Ailsa, but she remains comatose for several weeks. Duncan blames himself for the accident. The doctors inform Alf and Duncan that Ailsa may never wake up and Alf decides to turn the machine off, but Duncan notices Ailsa make a slight movement and tells the doctors not to turn the machine off. When homeless teen Mitch McColl (Cameron Welsh) saves Duncan's life, he is grateful and offers him food from the Stewart house. Alf finds out and soon he and Ailsa agree to let Mitch live with them and Mitch and Duncan form a sibling-like bond. Nick Smith (Chris Egan) settles in Summer Bay with his family and he and Duncan quickly become friends and get into various scrapes. The Sutherland family arrive and Duncan and Nick are attracted to the two youngest daughters, Jade (Kate Garven) and Kirsty (Christie Hayes) and begin dating them respectively. Ailsa dies of a heart attack, causing Duncan's behaviour to worsen and his relationship with Alf suffers. Duncan's friends soon lose patience with him and Jade breaks up with him. Duncan spirals further out of control when he learns that Jade is dating David Barclay and sets a bomb up in his letterbox which backfires badly. After Duncan steals from the Diner and destroys Nick's games console, Alf is at his wits' end. Duncan's aunt Morag Bellingham returns to town and sees how unhappy he is. Duncan later tells her he wants to move to the city with her. Alf is reluctant to let Duncan go, but relents in the end and he leaves with Morag. Duncan returns to Summer Bay three years later on the night of Robbie Hunter (Jason Smith) and Hayley Smith's (Bec Cartwright) combined 17th and 21st birthday parties. His presence proves an irritation for his late cousin Alan's son Seb Miller (Mitch Firth) who is now dating Jade. Duncan is later revealed to have a drug habit and begins hanging around with Jade and they get high on bulbs. At the party, Duncan steals Robbie's car keys and involves Jade in a drag race. Seb tries to put a stop to it and jumps on the bonnet, but a drug-addled Duncan keeps driving. Jade and Seb are left injured and Duncan is unscathed. Duncan is arrested, but with the legal representation of Morag, he avoids all charges. Once Jade and Seb leave the Bay after the accident, Alf and Morag try to get Duncan to settle back in and send him to Summer Bay High, where he is unpopular. He antagonises Robbie and Kim Hyde (Chris Hemsworth) and begins harassing Tasha Andrews (Isabel Lucas) when he learns that her biological mother was the late Angie Russell (Laurie Foell). After pulling a gun on Kim and Robbie, Duncan leaves to join his half-sister, Roo (Justine Clarke; Georgie Parker) in New York City. Duncan later contacts Alf with the news that Roo has been involved in a car crash and is in a critical condition. Alf flies out to join them. The following year, Duncan returns to Summer Bay for Alf's 60th birthday party along with a number of other relatives. He is reluctant to approach Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), his former uncle and Seb's grandfather. Duncan then apologises for all the grief he caused Seb. During the party, Duncan tries to get closer to Alf, but feels ignored and leaves the party early, taking a bottle of wine with him. After the party, Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright) is killed in a car crash and Duncan is accused by Alf when he resurfaces several days later. Detective Peter Baker (Nicholas Bishop) tells Duncan the paint taken from his car does not match the one found on Chloe's. Although Alf is relieved, Duncan is hurt and angry. After a talk with Alf, Duncan reveals that Roo's accident helped him put things in perspective and he has changed as person. Duncan returns to the United States after repairing his relationship with his father. A few years, later Duncan gets married and Alf flies overseas for a week to attend the wedding, but they fall out over his wife, Caroline, and barely speak afterwards. Roo contacts Duncan to tell him that Alf has had a stroke and that he has removed Duncan from his will. Eleven years later, Duncan (now played by Benedict Wall) returns to the Bay to see Roo and patch things up with Alf. He meets Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee) by the pool and they talk about their problems. That night, Duncan comes to Summer Bay House to see Alf and Roo, but Alf walks away. Duncan catches up with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) and Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons), but Alf initially refuses to listen or talk to him. He later seeks Duncan out and they come to a truce. Over lunch, Duncan tells Roo and Alf that he has a five-year- old son called Bryce. Alf is angered that Duncan did not tell him sooner and throws him out of the house when Duncan mentions the will. Duncan returns to explain that shortly after he got his pilots license, he discovered Caroline had been having an affair. They broke up and she took Bryce to live in Hawaii. He did not want to tell Alf about his son and divorce, as he felt like a failure. Alf and Duncan reconcile. Duncan and Tori spend more time together and when he learns her 30th birthday is coming up, he offers to fly Tori, her brothers and their friends to a vineyard for the day. During the flight, Duncan and the passengers pass out due to a carbon monoxide leak and the plane crashes. They all survive, but Tori's brother Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood) is missing. Duncan, Tori and Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) leave the others to search for him. They later encounter Justin Morgan (James Stewart) and together they find and rescue Brody. Duncan is reunited with Roo and Alf at the hospital. Duncan eventually flies out to Hawaii be with Caroline when she hurts herself. In 2018, Caroline dies and Alf and Roo fly to the US to attend the funeral. Reception For his portrayal of Duncan, McKensy was nominated for Best Young Actor at the 1999 Inside Soap Awards.

It was a short-range (60–70 kilometer) tactical reconnaissance system and had low-level flight capability. The Tu-143 was truck-launched with JATO boosting, recovered by parachute, and powered by a TR3-117 turbojet with 5.8 kN (590 kgf, 267 lbf) thrust. The initial version carried film cameras, but later versions carried a TV or radiation detection payload, with data relayed to a ground station over a datalink. Some 950 units were produced in the 1970s and 1980s. The Tu-143 was used by Syria in reconnaissance missions over Israel and Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War, as well as by Soviet forces in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.

Garde-Infanterie-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed on May 18, 1915.4\\\\. Garde-Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. It was a division of the Prussian Guards and hence recruited from all over the Kingdom of Prussia. The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of regular infantry divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 5th Guards Infantry Brigade was transferred from the 3rd Guards Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 5th Foot Guards and the 5th Guard Grenadiers. The 93rd Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 1st Guards Reserve Division. Combat chronicle After formation, the division entered the line north of Przasnysz, where it remained until July 1915. It then participated in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive, breaking through at Przasnysz and fighting in the follow-on battles to the lower Narew and then to the upper Narew. Continuing the offensive, it crossed the Neman River in September 1915 and fought in the Battle of Vilnius. The division then went into reserve and was transferred to the Western Front. It arrived in the trenchlines in Flanders and the Artois in October and remained there until the end of the year. After four months in reserve, it returned to the line in Flanders and the Artois in April 1916. It fought in the Battle of the Somme until November 1916, and then remained in the line on the Somme until March 1917. The division then fought in the Battle of Arras and remained in the line in Flanders and the Artois until September 1917, when it entered the Battle of Passchendaele. In 1918, it participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). It remained in the line until July, when it went to a quieter sector in Lorraine to rest. In late July and August, it fought in the Second Battle of the Marne. It remained in the line until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as a first class fighting division.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 88-91.

A person with artistic control has the authority to decide how the final product will appear. In movies, this commonly refers to the authority to decide on the final cut. When a director does not have artistic control, the studio that is producing the project commonly has the final say on production. When dealing with numeric values, artistic (or creative) control usually refers to the commanding portion of an executive deal or contract, so a share such as 51% and 49%, respectively, for shareholders or stocks would denote the shareholder with 51% as having control. 50 and 50 percent share an equal commanding portion, and so must come to terms on both sides.

He first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 30 October 2000 and departed on 12 September 2002. Storylines Jude is the elder of two sons born to Jill Lawson (Tracy Mann). After his father walked out on them when he was 12, Jill became obsessed with religion and believed both Jude and his younger brother, Noah (Beau Brady) were possessed by demons. Jude left home at 16 and dropped out of high school. He returned for Noah when he was old enough to take responsibility. Jude began his own cleaning business in order to support them while attending night classes at TAFE in order to achieve a legal degree. Jude is first seen when he plans to start a surf shop only to learn that it has been leased to Alf (Ray Meagher) and Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn) as the new diner. Jude meets Ailsa's daughter Shauna Bradley (Kylie Watson) and they begin spending time together. It seems as at first that Shauna is trying to avoid her ex-boyfriend Harry Reynolds (Justin Melvey) but she feels the same as Jude. When Ailsa dies, Jude supports Shauna in her grief. Holly Loader (Clare Flanaghan), Jude's ex- girlfriend arrives in Summer Bay and he is shocked when he learns that She and Noah had slept together while they were going out. Jude is incensed and throws Noah out but later comes to realise that Holly took advantage of Noah and sends her packing. Just as Jude rebuilds his relationship with his brother, Noah descends into alcoholism and Jill returns. Jill tries to influence Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright) with her beliefs and Jude, Noah and Hayley's guardian Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) are concerned. It becomes apparent that Jill is in need of psychological help and Jude and Noah agree to forgive her after she leaves to get help. When Irene is hassled by a group of thugs working for property developer Dennis Scott, Jude steps in and able to fight them off. Jude's quickness with his fists lands him in trouble when he is accused of beating up Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell), one of Shauna's students. Jude is later cleared of any wrongdoing when it emerges Kane's brother, Scott (Nathaniel Dean) is the culprit. After Shauna is kidnapped by Scott, Jude rescues her and he asks her to move in with him. Shauna turns down his offer but proposes to him and he accepts Anna Miller, one of Jude's cleaning employees, dies of cancer and Jude offers her son Seb (Mitch Firth) a place to live. Jude makes another new friend in new counsellor and doctor, Flynn Saunders (Martin Dingle-Wall). When Noah and Seb suspect that Flynn and Shauna are having an affair, Jude is shocked and confronts Flynn. Shauna tells Jude that she made a pass at Flynn and he turned her down. Jude ride off on his motorbike in a rage and crashes, suffering severe injuries. Flynn and trainee doctor, Charlotte Adams (Stephanie Chaves-Jacobsen) battle to save him and are successful. Shauna leaves town and Jude is left feeling down. He makes a pass at Gypsy Nash (Kimberley Cooper), which neither of them take very seriously. When Charlotte becomes Jude's new neighbour, they become very close and he supports her during her trauma with abusive boyfriend Steve Kent and helps Charlotte look after her grandmother, Gladys (Moya O’Sullivan), who is suffering from Alzheimer's. After developing feelings for one another, Jude and Charlotte become a couple and when Charlotte falls pregnant with twins, Jude is shocked. He confides in Noah that he likes Charlotte but doesn't love her. Charlotte is prepared to raise the babies alone until Jude tells her he is committed to her. Charlotte miscarries and the couple hold a memorial service with their friends present. Jude's world is then rocked when Shauna returns to the Bay to help care for Alf, who has recently suffered a heart attack. Jude still realises he has feelings for Shauna and she is still in love with him. Jude breaks the news to Charlotte and an angry Noah and he leaves with Shauna to go to Melbourne. When Charlotte nearly drowns several months later, she sees a vision of Jude under and begins asking for him while in hospital. Josh West (Daniel Collopy), who rescued Charlotte, arranges for a helicopter to fly Jude to the bay. Jude notices Charlotte is suffering from delusions, believing that they are still a couple and the twins are still alive. Jude goes along with this and remains at Charlotte's side, shortly before she dies of complications following her accident. Jude learns that Charlotte has not changed her will following their split and inherits her entire estate including a large sum that one of her patients left her. With Alf's help, Jude uses the funds to finance an orphanage in Vietnam, where Charlotte had planned to go to work before she died. Jude then leaves to return to Shauna in Melbourne.

They then became the Toronto Ontarios. The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams from Toronto, Ontario because there wasn't an arena in the city that was large enough to sustain a franchise. In 1911, a new arena was being built in Toronto and a franchise was awarded to the Toronto Hockey Club, and a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club applied for a second franchise. The Tecumsehs bought a franchise from Ambrose O'Brien, paying 500 cash and promissory notes for 2,000. The Tecumsehs were put on the NHA schedule for the 1911-12 season with no home games scheduled until late in January, when the arena was expected to be completed. Because of construction delays, it soon became clear that the arena would not be ready in time, and both Toronto teams were removed from the schedule, leaving the NHA with only four teams for the season. Before the 1912-13 season started, O'Brien said that he never received the balance of the franchise fee from the Tecumseh backers, so he re-sold the franchise to a group headed by W.J. Bellingham from Montreal. Goaltender Billy Nicholson, formerly with Montreal Hockey Club, was appointed player-manager-captain. The team he put together included future hall-of-famer George McNamara and his brother, Howard McNamara. Teddy Oke, who would go on to be one of the founders of the Canadian Professional Hockey League in 1926, was also on the team. They played their first game on December 28, 1912 against the Montreal Wanderers at the arena, which would soon become known as Arena Gardens. The visiting Wanderers won 7-4 in front of 5,000 fans. Paid attendance of 4,339 and gate receipts of 3,040 both set short-lived Toronto hockey records. The Tecumsehs got off to a good start, but at the end of the season were in last place in the six-team NHA in with seven wins and 13 losses. Bellingham sold the bankrupt club to Tom Wall, who renamed the team the Toronto Ontarios.

During peacetime the regiment was garrisoned in Spandau. With the outbreak of World War I, the regiment (as part of the 5th Guard Infantry Brigade) was transferred to the 3rd Guard Infantry Division of the Guards Reserve Corps. The regiment participated in the invasion of Belgium in August 1914; in late August the Guard Reserve Corps was transferred to the eastern theater of the war and the regiment took part in fighting in Poland, Russia and then later Lithuania. It was during this time that the regiment acquired the nickname \\"The White Devils\\" from the Russian because of the unit's distinctive white braid (Litzen). In May 1915 the 5th Guard Infantry Brigade was used to form the new 4th Guard Infantry Division. This division would become one of the German army's best, and the regiment would find itself engaged in some of the most significant battles of the war. From November 1915 until the end of the war it fought on the western front, namely on the Somme, Arras, Flanders, and during the Spring Offensive of 1918. During the war, just over 4,000 men of the regiment were killed. Commanders during the war were Oberst von Hülsen, Oberstleutnant von Radowitz and Major von Kriegsheim. In 1919, the last remaining soldiers of the regiment formed the \\"Detachement Maltzan\\", a Freikorps ready for use in the Baltic. In Spandau there is a memorial in memory of the killed soldiers of the 5th Foot Guards.

The parish is on the county border with Somerset and includes the hamlets of Huntenhull Green, Short Street and Thoulstone. The village lies about from each of three towns: southwest of Westbury, northwest of Warminster, and east of Frome (in Somerset). Features The village High Street is a section of the A3098 between Westbury and Frome and is some 2 km long. Near the centre of the village are the village school and the Anglican parish church. The parish includes the site of Thoulstone Park Golf Club and Hotel, which closed in 2001 and (as of 2016) awaits refurbishment or redevelopment. The site has been used for events such as the Sunrise Celebration. History The civil parish of Chapmanslade was established in 1934 from parts of Corsley, Dilton Marsh and Upton Scudamore parishes. Prior to this, the village High Street formed the boundary between Corsley (historically part of Warminster) and Dilton Marsh (historically part of Westbury). The name Chapmanslade has referred to the village since the 14th century at least. A was a travelling merchant or pedlar, and a was a valley or glade. The principal local industries were weaving and agriculture, but the employment profile of the village is now very similar to Southern England generally. Religious sites Church of St Philip & St James The Church of England parish church of St Philip and St James was built in 1866-7 to designs of G.E. Street, in the Gothic Revival style. The interior has its original fittings, designed by Street and of high quality, with stained glass by Clayton and Bell. Originally a chapel of ease to Dilton Marsh church, the district was transferred to Corsley ecclesiastical parish in 1924, which now forms part of the Cley Hill benefice. A Congregational gathering was formed at Chapmanslade in 1761, and built a chapel in 1771. In the mid-19th century a disagreement between minister and congregation caused the entire congregation to join the Baptists at their chapel. A new chapel, a stone building in Gothic style, was built in the east end of the village in 1867. In the later 20th century this building was sold and became a private house. Particular Baptists came to Chapmanslade in 1777 and built a chapel in brick and stone on Wood Lane, north of the High Street. Sometime in the 20th century this too became a private house.  Amenities  The village's primary school is next to the church and was designed by the same architect, G.E. Street. It opened in 1872 as a National School, was enlarged in 1894 and has a further modern extension. Control passed to the county council in 1906 and the school has Voluntary aided status. The village has a pub, the Three Horseshoes. Governance Most local government services are provided by Wiltshire Council, which has its offices in Trowbridge. Chapmanslade also has its own elected parish council of five members, which is almost entirely a consultative body. The village is represented in Parliament by the MP for South West Wiltshire, Andrew Murrison, and in Wiltshire Council by Fleur de Rhé-Philipe.

It was known as \\"Özi Kuşatması\\" in Turkish. In 1788, Russian forces led by Prince Grigory Potemkin and General Alexander Suvorov besieged the city, held by Ottoman troops commanded by Hasan Pasha. Despite Suvorov's urging to storm the city immediately, Potemkin had the Russian forces encircled Ochakov (Özi), bombarding the city and cutting off the defenders' supply of food and ammunition. By keeping his soldiers out of direct battle, Potemkin minimized Russian casualties, though he was accused by his generals of cowardice. The argument about storming continued in the Russian headquarters during the entirety of the siege. Also, the Russians captured strategically important Pirezin Island on July 18, 1788. The first combat was on May 31, with the arrival of the Turkish navy. The Russian flotilla lost a double-sloop while attempting to retreat. The Russian army began assaulting the city on July 9. The Turks made several attempts to break the siege. On July 27, about 5,000 Janissaries attacked positions held by Cossacks and forced them to retreat. Suvorov personally led reinforcements and drove the Janissaries to the gates of Ochakov, but was injured. Hasan Pasha expected reinforcements from the Turkish fleet, which gathered in Limans. But after the attack of Admiral Senyavin's fleet, Turkish reinforcements were cut off. The condition of both armies continued to decline, there was a threat of disease, and the weather was growing very cold. Potemkin ultimately gave in to Suvorov's arguments. On the night of December 6 (December 17 in the Gregorian calendar), the Russians attacked, and captured Hasan Pasha's palace, forcing its guards to surrender. Over 9,500 Turks were killed during the assault, more than 4,000 were taken prisoner, including Hasan Pasha himself, but most of the city garrison was killed in the street fight, having lost about 20,000 men dead. The Russians lost 956 soldiers and had 1,829 wounded by the end of the operation. The Russian victory was celebrated in a famous ode by Gavrila Derzhavin, and in a Te Deum by Giuseppe Sarti.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 23 January 2003. The character was riding a white horse onto the beach, where he was spotted by Dani Sutherland. Scott departed on 25 November 2005. Storylines Scott is first seen riding his horse, Jacko while helping a search party find an ill Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) who has been missing. Scott meets Dani Sutherland (Tammin Sursok) and they become attracted to one another and begin a relationship. Scott later purchases the local boatshed previously owned by Rob Storey (Matthew Lilley) but finds himself at odds with Dani's ex- boyfriend Josh West (Daniel Collopy), who wants to start a development on the land where the boatshed is based. The boatshed is later burned out. After a misunderstanding where several residents think Scott and Dani are getting engaged, Scott uses this chance for Dani to meet his mother, Beth (Clarissa House). When a woman named Mira Sardelic (Hollie Andrew) arrives in the bay, it is revealed that she is Scott's wife and they married in a bid to keep her in Australia. Mira insists she still wants to be with Scott but realises he does not feel the same way and leaves.

Natural dog odor can be unpleasant to dog owners especially when dogs are kept inside the home, as some people are not used to being exposed to the natural odor of a non-human species living in proximity to them. Dogs may also develop unnatural odors as a result of skin disease or other disorders or may become contaminated with odors from other sources in their environment.  Healthy odors  All natural dog odors are most prominent near the ears and from the paw pads. Dogs naturally produce secretions, the function of which is to produce scents allowing for individual animal recognition by dogs and other species in the scent-marking of territory. Dogs only produce sweat on areas not covered with fur, such as the nose and paw pads, unlike humans who sweat almost everywhere. However, they do have sweat glands, called apocrine glands, associated with every hair follicle on the body. The exact function of these glands is not known, but they may produce pheromones or chemical signals for communication with other dogs. It is believed that these sweat secretions produce an individual odor signal that is recognizable by other dogs. Dogs also have sweat glands on their noses. These are eccrine glands. When these glands are active, they leave the nose and paw pads slightly moist and help these specialized skin features maintain their functional properties. The odor associated with dog paw pads is much more noticeable on dogs with moist paw pads than on those with dry pads. Dogs also have numerous apocrine glands in their external ear canals. In this location, they are referred to as ceruminous glands. The ear canals also have numerous sebaceous glands. Together, these two sets of glands produce natural ear wax, or cerumen. Micro- organisms live naturally in this material and give the ears a characteristic slightly yeasty odor, even when healthy. When infected, the ears can give off a strong disagreeable smell. It is not uncommon for a veterinarian to sniff a dog's ears to try to detect any potential bacterial or fungal infection. Some owners do this routinely if they have a dog susceptible to ear infections or if they have a breed with heavy, floppy ears, which can hide early signs of inflammation. Dogs, like all Carnivorans, also possess two anal sacs, or scent glands. These sacs communicate with the surface of the skin by ducts which open on either side of the anus. The sacs are lined with apocrine and sebaceous glands. They function to produce a natural secretion that varies from thin and yellowish to pasty and greyish; the secretion has a very strong musky odor. A small amount of this material is deposited when dogs defecate. A large amount may be extruded when a dog is frightened. It is thought that this secretion leaves a signal to other dogs allowing them to recognize the source of the individual fecal deposit. This odor is also likely the signal being sampled when strange dogs investigate one another by sniffing out the anal area. Dogs' anal glands can become swollen and unable to drain naturally, sometimes requiring a visit to the veterinarian or groomer to express the built up liquid. Excessive licking and chewing of the area is one indication of this. Typically, these glands are expressed during routine professional grooming as a preventative measure. Another source of natural odor results from a common dog behavior: rolling in and marking themselves with the feces of other animals in their environment.  Unhealthy odors  Poor grooming of dogs with long, thick or corded hair can cause the haircoat to be a source of unpleasant odor. A coat that is not kept clean and groomed can trap dirt and other substances with unpleasant odors. Skin diseases can cause a dog to have increased or abnormal odor. Allergy can cause increased production of apocrine sweat, which imparts a musty odor. This condition, termed hyperhidrosis, can encourage yeast infection or bacterial skin infection and these micro- organisms produce odors as well. Dogs with seborrhea or keratinization defect, and dogs with deep skin folds (such as on the face of a bulldog), are very subject to secondary proliferation of bacteria or yeast on the skin surface, and these produce odors. Ear disease (otitis) can be a source of odor that varies from yeasty to one resembling sewage as either cerumen or pus accumulates in the diseased ear canal. Anal sac disease or excessive anal sac production can cause a very musty pungent odor. Anal sacs can become abscessed and infecting micro-organisms produce odor. Dental disease or mouth ulcers can produce rotten smelling breath (halitosis). Dental calculus harbors numerous bacteria which produce odor and foul breath. Dental disease can also lead to excessive drooling, and the skin around the mouth can become infected, leading to more odor production. Dogs can also acquire foul smelling breath as a result of coprophagia, the practice of eating their own feces or the feces of other animals. Commercially prepared food additives can be purchased which, when added to a dog's food, impart a bitter flavor to their feces thereby reducing the tendency towards consuming their own feces. Some medications, such as antibiotics, taken by mouth or antiseptics or medicated shampoos used on the skin can produce odors that owners may find unpleasant. Likewise, some food ingredients, most noticeably fish meal or fish oil, can produce skin odor in dogs. Flatulence can be a problem for some dogs, which may be diet-related or a sign of gastrointestinal disease. This, in fact, may be the most commonly noticed source of odor from dogs fed cereal-based dog foods. Skunks and dogs often have aggressive encounters and a dog may be sprayed by a skunk. This results in an over-powering musky acrid odor that remains apparent in the 'skunked' dog's coat for many days or even weeks until steps are taken to neutralize the odor.

Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt. It was first published in hardcover by Gnome Press in 1948, and in paperback by Lancer Books in 1967. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition It has also been translated into Italian and German. Plot summary The carnelian cube of the title is a small red \\"dream stone\\" confiscated by archaeologist Arthur Cleveland Finch from Tiridat Ariminian, one of the workers on the dig he is supervising in Cappadocia. It bears an inscription in Etruscan that appears to identify its original possessor as Apollonius of Tyana, and supposedly allows the bearer to attain the world of his dreams. Finch, frustrated with the irrationality of his existence as an archaeologist, yearns for a more rational world in which he could realize his true dream of being a poet. Sleeping with the stone beneath his pillow he finds himself cast into a parallel world. It and later worlds visited by Finch tend to place him in or near his native Louisville, Kentucky rather than the Middle Eastern locale he starts out from, but Kentuckys that, while appearing to share much of the \\"real\\" world's history, have developed in radically alternate directions due to differences in their worlds' psychological or physical properties. Finch's new home sets the pattern; it is entirely too rational, with its denizens acting solely from self-interest in a society organized on a strict patron-client basis. The regimentation extends to naming conventions: people's names are ordered surname first, given name second, and occupation last. Finch initially finds himself classed as \\"Finch Arthur Poet\\" — and is, indeed, a poet. Poets are, however, a low-classified occupation, with few perks, certainly as compared to the local patron, Sullivan Michael Politician. Finch's attempts at social climbing, while initially successful, also bring him enemies, eventually making his new world too hot for him. The stone had not made the trip with him, and Finch's only means of escaping this new and not entirely congenial existence is to purloin its counterpart from the local version of Tiridat. With the rational world's counterpart stone, Finch dreams himself into a second parallel world, this one exemplifying the individualism he has missed in the rational world. But he finds the individualist world one of rampant vanity and violence, in which megalomaniacal bully-boys like Colonel Richard Fitzhugh Lee uneasily dominate a population of extreme egocentrics defensive of their \\"originality\\" and touchy about being told what to do. It is also a more fantastic place, in which claims of ESP or the ability to raise spirits tend to be real. Hiring a medium-provided spirit to do the dirty work, Finch again obtains his current world's counterpart of the carnelian cube and makes his escape, this time hoping to regain his original existence as an archaeologist reconstructing the past. Finch awakens in yet another parallel world, only to find the stone has once again over-literalised his dream; his third world is one in which astrology-guided archaeologists really do reconstruct the past, drafting and magically conditioning vast numbers of people to reenact past events. He finds himself project head of a recreation of the Assyrian siege of Samaria, and quickly discovers the reenactment no mere fantasy; the brainwashed participants actually fight, kill and die in the furtherance of scientific knowledge. Caught up in the chaos, Finch faces execution at the order of the reenactor portraying usurping Assyrian king Sargon. \\"Sargon\\" turns out to be yet another version of Tiridat, who, like the others, is the possessor of this world's carnelian cube. Begging the cube from the \\"king\\" as a last request, Finch determines to escape once again by dreaming himself into a truly ideal world. On this note the novel ends, with neither the protagonist's possible execution or projected escape recounted, leaving the plot open-ended and providing an obvious opportunity for a sequel. However, no such sequel ever appeared.

Fantasy Review's Kemp McDonald faulted the novel as scattershot and plotless, saying that \\"Characters and scenes, individually well-drawn, pass and do not return, collectively insignificant. Loose ends and unexplained anomalies abound\\".\\"Sophisticated Woodcutter\\" in Fantasy Review, April–May 1949, p.27 Astounding reviewer P. Schuyler Miller called the book \\"quite unlike anything else the reader will find on today's market,\\" providing \\"more sheer entertainment than any the fantasy publishers have yet given us.\\" He felt \\"The fantasy is a little more heavy-handed than in the other Pratt-de Camp books, the incongruities laid on thicker, but the familiar and heady flavor is still there\\" \\"although it may not quite measure up to ... previous books by these incomparable collaborators.\\"Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"Book Reviews,\\" in Astounding Science Fiction v. 44, no. 1, September 1949, p. 151 Amazing Stories, noting that The Carnelian Cube was \\"not quite up to the standards\\" of its authors' best work, found it \\"nevertheless a diverting (and at times) racy tale. ... definitely not great literature, but [offering] a pleasant few hours to any reader desiring amusement\\".Tish, Morris. \\"Great Books in Science Fiction\\" in Amazing Stories, December 1949, p. 150. A. Langley Searles similarly found that although the novel \\"did not duplicate the high standards of its predecessors\\", readers \\"are sure to be entertained and often amused by it\\".Searles, A. Langley. \\"Guest Review\\" in Fantastic Novels v. 4, no. 1, May 1950, p. 116. More recently, E. F. Bleiler wrote that the novel's settings were \\"ingeniously contrived and the adventures are well adapted to their environment, but the reader must be prepared to have his credulity strained, perhaps because of lack of unity.\\"Bleiler, E. F. The Guide to Supernatural Fiction, Kent State University Press, 1983, p. 322-23.

The order includes corticioid and hydnoid fungi, together with a few polypores and clavarioid species. Most fungi within the Thelephorales are ectomycorrhizal. None is of any great economic importance, though Sarcodon imbricatus is edible and commercially marketed, whilst several species have been used for craft dyeing. Taxonomy=History Though \\"the Thelephorales\\" were referred to in passing by E.J.H. Corner in 1968, the order was not formally published till 1976 when German mycologist Franz Oberwinkler first described it as encompassing the families Thelephoraceae and Bankeraceae. As originally conceived, species within the order had diverse basidiocarp (fruit body) forms, but shared several features in common, notably similarities in basidiospore shape (most having spiny to warted, often lobed spores) and similarities in basidiocarp colours, linked to the presence of thelephoric acid derivatives and often accompanied by blue to greenish reactions with alkalis. Current status Molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, has supported the morphological concept of the Thelephorales, indicating that the order forms a distinct grouping within the Agaricomycetes, close to the Polyporales.  Distribution and habitat  All fungi within the order are ectomycorrhizal, forming mutually beneficial associations with the roots of living trees. Distribution of the Thelephorales is cosmopolitan. According to a 2008 estimate, the order contains 18 genera and over 250 species worldwide. Economic importance Sarcodon imbricatus is an edible species collected for local markets in some countries and commercially collected in China for export as a dried product. Polyozellus multiplex is also edible and collected for sale in North America.

Early life Frances Hyde was born in Carthage, Missouri on March 15, 1919. Growing up, she witnessed a public hanging held outside on the courthouse lawn; hawkers sold tickets to the best views. This grounded a lifetime resistance to capital punishment. She held degrees from Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri (1939) and Syracuse University (1941), and conducted graduate work at Columbia University and The New School for Social Research. She married Thomas Crowe, a physician, in 1945 and had three children. Career and activism Crowe worked for Bell Labs during World War II. In 1945, following the bombing of civilian populations in Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, she became a peace activist. Her participation in numerous protests led to arrests, trials, and imprisonment. She was active in the Society of Friends, American Friends Service Committee (running the local office from the basement of her Northampton, Massachusetts home for several decades), and War Resisters League, and co-founded the Traprock Peace Center (based in Deerfield, Massachusetts) and the Committee to End Apartheid (based in Springfield, Massachusetts). In the 1960s, she founded the Northampton, Massachusetts chapter of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, the Sane Nuclear Policy Committee (now Peace Action), and the Valley Peace Center (based in Amherst, Massachusetts), and also participated in the activities of Women Against the War and Amnesty International. In 1967, during the Vietnam War, she worked as a draft counselor, providing counseling to over 2,000 people about applying for conscientious objector status by the war's end. She continued to be an advocate for conscientious objectors. Stating that she could not pay for killing, she became a war tax refuser since the beginning of the Iraq War. She was also one of the core members of the Northampton Committee to Stop the War in Iraq and the Alliance for Peace and Justice, which is a Western Massachusetts coalition consisting of individuals and organizations. The Alliance was formed in December 2009 in response to President Obama's call to increase the troops in Afghanistan and she was explicit in helping the Alliance pass the \\"Bring Our War $$ Home\\" resolution in Northampton, Massachusetts and Amherst, Massachusetts.

Old English surnames were in particular a description of one's profession such as \\"Smith\\" or \\"Thatcher\\" or described an area in which one lived. The Blackburn Brook, the likely origin of the Staniforth surname The name of Stanford is believed to be of ancient Saxon origin and to have been derived from the words stan, meaning \\"stone\\", and ford, meaning \\"river-crossing\\". It was undoubtedly first given to a place answering that description (there were ten parishes of the name in England) and was taken therefrom by its first bearer because of his residence there at the time of the adoption of surnames in Great Britain. Sheffield historian David Hey writes about a potential location on the Blackburn Brook in Ecclesfield that contained a farm known as Stonyford Farm. The 1434 Ecclesfield court rolls mention John of Stannyford passing on land in 'Stanyford' to his son Richard further backs up this claim. It is found in ancient records in the various spellings of Staniford, Staniforth, Stanforth, Stamforth, Standiford, Stanniford, Staynfor, Stanforde, Stannyforthe, Standford and Stanford, of which the form last mentioned is that most generally used in North America today. Among the early records of the family in England are those of Adam de Stanford, of Oxford County in 1273. Probably the first of the name in America were Richard and John Stanford of Virginia in 1635.

The Society's chapters have often been headquartered in chapter houses, akin to residential cooperatives, though there have been many chapters which lacked a chapter house. Where established, chapter houses have served as venues for the academic talks hosted by the Society. More informally, the shared living space of the Society's houses has provided its members with a forum for a regular exchange of ideas across disciplines--over breakfast or dinner, for example, or a game of chess. Origin and Mission The Society was founded in 1899 as the Gamma Alpha Graduate Scientific Fraternity in Ithaca, NY by graduate students in the biological sciences at Cornell University. Its purpose was an interdisciplinary one with respect to the sciences: to stimulate “mutual interest” among graduate students from “the various scientific departments of Cornell University.” In time, it expanded to more than a dozen chapters across the country and boasted a membership of “more than 10,000 men.” In 1963, it formally changed its name to the Gamma Alpha Graduate Scientific Society, in part to further differentiate itself from undergraduate fraternities. Originally, the Society was a scientific fraternity exclusively for men, but local chapters (such as Missouri's) admitted women by 1968. Other chapter houses (Chicago, Cornell and Ohio) began to admit women and students in disciplines other than the sciences in 1972, with the rest (Ann Arbor) following suit the following year. Currently, the University of Illinois is the only local chapter that remains an all-male fraternity. Although the makeup of the organization has thus changed greatly since its inception, it is still dedicated to promoting an interdisciplinary fellowship among graduate students, in large part through its cooperative living arrangements. Its motto remains Γνωθι την 'Αληθειαν (Know the truth). The significance of Gamma Alpha's motto as well as the symbolism of its insignia used to be revealed to new members in their initiation ceremony. After presenting the candidates with their certificates of membership, the president of the chapter would inform them that: > The letters ΓΑ denote our motto: Gnothe ten Aletheian - KNOW THE TRUTH. The > wings and star on our Society Emblem, which all of you are now entitled to > wear, signify PROGRESS and ATTAINMENT. The four notches in that Emblem > commemorate the four original Chapters: CORNELL, JOHNS HOPKINS, CHICAGO, AND > DARTMOUTH. Nowadays, however, the Society has no such initiation ceremony, though the motto and insignia have been retained. Most ceremonies of this sort--another would be the singing of the fraternity's song at the end of chapter meetings-- appear to have been dropped with the organization's metamorphosis from a fraternity into a type of fraternal, co-ed cooperative. Activities : A historical survey of Gamma Alphans' activities is requested here. (volunteers: see the discussion page) Publications : An overview of The Gamma Alpha Record and Newsletter is requested here. (volunteers: see the discussion page) Chapters The Society presently has four active chapters--in Ithaca, NY (Cornell University), Chicago (University of Chicago), and Ann Arbor, MI (University of Michigan) as well as at Champaign-Urbana, IL (University of Illinois). None of them is legally affiliated with its members’ home academic institution(s). The chapter in Chicago, for example, bears no legal connection with the University of Chicago, and indeed, its members may attend other universities in the vicinity. Still, for the sake of convenience, each chapter is designated by the name of its logical academic institution: Cornell, Chicago and Ann Arbor respectively. Cornell The Cornell Chapter was the founding branch of the organization and contributed a number of illustrious members like Hans Bethe, the German-American physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967 for his work on the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis. Locations The chapter continues to offer housing to graduate students in the sciences at its house at 116 Oak Avenue overlooking the beautiful Cascadilla Gorge. Chicago= Origin  The Chicago Chapter was the second chapter of the Society to be established (excluding the chapters of the Alpha Delta Epsilon Scientific Fraternity which, though they existed prior to the Chicago Chapter, merged with the Society shortly after the latter's establishment). According to early records, it was through the “untiring zeal” of F. H. Krecker and R. E. Sheldon of the Cornell Chapter that graduate students in the sciences at the University of Chicago petitioned Gamma Alpha for a charter in December 1907. The charter was granted on February 8, 1908, and the chapter officially installed on the same day. Locations The chapter has been housed in six different locations in its nearly one hundred years of existence in Hyde Park, Chicago. (1) In its first year, the chapter secured rooms that were “modestly though neatly furnished” on the first floor of 5724 S. Drexel Avenue. (2) Within a year, it had already found a house of its own at 5731 S. Monroe Avenue (renamed Kenwood Avenue in 1915), where “almost all” of its 24 members lodged. (3) By October, 1915, the chapter had moved again, this time to a house that would affectionately come to be called the “Blackstone Castle,” at 5520 S. Blackstone Avenue, where “eighteen to twenty-odd men” were put up in seven bedrooms. (4) Within seven years--by October 1922--the chapter had moved back to Kenwood Avenue, making its home in the house (5733) next to its former residence (5731). (5) And in the first quarter of 1938, the chapter relocated to 5735 S. Woodlawn Avenue, “the most beat up house on Woodlawn” with a “poor porch” that remained, “well, darn poor.” (6) Finally, in a forced move in the latter half of 1958, the chapter settled into its longest-lived home to date, the former residence of the famous American sociologist, David Riesman, at 5621 S. University Avenue, across the street from the campus (see below). Challenges  The chapter fell on especially tough times and nearly lost its housing both during World War II and with the sale of its house to the University of Chicago in 1958. Like many residential institutions during World War II, the Chicago Chapter lost many men to the armed forces and was hard pressed to fill the house with enough members to make ends meet. Supplies like roofing tiles were “unattainable at any price” that the chapter could afford and the pipes also fell into disrepair, dripping “dismally” through the winter of 1943. The house's future seemed “none too bright” to its members and was in fact so uncertain that “all efforts” were “being made to forestall a possible closure.” Gamma Alpha Chicago, 2006Such a closure was all but certain in 1957 when an expanding University of Chicago arranged to buy the chapter house and replace it with a seminary dorm. For its part, the local corporation governing the house planned to use the monies from the sale to “establish a fellowship- loan fund,” but at the cost of permanently closing the chapter house and displacing its resident members. A hard battle was subsequently fought by the chapter's active members, with the support of the national organization, to get the local corporation to relocate rather than abolish the chapter house. Eventually, the corporation capitulated and, with help from the university, relocated the chapter in 1958 to 5621 S. University Avenue, the “magnificent residence which is the present home of ΓΑ.”  At Present  The Chicago Chapter has institutionalized in its “House Rules” the membership changes which were ushered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In recruiting new members for its 15 rooms, it now seeks to maintain a balance between the sexes and to admit students from as diverse a set of academic fields as possible. It has thus come to conceive of itself more as a graduate student cooperative than a scientific fraternity, though it remains both active in the national organization and invested in the welfare of its sister chapters. For more information about the present activities of the chapter, its recruitment of new members and alumni contacts, visit the chapter's homepage.  Ann Arbor  See current house information here: http://www.gammaalphacoop.wordpress.com The Gamma Alpha chapter of Ann Arbor first bought a house near the North Engels building. In 1949, Gamma Alpha moved to the current location in the southwest area of the city, into a house that was built in 1923 as a family residence. During the early years, GA Ann Arbor housed up to 40 male Chemistry graduate students. This luckily changed over time—the house now offers single rooms for 13 graduate students, both female and male and from all departments. The house has a lively and multicultural community, and besides some tightly organized house meetings, the members cook together, fill out crosswords, play board games, sled (in winter), brew beer, bake bread, repair the house, and engage in many other activities.  The University of Illinois at Champaign- Urbana Instituted on December 16, 1908, a residential chapter has continuously been located at the University of Illinois, and has been situated at 807 W Nevada Street, Urbana, Illinois 61801 for approximately the last 80 years. The Illinois chapter is a co-ed organisation and amongst notable alumni are Polykarp Kusch and Arnold Beckman. Initiated May 25, 1932, Polykarp Kusch won the Nobel prize in physics in 1955. Arnold Orville Beckman, initiated December 1922, was the inventor of the first pH meter and founder of the first silicon transistor company in California (thus giving birth to Silicon valley). The Illinois chapter still encourages application from graduate students attending the University of Illinois, and has opened membership capabilities to students in areas other than exclusively scientific disciplines.

As a charism, the gift is imparted to individuals by the power of the Holy Spirit. The view of Cessationism held that the charismata were exclusively for Apostolic times, and therefore the gift of miracles ceased with the writing of the last book of the Bible or the death of St. John the Apostle. In Continuationism, on the other hand, the gifts are held to be possible throughout the history of Christianity, and to have occurred since Apostolic times. Catholicism In Catholicism, the gift is one of the extraordinary graces of the Holy Spirit imparted to certain individuals so that Christ's doctrine may become credible and Christians confirmed in their faith. Although miracles are necessarily the work of God, men and angels may be said to work miracles in a threefold way * by their prayers invoking a miraculous effect; * by disposing or accommodating the materials, as it is said of the angels that they will in the resurrection collect the dust of the dead bodies that these may be re-animated by the Divine power, * by performing some other act in co- operation with the Divine agency, as in the case of the application of relics, or of visits to holy places which God has marked out for special and extraordinary favours of this kind. Like other charismata, these are special and extraordinary powers vouchsafed by God only to a few, and primarily for the spiritual good of others rather than of the recipient. Pentecostals and charismatics In Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, it is believed that God continues to operate this gift through believers with the gift of faith.Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, Foundations of Pentecostal Theology, 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), p. 338.

Bucking is a movement performed by an animal in which it lowers its head and raises its hindquarters into the air while kicking out with the hind legs. It is most commonly seen in herbivores such as equines, cattle, deer, goats, and sheep. Most research on this behavior has been directed towards horses and cattle. Bucking can vary in intensity from the animals’ slight elevation of both hind legs, to lowering their head between their front legs, arching their back, and kicking out several times. Originally, it was predominantly an anti-predator and play behavior, but with domestication, it is now also a behavioral issue in riding horses, and a desired behavior in bucking bulls. If powerful, it may unseat a rider enough to fall off. Bucking, in some cases, may have consequences for serious injury to animal and rider. Reasons for bucking A loose horse may buck due to aggression or fear, as the very high kick of this horse suggests Bucking is a normal behavior for a horse with an overabundance of energy, and in a loose horse, may simply be playful behavior, as here Bucking, though a potentially dangerous disobedience when under saddle, is a natural aspect of horse behavior. Bucking is used by animals for several reasons. In the wild, it can be used as a defense mechanism against predators such as mountain lions that attack by leaping on the animal’s back. By performing this behaviour, the animal throws a predator from its back. It can also be used as a mechanism of play and territorial herd defense. For a human to safely ride a horse, the horse has to be desensitized to the presence of something on its back and also learn not to kick out with both hind legs while under saddle. Nonetheless, because the instinct is always there, bucking can still occur for a number of reasons: * Happiness, such as when a horse bucks during a gallop because of enjoyment, or during play. * General excitement, such as horses that buck in a crowded schooling ring or at the beginning of a ride in a crowd of horses, such as an endurance ride. * The rider's aids while riding or training cause confusion, frustration, or fear in the horse, and the horse responds by bucking. * The horse is \\"fresh\\", having been kept up in a stall for a long period of time, and is releasing pent-up energy. * Pain or discomfort which may be due to an ill-fitting saddle or another piece of equipment, tooth problems, or other medical issues. * Provocation, usually due to an insect bite (usually on the hindquarters) which the horse is trying to rid itself of, or in some cases a response to use of a whip on the flank or hindquarters. * Untrained horses may instinctually buck the first few times they have a saddle on the back if not given proper ground training, and occasionally, even with proper preparation. This is an instinctive defense mechanism. * Having found that bucking the rider off results in not having to work, the horse does it to avoid being ridden. * Disobedience to the riding aids, when a horse does not wish to do what is asked by the rider. Sometimes this is due to poor riding on the part of the person, but sometimes a horse attempts to evade a legitimate request by bucking. * Rodeo broncs and bucking bulls are used specifically as bucking stock, usually bred to be prone to bucking and encouraged to buck whenever a rider is on their back with the help of a \\"bucking strap\\" around their flank. * Fear of loud and noisy machines, like cars, trucks, trains, and planes. In response to tragic injuries that have resulted, the American courts have uniformly held that \\"the needs of a modern, industrial society often conflict with and generally must prevail over the delicate sensibilities of horses.\\"Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co., 15 Cal. 4th 456 (1997). Ordinary riders need to learn to ride out and correct a simple buck or two, because it is a relatively common form of disobedience. Further, at times, movement akin to bucking is actually required of a horse: Horses that are jumping over an obstacle actually are using almost the same action as bucking when launching themselves into the air, it is simply carried out with advanced planning over a higher and wider distance. The classical dressage movement known as the Capriole is also very similar to the low buck done by a horse when it kicks out with both hind legs. Solutions to bucking Horse bucking as an act of disobedience or discomfort Bucking in horses, especially if triggered by fear, pain or excitement, is generally a minor disobedience, unless it is strong enough to unseat the rider, at which point it is a dangerous act. If bucking is a premeditated act of the horse and becomes an undesired habit (such as when a horse learns to buck off a rider so as to no longer have to work), then the horse must be re-schooled by a professional trainer. It is important to address the problem of the bucking immediately. Even with good cause, it is a potentially dangerous disobedience that cannot be encouraged or allowed to continue. However, a rider does need to be sure that it is not triggered by pain or poor riding. The horse's turn-out schedule should also be assessed, as extra turn-out will give a horse to release extra energy before a rider gets on. In certain cases (such as a show, when horses are unable to be turned-out for extended periods), longeing the horses for a brief period can help calm excess energy, allowing the rider to mount, and ride safely. If poor riding is the cause, special attention and improvement to the rider’s balance and aids will help eliminate confusion and thus prevent the behavior. If ill-fitting equipment is the problem, a refit of the tack causing the discomfort is necessary to not only stop the bucking, but also to prevent further injuries that may arise due to poor fit. Usually a horse gives some warning that it is about to buck by dropping its head, slowing down or stopping, and excessively rounding up its back. With such an advance warning, riders can intervene in early stages by encouraging forward motion or circling. With less warning, a rider may still prevent bucking by using one direct rein to pull the horse's head sideways and up, turning the horse in a small circle. This is sometimes called a “one-rein stop.” If a rider pulls the horse's head up with both reins, the horse's neck is stronger and the rider is likely to be flipped over the horse's head. By turning the horse sideways, the rider has more leverage and a horse cannot easily buck while turning around. This also can be used to stop a horse that has begun bucking. When the horse stops bucking, it must be asked to move forward—forward motion makes it difficult for the horse to buck and discourages the behavior. The use of positive punishment, such as to deliberately put the horse into a hollowed-out frame for a moment by deliberately raising the head and hollowing out the horse's back, may discourage or reduce the power and severity of the buck. Raising the head or the application of upward and sideways pressure on the horses head to create discomfort immediately following a buck has been shown to discourage bucking in the future. Certain training aids, such as a gag bit, certain types of martingale or, particularly on ponies, an overcheck, may also discourage bucking. Bucking is sometimes seen during the early stages of horse training, often caused by the uncomfortable new feeling of a piece of saddlery, which will usually reside after habituation. If the behavior stems from the frustration that arises with inconsistent or absent reinforcement or punishment, then special attention from the handler, such as a consistent reinforcement schedule could be implemented. If poor riding is the case, special attention and improvement to the rider’s balance, and commands will help to eliminate the confusion, and thus prevent the behavior. If ill-fitting tack is the problem, then a refit of the tack causing the discomfort is necessary to not only stop the bucking, but also to prevent further injuries that may arise due to the inappropriate fit. Consequences of chronic bucking Some horses are chosen for use in rodeos, due to their habitual or powerful bucking ability. Horses that are chronic and consistent buckers cannot be ridden safely and if they cannot be retrained become unsuitable for any type of ordinary riding. There are few options available to such an animal, and thus may become unwanted by many buyers. Thus, humane euthanasia or sale to slaughter may be that animal's fate. In a few cases, a horse that cannot be retrained not to buck may be sold to a rodeo stock contractor. Ironically, such horses often fetch a high price in the bucking stock world because they often are easy to handle on the ground, yet very clever and skilled at unseating riders, thus allowing a cowboy to obtain a high score if the rider can stay on. At rodeo auctions such as the Miles City Bucking Horse Sale, a spoiled riding horse, particularly one that is powerfully built, will bring a top price and have a long career in rodeo.

He served as the second head football coach and the first paid at Ohio State University, coaching from 1892 to 1895 and again in 1898, compiling a record of 22–22–2. Ryder was later a noted sportswriter for The Cincinnati Enquirer. Early years and playing career Ryder was born in Oberlin, Ohio in 1871, but moved with his family as a youth to New England. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he learned the game of American football. In 1888 Ryder returned to Oberlin to attend Oberlin College. He introduced the game to that school, and soon began to pressure the school administration to allow the Oberlin students to form an intercollegiate team. The pressure ultimately paid off in the Fall of 1890.Nat Brandt, When Oberlin Was King of the Gridiron: The Heisman Years Before the Oberlin team would play a game, however, Ryder decided to transfer to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He later played for the Williams team. He graduated in 1892. Coaching career In the Fall of 1892, Ryder came to Columbus, Ohio to teach at Columbus Academy. He was also offered a job as the head coach of the Ohio State University football team. He was the first coach hired at the University. The Ohio State Buckeyes football team had previously been coached by Alexander Lilley, but Lilley had worked as a volunteer. In his first season, Ryder was paid $15 per week for a season total of $150. Ryder led Ohio State to its first winning season. He introduced the concepts of closed practice and a training table. He also introduced a formation known as the Ryder Wedge, which was a variation of a wedge formation he had used at Williams College. In Ryder's first season, Ohio State outscored their opponents 242 to 14 in their five wins, and were outscored 130 to 18 in their three losses. Ryder stayed with Ohio State from 1892 until 1895. During this time Ryder became proprietor of Columbus Academy. Later, during the Spanish–American War, Ryder saw service with the Ohio Cavalry. Following the war, he returned to Columbus and served one more year, 1898, as the Ohio State coach. Sportswriting career Ryder then landed a job at the Columbus newspaper, the Ohio State Journal, and became a successful sportswriter. In 1905, he was offered a job with The Cincinnati Enquirer. Ryder replaced Charles Webb Murphy as The Cincinnati Enquirer's sportswriter, and was a fixture at that newspaper for more than 30 years. While with the Enquirer, Ryder usually covered the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. In 1919, Ryder helped give the nickname to the University of Cincinnati sports teams, the Bearcats. Cincinnati's football team had five years earlier fielded a star fullback named Leonard K. \\"Teddy\\" Baehr. In a 1914 game against Kentucky, the Cincinnati fans cheered, \\"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\\" In 1919, Ryder revived the nickname and attributed it to the entire team. The name stuck and was soon adopted by the University.Greg Hand, History of the Bearcat Mascot As The Cincinnati Enquirer sportswriter, Ryder was a voter for the Most Valuable Player award for baseball's National League. He was one of eight American sportswriters, one from each National League city, who voted for the award. In 1924, St. Louis Cardinals second baseman Rogers Hornsby batted .424. Ryder did not give Hornsby a single vote in any of the ten spots on his ballot because he considered Hornsby a selfish player. Ryder was quoted as saying: \\"I will concede Hornsby is a most valuable player to himself, but not to his team. On that basis I couldn't give him a solitary vote.\\" Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Dazzy Vance won the award.December Classic Moments Ryder retired from The Cincinnati Enquirer in June 1936. Soon after, he died of a heart attack in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Avondale.

The village lies in the middle of Salisbury Plain, about east of the town of Warminster. The Chitterne Brook, a small tributary of the River Wylye, flows southwest through the village. History A large settlement of 60 households, held by Edward of Salisbury, was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Chitterne was one of many Wiltshire estates owned in the 12th century by Ela, 3rd Countess of Salisbury. There were two ancient parishes, Chitterne St Mary to the west and Chitterne All Saints to the east. Their villages were adjacent and each had a small parish church. In the 19th century they became two civil parishes, then in 1907 they were combined to form Chitterne civil parish. A village school was built near the village green in 1840 and was attended by children of all ages until 1937, when it became a junior school. The school closed in 1967, by which time the number of pupils had fallen below 20. Features The village green Chitterne has a village hall, which stands on the site of the former school. Opposite the hall is a large sports field, on which cricket and football are played, according to the season. The village also has a public house called the King's Head. There are several notable houses, including Chitterne House, the Manor, the Grange, and Manor Farm, all Grade II listed for their architectural merit. Large parts of Chitterne parish are Ministry of Defence land within the Salisbury Plain Training Area; the Imber firing range is to the north and the Copehill Down training area to the east. The latter has an uninhabited \\"German Village\\" used by the British Army for training in street warfare (FIBUA - Fighting in Built- up Areas). This was built in the mid-1980s, before the Berlin Wall was demolished, and is based on a typical village of Saxony in Germany. A few miles to the north, across Salisbury Plain in the \\"Danger Area\\", and now part of Heytesbury parish, lies the remains of the ancient village of Imber.  Religious sites  Victorian church The first records of churches in the parishes are from 1270 for All Saints and 1319 for St Mary's; both were largely rebuilt in the 15th century. From 1848 the two churches were served by one vicar, and by that time the churches were in need of repair and too small to serve the growing population, so a new church was built in the centre of the village and opened in 1863. The new church was built in flint and stone in the Perpendicular style, to designs of T.H. Wyatt. The 12th-century font was brought from St Mary's, as were the pulpit and two bells. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1968 and is now part of the Salisbury Plain benefice. Surviving part of St Mary's Church At first the chancels of both earlier churches were retained, to serve as chapels for their graveyards. All Saints was demolished in 1877 but St Mary's chancel still stands and is Grade II* listed. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built sometime before 1846, and was later taken over by Baptists. After a fire in 1903, a rebuilt chapel opened on the same site in 1904. The chapel closed c.1969 and is now a private house. Local government Most local government services are provided by Wiltshire Council, which has its offices in Trowbridge, to the north. Chitterne also has its own elected parish council of seven members, five representing the ancient parish of Chitterne All Saints and two representing the former Chitterne St Mary. The village is represented in Parliament by the MP for South West Wiltshire, Andrew Murrison. In popular culture In Dennis Wheatley's 1934 novel The Devil Rides Out, characters drive through the parishes of Chitterne St. Mary and Chitterne All Saints. A Satanic 'Grand Sabbat' then takes place somewhere between Chitterne All Saints, Imber, and Tilshead.

The mill has the largest cast iron waterwheel in England, spanning a diameter. The present mill worked until 1957 grinding all kinds of grain for animal feed, but ceased operation upon the death of the miller, who is the present owner's father. After a great deal of restoration work, the mill was re-opened in 2008. History The mill stands below the Oldbury Viaduct of the Severn Valley Railway which runs close by. The earliest reference to the mill and its surrounding land appears around the late 15th century, when it was known as \\"Donynges\\" or \\"Dunnings\\" Mill. The property was originally part of the Pitchford estate of the Ottley family, who owned much of the land in Bridgnorth and surrounding parishes. The mill remained in the hands of the Pitchford estate until the 18th century. In the early centuries the mill was probably worked by an itinerant journeyman miller – someone who would visit the mill only when there was work to be done. The mill has been enlarged and altered several times. The original structure would have had no resemblance to the present building. Originally it would have been a low structure with two floors and extending parallel to the present wheel. It is probable that the old wheel would have been constructed of wood instead of iron, been much smaller than the present wheel, and would have been located on the opposite end of the building. The entrance where corn was delivered also was likely in another location. The earliest known resident millers, the Crowther family, enlarged the mill and likely built proper living accommodation at that time, though the mill could have also been enlarged prior to their involvement. It is likely the first enlargement would have taken place around the early 17th century, when land was obtained to construct the upper pool. When this pool was made, a small mill was built under its dam. This smaller mill was known locally as the \\"mill in the hole\\", or Clover Mill. All that remains of this smaller mill is the building's back wall and the wheel pit. The newest part of the building, the \\"L\\" extension, was the last addition and provided a kitchen, bedroom and attic/bedroom. The present wheel was originally cast at Coalbrookdale in 1854, installed around the middle of the 19th century and replaced an earlier wheel on the same site. Documents show that as early as 1843 a steam engine had been purchased to work in conjunction with the present wheel. Because of the lack of resources, little modernisation of the house had taken place since Victorian times. This state of affairs continued until 1946 when the miller and resident at that time, Henry Thomason, wired the house for electricity. Though the house had lights and power, Thomason refused to electrify the mill, saying it would be dangerous. When Thomason died in 1957, the mill sat unused for a time.  Restoration  In 1958, the mill was restored. A tremendous amount of work went into the restoration, which included fixing water damage to the wheel, rebuilding several walls around the wheel pit, installing a new steel axle, replacing millstones and their timber framework, replacing floorboards, windows and more. Great care was taken to use old materials, mostly obtained from demolition sites. In 2007 the mill was awarded a £67,500 grant from GrantScape Community Heritage Fund to reinstate the secondary water feed to the wheel – this involved reinstating both a large feed pool and underground pipe, and the reconstruction of the overwheel water tank which had been removed in the mid 1960s when it became unsafe. While this work was being planned the mill was badly damaged by serious flooding during the summer of 2007. A grant from the Shropshire Tourism Action Plan programme for European Rural Development Funds was obtained to upgrade the site and improve visitor access. Other funding from the Society of Protection of Ancient Buildings, Bridgnorth District Council and the Midlands Mills Group, along with money raised through a public appeal, helped restore the wheel and workings so three sets of millstones could turn once again. The culmination of these three projects was marked by a re-opening in July 2008. During 2008 work to uncover the ruin of the smaller mill was also carried out. Fragments of mill stones, one large English mill stone, and evidence of an even older water wheel were exposed during the excavations.

It was in response to plans to close the National Workshops, created by the Second Republic in order to provide work and a minimal source of income for the unemployed. The National Guard, led by General Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, was called out to quell the rebellion. Things did not go peacefully and over 10,000 people were either killed or injured, while 4,000 insurgents were deported to Algeria. This marked the end of the hopes of a \\"Democratic and Social Republic\\" (République démocratique et sociale) and the victory of the liberals over the Radical Republicans. Background During this time, France was in a period of internal turmoil and had gone through many revolutions, such as those of July 1830 and the February 1848. A provisional government, called the Second Republic, was declared after the abdication of Louis Philippe in February. This was a democratic republic and immediately democratic reforms were being enacted, including universal male suffrage. To combat unemployment, the National Workshops were created which provided jobs and wages. These Workshops were a tremendous success attracting many unemployed persons; however, to fund these Workshops new taxes were applied to lands. This alienated land owners, among them peasants, from the provisional government as they did not like the idea of paying money so that the unemployed could have the \\"right to work\\". As a result, these land taxes were flouted, causing a financial problem for the Second Republic. On 23 April 1848, the French people elected a mainly moderate and conservative constituent assembly; this angered radicals in Paris, who saw this as contrary to their vision. The radicals invaded the assembly, as they believed that their democratic republic was being eroded away. This action was quickly thwarted; however, it sparked fear in conservatives, who were becoming a parliamentary majority. Soon, the conservative majority closed down the National Workshops, which sparked three days of bloody unrest. Uprising Painting of a barricade on Rue Soufflot (with the Panthéon behind), Paris, June 1848. By Horace Vernet. Rue Saint-Maur-Popincourt after the attack by General Lamoricière's troops, 26 June 1848 On 23 June, the Comte de Falloux's committee issued a decree stating the Workshops would be closed in three days and that the options were that young men could join the army, provincials could return home or they could simply be dismissed. The anger surrounding the closing of the Workshops increased, and shortly after that, the uprising began. In sections of the city, hundreds of barricades were thrown up which blocked communication and reduced the mobility of persons. The National Guard was called out to halt rioting; this sparked fighting once the guard and protesters clashed. The labourers had now become insurgents and were breaking stones to use as barricades. The numbers of military members were estimated to be over 40,000; however, the number of insurgents was estimated to be higher and was growing as they traveled from house to house recruiting other citizens to join them, threatening them with death if they refused. The insurgents also seized many armories to gather weapons. By 26 of June, the revolution was over, and more than 10,000 people were either killed or injured, including about 1,500 troops and about 3,000 insurgents killed. Among the dead was Denis Auguste Affre, Archbishop of Paris, killed while trying to negotiate peace. The Archbishop was led to believe that his presence at the barricades might be the means of restoring peace. He accordingly applied to General Cavaignac, who warned him of the risk he was about to incur. Soon afterwards, the firing having ceased at his request, he appeared on the barricade at the entrance to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, accompanied by M. Albert, of the national guard, who wore the dress of a workingman, and bore a green branch as a sign of peace, and by Tellier, a devoted servant. His reception was not very favorable, and he had spoken only a few words, when the insurgents, hearing some shots, and thinking they were betrayed, opened fire on the National Guard, and the Archbishop fell.Grey, Francis. \\"Denis Auguste Affre.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 19 July 2019 Aftermath The Archbishop's public funeral on 7 July was one of the most striking spectacles of its kind. Over 4,000 insurgents were deported to Algeria. After the insurgents were crushed, all ideas of a revolution were abandoned. The French Constitution of 1848 was adopted, stating that executive power should be wielded by a President of the Republic and that the people should elect this president every four years. Once a president was elected he would have the power to appoint Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The constitution provided provision for an Assembly of 750 legislators who were to be elected by the people every three years.; for a French Analysis of this Constitution, Arnaud Coutant, 1848, quand la republique combattait la democratie, mare et martin 2009 After the constitution was enacted, elections were held and Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was elected.

Casting Actress Isla Fisher was nineteen when she joined the cast of Home and Away in 1994, shortly after finishing up her role of Robyn Devereaux on Paradise Beach. Fisher was cast alongside Shane Ammann in the respective roles of Shannon and Curtis Reed. In an interview with Rachel Browne of The Sun-Herald, Fisher spoke of her success and experiences on the show. \\"I would be stupid to let it go to my head because it could all end tomorrow and I would just fade back into obscurity.\\" She added: \\"I like working on Home And Away but it's a heavy workload so I get stressed out a lot, We work about 15 hours a day, including the time it takes to learn lines. \\"I know a lot of people work those sort of hours but I think we really feel it because most of us are young and fairly inexperienced.

She begins starving herself and develops anorexia. Shannon manages to convince everyone that she is fine, and although she skips family meals, it takes her guardian Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrance) a long time to realise something is wrong. Shannon faints and almost drowns while she is out swimming one day. After she is rescued, her friends and family rush her to the hospital for treatment, and she begins a long recovery process. Katherine Walker Producers explored the character's background further with the introduction of her biological mother, politician Katherine Walker (Linden Wilkinson) in 1996. The storyline begins with Shannon deciding to find her mother, against Pippa's advice. The state's fostering department arrange a meeting between Shannon and her mother, who does not show up. Instead, Katherine watches Shannon from afar, as she cannot gather the courage to speak to her. An Inside Soap writer explained that Shannon was fostered by Elizabeth Reed when she was 12 years old. Elizabeth eventually adopted Shannon and her foster brother Curtis. Elizabeth was later killed in a car accident. The writer thought that Shannon did not need rejection from her mother in addition to her recent \\"teenage problems\\". Katherine feels that with her growing political career, she does not want a scandal, but she returns to Summer Bay as she wants to see how Shannon has turned out. At the same time, Shannon is tasked with interviewing Katherine. She is unaware of their connection, until she recognises a ring Katherine is wearing from her childhood memories of her mother. Katherine appears to want to get to know her daughter, but Shannon soon realises that she is just using their connection to improve her political ambitions. Sexuality Shannon was bisexual. In her final storyline it was implied that she had moved away with a female partner, but never directly stated. Shannon has several romantic relationships with male characters during her time in the show, but formed a close relationship with Mandy Thomas (Rachael Blake), an author who inspires her to pursue a career in writing. Her friendship with Mandy, a gay older woman, leaves Shannon questioning her own sexuality. Departure Fisher chose to leave the serial in June 1997. She admitted that she was sad to leave the show, but she wanted to go and do other things. Fisher moved to London after leaving Australia, before moving to Paris, where she was to attend the L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq, a theatre and arts training school. Her character's final storyline saw her choose between her partner Lachlan Fraser (Richard Grieve) or Mandy, who has recently returned to the Bay. Fisher did not think Shannon and Lachie's relationship was working out, and Mandy's arrival had made her realise how much she had missed her. She commented, \\"And although she loves Lachie as a friend, it's not to the degree that she loves Mandy.\\" Shannon opts to leave the Bay for Paris, leaving Lachie behind. Steven Murphy and Simon Timblick of Inside Soap branded her exit at the time as \\"the most controversial departure in the show's history\\". However, Fisher was happy with it and glad her character was shown doing what makes her happy. She added, \\"Love is love – it doesn't matter if it's between a boy and a boy, a girl and a girl or a girl and a boy.\\" Storylines Shannon and Curtis arrive in Summer Bay to be fostered by Michael (Dennis Coard) and Pippa Ross.

Born in South Carolina, he commanded a brigade in A.P. Hill's famous \\"Light Division\\" and was wounded several times. Ezra Warner's book, Generals in Gray, claims that \\"McGowan's career and reputation were not excelled by any other brigade commander in the Army of Northern Virginia.\\"Warner, pp. 201–202 Following reconstruction, he was elected to the United States Congress but refused to take his seat, later serving as an Associate Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court.Brooks, pp. 72–77 Early life and education Born to Irish parents in the Laurens District of South Carolina, McGowan's father was a prosperous farmer who had intended his son to study law. McGowan attended and graduated from South Carolina College in 1841, where he was a member of the Clariosophic Society.Morgan, p. 31 Subsequently, he studied law in Abbeville and was admitted to the bar. Prior to the Civil War, McGowan practiced law as partner of Thomas C. Perrin and served in state politics. He volunteered for service in the Mexican–American War and enlisted as a private in the Palmetto Regiment. He was commended for his gallantry near Mexico City, rose to the rank of captain and served as quartermaster and staff officer.Tucker, p. 1321 Career=American Civil War In late 1860 he was appointed to command a brigade of the South Carolinian militia, being a major general in the same, and was present at the attack on Fort Sumter. At the First Battle of Bull Run, McGowan served as an aide-de-camp on the staff of General Milledge Bonham. In September 1861 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 14th South Carolina Infantry; and became the Colonel of the regiment in April 1862. The 14th was assigned to Maxcy Gregg's brigade in A.P. Hill's Light Division. After Gregg was killed in the Battle of Fredericksburg, McGowan was promoted to brigadier general (to rank from January 17, 1863) and took command of the Light Division's South Carolina brigade. One of his fellow officers was Abner M. Perrin, the nephew of his former law partner, who would succeed him in command of the regiment. Except for when wounded, McGowan commanded this brigade for the rest of the war, surrendering with it at Appomattox Court House. McGowan was wounded four times during the Civil War. The first occurrence was at Cold Harbor during the Seven Days Battles on June 27, 1862, where he was bruised in the right side by canister. The second wound happened at Second Manassas when McGowan was hit in the thigh. McGowan suffered his worst wound at Chancellorsville. A Minié ball severely injured McGowan's leg below the knee. Although he kept the leg, it was not until February 1864 that he was able to return to field command. McGowan received his final wound at Spotsylvania where he was hit and suffered a minor wound to the forearm. Reconstruction Returning to Abbeville after the war ended, McGowan was elected to Congress as a member of the Conservative Party, but refused his seat. He became a leader in the fight against \\"carpetbagger\\" influences in the state's legislature. He was elected as an associate justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court in 1879 and served there until July 1894.

She served as a commissioned ship for 10 years and 10 months. Whitley (AKA-91) was laid down on 2 May 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Co. under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1191), launched on 22 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. John R. Reilly, delivered to the Navy on 21 September 1944, and commissioned that same day, Comdr. Albert C. Thompson, USNR, in command. Service history=World War II, 1944-1945 Following shakedown training out of San Diego, Whitley loaded cargo at San Francisco and sailed on 9 November, bound for the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived at Oahu on 27 November and remained in the islands until late January 1945 conducting amphibious training and testing amphibious equipment and techniques. On 27 January, the attack cargo ship departed Pearl Harbor and steamed for the western Pacific. The ship arrived in Eniwetok lagoon on 5 February, took on fuel and supplies, and then continued her voyage on the 7th. She arrived in the Marianas soon thereafter and conducted landing rehearsals at Saipan and Tinian until 16 February when she got underway for the Bonin Islands. The attack cargo ship arrived off Iwo Jima at dawn on the 19th and began disembarking elements of the 5th Marine Division. She remained in the vicinity of Iwo Jima for eight days in all, but her only brush with combat came on the night of 23 and 24 February when her anti-aircraft battery briefly and inconclusively engaged two Japanese aircraft. In the evening of 27 February, she joined a convoy bound via the New Hebrides for Guadalcanal. The ship stopped at Espiritu Santo on 15 March and embarked members of the Royal New Zealand Air Force for transportation to Guadalcanal. At the latter island, she exchanged the New Zealanders for a complement of Hawaii-bound Marines. Whitley arrived back at Oahu on 16 April. She conducted voyage repairs at Pearl Harbor and then underwent refresher training near Maui until 11 May when she left Hawaii with a convoy bound for San Francisco, where she arrived on 18 May. Two days later, she sailed for Aberdeen, Washington, where she loaded cargo bound for Hawaii. Whitley arrived at Oahu on 12 June and, after a 10-day stopover, got underway for the ammunition depot at Bangor, Washington. There, in mid-July, the attack cargo ship took on another cargo for Hawaii, returned to Pearl Harbor later in the month, and remained there through the end of hostilities on 15 August. Post-war operations, 1945 The ship departed Oahu on 23 August and arrived in Lingayen Gulf in the Philippines on 24 September. There, she embarked troops of the Army's 27th Regimental Combat Team (RCT). On 1 October, she set sail for Japan and arrived off Wakayama on the 7th. After more than a fortnight's wait while minesweepers cleared the mines from Nagoya Channel, she anchored in Ise Bay near Nagoya on 27 October and began unloading her passengers and their equipment. She departed Nagoya on 1 November and set course for the Marianas. She entered Apra Harbor, Guam, on the 8th, embarked Navy officers and men for transportation home; and began her homeward voyage on 17 November. Following stops at Oahu, Panama, and Jacksonville, Florida, Whitley arrived at Norfolk on 2 January 1946. 1946-1951 Repairs at Norfolk preceded a series of voyages between ports on the east coast — such as Bayonne, New Jersey, and Norfolk, Virginia — and places in the North Atlantic — such as NS Argentia, Newfoundland; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Narsarsuaq, Greenland. In November, she began the first of three round-trip voyages from the east coast to Bremerhaven in Germany. Those four voyages occupied her time completely until August 1947. Between August 1947 and May 1949, she made a series of training cruises and supply voyages from Norfolk and Bayonne to various locations in the Caribbean area. In May and June 1949, she added the Mediterranean Sea to her itinerary with a round- trip voyage from the east coast, via Casablanca, to Naples, Italy, where she embarked detaches from the 6th Fleet for transportation home. She arrived back in Norfolk on 29 June and resumed her passenger and cargo runs to bases in the Caribbean area. That employment occupied her time until the summer of 1950. On 12 July 1950, she embarked upon a voyage which took her to Thule, Greenland, and to Cornwallis Island in the far northern reaches of Canada. She returned to the United States at Boston on 31 August and spent the remainder of 1950 and the entire year of 1951 plying the waters along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean engaged in training exercises and transporting people and supplies between various bases. The only exception to that routine came in April and May 1951 when she made a round-trip voyage from Norfolk to Casablanca, Morocco, and back. 1952-1954 The year 1952 brought with it increased duty in European and African waters. On 16 January, she put to sea from Norfolk, bound, via Casablanca, for Naples and Genoa in Italy. She returned to Norfolk on 5 March; but, after a logistics run to Newfoundland in April, she embarked upon another voyage to the Mediterranean on 10 May. After visiting Golfe Juan and Naples, she headed back to the United States, arriving in Norfolk on 25 June. Two months of local operations ensued. However, on 26 August, the attack cargo ship headed back to Europe — this time to Greenock, Scotland, to participate in a NATO exercise, \\"Operation Mainbrace\\", conducted off the coast of Norway. At the conclusion of the exercise, she visited Portsmouth, England, before returning to Norfolk where she arrived on 11 October and resumed local operations and training and supply cruises to the Caribbean area. In November and December 1953, she made another round-trip voyage to Casablanca and Naples to carry cargo to the 6th Fleet. She returned to Norfolk on 23 December and then conducted local operations until 2 March 1954, when she began another deployment in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet. She sailed direct to Naples but, on the homeward voyage, stopped at Casablanca and at Portsmouth, England. She returned to Norfolk on 22 April and resumed her normal routine. Later in the year, she made her final voyage to the Mediterranean and then conducted fleet exercises in the West Indies. Decommissioning and sale, 1955-1973 On 29 January 1955, she entered the Monti Marine Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, to begin inactivation overhaul. In April 1955, she moved south to Charleston, South Carolina, to complete the inactivation process. Whitley was decommissioned at Charleston on 16 August 1955. She remained inactive, berthed with the Charleston Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, until 1 July 1960, when her name was struck from the Navy List, and she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup. She was reinstated on the Navy List on 1 December 1961 and then transferred to the Italian Navy in February 1962 as a loan. She served as Etna (A 5328) until 1 May 1973. She was returned to the United States Navy and simultaneously sold to the Italian Navy. Her name was struck from the Navy List for the last time on 1 May 1973. The Etna was scrapped at Naples in July 1979. Awards Whitley earned one battle star during World War II.

She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 3 February 2006. Belle's storylines included finding her birth mother, a drug addiction, her relationship with Aden Jefferies and being diagnosed with cancer. In 2009, it was announced that Tovey had quit the show and the writers took the decision to kill off the character. Belle made her last appearance on 11 August 2009. Casting Tovey joined Home and Away in 2006 when she was 18. The character of Belle was her first television role. On joining the cast, Tovey said she was \\"overwhelmed\\" and found it \\"daunting\\". She added \\"It was hard not to feel intimidated and nervous about joining the cast, this was really my first television role, so it was a huge step\\". Character development=Characterisation Belle is described as being a \\"cheeky, extroverted young girl\\". She was full of insecurity from her \\"disciplined and controlling\\" upbringing. She craved love and attention from her parents, which they never gave to her. Belle's parents were shocked to discover their daughter was rejecting their conservative lifestyle and hanging out with the wrong crowd. On her character Tovey said \\"Belle is fantastic, she's sassy and fun with quite a mouth on her! We have also seen a more vulnerable side to Belle with her romance with Aden this year and next year, we will see Belle go on a bit of a downward spiral which is a good challenge as an actor\\". Introduction Tovey explained that her character comes to Summer Bay shortly after learning that she was adopted, as her birth mother lives nearby. A homeless Belle befriends Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) and he agrees to let her stay in his bedroom, though he keeps her presence a secret from his foster parents, and tells her that someone in the house is sick. Belle is soon discovered by Ric's girlfriend Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson), who Tovey said is \\"a bit shocked, as you can imagine!\\" Ric's foster mother Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) hears them, and Ric and Belle explain everything to her. While Sally is sympathetic, she tells Ric that Belle cannot stay as her husband Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) has cancer. Tovey told an Inside Soap columnist that Ric just tells Belle to go without explaining why, so she \\"doesn't realise why it's such a big deal\\" and sneaks back in later on. When she goes to use the bathroom, Belle comes face to face with Flynn and they are both startled, which leads to Belle knocking him down the stairs as she runs away. Tovey said that Belle is so panicked that she does not think to stop and help an unconscious Flynn. Painkiller addiction In 2009, producers used the character to explore painkiller addiction. The storyline meant Tovey had to spend weeks crying and shouting, but she said that she was determined to do a good job and worked hard on the scenes. Tovey revealed that the addiction storyline made a bigger impression on her than any of Belle's other plots. She also stated, \\"It was very challenging at points but I have to say I was quite relieved when it was over because it was quite exhausting at points\\". Belle spends weeks lying to cover up her addiction and she becomes \\"erratic\\". Her painkiller addiction is discovered by her boyfriend, Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance), after he gives her a necklace and she sells it to buy more drugs. Tovey told Carolyn Stewart from TV Week that it was \\"a huge deal\\" for Belle to give up the necklace to her dealer, but she has nothing else to give him. Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) spots the necklace in a pawnshop and tells Aden, who is heartbroken. Tovey explained, \\"He's so in love with her, but by pawning the necklace, she's essentially saying that the drugs mean more to her than he does. She might not think that's true, but the fact is she's put her need for drugs before everything else in her life.\\" When Aden confronts Belle, she denies taking the pills, but he tears the room apart and finds her stash. He then \\"absolutely loses it\\" when Belle continues lying to him and storms out. Belle later tells Aden that she will try to get off the drugs, but he know that he cannot be around to witness it, as he went through a similar situation with his alcoholic father. Tovey noted that everything Belle said brought back bad memories for Aden. She also commented that Aden questions everything Belle ever told him and realises that she is no longer the person he fell in love with. A devastated Belle sees that she has pushed him too far and their relationship is over. Tovey said Belle \\"feels she has nothing left\\" and that \\"her whole world seems to be crumbling\\" because of her addiction. Tovey thought that fans of the couple should be worried as there seemed to be no way to get through the situation, as Belle's addiction had worn them both \\"down to their bare bones.\\" Departure In April 2009, Tovey announced that she had quit Home and Away. On her decision to leave, Tovey said \\"I can't stress enough what a hard decision it was and that I nearly changed my mind a few times. I still feel sad about it, but I really just wanted a change\\". Tovey's final scenes were filmed in the same month and shown on Australian screens in August. Tovey said she found filming her final scenes \\"heartbreaking\\", but she said that she was happy with the writers' decision to kill off the character. Storylines Shortly after finding out she is adopted, Belle arrives in the Bay to find her birth mother.

Well, it is if you're on about the strung-out journalist. She's spent the past weeks driving us up the wall with her whingeing, while at the same time gobbling any pills she can get her hands on. Thank goodness she got the sack from her job at the paper otherwise who knows how long the storyline would have rumbled on for.\\" Another writer for the Daily Record commented on Belle's last scenes, noting that she \\"managed to make it to death's door without losing her looks\\".

While his work has a regional feel, he ignored the colonial revival look so popular in Virginia. Goodman was quoted in the 1968 survey book Architecture in Virginia as saying that he aimed to \\"get away from straight historical reproduction.\\" Goodman, who designed the original National Airport outside of Washington, D.C. and served as main architect of the Hollin Hills neighborhood in Alexandria, Virginia, attended the Illinois Institute of Technology. He came to D.C. in 1934 to work as the designing architect in the Public Buildings Administration. He later served as head architect at the United States Treasury Department and the Air Transport Command. After World War II he worked closely with Robert C.

Projects Other projects included the 1964 Unitarian Church in Arlington, Virginia at 4444 Arlington Blvd. His residence, Goodman House, was built in 1954 at 514 Quaker Lane in Alexandria. In Reston, he designed a \\"cluster\\" of townhouses in the woods above Lake Anne known as Hickory Cluster. In the Southwest Waterfront Community of Washington, D.C. and just north of Fort McNair between N and O Streets and Delaware Avenue and 4th Street, SW, Goodman designed the glass and aluminum clad River Park Mutual Homes, which consists of two conjoined high-rise buildings and several clusters of flat and barrel-roof top townhouses.

All three of these are Grade II* listed buildings and are built in a classical style similar to other buildings on the street. Liverpool Central Library during rebuild Interior view of the library prior to its 2013 refurbishment Previous to the creation of this public library was England's first subscription library (1758-1942), latterly known as The Lyceum, Liverpool, but often referred to as the Liverpool Library. 750,000 people visited the museum in 2017. In 2018, the library won The Bookseller’s Library of the Year Award. Rebuilding In May 2008 it was announced that some of the complex of buildings that hold the Central Library were to be demolished and replaced with modern buildings suitable for use with modern IT services. The historic buildings in the complex would be refurbished to provide modern facilities and was designed by the Architects Austin-Smith:Lord. In October 2009 the proposed rebuild was shown to the public. The main library building on William Brown Street closed on 23 July 2010, while closed, a temporary service operated from next door, on the second floor of Liverpool World Museum. The refurbished building features a central atrium, with a series of open-plan floors. The atrium is topped with a glass dome, and the building has a roof terrace, with views out over the city centre. It re-opened to the public on Friday 17 May 2013. At the entrance to the library is a 72 foot granite walkway, inlaid with the titles of literary classics. The titles contain a riddle, a series of letters picked out in red which spell out the title of a small but eye-catching item in the library's collection. The riddle was included to provoke the interest of visitors, and was presented as a competition at the museum's re-opening. 500 people took part, with 200 solving the riddle, and three winners were chosen in October 2013, five months after opening. The library has not revealed the answer to the riddle, in order to preserve the puzzle for future visitors.Literary detectives uncover library secret BBC News 23 October 2013; retrieved 11 May 2019Liverpool Central Library Entrance Riddle at atlasobscura.com; retrieved 11 May 2019 Library group It is a member of the Libraries Together: Liverpool Learning Partnership (evolved from Liverpool Libraries Group) which formed in 1990.

This is similar to the concepts of inflation and deflation except that escalation is specific to an item or class of items (not as general in nature), it is often not primarily driven by changes in the money supply, and it tends to be less sustained. While escalation includes general inflation related to the money supply, it is also driven by changes in technology, practices, and particularly supply- demand imbalances that are specific to a good or service in a given economy. For example, while general inflation (e.g., consumer price index) in the US was less than 5% in the 2003-2007 time period, steel prices increased (escalated) by over 50% because of supply-demand imbalance. Cost escalation may contribute to a project cost overrun but it is not synonymous with it. Over long periods of time, as market supply and demand imbalances are corrected, escalation will tend to more-or-less equal inflation unless there are sustained technology or efficiency changes in a market. Escalation is usually calculated by examining the changes in price index measures for a good or service. Future escalation can be forecast using econometrics. Unfortunately, because escalation (unlike inflation) may occur in a micro- market, and it may be hard to measure with surveys, indices can be difficult to find. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has a price index for construction wages and compensation (what the construction contractor's labor cost), but has none for the prices that owners must pay the construction contractor for their services. In cost engineering and project management usage, escalation and cost contingency are both considered risk funds, that should be included in project estimates and budgets. When escalation is minimal, it is sometimes estimated together with contingency. However, this is not a best practice, particularly when escalation is significant.\\"Escalation Estimation: Working With Economics Consultants\\", John K. Hollmann; Larry R.

It involves using elastic dynamics and mathematical optimizations to decide the body-shapes during motion and interaction with forces. It has various applications within realistic simulations for medicine, 3D computer animation and virtual reality. Background Methods for simulating deformation, such as changes of shapes, of dynamic bodies involve intensive calculations, and several models have been developed. Some of these are known as free-form deformation, skeleton-driven deformation, dynamic deformation and anatomical modelling. Skeletal animation is well known in computer animation and 3D character simulation. Because of the calculation insensitivity of the simulation, few interactive systems are available which realistically can simulate dynamic bodies in real-time. Being able to interact with such a realistic 3D model would mean that calculations would have to be performed within the constraints of a frame rate which would be acceptable via a user interface. Recent research has been able to build on previously developed models and methods to provide sufficiently efficient and realistic simulations. The promise for this technique can be as widespread as mimicking human facial expressions for perception of simulating a human actor in real- time or other cell organisms. Using skeletal constraints and parameterized force to calculate deformations also has the benefit of matching how a single cell has a shaping skeleton, as well as how a larger living organism might have an internal bone skeleton - such as the vertebrae. The generalized external body force simulations makes elasticity calculations more efficient, and means real-time interactions are possible. Basic theory There are several components to such a simulation system: *a polygon mesh defining the body shape of the model *a coarse volumetric mesh using finite element methods to ensure complete integration over the model *line constraints corresponding to internal skeleton and instrumented to the model *linearizing of equations of motion to achieve interactive rates *hierarchical regions of the mesh associated with skeletal lines *blending of locally linearlized simulations *a control lattice through subdivision fitting the model by surrounding and covering it *a hierarchical basis containing functions which will provide values for deformation of each lattice domain with calculations of these hierarchical functions similar to that of lazy wavelets Rather than fitting the object to the skeleton, as is common, the skeleton is used to set constraints for deformation. Also the hierarchical basis means that detail levels can be introduced or removed when needed - for example, observing from a distance or hidden surfaces. Pre-calculated poses are used to be able to interpolate between shapes and achieve realistic deformations throughout motions. This means traditional keyframes are avoided. There are performance tuning similarities between this technique and procedural generation, wavelet and data compression methods. Algorithmic considerations To achieve interactivity there are several optimizations necessary which are implementation specific. Start by defining the object you wish to animate as a set (i.e. define all the points): p : \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3 : (x, t) \\\\mapsto p(x, t) . Then get a handle on it. Let p_S : S \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^3 Then you need to define the rest state of the object (the non-wobble point): r(x) = \\\\sum_{a} r_a \\\\emptyset ^a (x) = r_a \\\\emptyset ^a (x) = x Projects Projects are taking place to further develop this technique and presenting results to SIGGRAPH, with available reference of details. Academic institutions and commercial enterprises like Alias Systems Corporation (the makers of the Maya rendering software), Intel and Electronic Arts are among the known proponents of this work. There are also videos available showcasing the techniques, with editors showing interactivity in real-time with realistic results. The computer game Spore also has showcased similar techniques.

History The station was specifically used for ship liner traffic, opening on 12 June 1895. It was accessed via the Victoria and Waterloo tunnels. It had two main platforms of and , with a centre release track between them, and a bay platform, all covered by a roof. Beyond the buffers were waiting rooms and an inspector's office. It was rebuilt in 1945 after bomb damage. On the opposite side of Princes Parade from the station were the Customs examination rooms and the floating Princes Landing Stage, where the ships berthed.Railway Magazine June 1950 p. 372 Due to weight restrictions on the line, it was worked by a pair of LNWR Webb Coal Tank locomotives which took trains from Edge Hill railway station until strengthening of the infrastructure around the docks area in 1950 allowed large mainline locomotives to travel through. To open the line for a train the signalman had to walk about fitting six Annett's keys into locks at the swing bridge and points. A pilot with a red flag walked a similar distance in front of each train that arrived and departed.Railway Magazine June 1950 p. 373 The station was closed when the Belfast Steamship Company's Ulster Queen hit the swing bridge at the entrance to Prince's Dock on 21 October 1949, reopening on 27 March 1950.Friday 21 October 1949, Hull Daily Mail The station was heavily used during both World Wars, receiving troop trains from all over the United Kingdom and troops entering the country, however a decline in Atlantic liner traffic in the 1960s due to the growing popularity of air travel saw its use decline. 1972 view of branch-line with MV Ulster Queen and the Liver Building in the background.

He made his first appearance on 21 November 1989 and remained a regular for almost eight years, before Bowler opted to quit in 1996, leading to his character’s exit the following year. Introduced as the patriarch of the new Tate family, who were brought in as part of the show’s rebranding, in 1989, many of Frank’s storylines revolved around his volatile relationship with his wife Kim Tate (Claire King). During his time in the programme, Frank and Kim divorced and remarried before his death - brought on by her return to the village after being presumed dead - ended their second marriage. Other notable storylines included his addiction to alcohol; coming to terms with his daughter Zoe’s (Leah Bracknell) sexuality; sparking a conflict with his own son Chris (Peter Amory); discovering Kim's affair with local handyman Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey); and his various business dealings and feuds with the likes of Dave's father Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze), his close friend Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby), and fellow businessman Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic). Storylines=1989–1997 Frank first appeared in November 1989 when Matt Skilbeck (Frederick Pyne) visited Home Farm to speak to him over the condition of several ewes in his company, which Matt had refused to allow Chris Tate (Peter Amory) to have. After a tense confrontation between them, Frank revealed that Chris, the manager who Matt despised and wanted sacked, was in fact his son. Having made his fortune in haulage, he and Kim bought Home Farm. The two continued to run Tate Haulage along with Chris, In December, they are joined by Chris' sister and Frank's daughter Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell). Frank and Kim's married life was shattered in 1992 when Kim had an affair with gamekeeper, Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon). Frank subsequently threw her out and they divorced. Frank was deeply affected by his separation from Kim and turned to alcohol to drown his sorrows. In 1993, Frank was deemed a hero during the plane crash that rocked Emmerdale in December when he helped local farmer Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) rebuild the bridge that was demolished by the crash and let emergency services across. During the plane crash, Frank stopped Kim running into her burning stables to rescue her horses. Frank and Kim soon reconciled and they remarried in 1994. With his life back on track, Frank stopped drinking and he and Kim enjoyed their remarriage. However, in 1995, Home Farm employee Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey) caught Kim's eye and they began an affair. Frank hired a spy to watch over Kim and Dave, and eventually caught them in bed together, uttering the line \\"What do you call this Dave - overtime?\\". Kim later discovered she was pregnant and gave birth to baby James in September 1996. Frank paid Kim £1 million to name the baby as his, although Frank was eventually revealed to be James's biological father. Dave died on Boxing Day 1996 while rescuing baby James from a fire. In 1997, Kim took her next plot against Frank by faking her own death and got Frank imprisoned for her murder. After Frank was released, Kim shocked him by turning up on his doorstep on 22 May 1997. Kim revealed that the woman who had in fact been killed was a double and, after a heated argument, Frank suffered a massive heart attack. As Frank lay dying, Kim uttered the last words he ever heard, which were \\"You're a dinosaur Frank, and we all know what happened to them\\". Zoe found Frank the next morning and he tried to tell her of Kim's return but died and the true circumstances of his death were never exposed. One of Frank's biggest secrets were revealed two years after his death when Tate Haulage employee Liam Hammond (Mark Powley) - who took Chris hostage - revealed that he was Frank's illegitimate son and that he was the result of an affair between Frank and an unnamed woman. Chris bonded with Liam, but Liam was shot and killed by Zoe when she was trying to \\"save\\" Chris. Following Chris's death in 2003, he was buried with Frank. In 2009, Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) showed her and Chris's son Noah Dingle (Jack Downham) Frank and Chris's grave. In October 2010, Holly Barton passed out on Frank and Chris's grave, following drug use. In July 2020, Kim Tate tells Her and Frank's son James who now goes by the name Jamie that Frank would be turning in his grave if he knew how weak and pathetic Jamie was acting following the breakdown of his marriage.

The station serves the Albany area. The station is currently owned by Loud Media. History WMVI signed on the air in 1973, at 1170 kHz with 250 watts, daytime only operation. It was originally owned by John Farrina and had a middle-of-the-road (MOR) format, focusing on standards and big bands. Early disc jockeys included Don Kirby, John Butler, and Rene' Tetro. WMVI had a race wire installed and broadcast thoroughbred and harness racing results, three times per hour from 1:00 pm until sign off, a unique feature in the Albany region. This helped the station gain an audience above what would normally be expected for a small radio station competing directly with larger Albany stations. WPTR legend \\"Boom Boom Branigan\\" (Joe Motto), who also owned other small AM stations around the Northeast U.S., purchased WMVI in 1979. Following the change in ownership, the station had a hybrid format of oldies, standards and big-band music, which underwent very little change until the early 1990s. During the late 1980s, WMVI had secured a construction permit to switch to 1160 kHz with 50,000 watts daytime power and modest nighttime power. However, ownership could not afford the upgrades the station needed for high-power, directional operation and the permit was left to expire. Later, WMVI did secure another permit to switch to 1160 kHz with 5 kW days/570w nights, non- directional. Coming under Branigan's ownership once again in late 1995, WMVI would return after a brief period, being off the air with an oldies/variety format which featured Branigan himself as the centerpiece of the station. Though the format proved popular with local listeners, the station had an extremely difficult time retaining advertising accounts due to repeated transmitter & 'telco' STL failures, forcing the station off the air repeatedly, sometimes for days at a time. As station employees moved to more secure jobs and operating funds became scarce, Branigan leased the station in 1998 to a group which aired Black Gospel music. Again, money shortages and aging, unreliable equipment forced Branigan to sell the station outright. In August 2000, Anastos Media bought WMVI and brought it back on the air as a testing format of 1960s–1970s music as Sunny 1160 before entering a simulcast with co-owned pop-standards station WUAM in Saratoga Springs. Two years later, WMVI would take the abandoned WABY calls as a tribute to its former rival and the station, whose death led to its rebirth. The WUAM portion of the simulcast ended in April 2008, with the format change of WUAM to an audio simulcast of local cable TV news outlet Capital News 9. Ernie Anastos sold his Albany-area stations—WABY, WQAR, WUAM and its translator W291BY, and WVKZ—to Empire Broadcasting Corporation in June 2012, at a purchase price of $1.2 million. The transaction was consummated on September 7, 2012. W291BY would later switch its originating station from WUAM to WABY. In May 2014, WABY began simulcasting on sister WUAM, which dropped their simulcast of Capital News 9. The simulcast was moved full-time on June 23, while WABY began stunting with Gregorian chants. On June 26, at 4 pm, the station adopted an adult hits format, branded as \\"Mix 106.1.\\"https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89254/new-mix-in-albany/ On June 26, 2014, the WABY call letters moved to WUAM, while 1160 adopted the WAIX calls to match the \\"Mix\\" branding.

This allows for a higher voltage rating than an air dielectric using a smaller total volume. However, many dielectrics have higher breakdown field strengths than vacuum: 60-170 MV/m for teflon, 470-670 MV/m for fused silica and 2000 MV/m for diamond, compared with 20-40 MV/m for vacuum. There are several different designs in vacuum variables. The most common form is inter-meshed concentric cylinders, which are contained within a glass or ceramic vacuum envelope, similar to an electron tube. A metal bellows is used to maintain a vacuum seal while allowing positional control for the moving parts of the capacitor.http://www.hatdaw.com/papers/sb_12.pdf Service Bulletin Vacuum variable Capacitors, retrieved 2012 March 12 Invention Nikola Tesla filed a patent in 1896 for a vacuum capacitor. The original use was to enhance the quality of the electrical components for handling \\"currents of high frequency and potential\\". These components were necessary for the DC impulse research which Tesla was studying. Commercial products have been available since 1942.http://www.amstechnologies.com/fileadmin/amsmedia/downloads/4317_jenningscapacitorshighvoltagevacuumandgasfilled.pdf Jennings high voltage vacuum capacitors Applications Vacuum variable capacitors are commonly used in high-voltage applications: 5000 volts (5 kV) and above. They are used in equipment such as high-powered broadcast transmitters, amateur radio RF amplifiers and large antenna tuners. Industrially they are used in plasma generating equipment, for dielectric heating, and in semiconductor manufacturing. The main applications today are RF plasmas of 2 to 160 MHz where the vacuum capacitor is used as the impedance variation part in an automatic matching network in the fabrication of chips and flat panel displays. A 12 pF 20 kV fixed vacuum capacitor A fixed-value vacuum capacitor Other variations of vacuum capacitors include fixed-value capacitors, which are designed very much like the variable versions with the exception of an adjustment mechanism. Comparison When compared to other variable capacitors, vacuum variables tend to be more precise and more stable. This is due to the vacuum itself. Because of the sealed chamber, the dielectric constant remains the same over a wider range of operating conditions. With air variable capacitors, the air moving around the plates may change the value slightly; often it is not much but in some applications it is enough to cause undesirable effects. Vacuum variable capacitors are generally more expensive than air variable capacitors. This is primarily due to their design and the materials used. Although most use copper and glass, some may use other materials such as ceramics and metals such as gold and silver. Vacuum variables also vary in adjustment mechanisms.

It is located 15 km southwest of Gabrovo on the northern slopes of the Balkan Mountains in the Bulgarka Nature Park and is close to the Sokolovo cave. Originally, a small wooden church was built in 1833 and the frescoes were finished a year later. Hristo Tsokev, a Gabrovo-born artist, donated the church icon, which represents the Virgin Mary and Christ and is considered to be miraculous. In 1862, Father Paul Zograf and his son Nikola from the village of Shipka decorated the church with frescoes. The monastery has a big yard surrounded by residential and utility buildings. In the centre of the yard, in 1865 the master Kolyu Ficheto constructed a big stone fountain with eight taps. The whole monastery was built during the Bulgarian National Revival with the strong support of the people of Gabrovo and the local villages.

GMHBA also operates eye care and dental care practices along with GP clinics. History GMHBA has roots in the Cement Workers Hospital Benefits Scheme, established in 1927 by workers at the cement works at Fyansford, on the outskirts of Geelong. By 1928 a number of similar schemes had been started for employees of other local industrial organisations. An open health fund was officially launched and opened to the public by the mayor of Geelong on 13 August 1934. The name Geelong Medical and Hospital Benefits Association (GMHBA) was adopted in 1958. In October 2009 GMHBA launched a second brand called Frank Health Insurance, which was developed to provide a simple private health insurance offering at low cost. NIB takeover bid In October 2010 Newcastle, New South Wales based health fund NIB made a $140 million takeover offer to GMHBA members. The company went public with the offer, after the GMHBA board rejected their initial offer and refused to enter into discussions. NIB was Australia's first health fund to demutualise, listing on the stock exchange in 2007. The takeover would give members an average of $1500 tax free, with some receiving as much as $6500. NIB chief Mark Fitzgibbon admitted that his company's $4 million sponsorship of the Geelong Football Club and the Lorne Pier to Pub swimming race was part of a long-term strategy to win support of Geelong locals. He also said that he intended to recruit a number of local celebrities, including GFC president Frank Costa and sports broadcaster Billy Brownless, to pressure GMHBA directors into calling a vote. GMHBA chief Ken Jarvis criticised the actions of NIB, saying his company makes a $15 million a year contribution to the Geelong economy and supported local charities. The initial $140 million offer was later increased to $161 million, and then to $180 million, before it was withdrawn by NIB in December 2010, after the GMHBA board still refused to consider the offer.

He played parts of three seasons, from 1972 until 1974, with the New York Mets. Originally drafted as a pitcher by the Mets in 1967, he did not begin his professional career until 1968 due to a shoulder injury. He was converted into an outfielder, and he started 1968 with the rookie class Marion Mets. At 19, he was drafted into the army and served 14 months in the Vietnam War. After missing the 1969 and 1970 seasons while serving in the army, Schneck continued to progress through the minor leagues until 1972, when he made his major league debut. After spending most of 1973 back in the minor leagues with the Tidewater Tides, Schneck got his longest shot at the majors in 1974. He played 93 games with the Mets that season, batting .205 with 5 home runs. However, that proved to be the end of his major league career. Schneck went 2–11 at the plate on September 11, 1974 during a 25 inning marathon night game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Those 11 at- bats tied a major league record for most AB in an extra-inning game. On December 3, 1974, Schneck was traded by the Mets with Don Hahn and Tug McGraw to the Philadelphia Phillies for Del Unser, John Stearns, and Mac Scarce. He started the 1975 season with their top farm club, the Toledo Mud Hens, and on August 5 he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for John Vukovich. He played with their top farm team, the Indianapolis Indians, until the end of the 1976 season. During that offseason, he was traded again, this time to the Chicago Cubs, for outfielder Champ Summers. After playing one more season in the minors, for the Wichita Aeros, Schneck retired. Early life Schneck graduated from Whitehall High School, where he was a pitcher.

At Duke, Chappell started in over half of their games in 1998. Chappell transferred to Michigan State University in the fall of 1998. Under the leadership of Tom Izzo, Chappell contributed to a dynamic team that won the NCAA National Title in 2000 and made it to the Final Four in 2001.

In 2004, Mike Chappell set a new NBL record after scoring an explosive 44-points in a game against the Perth Wildcats. Word of Chappell's success in the NBL reached the US, and he was selected to play for the Toronto Raptors in the 2004 NBA Summer League in Minnesota. During the 2002 NBL off- season, Chappell and the Cannons embarked on a short tour of the United States playing various college teams. On one occasion they played against the Michigan State Spartans at the Breslin Center. For that game, the Cannons featured former Michigan State player, NBA legend with the Los Angeles Lakers and one of the most decorated players in basketball history, Earvin \\"Magic\\" Johnson.

She was played by Sheila Mercier as a regular character between 1972 and 1994, with occasional guest appearances in the show after her original departure. Mercier cut back on location filming during the late 1980s and eventually left the serial in 1994 due to the gruelling schedule. Annie was one of Emmerdale's original characters, appearing in its first episode on 16 October 1972 and became the longest serving female character in the series' history. She was the soap's \\"first matriarch\\", the maternal force behind the Sugden family, who were collectively one of Emmerdale's main focal points. Over the years, the character featured in a number of storylines, including being widowed twice, coping with the deaths of various other family members, financial woes, nearly dying in a farmhouse fire, an addiction to tranquillisers and sustaining injuries in the Emmerdale plane crash, which left her in a three-month coma. Mercier and Frazer Hines, who played her on-screen son Joe Sugden, were the only two original cast members to appear in the show for its 20th anniversary. Though the character left the serial in 1994, she has made occasional appearances since this time and last appeared on-screen in February 2009, in a special tribute episode to mark the death of Clive Hornby who played her on- screen son, Jack Sugden. Mercier has previously made guest appearances in 1996 and in 2000 for a special web broadcast in which Annie talked to her troubled screen son Jack. The broadcast was available for viewers to download on the official Emmerdale website. Despite having married Amos off-screen in late 1995, she was credited upon her return in 2009 by her most famous name, Annie Sugden. Character creation and development Annie Sugden was created by Kevin Laffan, the creator of what was then known as Emmerdale Farm who also wrote the serial's first 212 episodes. Laffan was said to be \\"keen on dominant women\\" and it has been said that he created a \\"memorable heroine\\" in Annie Sugden, \\"the wife of the ne'er-do-well…who drank himself to an early grave\\" (the first episode opened with his funeral). The show originally focused upon the struggles of Annie and her family, with the first episode of Emmerdale Farm (1972) being billed as \\"the living story of the Sugden family - the excitement of country life around.\\" Actress Sheila Mercier – whose career had been mainly theatrical – was chosen to play the role and went on to be the serial's longest running original actor. Mercier has commented \\"I had done a lot of television from the stage of the Whitehall, but very little else before joining Emmerdale Farm…I remember, at first, playing to the Gods! Tristan de Vere Cole, one of the first directors on the programme, told me to take [my performance] down until it was so low I was almost muttering. Then, Gordon Flemyng - another of the directors - played back to me a scene I did so that I could see what I had done wrong.\\" In her 1994 autobiography, Mercier recalls how on so many occasions she wanted Annie to cry but the director, David Green, said \\"Annie does not cry. She cries all her tears into the pillow at night.\\" The character of Annie Sugden has been described as a firm favourite with viewers, from the opening scene of Emmerdale Farm with Annie standing in the farmhouse kitchen, to the day she left. As peacekeeper between her sons, Joe (Frazer Hines) and Jack (Andrew Burt/Clive Hornby), Annie was soon placed at the centre of the soap's action. The character was involved in numerous storylines, including marriages, bereavements, tragedies and family problems. Commenting on her \\"most gripping\\" storylines, Mercier has said, \\"Annie's daughter, Peggy Skilbeck's (Jo Kendall) death, Peggy's twins' deaths and Annie's father, Sam Pearson's (Toke Townley) death, which all called for lots of tears.\\" In the 1985 Emmerdale Farm Celebration Edition 1000 Episodes Magazine, Annie's personality is described: Annie Sugden as she appeared in 1972. Commenting on her character in 1985, Mercier said: \\"Annie Sugden has changed a great deal over the years. At the beginning she was very terse. She was the head of the family and let everyone know it. She ruled with a rod of iron. She'd had a tough life. She'd had a rough ride with her husband Jacob, who used to drink the money away and sit in the Woolpack until all hours. Her son Jack didn't live at home then and it was Annie who kept the farm together. Until Henry Wilks (Arthur Pentelow) came along they were poor farmers, living hand-to-mouth. But now things are different. Jack has made a success of Emmerdale and Henry's interest in the farm and Annie herself has made her relax. She's mellower now.\\" Despite suffering from arthritis, Mercier managed to undertake location filming for the show from 1972–1990. In the final episode of Emmerdale Farm before the transition to Emmerdale, broadcast in November 1989, she appeared on location at Lindley Farm near Harrogate, which served as the exterior for Emmerdale Farm, for scenes in which Annie greeted son Jack on his return from a trip to Italy. From the early 1990s, Sheila Mercier cut back on her appearances, usually working only in the studio. However, she appeared on location in a car during the 1993 plane crash episodes. Annie Sugden reportedly poured more than 6,000 cups of tea in the farmhouse studio, where she was most often seen. After she retired in 1994, she has appeared in only a handful of Emmerdale episodes, making guest appearances in 1995 and 1996. However, in 2000 she came out of retirement briefly to take part in a special internet mini-drama, which ran side by side with the Emmerdale television broadcast. Mercier talked live on the Net with her troubled screen son, Jack, played by Clive Hornby. The broadcast was available for viewers to download on the official Emmerdale website. Mercier was also invited to return to the Emmerdale set to celebrate with the crew at the official 30th anniversary party. In an interview in 2002, Mercier said she had no desire to return to acting, \\"I don't want to act. I watch TV, read and live like an ordinary person.\\" However, for the show's 5000th episode in May 2008 a special documentary was transmitted across the ITV network, Mercier (aged 89) made another appearance along with Hines, Frederick Pyne and Jean Rogers the actors who played Joe, Matt and Dolly Skilbeck, respectively. In February 2009, Mercier reprised the role of Annie for two episodes, where Annie attended her son Jack's funeral, following the death of actor Clive Hornby. Mercier said, \\"It will be a pleasure to return for this special tribute episode to Clive. I'm sure it will be a fitting way to celebrate the life and memory of one of Emmerdale's dearest characters\\". This was Mercier's last screen appearance prior to her death in December 2019. On 18 August 2020 it was announced Annie would die off-screen on 28 August, following Mercier's death eight months earlier. Storylines Annie Sugden is the only child of young labourer Sam Pearson and his wife Grace. Annie marries local farmer Jacob Sugden and he moves her into Emmerdale Farm. They have three children; Jack, Peggy and Joe. Annie's mother dies in the same year her daughter Peggy marries Matt Skilbeck. The audience is introduced to farmer's wife Annie Sugden in the soap's first episode in 1972. It was a time of sadness for the Sugden family, as Annie was burying her recently deceased husband, Jacob, who had died after spending much of his later years in the pub, The Woolpack, drinking away the family's farming profits. Early central storylines in the serial followed Annie as she struggled to come to terms with the death of her husband, support her family, and run Emmerdale Farm, set in the Yorkshire Dales in the fictional village of Beckindale. Matriarchal Annie aimed to rebuild the ailing farm by reuniting her two feuding sons, Jack and Joe. She sold part of Emmerdale Farm to village outsider, Henry Wilks, who had made his fortune in the wool industry and brought his business acumen to Beckindale. Early in the series, Woolpack landlord Amos Brearly decided a woman's touch was needed in his pub and proposes to Annie but she turns him down. Tragedy follows the Sugdens; Peggy dies of a brain haemorrhage a few months after giving birth to twins and three years later, Peggy's twins are killed on a level crossing, leaving Annie to comfort their father Matt. Annie's father Sam dies and Jack's wife, Pat Sugden dies two years later, forcing Annie to help Jack raise his young son Robert Sugden. A few years later, Emmerdale Farm begins collapsing due to subsidence. Although the family moves into Hawthorn Cottage, Annie remains unhappy until it was renamed Emmerdale Farm. Annie and her second husband, Leonard Kempinski, whom she had married in October, plan to go on holiday to Spain. The night they are supposed to fly out, a plane crash into the village. As Joe is driving them to the airport, the wing of the plane collides with the car. Joe escapes with a broken leg; however, Annie is in a coma for several months. The cries of her new granddaughter Victoria Sugden finally wake Annie from her coma but she is devastated to discover Leonard has died. Widowed again, Annie is left to mourn a second husband. At Jack's wedding to Sarah Connolly, Amos announces that the residents of Beckindale have decided to rename the village Emmerdale, in honour of Annie. He remarks that people had voted for the name Emmerdale as they held Annie in such high regard. After moving to Spain, Annie returns to Emmerdale the following year to bury her son Joe, who had died in a car accident. 23 years after his first proposal, Amos Brearly proposes to Annie again; this time she accepts. Annie and Amos return to Spain where they marry on 5 November 1995, though Annie returns briefly to ask Jack to sell Emmerdale Farm; he refuses. After a 13-year absence, Annie returns to the village for Jack's funeral. Jack had been staying with her in Spain and had suffered a fatal heart attack; she accompanies his body to Emmerdale. She grieves with Jack's family, which includes his widower Diane Sugden, Victoria, and his adoptive son Andy Sugden, before returning to Spain after his funeral. Following her departure, Annie is often contacted and mentioned by her relatives, many of whom go to stay with her during times of crisis. Diane rings Annie to inform her of Alan Turner's death; Annie sends flowers. Diane goes to stay with Annie after she takes ill and stays for two months. Annie donates €300 to Sarah Sugden's fundraiser page for her cancer treatment. Annie cannot attend Robert's wedding to Aaron Dingle as it is very short notice, but she hopes Robert will be happy with his new husband. The day after the wedding, Robert reveals a letter from Annie which tells him that his father Jack and grandfather Jacob would be so happy to see him settle down, and she hopes he will visit her with Aaron very soon. Following Victoria's rape, Victoria and Robert visit Annie to cheer Victoria up. Victoria visits Annie and upon her return in December, Victoria reveals to Diane that Annie was very upset to hear about Robert been sent to prison. Months later, Victoria receives a phone call from Diane with news that Annie has died peacefully at the age of 100. Victoria and Diane then head down to see Matt & Dolly Skilbeck to arrange Annie's funeral. In other media The character Annie Sugden has been the topic of several tie-in books related to the Emmerdale serial. These include Annie Sugden's Country Diary, written by Lee Mackenzie and published in 1978. The novel gives Annie's account of her childhood and early adult life in Beckindale. It is described as a \\"story of the long, hot summers between the wars, the village school and the open fields [..] Annie's heart-warming memories of the good times and the hard times amongst honest working folk in the Yorkshire dales [...] the Diary of a country lass who loves life, despite its trials and tribulations\\". The novel gives an account of Annie's parents, her \\"sensitive musical\\" mother, her \\"down-to-earth, prosaic\\" father, her \\"first and truest\\" love, Laurence Stanton, and her \\"reluctant\\" marriage to Jacob Sugden, right up until she became the owner of Emmerdale Farm. Annie Sugden's Emmerdale Farm Cookbook was also released in 1984. Reception The character was selected as one of the \\"top 100 British soap characters\\" by industry experts for a poll to be run by What's on TV, with readers able to vote for their favourite character to discover \\"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\\" References Emmerdale characters Fictional bartenders Television characters introduced in 1972 Fictional chefs Fictional farmers Female characters in television Fictional painkiller addicts ","title":"Annie Sugden"},{"id":"6283086","text":"Wabag is the capital of Enga Province, Papua New Guinea.

Combs is best known for dominance on NASCAR's lower level Dash Series in the 1970s and 1980s. He had five championships in that series, and was the all-time wins leader in that series before it closed up in 2004. Winston Cup=1981 Combs made his entrance into the series in 1981, driving for two races late in the season. Driving for the #77 of Irv Sanderson, Combs made his debut at North Wilkesboro. He qualified well, putting it in with an 11th-place lap. Eventually, rear end problems sidelined Combs to 28th. Combs again qualified well at Rockingham, but fell out once again due to mechanical problems to 34th. 1982 Combs upped his races to five starts in 1982, beginning with a 38th at Charlotte. Including that race, Combs only managed to finish two of his five starts. However, those two were fairly impressive. Both races came at Michigan and the result was a 17th place and a 13th place showing. 1983 Combs continued on his five-race pace in 1983, continuing to drive Sanderson's cars. He still struggled to finish races, falling out of two of the events. Yet, once again, if Combs finished he had good finishes. He was 13th at Charlotte, 20th at Michigan and at Atlanta, Combs grabbed his only top-10 with a solid eighth-place finish. 1984 Combs biggest year came in 1984, when he competed in twelve events. However, judging by the nine DNFs it was not exactly successful. The only races he did finish were an 18th at Charlotte, 19th at Daytona and 25th at Richmond. After finishing 39th in points, Combs and Sanderson finally split and Combs went back to lower level racing. Moonshining In 2009, Combs was arrested for the operation of a moonshine still in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina.

It was unveiled on 13 March 1904 as a celebration of the peaceful resolution of the border dispute between the two countries. The Christ of the Andes, a symbol of eternal peace, is commonly believed to have been made from the cannons of war, though some historians regard this as doubtful. Engraved at the feet in Spanish are the words, \\"Sooner shall these mountains crumble into dust than Chileans and Argentinians break the peace which at the feet of Christ, the Redeemer, they have sworn to maintain.\\" The statue is located at the pass of La Cumbre, the highest point on the old road between Mendoza in Argentina and Santiago de Chile. The pass is also known as the Church (Iglesia) Pass on the Chilean side and the Bermejo Pass on the Argentine. The nearest major settlements are the Argentine town of Uspallata and Juncal in Chile. The closest village is Las Cuevas. The road climbs 1 km over a sinuous 9 km from Las Cuevas to the pass. The road is only accessible in summer months, when there is no snow. Winter temperatures can reach -30 °C. The road is now principally used as a tourist route to visit the statue, with the main route between the two countries now using the Cristo Redentor Tunnel at the foot of the climb. Construction At the beginning of the 20th century, Pope Leo XIII wrote a series of papal encyclicals calling for peace and harmony and for devotion to Christ the Redeemer. At the same time, Argentina and Chile were coming close to armed conflict in an ongoing dispute over the location of the border. The bishop of Cuyo, monsignor Marcelino del Carmen Benavente, promised to erect a statue of Christ the Redeemer to remind the parties of Christ's message of peace. The seven-meter-high bronze statue was subsequently made by Buenos Aires sculptor Mateo Alonso and shown for a while in the patio of the Lacordaire School of the Dominican Order in Buenos Aires. As the countries slipped closer to war, Ángela Oliveira Cézar de Costa, a well-connected society lady who led a Christian group at the school, had the idea of taking the statue to the Andes in the event of peace as a symbol of unity between the two nations. She had particular cause for concern as her brother was an Argentine Army general preparing for conflict at the frontier. As a friend of the President of Argentina, Julio Roca, she was able to gain the interest of both countries. She would later be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. A diplomatic breakthrough in May of 1902 led Argentina and Chile to a peaceful agreement. The plan for the statue progressed and Oliveira Cézar de Costa and Bishop Benavente prepared to move the statue to the pass of Cumbre del Bermejo, which José de San Martín had used in 1817 to cross the Andes and liberate Chile from Spanish colonial rule. In 1904, the Christ was moved in pieces 1,200 kilometers by train, then carried up the mountains by mule. The six-meter-high granite pedestal designed by Molina Civit was completed on 15 February 1904, and Alonso, the original sculptor, directed the piecing together of the bronze statue. It was erected with the figure facing the line of the border, standing on a globe with South America prominent, his left hand holding a cross and his right raised in blessing. Inauguration On 13 March 1904, 3,000 Chileans and Argentines climbed to the summit despite the inhospitable conditions and watched the two armies, only a short time before ready to do battle with one another, firing gun salutes together. President Roca of Argentina and President Germán Riesco of Chile were unable to attend but their foreign ministers were present, along with the Archbishop of Buenos Aires and the bishops of Cuyo, Argentina and Ancud, Chile. Two plaques were unveiled celebrating the friendship between the two countries. One is inscribed (in Spanish) \\"Sooner shall these mountain crags crumble to dust than Chile and Argentina shall break this peace which at the feet of Christ the Redeemer they have sworn to maintain.\\" Subsequent development In 1916 the cross of the statue was remade, the original having succumbed to the difficult climate conditions. The original cross of bronze was made into commemorative medals. Various further plaques were added over the years. A major repair was undertaken by the Argentine Province of Mendoza in 1993 when the statue was in great disrepair, as well as nearby buildings that had been used as a meteorological station. In 2004, the centenary of the statue was celebrated in a ceremony at the statue attended by President Néstor Kirchner of Argentina and Ricardo Lagos of Chile. They reaffirmed the friendship between the two countries. The statue was declared a National Historic Monument of Argentina.

He was played by Ronald Magill. He ran the Woolpack, along with Henry Wilks for 19 years. Storylines Amos was born on 1 April 1920. Amos was Beckindale's local gossip, he was at the centre of all the local news, in the Woolpack. In 1973, Amos was convinced that the brewery liked couples to run pubs and Amos saw a decent woman in Annie Sugden. Annie turned Amos down gently, later he went into business with Henry Wilks and they ran the pub together until Amos retired. In 1976 The Woolpack premises had to be moved when it was found to be suffering from subsidence. In 1978 while closing up The Woolpack Amos and Mr Wilks were threatened by burglars and were locked in the cellar all night. However, later that year he was proud to give his barmaid Dolly Acaster away when she married Matt Skilbeck. In summer 1980, gamekeeper Seth Armstrong switched from The Malt Shovel to The Woolpack – Seth continuously irritated Amos. Amos gained an allotment in 1980, and this was the scene of much rivalry between himself and Seth for many years. During the same year, Amos told Henry Wilks: \\"You've never been fortunate enough to meet another Brearly!\\" In late 1980, Henry did meet one when Amos's aunt Emily turned up for a visit. Amos was terrified of her. She fled from the Woolpack on discovering that Amos had written-up a report on UFOs spotted locally, stating that he was tampering with unknown forces. A couple of years later, she returned to announce that Amos's uncle Arthur had died. Aunt Emily thought she stood to gain from Arthur's will, but she was only bequeathed some old junk, including an elephant's foot umbrella stand. In 1981, Amos set up his own village newsletter – The Beckindale Bugle. It was short-lived. In 1983, Amos sought upward mobility by cultivating the friendship of NY Estates boss Alan Turner. He was distressed to hear Alan criticising him to a golfing pal. From then on, Amos treated Alan frostily, insisting on calling him \\"Mr Turner\\". Amos had a brother Ezra Brearly who made a few appearances in the 1980s. He also mentioned another brother who had died young. Amos's rivalry with Ernie Shuttleworth of the Malt Shovel public house took on a new intensity during the '80s, as each tried to outdo the other with various ventures, including happy hours, juke boxes and dominoes tournaments. In 1984, Ernie was thrilled to get Amos a ticking off from the local police by tampering with the Woolpack clock so the pub was caught serving drinks after hours. In 1988, Amos seemed set to marry Gloria Pinfold, an old sweetheart of his from many years before. She was a strong-willed woman who moved into the Woolpack and interfered with Henry's book keeping and the diet of the two men, insisting that full English breakfasts were not to be eaten because of cholesterol and fat content. Finally, she had a better offer from another man and left Amos. In the summer of 1989, Henry got hay fever and drove Amos mad with his sneezing. Amos also discovered a crop circle at Home Farm and was convinced that aliens had landed in Beckindale. Sadly, by the time Amos took a local expert to see the fantastic spectacle, the field had been harvested. In July 1990, while celebrating friend Annie's 70th birthday, Amos suffered a stroke. Shortly after he decided to retire in January 1991 handing the pub over to Alan Turner he returned to the village in October for Henry's funeral, he also returned in late December and in January 1992 and tells that he is moving to Spain. Even though Amos left the show as a regular character he was to make several guest appearances over the coming years. He made a brief return in late 1992. In 1993 he returned for a few months from May to October and was present when Annie married Leonard Kempinski, whom she had met a year earlier while staying with Amos in Spain. He made several appearances throughout 1994, first returning for the funeral of the plane crash victims where he did the same reading he had done at Wilks's funeral two years previously. In February he served as best man when Alan Turner married former prostitute Shirley Foster. He returned again in May for Jack and Sarah's wedding; at the reception – held in a barn at Emmerdale Farm – he made the announcement that the residents of Beckindale had decided to rename the village Emmerdale in honour of Annie Sugden. He returns once again in December for the first anniversary of the Plane Crash. Amos made his final appearance in the show in July 1995 when he came home with Annie for her son Joe Sugden's funeral. Joe had died in a car crash while staying with Amos and Annie in Spain. Amos later remarked that one night while enjoying a drink with Joe in Spain, Joe had asked Amos to make sure that if anything was to happen to him that there would be a few free drinks given in The Woolpack after the funeral. Amos thought that this request to him was strange considering that Joe was more likely to outlive him, hinting that Joe's death may not have been an accident. Following the funeral, Annie contemplating life alone shocked Amos by proposing but Amos told her he would have to think about it and Annie, feeling embarrassed, told him to forget about it. After Amos discussed it with Alan, he proposed to Annie, 23 years after his first proposal. This time Annie accepted. Sarah then waved them off as they left Emmerdale Farm, returning to their home in Spain. Amos was never seen in the village again. He and Annie married, off screen, on 5 November 1995. He was last mentioned in 2001 when Jack went to visit Annie and Amos in Spain. When Annie returned in 2009 for Jack's funeral, Amos was not mentioned, as the actor Ronald Magill had died in 2007.

Professional wrestling career Gillem was inspired to begin a career as a professional wrestling after seeing Mildred Burke wrestle. She was trained in Tennessee with Wilma Gordon, and she began wrestling in carnival shows. Besides wrestling men and women, Gillem wrestled bears and alligators as part of her act. Gillem eventually found work touring with promoter Billy Wolfe's, the husband of Mildred Burke, troop of women wrestlers in 1942. She was often an opponent of Burke's, wrestling her for the World Women's Championship. She acted in this capacity until her retirement in 1962. During her time with the promotion, she developed a sexual relationship with Wolfe. During one professional wrestling match, one of Gillem's eyes was knocked out of the socket. Also, she developed a cauliflower like sore on the back of her head due to taking bumps in the ring. Gillem, however, gained additional notability when she was one of the focal interviewees for Lipstick and Dynamite, Piss and Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling, a documentary about the early days of women's wrestling in North America. Personal life She was born in Birmingham, Alabama to Fred and Clara Gillem. In high school, Gillem won the Alabama State softball championship with her team. After her father died when she was 19, Gillem took care of her mother, who was an invalid. After leaving wrestling, she rode horses and worked as a trapeze artist. Gillem then became a lion tamer and wrestled alligators. She met her husband John Wall while working for the Bailey Brothers' circus. The couple had three children together: Kathleen Ann, John, and Claire Fredrica. Her husband was killed while working as a Broadway stagehand in New York when a 500-pound box fell on his head. After his death, Gillem ran her mother's boarding house. In 1973, she began running the Birmingham motel in Pensacola. Death Gillem underwent heart bypass surgery in 2003. On August 12, 2009, she died of Alzheimer's disease at her home in Pensacola, Florida.

Formerly known as gorgonians,Gorgonacea World Register of Marine Species. Retrieved 2011-12-04.Gorgonacea; Lamouroux, 1816 ITIS Taxonomy. Retrieved 2011-12-04. they are sessile colonial cnidarians that are found throughout the oceans of the world, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Common names for subset of this order are sea fans and sea whips; they are similar to the sea pens of related order Pennatulacea. Individual tiny polyps form colonies that are normally erect, flattened, branching, and reminiscent of a fan. Others may be whiplike, bushy, or even encrusting. A colony can be several feet high and across, but only a few inches thick. They may be brightly coloured, often purple, red, or yellow. Photosynthetic gorgonians can be successfully kept in captive aquaria. About 500 different species of gorgonians are found in the oceans of the world, but they are particularly abundant in the shallow waters of the Western Atlantic, including Florida, Bermuda, and the West Indies. Anatomy Venus fan (Gorgonia flabellum), Caribbean Sea at Goat Bay (Bahía de la Chiva) on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico Gorgonian with reproductive stage, Caribbean Sea at Cabrits National Park, Dominica A close-up of an alcyonacean showing individual polyps The structure of a gorgonian colony varies. In the suborder Holaxonia, skeletons are formed from a flexible, horny substance called gorgonin. The suborder Scleraxonia species are supported by a skeleton of tightly grouped calcareous spicules. Also, some species encrust like coral. Most of the Holaxonia and Scleraxonia, however, do not attach themselves to a hard substrate. Instead, they anchor themselves in mud or sand. Measurements of the gorgonin and calcite within several long-lived species of gorgonians can be useful in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, as their skeletal growth rate and composition are highly correlated with seasonal and climatic variation.  Features  Soft corals contain minute, spiny skeletal elements called sclerites, useful in species identification. Sclerites give these corals some degree of support and give their flesh a spiky, grainy texture that deters predators. In the past, soft corals were thought to be unable to lay new foundations for future corals, but recent findings suggest that colonies of the leather-coral genus Sinularia are able to cement sclerites and consolidate them at their base into alcyonarian spiculite,Kenji Konishi, \\"Alcyonarian spiculite: the limestone of soft corals\\", 1981; M.-S. Jeng, H.-D. Huang, C.-F. Dai, Y.-C. Hsiao and Y. Benayahu. (15 May 2011), \\"Sclerite calcification and reef-building in the fleshy octocoral genus Sinularia (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea)\\", Earth and Environmental Science, Coral Reefs . thus making them reef builders. Unlike stony corals, most soft corals thrive in nutrient-rich waters with less intense light. Almost all use symbiotic photosynthetic zooxanthella as a major energy source. However, most readily eat any free- floating food, such as zooplankton, out of the water column. They are integral members of the reef ecosystem and provide habitat for fish, snails, algae, and a diversity of other marine species. Despite being dominated by \\"soft corals\\", the order Alcyonacea now contains all species known as \\"gorgonian corals\\", that produce a more or less hard skeleton, though quite different from \\"true\\" corals (Scleractinia). These can be found in suborders Holaxonia, Scleraxonia, and Stolonifera. Many soft corals are easily collected in the wild for the reef aquarium hobby, as small cuttings are less prone to infection or damage during shipping than stony corals. Nevertheless, home-grown specimens tend to be more adaptable to aquarium life and help conserve wild reefs. Soft corals grow quickly in captivity and are easily divided into new individuals, and so those grown by aquaculture are often hardier and less expensive than imported corals from the wild. Ecology Purple sea whip gorgonian Fossil gorgonian holdfast on a Miocene limestone surface, Czech Republic Each gorgonian polyp has eight tentacles, which catch plankton and particulate matter for consumption. This process, called filter feeding, is facilitated when the \\"fan\\" is oriented across the prevailing current to maximise water flow to the gorgonian, hence food supply. Some gorgonians contain algae, or zooxanthellae. This symbiotic relationship assists in giving the gorgonian nutrition by photosynthesis. Gorgonians possessing zooxanthellae are usually characterized by brownish polyps. Gorgonians are found primarily in shallow waters, though some have been found at depths of several thousand feet. The size, shape, and appearance of gorgonians can be correlated with their location. The more fan- shaped and flexible gorgonians tend to populate shallower areas with strong currents, while the taller, thinner, and stiffer gorgonians can be found in deeper, calmer waters. Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa, and brittle stars, are known to dwell within the branches of gorgonian colonies. The pygmy seahorse not only makes certain species of gorgonians its home, but also closely resembles its host, thus is well camouflaged. Two species of pygmy seahorse, Hippocampus bargibanti and Hippocampus denise, are obligate residents on gorgonians. H. bargibanti is limited to two species in the single genus Muricella. Gorgonians produce unusual organic compounds in their tissues, particularly diterpenes, and some of these are important candidates for new drugs. These compounds may be part of the chemical defenses produced by gorgonians to render their tissue distasteful to potential predators. Bottlenose dolphins in the Red Sea have been observed swimming against these tissues, in what is thought to be an attempt to take advantage of the antimicrobial qualities of diterpenes. Despite these chemical defenses, the tissues of gorgonians are prey for flamingo tongue snails of the genus Cyphoma, the fireworm Hermodice spp., and their polyps are food for butterflyfishes.

Signature The treaty was signed by the two governors of the island, Robert de Longvilliers for France and Martin Thomas for the States General of the Netherlands. The signing took place atop Mount Concordia. Based on the terms of the agreement, the island of Saint Martin was to be divided between the Kingdom of France and the Dutch Republic, and the peoples of St. Martin were to co-exist co-operatively. The French would keep the area that they occupied and the coast facing Anguilla, and the Dutch would have the area of the fort and the land around it on the south coast. The inhabitants would share the natural resources of the island. However, France and the Netherlands continued to dispute over the ownership of the island until 1817, when the borders of the island were finally set. See the Text of the Treaty of Concordia (Wikisource : English translation of the original text in French).  Validity  Questions as to its validity have arisen several times in the past and continue to cause issues. Research was supposed to be undertaken by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs about it. At the time of the treaty, agreements signed between representatives of the monarch had to be registered at the King's Council. That essential formality was never performed, but it seems that on many occasions, French civil law recognised the validity of the agreement. The treaty has always been fairly applied in practice and is referred to in the following texts: * Franco-Dutch Convention of November 28th, 1839. (See French text) * French side gubernatorial Order of 11 February 1850 about the rules on the salt trade and use, whose Article #32 states : *: The inhabitants of the French side of St. Martin will enjoy the ability to consume and export abroad salts harvested by them on the Dutch side, this under the terms of the Treaty of 1648. * Decree of 30 July 1935, which in its Article #40 provides for the freedom of establishment in the French part of Saint-Martin for the Dutch citizens from the Dutch part of Saint-Martin : *: The requirements of the Decree shall not apply to foreigners from the Dutch island of St.Martin regarding their stay and transit in the French part of the island. Foreigners from the islands of Saba, Anguilla, Statia, Saint Christopher Nevis, which at the date of this Order were finally fixed in the dependences of Saint-Martin and Saint Bartholomew for the benefit referred to in the preceding paragraph.

Plot = Ultimate Nightmare  A broadcast disrupts the world's communications systems, filling televisions and computer monitors with images of death and destruction that cause thousands of people to commit suicide. The broadcast ripples across the psychic plane, and attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Charles Xavier, with both tracing the source to the Tunguska wasteland in Russia, the site of a massive comet crash over a century ago. S.H.I.E.L.D. Commander Nick Fury leads a team of heroes - Captain America, Black Widow and Sam \\"Falcon\\" Wilson - on a reconnaissance mission, while Professor X sends the X-Men Jean Grey, Wolverine and Colossus to investigate. Neither team is aware of the other's involvement. The two teams trace the signal to an abandoned complex built in the era of the Soviet Union and encounter an army of mutated humans, all engineered by a now-defunct Soviet super-soldier project designed to create versions of Captain America. Two characters who make appearances, though unnamed, are Ultimate Unicorn and an Ultimate version of Red Guardian. After defeating the humans the two teams meet, with Fury's team capturing the X-Men and then discovering the source of the broadcast - a sentient, self- repairing robot called Vision. Vision explains that it traveled to Earth 100 years ago, and when its ship malfunctioned it crashed in Tunguska and was later captured by the Soviets, who amputated portions of its body and grafted them onto Soviet Army volunteers to create experimental super-soldiers. Vision has repaired itself enough to communicate with the world and warns Fury of an impending threat: the Eater of Worlds called Gah Lak Tus. The X-Men subsequently escape and Fury's team takes the Vision back to S.H.I.E.L.D for further analysis. The cover of Ultimate Extinction #5 (July 2006), featuring the Gah Lak Tus swarm. Cover art by Brandon Peterson  Ultimate Secret  A secret S.H.I.E.L.D. installation in New Mexico investigating revolutionary methods of space travel is attacked by the alien Kree. This forces resident scientist Dr. Philip Lawson to change to his true identity of Captain Mahr Vehl and battle the attackers. Although able to successfully defend the installation, Mahr Vehl is rendered unconscious and is eventually questioned by Fury. Mahr Vehl explains he is a member of the Kree himself, and that they have been observing Earth to determine if humanity poses a threat to the Kree in the larger galaxy. Observing mankind's violent nature, Mahr Vehl reveals that the Kree have recently decided to confine humanity on Earth until the entity Gah Lak Tus can destroy them, thus ending the potential threat. Realizing that other Kree will be coming and that the threat the Vision foretold is now very real, Fury summons the Fantastic Four and the Ultimates. A Kree force attacks the installation soon after but is stopped by a combined team of heroes. Another team of heroes - with Mahr Vehl's aid - storm the Kree ship while the aliens are on Earth. The commander, Yahn Rgg, activates the self-destruct mechanism, but not before Mahr Vehl hacks into the ship's database and downloads its contents into his memory banks. With the information gained from both Vision and the Kree, Fury contemplates how to deal with the coming threat of Gah Lak Tus.  Ultimate Extinction  Fury enlists the aid of Reed Richards and Professor Xavier once Silver Surfer arrives to \\"herald\\" the approach of Gah Lak Tus, who is discovered to be a swarm of thousands of sentient ships stretched long and within only a week's journey from Earth. The heroes Captain America, Falcon, Iron Man and Mahr Vehl have several battles with Gah Lak Tus' heralds, the Silver Men, and allow Reed Richards, Charles Xavier and Jean Grey time to develop a plan. Xavier and Grey make psychic contact with Gah Lak Tus, which completely repulses the entity and distracts it. Richards then uses a weapon known as the \\"Nevada gun\\" and teleports the latent energy of a Big Bang into the heart of the Gah Lak Tus swarm. With 20% of its mass destroyed by the blast, the entity retreats. Richards then programs Vision with plans for the weapon and sends it into space, in the hopes that other races will be able to benefit and fend off Gah Lak Tus. Nick Fury's only comment on the matter is \\"the human race can kick the hell out of anything.\\" Collected editions The series has been collected into a number of volumes: *Ultimate Galactus Trilogy (368 pages, hardcover, Marvel Comics, , softcover, June 2009, ) collects: **Ultimate Nightmare (120 pages, Marvel Comics, March 2005, , Panini Comics, December 2006, ) **Ultimate Secret (96 pages, Marvel Comics, January 2006, , Panini Comics, December 2006, ) **Ultimate Extinction (120 pages, Marvel Comics, August 2006, , Panini Comics, December 2006, )  Notes References  External links *Ultimate Galactus Trilogy HC Review, Comics Bulletin *Ultimate Secret #1 Review, #3 #4, Comics Bulletin *Ultimate Extinction #3, Comics Bulletin *Examining the Ultimate Galactus Trilogy, ComicsVerse ","title":"Ultimate Galactus Trilogy"},{"id":"6283451","text":"Timber Ridge is a mountain ridge of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians straddling the U.S. states of Virginia and West Virginia.

The Lu star is believed to be Zhang Xian who lived during the Later Shu dynasty. The word lu specifically refers to the salary of a government official. As such, the Lu star is the star of prosperity, rank, and influence. The Lu star was also worshipped separately from the other two as the deity dictating one's success in the imperial examinations, and therefore success in the imperial bureaucracy. The Lu star is usually depicted in the dress of a mandarin. Shouxing The star of Shou (壽), Shouxing 壽星, is α Carinae (Canopus), the star of the south pole in Chinese astronomy, and is believed to control the life spans of mortals. According to legend, he was carried in his mother's womb for ten years before being born, and was already an old man when delivered. He is recognized by his high, domed forehead and the peach which he carries as a symbol of immortality. The longevity god is usually shown smiling and friendly, and he may sometimes be carrying a gourd filled with the elixir of life. He is sometimes conflated with Laozi and corresponding gods of Taoist theology.

In his limited NASCAR career, Hume competed in fifteen Winston Cup events. Winston Cup=1964 Hume appeared in the series in 1964, completing two races late in the year. In his debut at Darlington, Hume started 28th but slid to 38th after an early crash. Hume would then barely improve at Charlotte, where he finished 35th due to overheating. 1965 Hume had a significantly better season in 1965, when he competed in four events. He only managed to finish one of the four races. That race, at Charlotte, Hume finished 18th. All of his DNFs were due to mechanical issues. 1981 Hume returned to the series after a sixteen-year absence in 1981, completing one race for D.K. Ulrich. He started the race at Rockingham in 33rd position and would finish there after an early race crash. 1984 Another multiple year absence ended in 1984, when Hume ran a race for Bahari Racing. After starting 23rd at Atlanta, Hume came home with a 26th- place finish. He would finish that event twenty-nine laps down. 1985 Hume ended his career with a seven-race stretch in 1985. It was a decent season, driving for James Hylton. In his seven starts, he once again struggled to finish races, only completing four of those. However, all four ended up being top-21 finishes. The best of the year, and his career, was a 16th-place effort at Bristol. After a 38th place showing in points, Hume was replaced and he has not driven in NASCAR since.

She was born in Bellville, Texas to Dr. and Mrs. Otis Laurence Williams. She began teaching in the Dallas schools in 1894, became assistant supervisor of music for the schools in 1910, acting supervisor in 1913 (the year the Dallas schools acquired their first phonograph), and supervisor in 1914. She was awarded a bachelor of science degree by Chapel Hill College in 1915 and later studied at the University of Chicago, Cornell University, and the University of California.

Storylines Ron and DD (Irene Mariot) arrived in Brookside Close during the autumn of 1990 with their three children, but their marriage collapsed during 1993 due to Ron's affair with Bev McLoughlin (Sarah White). In December 1993 she gave birth to a son called Josh, but they split up soon afterwards when she revealed that Josh wasn't his son. He was actually Ron's grandson and the son of Ron's son Mike (Paul Byatt).Brookside Facts-3 In early November of that year, at the wedding of neighbour Frank Rogers (Peter Christian) to Bev's sister Lyn Matthews (Sharon Power), Ron and DD got into an argument after Bev turned up. Frank took Tony (Mark Lennock) in the wedding car to the reception to get him away from his warring parents. During the journey, Frank (who had been allowed to drive the luxury car as a gift from Lyn) crashed after he swerved to avoid an oncoming car which was being driven recklessly by neighbour Jimmy Corkhill. Frank died soon after arriving at the hospital and Tony was left in a coma with a fractured skull. At Frank's funeral, Ron learnt that Frank's post mortem had included a blood test which showed him to be over the drink-drive limit, although the full truth about the crash was still three months away from being revealed. One morning at the beginning of December 1993, Tony opened his eyes for a few minutes while Ron was visiting him in hospital. Ron was ecstatic by what he saw and was confident that Tony would be out of hospital in time for Christmas. However, when Ron returned to the hospital hours later, the doctor informed Ron that Tony was in a persistent vegetative state and was unlikely ever to recover. Ron was determined to help Tony recover, at whatever cost, wanting to find a medical cure which he had heard was possible for coma victims at specialist clinics in America, while DD was determined for him to be cured at Lourdes, which non-Catholic Ron did not think was possible. A guilt-ridden Jimmy helped out with endless fundraising efforts, with nobody else knowing that he had caused the accident. Tony then contracted pneumonia and had to stay in hospital over Christmas, and showed no further signs of improvement. In January 1994, Ron came to visit Tony in hospital and found him being given the last rites. DD explained that Tony was being giving the last rites at her request, which outraged Ron, who was still determined that a medical cure could be found. Tony's doctor, who had already discussed the situation with DD, then persuaded Ron that there was no chance of Tony ever regaining consciousness, and Ron soon accepted that Tony would never recover. Ron then began talking of the possibility of having Tony's treatment withdrawn and allowing him to die (echoing the recent real life right-to-die case involving Hillsborough disaster victim Tony Bland), although DD was still determined that Tony might still recover if he was taken to Lourdes, even though she had accepted that there was no medical cure. Ron then gave DD permission to take Tony to Lourdes in hope of curing him, despite not believing that Tony could be cured this way, but Tony died in hospital just before DD and Jackie Corkhill (Sue Jenkins) were due to take him to Lourdes. Jimmy broke down at Tony's funeral, unable to contain his guilt any longer, and confessed to Ron at the graveside that he was driving the other car while high on cocaine. Ron later married his former girlfriend Anthea Brindley (Barbara Hatwell), who had revealed to him that he was the father of her daughter Megan, by now in her thirties. In December 2000, only a few days before Christmas, his life was hit by another tragedy when his son Mike was badly injured in a car crash caused by neighbour Tim O'Leary (Phiip Olivier), who had fled the scene after crashing the stolen car that he had been driving. Mike suffered spinal injuries and was unable to walk for six months. In May 2001, after a succession of robberies at his house, Ron finally snapped and bought a gun off Sotto, an acquaintance of neighbour Tim O'Leary, which he eventually used on a burglar who had entered his house. The burglar was Clint Moffat (Greg Perapes), the brother of his daughter Jacqui's (Alexandra Fletcher) boyfriend, Robbie (Neil Davies). Ron did not realise who he had shot until it was too late. Robbie turned out to be the burglar; Clint was only in the Dixons' house to get Robbie out. Ron was charged with his murder. He was released on bail but following his trial in December 2001 he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to nine months in prison. He was freed four months later. After the verdict, Anthea left Ron and he found himself on his own again. In 2003, Ron married Bev and in the final episode, Ron, Bev and Josh moved away from the close.http://www.brooksidesoapbox.co.uk/ – The Dixons Feuds Throughout his time on Brookside Close, Ron Dixon was often an unpopular man. Ron discovers in 1995 that he has a daughter that he never knew about, but he kept her identity a secret, as she could also have been Jimmy's daughter, although a DNA paternity test was never given. He also had many petty feuds with neighbour Max Farnham (Steven Pinder). Like many of the neighbours, he despised drug dealer Jack Michaelson (Paul Duckworth) and was assaulted by him in 2003. Ron and Jimmy Ever since Jimmy was involved in the death of his son, he had an ongoing feud with him. The two however reconciled when Ron's son Mike and Jimmy's daughter Lindsey (Claire Sweeney) were arrested in Bangkok after drugs are planted in Lindsay's daughter's teddy bear. Later on, Ron has an affair with Jimmy's wife, Jackie. Jackie leaves Ron after Jimmy's son is killed by drug dealers. Ron eventually expressed forgiveness during his wedding speech in 2003 noting that Jimmy wasn't a callous killer. Regardless, his final words on the programme were to tell Jimmy that he hoped he would never see him again. Politics Ron is one of the few politicised characters in the later years. Although unlike socialist Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson) and Chrissy Rogers (Eithne Brown), and Conservative Paul Collins (Jim Wiggins), his beliefs aren't fervent; Ron often makes off-the-cuff right wing political remarks as a reaction to something he has heard. In the series he has supported taxing the poor more than the rich to incentivise hard work, bringing back hanging, arming the police and claiming that addiction doesn't exist. His outbursts are usually treated with bemusement by others. During the siege he claimed that hanging would deter the criminals from shooting their victims to which Bev pointed out that no deterrent stopped him from pulling the trigger when he shot an intruder.

Early life Prieto was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her mother was Brazilian and her father was a Chilean diplomat. In 1954, the family settled in Rio de Janeiro. Career The film that brought Prieto fame was El Justicero (1966) by Nelson Pereira dos Santos, a satire of hypocritical morals of carioca bourgeoisie, which earned her the \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" award by the Governorship of Rio de Janeiro. On TV, her first appearance to a broader public was with A Rainha Louca, a telenovela of Rede Globo in 1967. The series was an adaptation of Mémoires d'un médecin: Joseph Balsamo by Alexandre Dumas. She also appeared in plays by notable playwrights such as Henrik Ibsen, Nélson Rodrigues, and Augusto Boal but she finally decided to pursue her career in cinema. Her 1969 film, A Penúltima Donzela, by Fernando Amaral and her 1971 film, Lúcia McCartney, Uma Garota de Programa, by David Neves were of particular success. The turning point in her career was A Viúva Virgem (1972) by Pedro Carlos Rovai, which was conceived as a social satire but inevitably seen as a precursor of pornochanchada conventions. In this film, Prieto played the role of Cristina, a young girl who marries a powerful coronel from Minas Gerais but left as a \\"virgin widow\\" when her older husband dies on the wedding night. Her last film, O Casamento (1975), by Arnaldo Jabor was about the decadent bourgeoisie, a common theme in many other works of Nélson Rodrigues, accompanied by a story of incestuous love.

History  A member of the Security Battalions stands near an executed man. Local cemetery in Meligalas for members of the Security Battalions executed by Greek People's Liberation Army. The Battalions were founded in 1943 by the quisling government of Ioannis Rallis. The Rallis cabinet passed the law raising the Security Battalions on 7 April 1943. The driving force behind raising the Security Battalions was the former dictator, General Theodoros Pangalos, who saw the Security Battalions as his means of making a political comeback, and most of the Hellenic Army officers recruited into the Security Battalions in April 1943 were republicans who were in some way associated with Pangalos. The National Schism between royalists and republicans was still going strong in the 1940s, and there were considerable tensions between royalist politicians such as Rallis and republicans like Pangalos. Pangalos was a Greek nationalist who resented Greece's semi-colonial relationship with Great Britain before the Second World War, and he presented the return of the king as return to subordination to Britain. However, both Rallis and Pangalos were men of the right who were strongly opposed to EAM, which provided some grounds for unity. Pangalos and the clique of the republican officers associated with him made it clear that the Security Battalions were meant to fight just as much as the return of King George II as they were against EAM, and initially royalist officers were reluctant to join. Both the Italians and the Germans distrusted the Security Battalions and provided them with only small arms, fearing that Pangalos, a tough, able soldier and a megalomaniac who was widely considered be \\"half mad\\", was not a reliable partner. Though Pangalos did not formally have a position in the Security Battalions, he ensured his followers were given key command positions. They were supported by the extreme right and Nazi sympathisers, but also by some centrist politicians who were concerned about the dominance of ELAS (the military arm of the communist-dominated National Liberation Front EAM) as the main body of the Greek resistance. Among the members of the Security Battalions one could find ex-army officers, forcefully conscripted soldiers, conservatives, landowners, extreme-right radicals and social outcasts, as well as opportunists who believed the Axis would win the war. The core of the Battalions consisted of men of the Royal Guard (Evzones, so the name tsoliádes). The Security Battalions were initially a small force, and only began to grow when Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943. After the armistice, German forces seized the parts of Greece that been occupied by the Italians. In the confusion caused by the armistice, ELAS had taken the opportunity to take over many of the Italian armories in Greece, and started to use the vast haul of Italian weapons they had seized against the Germans. With ELAS better armed and the Germans now occupying more of Greece, the Higher SS Police Chief of Greece, Walter Schimana, argued that the Reich needed an auxiliary force to relive the burden. After armistice of September 1943, the Germans became more generous in arming the Security Battalions. The growth in ELAS, which was now far better armed than it before the armistice, alarmed many conservative Greek officers, including the royalists, who started to join the Security Battalions as a way of defending the \\"bourgeois world\\". Despite their distaste for republicans like Pangalos, for many royalist officers the defense of the prewar status quo against EAM, came to override even the National Schism. One provincial governor, that of the Patras district, told an audience of Wehrmacht officers in February 1944: \\"Hellenism is by heritage and tradition opposed to the communist world-view. Annihilate communism!\\" For this reason, the governor announced that he was now recruiting for the Security Battalions in his district, saying he preferred that Greece be occupied by Germany permanently rather than see EAM come to power. The German military governor of the Balkans, General Alexander Löhr, in a message to Berlin stated his policy was to ensure \\"that the anti-communist part of the Greek population be fully utilised, revealing it self openly and obliged to display an undisguised hostility towards the communist side\\". The main role of the Security Battalions was to fight against ELAS. Their aggregate force was at most 22,000 men, divided into 9 'evzonic' and 22 'voluntary' battalions, under the command of SS Lieutenant-General Walter Schimana. Although the plan was to expand them all over the occupied Greek territories, their main theater of action was in eastern Central Greece and Peloponnese. At that time, ELAS had already gained control over 1/3 of continental Greece. They remained faithful to the Germans even when the occupation was crumbling. Their last mission was to engage in combat against ELAS and keep them away from the main routes, in order to secure the safe exit of the German troops from Greece. What the Greek people hated about the Battalions, even more than their collaborationist nature, was the total lack of control over their members. For example, after a battle in the hamlet of Attali in Evvia the collaborationists pillaged the houses of the village, taking away 1,000 oka of oil, five sewing machines, 200 ok of cheese and 30 complete trousseaus. 60 mules were needed to carry away the loot. By the end of the occupation their name was synonymous with arbitrary violence and frightful cruelty.Mazower, Inside Hitler's Greece, quoted in Dionysis Charitopoulos, Άρης ο αρχηγός των ατάκτων (=Ares, Leader of the Irregulars) (Athens, Topos, 2009), p. 545 (back-translated by contributor). The men of the Security Battalions were poorly disciplined and were much given to looting and rape. Even collaborationist officials of the Hellenic State complained that the Security Battalions were more of force for disorder than order as stole whatever they wanted, raped any women they wanted and killed whoever they pleased. The Security Battalions killed indiscriminately as it was German policy to cow the population of Greece into total submission by encouraging the Security Battalions to kill at random. Most of the people killed by the Security Battalions were not andartes or even associated with the andartes; instead being just killed at random as to instill such an atmosphere of fear in Greece that people would not want the andartes to operate in their area as that would bring the Security Battalions into their area. The mountainous terrain of Greece which favored the andartes together with the fact that the Wehrmacht was by 1944 fully committed elsewhere in Europe led to the policy of \\"total terror\\" being employed. Sometimes, the Security Battalions did engaged in targeted killings, as one Security Battalion death squad in Volos killed 50 local EAM members over the course of March 1944. More typical was the executions in the same month of 100 people shot at random as retaliation for the assassination by ELAS of General Franz Krech. When members of the Security Battalions were assassinated by ELAS, the Security Battalions tended to lash out by massacring any Greeks who just happened to be in the vicinity. The andartes would usually spare captured policemen or gendarmes unless they had been involved in killing fellow Greeks, but members of the Security Battalions, if captured were always summarily executed under the grounds that any member of the Security Battalions was a war criminal. During the war, the Allied-oriented government in exile and the main resistance organizations in Greece decried the Security Battalions for treason multiple times. In November 1943, a British officer, Major Donald Stott, arrived in Athens and contacted the local branch of the Geheime Feldpolizei (German military police). During the course of Stott's extended visit with the GFP, he asked to arrange for the Security Battalions to switch over to serving the Cairo government when it returned to Greece as Stott asserted to his German hosts that his government did not want EAM to come to power under any conditions. Stott's visit was considered so important by the Germans that he met with Hermann Neubacher of the Auswärtiges Amt, who played a key role in governing the Balkans. Accordingly, to Neubacher's account of the meeting, Stott told him: \\"This war should end in the common struggle by the Allies and German forces against Bolshevism\\". Neubacher's account also stated that Stott apologised for Britain supplying EAM with arms, and that he believed \\"communist infiltration is already a serious threat in the Mediterranean\\". Stott was not arrested by the Germans and allowed to leave Athens for Cairo with the message that Germany wanted to work with Britain. In the last stages of World War II, many Nazi leaders such as the Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler believed that the alliance of Britain and the Soviet Union would not last, and inevitably the British would have to ally with the Reich against the Soviet Union. Broadly speaking, there were two tendencies on the German side in the last years of the war. Some of the Nazi leaders like Himmler, who influenced by his intelligence chief Walter Schellenberg tried to engage in various stratagems to break up the \\"Grand Alliance\\" such as his offer in 1944 to stop deporting Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz if the United States were to give Germany 50, 000 trucks that would only used to supply the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front. And the other side was the tendency strongly encouraged by Hitler himself that if Germany could not win the war, then all of Europe should be destroyed so that Allies would liberate a wasteland. Given these hopes by some of the German side about the break-up of the \\"Big Three\\" alliance, Walter Schimana, the Higher SS Police Chief for Greece, and the diplomat Hermann Neubacher welcomed Stott's mission as the beginning of an anti-Soviet Anglo-German alliance. The Geheime Feldpolizei in Balkans were led by Roman Loos, a career policeman from Austria who was described by the British historian Mark Mazower as a \\"wily\\" and \\"shadowy\\" figure who closely worked with the SS, and was never tried for war crimes. Loos became a prominent policeman in Austria after 1945, and at the time his retirement in 1962 was serving as the Austrian liaison officer for Interpol. Stott was in radio contact with the SOE headquarters in Cairo during his time as a guest of the Geheime Feldpolizei, reporting to Brigadier Keble. After Stott's meeting was exposed, he was disallowed as a \\"rouge\\" agent and reprimanded while Keble was fired. Stott's visit inflamed the suspicions of EAM of the Cairo government, as many EAM members believed the king after his return to Greece would pardon all of the Security Battalions, and enlist them to fight on his behalf. Mazower reported that many of the documents relating to the Stott mission at the Public Record Office are still closed to historians. Mazower argued on the basis of one declassified document stating \\"our long term policy towards Greece is to retain her in the British sphere of influence, and...a Russian-dominated Greece would not be in accordance with British strategy in the Eastern Mediterranean\\" that the British were willing to push the Cairo government to ally with any anti-communist force in Greece. The belief that the British supported the Security Battalions and that the king would pardon all of the men who served in them further encouraged royalist officers to join. In a speech to mark Hitler's birthday on 20 April 1944 before the officers of the Security Battalions, Schimana announced that the most dividing line in the world was between communism vs. anticommunism, and predicated that the \\"Grand Alliance\\" against Germany would soon fell apart. Schimana predicated that both Great Britain and the United States would soon realize that the alliance with the Soviet Union was not in their best interests, and that the Anglo-Americans would switch sides to ally themselves with Germany. Referring to the Stott mission, Schimana argued to his audience that Britain approved of the Security Battalions and it only just a matter of time before British, Greek and German soldiers would be all fighting side by side against the Soviet Union and those loyal to the Soviet Union. One of the Security Battalions' royalist officers, Major-General Vasilos Dertilis, in a recruiting speech in May 1944 to a group of his fellow royalists stated that the denunciations of the Security Battalions by the radio station of the Cairo government were just for \\"show\\", and that in fact both the British and the king secretly supported the Security Battalions. In May 1944, a secret emissary representing Dertilis arrived in Cairo with a message for the government-in-exile that the Security Battalions were a \\"patriotic organisation\\" committed to the \\"national struggle\\" against communism, and that when Greece was liberated, they would reveal their true loyalty was to the king. The idea of a \\"Greek bridge\\" in the form of the Security Battalions that would led to an Anglo-American-German alliance against the Soviet Union was vigorously opposed by SS-Standartenführer Walter Blume who still believed that Germany on its own would defeat the \\"Big Three\\" alliance of the Soviet Union, the United States and Great Britain. Blume saw Great Britain as much an enemy as the Soviet Union, and he was much closer to republican officers like Pangalos than to royalist officers like Dertilis. Blume used his influence to try promote republican officers over royalist officers in the Security Battalions, and after Dertilis gave his speech in May 1944 boasting about his contacts with the Cairo government, he ordered his arrest under the grounds that Dertilis was a British spy Dertilis was sent to Vienna to be interrogated by the Gestapo while Blume had the Athens headquarters of the Security Battalions searched for evidence of contacts with Britain and the Cairo government. Rallis was furious at Blume's action and asked Schimana to dismiss him. Blume, who had a fearsome reputation as the most extreme and violent of all the SS leaders in Greece was greatly feared by his other SS officers, including his superior, the Higher SS Police Chief Schimana, and no action was taken against him. The idea that the Security Battalions were secretly supported by Great Britain and the United States encouraged them to commit atrocities as they believed that would not be punished after the war. EAM reported that many of the men serving in the Security Battalions were claiming that \\"they are serving the interests of England with her consent\\". After raiding the village of Pili in July 1944 looking for EAM members, the local Security Battalion told the villagers: \\"Next time we will come back with the English\\" One agent of the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) reported after interviewing captured members of the Security Battalions that 35-40% of them believed that the governments of Britain and the United States secretly approved of them fighting for Germany. A member of the Security Battalions wrote in 1944: \\"Our leaders gave us lectures and tell us that we are chasing the Andartes of EAM/ELAS and that way we are going to avoid Communism; and that the leaders of the Security Battalions act after the orders of the King with whom they are in contact\\". Many of the leaders of the Cairo government secretly approved of the Security Battalions as a counterweight to EAM. In June 1944 the Greek government-in-exile asked that the BBC's Greek language service stop denouncing the Security Battalions as traitors under the grounds that these men were going to be useful to the government after the war, a request the British government granted. At the same time, the Cairo government also asked that the British and American air forces stop dropping propaganda leaflets over Greece warning that all of the Security Battalions were going to be tried for treason and war crimes after the liberation, as this discouraged recruitment by the Security Battalions whom the government was planning to use to fight against EAM once it returned to Greece. In the summer of 1944, the Security Battalions assisted German forces in Athens with the bloko (round- ups). In the blokos, an entire district of Athens, usually one of the poor neighborhoods where EAM was most popular, was sealed off while the occupying forces and the Security Battalions rounded up the entire male population of the district. Informers wearing hoods to hide their identities would point out suspected EAM members, who were shot on the spot. Other men who merely suspected of being sympathetic towards EAM would be taken to Haidhari prison, where they were held as hostages, with the German policy being that these men would be executed if there any more ELAS attacks against them. The bloko was ordered by Blume as part of his strategy of polarization as he wanted to provoke more violence to justify even more extreme violence on his part. Blume had decided that Rallis was insufficient pliant, and was intriguing to replace him with Pangalos. From Blume's viewpoint, having Athens reduced to chaos would show the need to sack Rallis, who was close to a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1944, and replacing him with the stronger Pangalos. Ultimately, Blume was planning to carry out the \\"Chaos Thesis\\" under which the Germans before withdrawing from Greece would destroy all of the infrastructure such as factories, railroads, ports, etc., and furthermore would execute the entire political Greek leadership to reduce the country to complete chaos. Appointing Pangalos as prime minister and letting the Security Battalions run amok were part of Blume's preparations for the executing the \\"Chaos Thesis\\". On the eve of the liberation, several battles took place between the Battalions and ELAS; the best known being the Battle of Meligalas in September 1944. After the liberation, the groups were only temporarily disbanded, and were recruited into the Gendarmerie to fight alongside the British and government forces against the EAM/ELAS in the battle of Dekemvriana, in Athens. The Security Battalions always surrendered to the British, who usually let them keep the weapons the Germans had supplied with. General Ronald Scobie who commanded the British forces in Greece, in contrast to his attitude towards EAM, whom he dismissed as mere \\"bandits\\", treated the Security Battalions as a legitimate military force. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had a very favorable view of the Security Battalions, saying \\"It seems to me that the collaborators in Greece in many cases did the best they could to shelter the Greek population from German oppression\\". When he criticized by Labour MPs in the House of Commons for employing the Security Battalions to fight on the British side against EAM in the Dekemvriana, Churchill replied: \\"The Security Battalions came into existence to protect the Greek villagers from the depredations of some of those who, under the guise of being saviours of their country, were living upon the inhabitants and doing very little fighting against the Germans\\". In total, very few of their members were tried and convicted of collaborationism. For instance, their creator and quisling Prime Minister of Greece, Rallis, was sentenced to life imprisonment for treason and died in prison in 1946, but he was acquitted for his involvement with the Security Battalions. After the defeat of the EAM in Dekemvriana, the members continued to hunt down left, communist and anti-royalist civilians during the white terror period that ensued after the Varkiza Agreement that dismantled ELAS. Many ex-members continued carrying out atrocities against the DSE during the Greek Civil War. During the Civil War, Security Battalions veteran officers organized themselves in a secret group known as the Holy Bond of Greek Officers, which from 1947 onward was subsidized by the Central Intelligence Agency as one of Greece's principle \\"democratic\\" (i.e. anti- communist) groups. After the Civil War, and during the persecution of the communists during the 1950s and '60s in Greece, many of the brutal military personnel of the exile islands accused of tortures were ex-members of the security Battalions. Finally, the leader of the Greek junta of the 1970s, Georgios Papadopoulos had also been accused of being a member of the Security Battalions, but without definite proof. One of the first acts of Papadopoulos's government after the 1967 coup d'état was to change the pension rules to declare that Security Battalion veterans could collect pensions for their services, and that those who had served and were serving in the Greek military could \\"top up\\" their pensions by presenting proof to the pension board of their service in the Security Battalions in 1943–44. After the 1967 coup d'état, in a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate, Senator Lee Metcalf called the new government \\"a military regime of collaborators and Nazi sympathizers who are receiving American aid\\". In another speech before the Senate on 16 November 1971, Metcalf listed the members of the Greek junta who had served in the Security Battalions and denounced the administration of Richard Nixon for supporting what he called a \\"junta of Nazi collaborators\\". Some members of the Security Battalions were recognized during the Greek military junta of 1967-74 by law as \\"resistance fighters against the Axis\\", but this decision was cancelled after the fall of the regime. Oath Recruits to the Security battalion swore under the following oath: However, it is reported that Rallis in the negotiations for the founding of such militia unit on the side of the Nazi occupation forces, refused to accept this oath as \\"Greek military forces can't put their legions to a foreign government\\" It is unknown whether Rallis' views were taken into account by German officials.

Educated in California, she studied ceremonialism and naming practices on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in the state of Oregon. She was married to fellow anthropologist David H. French. Early years Kathrine McCullough Story was born on June 5, 1922, in Champaign, Illinois. In 1942, she received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy and anthropology from Pomona College in California. Her father, Russell M. Story, a political scientist, was President of the Claremont Colleges and Graduate School. At Pomona she met David H. French, who was pursuing his own anthropological career. They married in 1943, and they both pursued graduate work in anthropology at Columbia University in New York, where Americanists such as Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict were working. Career From 1943 to 1946, the Frenches served as relocation advisers and community analysts with the War Relocation Authority, monitoring conditions at relocation centers for Japanese-Americans, as part of a program to mitigate abuses. After David French took a teaching post at his former undergraduate institution, Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, in 1947, the couple began a decades-long involvement with the Warm Springs community. While her husband's research focused on ethnobotany and language, hers focused on naming practices and ceremonialism, in a community composed of Sahaptins, Paiutes, and—the Frenches' specialization -- Wasco Chinookans. French received her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1955. Her dissertation, though unpublished, is considered an important contribution to the study of ceremonialism in the region and an innovative study in the semiotic analysis of ritual. The Frenches' fieldwork at Warm Springs often involved mentoring the inaugural fieldwork experiences of budding anthropologists and linguists (many as Reed undergraduates) such as Yvonne Hajda, Dell Hymes, Gail M. Kelly, and Michael Silverstein. French served on the faculty of Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland from 1959 to 1980, pursuing an interest in the intersection of pediatrics, gerontology, cultural anthropology, and public policy. From 1981 until her death, she was an adjunct member of Reed's anthropology department. In the 1980s and 1990s French and Yvonne Hajda, a former student of David French's, collaborated in a long-term study of change and continuity in ceremonialism on Warm Springs, with Wenner-Gren Foundation funding. That material still awaits publication. Later years She collaborated with her husband on numerous projects and publications, including an important survey of naming practices, which was published after David French's death in 1994. In later years of her life she remained active in anthropology, advising students as well as taking on numerous consulting projects on behalf of tribal groups, including research for Archaeological Investigations Northwest, Inc., throughout the lower Columbia River area. Kathrine French died on June 14, 2006, of pneumonia resulting from complications from cancer.

In his attempts to get his work published, he meets a beautiful stranger who offers him a chance at fame and fortune in exchange for his soul. Stone, having lost faith in himself, agrees to the offer. After accepting the deal Jabez is quickly lavished with all he had ever dreamed of: a book deal, money, women, notoriety, Stone now has it all. However, despite the success, he is losing the friendship, respect and trust of those around him. Coming to the realization that he did not quite get everything that he bargained for, Stone begs the devil to release him from their deal. When the devil scoffs, he turns to famed orator Daniel Webster.

Proline has an unusually conformationally restrained peptide bond due to its cyclic structure with its side chain bonded to its secondary amine nitrogen. Most amino acids have a strong energetic preference for the trans peptide bond conformation due to steric hindrance, but proline's unusual structure stabilizes the cis form so that both isomers are populated under biologically relevant conditions. Proteins with prolyl isomerase activity include cyclophilin, FKBPs, and parvulin, although larger proteins can also contain prolyl isomerase domains.  Protein folding  Proline is unique among the natural amino acids in having a relatively small difference in free energy between the cis configuration of its peptide bond and the more common trans form. The activation energy required to catalyse the isomerisation between cis and trans is relatively high: ~20kcal/mol (c.f. ~0kcal/mol for regular peptide bonds). Unlike regular peptide bonds, the X-prolyl peptide bond will not adopt the intended conformation spontaneously, thus, the process of cis-trans isomerization can be the rate-limiting step in the process of protein folding. Prolyl isomerases therefore function as protein folding chaperones. Cis peptide bonds N-terminal to proline residues are often located at the first residue of certain types of tight turns in the protein backbone. Proteins that contain structural cis-prolines in the native state include ribonuclease A, ribonuclease T1, beta lactamase, cyclophilin, and some interleukins. Prolyl isomerase folding can be autocatalytic and therefore the speed of folding depends on reactant concentration. Parvulin and human cytosolic FKBP are thought to catalyze their own folding processes.  Evidence for proline isomerization  Methods for identifying the presence of a rate-limiting proline isomerization process in a protein folding event include: # Activation energies consistent with proline isomerization, which typically has an activation of about 20 kcal/mol. # Two-state folding kinetics indicative of both fast-folding and slow-folding populations in the unfolded or denatured state. # \\"Double-jump\\" assays in which proline-containing proteins are unfolded and refolded, and the population of non-native proline conformations are studied as a function of the extent of folding. # Acceleration of the in vitro folding rate by the addition of a prolyl isomerase. # Acceleration of the in vitro folding rate in mutant protein variants with one or more proline residues replaced by another amino acid. It is important to note that not every proline peptide bond is critical to the structure or function of a protein, and not every such bond has a significant influence on folding kinetics, especially trans bonds. Furthermore, some prolyl isomerases have a degree of sequence specificity and therefore may not catalyze the isomerization of prolines in certain sequence contexts.  Assays for prolyl isomerase activity  Prolyl isomerase activity was first discovered using a chymotrypsin-based assay. The proteolytic enzyme chymotrypsin has a very high substrate specificity for the four-residue peptide Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe only when the proline peptide bond is in the trans state. Adding chymotrypsin to a solution containing a reporter peptide with this sequence results in the rapid cleavage of about 90% of the peptides, while those peptides with cis proline bonds - about 10% in aqueous solution - are cleaved at a rate limited by uncatalyzed proline isomerization. The addition of a potential prolyl isomerase will accelerate this latter reaction phase if it has true prolyl isomerase activity.

Located between Shockoe Hill and Church Hill, Shockoe Bottom contains much of the land included in Colonel William Mayo's 1737 plan of Richmond, making it one of the city's oldest neighborhoods. History Shockoe was named in the 1730 Tobacco Inspection Act as the site of a tobacco inspection warehouse on land owned by William Byrd II. Shockoe Bottom continued developing in the late 18th century following the move of the state capital to Richmond, aided by the construction of Mayo's bridge in 1788 across the James River (ultimately succeeded by the modern 14th Street Bridge), as well as the siting of key tobacco industry structures, such as the public warehouse, tobacco scales, and the Federal Customs House in or near the district. Shockoe Bottom is also home to several historic sites and buildings, including the Edgar Allan Poe Museum and the Mason's Hall, which was built between 1785 and 1787. Throughout the 19th Century, Shockoe Bottom was the center of Richmond's commerce with ships pulling into port from the James River. Goods coming off these ships were warehoused and traded in Shockoe Valley. Between the late 17th century and the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the area played a major role in the history of slavery in the United States, serving as the second largest slave trading center in the country, second to New Orleans. Profits from the trade in human beings fueled the creation of wealth for Southern whites and drove the economy in Richmond, leading 15th Street to be known as Wall Street in the antebellum period, with the surrounding blocks home to more than 69 slave dealers and auction houses. In 2006, archaeological excavations were begun on the former site of Lumpkin's jail. Nearby is the African American Burial Ground, long used as a commercial parking lot, most recently by Virginia Commonwealth University, a state institution. It was reclaimed in 2011 after a decade-long community organizing campaign and today is a memorial park. On the eve of the fall of Richmond to the Union Army in April 1865, evacuating Confederate forces were ordered to set fire to the city's tobacco warehouses. The fires spread, and completely destroyed Shockoe Slip and several other districts. The district was quickly rebuilt in the late 1860s, flourishing further in the 1870s, and forming much of its present historic building stock. Architecturally, many of the buildings were constructed during the rebuilding following the Evacuation Fire of 1865, especially in a commercial variant of the Italianate style, including a 1909 fountain, dedicated to \\"one who loved animals.\\" The buildings in the district, which historically housed a variety of offices, wholesale and retail establishments, are now primarily restaurants, shops, offices, and apartments. It warehoused many of the city's goods, mostly tobacco. The district began declining in the 1920s, as other areas of the city rose in prominence with the advent of the automobile. Numerous structures would be demolished and cleared, including (in the 1950s), the Tobacco Exchange, which had been at the heart of the district. Up until they moved from Tobacco Row in the 1980s, the area was home to many of the country's largest tobacco companies. Redevelopment After centuries of periodic flooding by the James River, development was greatly stimulated by the completion of Richmond's James River Flood Wall and the Canal Walk in 1995. The next flooding disaster came not from the river, but from Hurricane Gaston, which brought extensive local tributary flooding along the basin of Shockoe Creek and did extensive damage to the area in 2004, with businesses being shut down and many buildings condemned. A major boom in residential growth was created in the mid-1990s when old warehouses in Tobacco Row were converted into apartments. Since then, more vacant buildings have been replaced with residential dwellings and new ones have been built. The National Trust for Historic Preservation named Shockoe Bottom one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in 2014 and a National Treasure shortly thereafter because of \\"Revitalize RVA,\\" the controversial plan to construct a minor league baseball stadium, a national museum of slavery, a Hyatt hotel, a Kroger grocery store, and residential and commercial office space at the site. As of 2020, there are ongoing efforts to construct a museum of slavery in the Shockoe Bottom that commemorates the Lumpkins Slave Jail / Devil's Half-Acre site.https://www.lumpkinsjail.org/ ReferencesExternal links * River District News Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Neighborhoods in Richmond, Virginia National Register of Historic Places in Richmond, Virginia Tobacco in the United States ","title":"Shockoe Bottom"},{"id":"6283806","text":"Shockoe Slip is a district in the downtown area of Richmond, Virginia.

Redevelopment: 1970s to present Beginning in the 1960s and accelerating in the 1970s, Shockoe Slip was redeveloped as a commercial and entertainment district; the nightlife district came just after Richmond passed liquor-by- the-drink laws, and when the so-called fern bar became popular across the United States. The restoration came at the time of an increased interest in historic preservation around the time of the Bicentennial, with the district being added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Early pioneer restaurants included The Tobacco Company, Stuffy's Going Bananas, Commercial Cafe and Sam Miller's, the last two being revived restaurant names from Richmond's 19th century. One of the earliest and oldest of Richmond's artist- run galleries, was Artspace 1306 located at 1306 East Cary Street in Shockoe Slip. Artspace 1306 retained its original name when the gallery moved to North 18th Street in Shockoe Bottom. Only when Artspace 1306 moved to 6 East Broad Street did the gallery drop the original address from its name. The Broad Street location became the home of another 501 C-3 gallery, Art6 Gallery, when Artspace moved to Plant Zero in the Manchester area of the city. Shockoe Slip also included some of the earliest rehabilitated downtown apartments; at the time of the restoration asphalt paving was removed to expose historic Belgian block streets. Shockoe Slip continues to be a popular place to live and work. The Martin Agency has maintained its headquarters in Shockoe Slip since 1997. In 2015 digital marketing agency Workshop Digital relocated to the Turning Basin Building in Shockoe Slip, and in 2016 CarMax relocated 125 designers, developers, and programmers to the adjacent Lady Byrd Hat building. Residential development surrounding the James River continues with the influx of students and professionals and an increased interest in urban living. Shockoe Slip was the site of the passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.

Career Elected deputy of Paris in 1936, he sat on the National Assembly from 1945 to 1958. André Le Troquer spoke out against the demands of the armistice of June 1940. In 1942, with Félix Gouin, he defended Léon Blum during the Process of Riom. He sat on the Consultative Assembly of Algiers before being named commissioner of War. He was at the side of Charles de Gaulle at the liberation of Paris. In 1945, Le Troquer became minister of the interior from 23 January 1946 to 2 June 1945 in the Félix Gouin government and minister of national defense in Léon Blum's government from 13 December 1946 to 13 January 1947. Vice President of the National Assembly, he was the interim president of the Congress of Versailles at the time of the election of René Coty to the presidency of the Republic in December 1953. In his capacity as president of the National Assembly, he played an important role throughout the events of May–June 1958 that marked the return of General de Gaulle to power. He went with Senate president Gaston Monnerville to Saint-Cloud for a decisive conference with de Gaulle and was there assured that de Gaulle's return would be carried out in conformance to constitutional practices. He read René Coty's message announcing that he had \\"appealed to the most renowned of the French\\" and presided over the sittings from the first to the third of June 1958 (inauguration of de Gaulle and powers to refine the new constitution). Defeated in the legislative elections of November 1958, he left politics in 1960 but not without having called for a \\"no\\" vote on the referendum of 8 January 1961 about Algeria. Le Troquer was charged with \\"offenses against morality\\" in the 1959 ballets roses scandal for which he was sentenced to probation and charged a modest fine. Le Troquer was president of the Municipal Council of Paris. He was decorated with the Croix de guerre for his participation in World War I where he was injured, resulting in the amputation of his right arm.

Jake T. Forbes is credited as the creator, and Chris Lie is the illustrator. The covers for all four volumes were drawn by Kouyu Shurei. It is published by Tokyopop. Return to Labyrinth is a four-part series starting with Volume 1 that was released in August 2006. Volume 2 was released in October, 2007, and was originally going to be titled Goblin Prince of the Labyrinth, but instead the Return to Labyrinth title is used for all volumes. Originally planned as a three-part series, it was announced at the end of the second volume that the story would be expanded to four volumes. Volume 3 was released on May 12, 2009. The final volume was released on August 3, 2010. The story takes place about thirteen years after the events of Labyrinth and centers around Toby, who by this time has grown up into a teenager. It received generally positive reviews. Synopsis=Volume I It has been over a decade since the events of Labyrinth, wherein Sarah Williams defeated the Goblin King and rescued her baby half-brother, Toby. Jareth, the Goblin King, has watched as Toby grows up into a teenager, secretly giving him everything he desired regardless of its attainability, propriety or scale. Through the years, Toby noticed the strange way all his wishes came true, but never understood the reason behind it. Despite this, he seems to have grown up into a reasonably well-adjusted teenage boy. He has no memory of the time that he was kidnapped by goblins and no idea of Sarah's rescue of him. Sarah herself has become a teacher. Jareth has been watching Toby, it seems, because he still intends for Toby to become his heir. A deadline is drawing near and other individuals, including a mysterious queen and the mayor of Goblin City, are eying the throne. Jareth eventually lures Toby back to the Labyrinth, where he meets various creatures, including some that his sister encountered during her own adventure. Volume II Immediately following Volume 1, Jareth names Toby his heir and then disappears. Mizumi, the Queen of Moraine, and her two daughters decide to stay with Toby in the Goblin Castle \\"to help him out\\". After a brief scuffle in the \\"History of Toby\\" museum, Toby embraces his destiny as the new leader of the goblins and begins training for the role. Mizumi volunteers to teach Toby magic, giving him a small vial of magical water from Moraine. During their lessons Mizumi reveals her past romantic history with Jareth and his subsequent building of the Labyrinth \\"to keep everyone, including [Mizumi] out\\". A flashback shows Jareth after Sarah's retrieval of Toby. He appears frustrated and unsettled, and the goblins, who believe that he is losing his powers, prepare to revolt. Jareth visits Mizumi in Moraine, where he requests that she prepare an ablation for him. When Mizumi asks what he offers in return, he offers a wager, claiming that if he wins, he keeps the ablation, but if he loses then \\"the goblin kingdom and its king are [Mizumi's]\\" to handle as she pleases. Mizumi agrees and gives Jareth thirteen years wherein to complete the wager; exactly what the wager entails is not revealed to the reader. Toby's studies interfere with his quest to find Hana's wings; therefore Hana begins searching for them alone. With the aid of Moppet, Hana discovers a locked door in a far tower of the Goblin Castle. After breaking through it, they discover a room closely resembling the bedroom that Sarah had as a teenager, though it also features a closet full of elaborate clothes and a dungeon lock on the door. At this point, Moppet begins to feel uncomfortable because of recognizing the music playing from the music box (\\"As the World Falls Down\\") and having a vision of Jareth demanding her love. Drumlin, Mizumi's daughter, locks them in the room and starts destroying it. During this time, Mizumi takes Toby to the Ministry of Prophecies where they select a prophecy for Toby. Toby only hears part of the prophecy, leaving out a dangerous omen of things to come. When Toby and Mizumi return to the castle, Toby sees Moppet falling. Desperate to save her, he magically extends his arms to catch her, but in the process of saving her life knocks her mask off to reveal her true face. Toby instantly recognizes her as a younger version of his sister, Sarah, but having pale hair and different coloring. Elsewhere, two reptilian creatures in cloaks discuss a plot against someone of importance. The scene then cuts to one of Sarah, who is grading papers when she hears a knock on the door. When she opens it, it reveals Jareth standing before her. Volume III After Moppet's face is revealed, Drumlin is taken to the dungeons, and Mizumi and Spittledrum sit Toby down for an explanation. One of Mizumi's powers, she says, is the ability to create ablations, to remove traits from living beings and give them form and autonomy. Moppet, she reveals, is the ablation that she created as part of her bargain with Jareth. At his request, she stole the part of Sarah Williams that frightened him the most: her dreams. (At about the same time, Toby recalls, the real Sarah gave up on theater and fairy tales and stopped telling him stories about her friends from the Labyrinth.) It is implied but not explicitly stated that the terms of Jareth and Mizumi's wager were that Jareth had to get Moppet to love him. For several years, Jareth kept Moppet a prisoner in the locked tower room. This temporarily restored his power over the goblin kingdom, but when he could not make Moppet love him, his old problems returned. Whether Moppet escaped from Jareth or was discarded is left unclear, but Spittledrum tells Toby of how he found Moppet among the rubbish people and brought her back to the city. One day, he says, Jareth saw Moppet and confronted Spittledrum. He told Spittledrum to keep Moppet out of the palace and gave him a peach. If Moppet ever mentioned anything about a locked room, he said, Spittledrum was to give Moppet the peach. Closing the meeting, Mizumi says that she is fully capable of returning an ablation to its former host, but that this will wipe out the ablation's separate memories and experiences. She also tells Toby that if an ablation dies, the host dies with it, and vice versa. When Toby muses that he wishes to summon Sarah to the labyrinth so that Mizumi can restore her dreams, Moppet objects and runs away. Meanwhile, in the human world, Jareth has gone to see Sarah. She does not immediately recognize him, but accepts his explanation that they know each other from the theater. During this meeting, Jareth seems disappointed that Sarah has made so little of herself but notices that her strong will is still there. It is also shown that Sarah has no memory of ever knowing Jareth, though why this is not revealed. After leaving Sarah, Jareth seeks and finds a specific goblin, Cob, who had been banished to the human world many years earlier. From him, he retrieves a tiny sliver of his own heart, which he had splintered off for safekeeping before his power began to wane; it is as potent as ever. With a good portion of his magic restored, Jareth plots his revenge on Sarah. He creates the Enigma Lain theater in an outdoor park and sends Sarah a ticket. Mizumi visits Drumlin in the dungeons. Though Drumlin apologizes, Mizumi tells her that it is too late and that she has to go \\"home.\\" As Moulin watches from a hidden place, Mizumi reabsorbs Drumlin. Drumlin and Moulin, it is revealed, are Mizumi's own ablations. Drumlin had been an ablation of her hope. Moulin decides to help Toby against Mizumi, but is caught and captured by Mizumi's servant Esker. Before the coronation, one of the strange reptilian creatures meets Toby and offers him a warning in unintelligible anagrams. He also gives Toby a gift, a small medallion. Toby proceeds to his coronation. After a few long rituals, Toby goes through an ordeal in which he locates the Pathfinder, giving him direct control over the Labyrinth's walls. Shortly after this, Mizumi announces her triumph over Jareth and claims the Labyrinth for her own, chaining Toby. The goblin army resists, but Mizumi's own forces rain in from above and defeat them. Candlewic, the captain of the guard, betrays Toby and Spittledrum to Mizumi. Mizumi confronts Moulin in the dungeons. Moulin and Drumlin, she says, are both ablations of the emotions that had bound Mizumi to Jareth. When Moulin asks why Mizumi bothered to create beings who could only die with her or as part of her, Mizumi answers, \\"There is another way. I just didn't want them to know that.\\" Despite this, Mizumi is about to reabsorb Moulin as she did Drumlin, but is interrupted by Esker, who reports that Jareth has made contact with Sarah in the human world. This news upsets Mizumi, who orders Esker to go to the human world and stop Jareth, but Esker explains that he cannot leave the Labyrinth; the Pathmaker is stopping him. Mizumi muses that there may be another way, and sends Esker to kill Moppet so that Sarah will die too. The volume closes with Toby, Skub, Spittledrum and Moulin imprisoned, Moppet climbing the rubbish hills with her peach, and Sarah walking into Jareth's trap. Volume IV Toby is trapped in the Oubliette and nearly loses his mind when he is finally taken to see Mizumi. She reveals that as Jareth's heir, Toby is bound to carry his title and his heart, which Toby is unable to sustain. To explain, she divulges more of her past with Jareth and how they initially met. Mizumi had instantly fallen in love with him, but Jareth's interest in her had been fickle and she demanded to see his heart. In response, Jareth challenged her to find it within the Labyrinth; if Mizumi found it, his heart would be hers, but in exchange, she gave him her word that she would never allow his Labyrinth to be harmed. When she could not find his heart, Jareth insulted her - though she had given everything she could give him, he still found her shallow. In the present, Toby allows Mizumi make him the vessel of her will in order to save his friends and the crumbling Labyrinth. Meanwhile, Hana and Stank end up finding Moulin; freeing her, she joins them as they set off to find Moppet and save Toby. In the wastes, Moppet takes a bite of Jareth's peach and becomes trapped in one of Sarah's greatest dreams: her mother remained married to her father and Sarah is able to pursue her dream of becoming a stage actress. While enchanted, she is attacked by Esker, who has been ordered by Mizumi to kill Moppet. Moulin, Hana, and Stank arrive and manage to save Moppet after a difficult fight, but are trapped when the Labyrinth collapses around them. When Toby arrives to save them, Moulin reveals that Moppet, being made of dreams, cannot be freed easily from Jareth's dreamtrap. To protect Sarah and Moppet, Toby traps them in an enchanted prison and returns to Mizumi. Sarah has walked into Jareth's trap, which features a puppet show before a goblin audience. The show follows Sarah's entire life, including her forgotten adventure in the Labyrinth and ending with how her life has become mediocre. Recognizing Jareth at last, he offers to guide her with the last of his power and let her dreams thrive again before taking her into the world of the Labyrinth. In the dreamtrap, Moppet realizes the flaw within the dream and how Sarah was forced to give up her dream of studying at Juilliard to become an actress. Moppet, now awake, sets off with Moulin, Hana, and Stank to find Sarah and stop Jareth's plans, and they are freed from Toby's prison by Hoggle and Ludo. Toby, uncertain about how to control the dissenting goblins and feeling alone, wanders the Labyrinth until he finds a fountain and is confronted by Jareth. When Jareth criticizes Toby's inability to know what he really wants to do, Toby wishes Jareth out of his life. Toby is transformed into a being resembling Jareth and when he returns to Mizumi, he declares his intention to tear down the Labyrinth and rebuild it. Frustrated with Toby's transformation, Mizumi is encouraged by an illusion of Drumlin to find the person who will lead her to Jareth. Under Jareth's spell, Sarah observes Moppet's progress as a new world shaped by Sarah's will is created. Despite Hoggle and Ludo's apprehension, Moppet is determined to find Sarah; she asks that they support Toby and parts ways with them. When her group reaches a door, Hana picks its brain to get the answer to its riddle and open it, though only Moulin and Moppet make it through. They arrive in a hall of mirrors that all show what they really are and an altar that requires a sacrifice before the next door is opened. When Moulin looks into a mirror, Mizumi finds her and passes through the mirror. To save Moppet, Moulin attempts to stab herself, since as Mizumi's ablation of regret, Mizumi will die as well. Failing that, Moulin forces Mizumi to see her regrets in a mirror, thus severing the link between them. Mizumi stabs Moulin to open the door to Jareth, with Moppet following her. When Moppet finds her, Mizumi has reached a dead end. Realizing that she will never know what Jareth desires, Mizumi creates a door for Moppet to find Sarah, deciding that she can wait for Jareth long after Sarah is gone. When the goblins initiate their revolt, Toby's attempts to control them with force falls apart when Mizumi cancels the contract she made with Jareth. Realizing that he has never been able to make decisions of his own since becoming the Goblin King, Toby relinquishes his role as king and ends the revolt with the goblins as his friends. Meanwhile, Sarah has completed her new world with Jareth nearly able to control her. However, Moppet arrives and confronts him with his attempts to cage her and risking the entire Labyrinth for his own desire, forcing Jareth to justify rescuing Sarah's abandoned dying dreams. After Sarah orders that Jareth show her the fates of her friends, she offers her will to Jareth to save the Labyrinth and frees Moppet from their connection by realizing her own dreams. Jareth is able to repair the Labyrinth and reluctantly accepts Toby's demand to allow everyone to find their own paths. Upon returning to their world, Sarah realizes her dreams by writing stories, allowing the existence of everyone in the Labyrinth to continue, while Toby begins to step away from escaping loneliness through fantasies and finds a friend. Characters Jareth, the Goblin King :The King of the Labyrinth, a vast kingdom within a realm known as the Underground. According to the manga, Jareth has ruled the Labyrinth for 1,300 years. Though he appears human, he has several inhuman abilities including the ability to form crystal orbs with which he can create illusions of all types or view things from a distance. He is also a master of disguise capable of physical transformations, such as changing into a barn owl. In the first volume, he poses as Toby's high school guidance counselor. He does not appear to have aged between the film and the manga. It is revealed that Jareth has been watching Toby grow up through the years and granting his wishes, supposedly in order to prepare Toby into becoming his heir. :In Volume II, more of the history of the Labyrinth is revealed. Part of Jareth's personal history is revealed as well: at one time or another Jareth had a relationship with Mizumi, Queen of Moraine. What exactly their relationship was is left open to interpretation, but it appears to have been a romantic one (Mizumi claims to have loved Jareth), though Jareth seems to have broken their bonds. Mizumi claims that the creation of the Labyrinth was an externalization of Jareth's powers and desire to isolate himself; however, in allowing one person, presumably Sarah, to enter the Labyrinth and in being defeated by that person, his power began to wane. Volume II also further explores Jareth's intentions and feelings towards Sarah, long speculated upon by fans of the film. The manga shows Jareth fixated on Sarah, genuinely frustrated by her refusal of his offer to stay in the Labyrinth as his beloved queen: there is some question as to whether Jareth is free to leave the Labyrinth. On one hand, Toby is warned that, as the Goblin King, he may not leave the Labyrinth unless he is summoned. Jareth's appearances to Toby and Sarah might be explained by their wishes for outside help. His only uninvited visit to the ordinary world takes place after his abdication. However, he is shown visiting Mizumi in Moraine while he is still Goblin King. :He was supposed to be without power following his abdication, but Volume III shows the extent of his fore-planning. Once in the human world, Jareth visits a goblin exile who has been keeping a fragment of Jareth's power preserved for him in an artefact, enough for the former Goblin King to carry out whatever plan he has for Sarah. Toby Williams :The baby whom Jareth kidnapped after he was wished away by his half-sister, Sarah. In the film it was hinted that Jareth became fond of Toby. In the manga, Toby has grown into a high school student who displays characteristics similar to those shown by his half-sister in the film, such as a love of theater and fantasy. He has no memories of his previous time in the Labyrinth nor of Sarah rescuing him. In Volume 1 of the manga, he returns to the Labyrinth after a goblin steals his homework and arrives in a ballroom in the castle beyond the Goblin City, where Jareth declares that he is to become the new king of the Goblin Kingdom. Toby spends most of the second volume coming to terms with his inheritance of the Labyrinth and becoming its king, which he has decided to view as a learning experience. Moppet :A polite and passive girl who resides in the Goblin City as a servant to the Goblin Mayor. She wears a goblin mask to hide her human face. Moppet is shown to have a crush on Candelwic, a tough goblin guardsman, but she seems to be too shy to say so. She dances with Toby in the ballroom before Jareth's declaration. In Volume II, it is revealed that she had been found by one of the trash ladies and then given to Spittledrum as payment for her taxes. Moppet appears to have no memory of anything that had happened to her before this. When Moppet's goblin mask is removed, Toby instantly recognizes her as looking like Sarah, though her connection to Toby's sister remains unexplained until Volume III - she is an ablation of Sarah. Ablations are independent beings created by Mizumi from aspects of people - in this case, Sarah's dreams. In volume IV she travels with Moulin through the traps laid by Mizumi, only to find Sarah in Jareth's clutches. Jareth reveals that he had asked Mizumi to create the ablation of Sarah's dreams in hopes of rescuing them after Sarah rejected them, attempting to control Moppet in hopes using her to restore his power. When she retorts at this, Sarah asks for Moppet's help in rebuilding the Labyrinth and disappears afterward. Hana :A faery whose wings were plucked by goblins as punishment for minor theft. She has a fierce temper and is easily agitated. She befriends Toby during his journey into the Labyrinth and he promises to help her find her wings. When Toby's studies prevent him from helping her search for her wings, she becomes agitated with him and goes with Moppet to find them alone. Stank :Hana's friend and steed. Stank looks like a smaller version of Ludo, having a round body, thick fur, and two short, twisting horns. Like Ludo, he can make rocks and bricks move by calling out to them. Like Ludo, he speaks only in short one- or two-word phrases, namely 'Arooo?'. Although good-natured, Stank has a number of unhygienic habits. In Volume IV Stank eats up Toby's present to Hana and sprouts wings, causing Hana to sigh 'Close enough'. Spittledrum :The somewhat incompetent mayor of the goblin city. He has served Jareth for a long time, and seems to think highly of himself as each time he comes to believe that Jareth will retire from being Goblin King, Spittledrum prepares a speech to accept becoming Jareth's successor. When Toby is named the heir to the Labyrinth, Spittledrum is initially upset but later looks after Toby. Though acute observation, he is able to determine Moppet's origins before she became his servant and forces Mizumi to reveal that Moppet was an ablation created in a wager with Jareth. One panel in Volume II gives his first name as \\"Panjan.\\" Mizumi :The Queen of Moraine, a land known for its beauty and dangerous waters. Known also as the Queen of Cups, Mizumi is a powerful magician and an icy beauty who was once very close to Jareth. Soon after Jareth is defeated by Sarah, he approaches Mizumi to present a wager offering \\"the Goblin Kingdom and its king\\" if she wins in exchange for creating an ablation for him. As of Volume III, the terms of the wager itself are unrevealed. :Mizumi helps Toby prepare for his coronation so that she can seize control herself. To do so, she tutors Toby in magic, alternately believing he is inept but has tremendous potential, in hopes of finding the Pathmaker, who controls the Labyrinth's shifts and changes. She has two daughters, Moulin and Drumlin, and a cold bodyguard named Esker. Volume III reveals that Moulin and Drumlin are actually ablations of Mizumi, created to rid herself of the emotions that kept her pining for Jareth. Mizumi had a stormy relationship with Jareth in Volume IV and wanted to see his heart, but the Goblin King storms off after their argument, saying that he would rather rule over the Goblins. She also stabs Moulin for her treachery. Drumlin :One of Mizumi's daughters. She is very obese as a result of her ability to drink moisture from anything she touches. In Volume III, it is revealed that Drumlin is an externalization of Mizumi's hope. She is reabsorbed by Mizumi when the Queen of Cups regards her as too much of a liability, though Drumlin briefly rematerializes once Mizumi realizes the value of hope. Moulin :Mizumi's other daughter. She carries a rain cloud named Nimbus, having the power to control water, and an umbrella to keep herself dry. Moulin is also a skilled fencer, sparring with Sir Didymus in a demonstration during Toby's physical education lesson, and she preferred dancing with Moppet to dancing with Toby at the Goblin Ball. She often reads a book that details the all impossible outcomes that the reader can imagine. Upon learning that she and Drumlin are Mizumi's ablations, Moulin becomes rebellious and is nearly reabsorbed, though Mizumi is distracted and delays the task. She joins Moppet, Hana, and Stank to find Sarah Williams in Volume IV. When she encounters Mizumi again, it is revealed that Moulin is an externalization of Mizumi's regret. By forcing Mizumi to realize her regret without Moulin, the link between them is broken, allowing Mizumi to stab her without repercussion. Esker :Mizumi's servant. He is tall and imposing, always wearing a skull-like mask (unless that's his face). Unlike Moulin and Drumlin, Esker does not show much interest in anything except his obedience to Mizumi. Sarah Williams :The protagonist of the film. In the manga, she is a supporting character, living a subdued life as an English teacher and sharing a close relationship with her half-brother, Toby. A stylized, younger version of Sarah appears frequently in flashbacks and in scenes of Jareth's imagination. Mizumi briefly takes this form while mocking Jareth about his apparent loss of power. After leaving the Labyrinth to Toby, Jareth approaches Sarah in the human world and is disappointed to find she does not remember him and has discarded her fantasy-related dreams for a more practical life. Jareth winds up luring Sarah into a trap that magically persuades her to take up her old dreams again before bringing her into the Labyrinth world, where he hopes for Sarah's will and imagination will reawaken and create a new and perfect world. Skub :The small goblin who stole Toby's homework and led him into the Labyrinth. A failure in the goblin army, he has become Toby's personal chef. Dingle :The little imp that rings Moppet's alarm clock. The Brick Layer :A spider-like goblin that builds the outer brick walls of the Labyrinth. His perplexing remarks help Toby learn how to maneuver within the Labyrinth. Hoggle :A cowardly dwarf-goblin that once worked for Jareth but became loyal to Sarah in the film. At that time, Jareth had threatened Hoggle to turn him Prince of the Bog of Eternal Stench if Sarah ever kissed him. In the manga, it is shown that Jareth has fulfilled this promise, and Hoggle claims to resent Sarah for this development. Sir Didymus :A small dog-fox goblin first seen in the film. He has a loyal canine steed named Ambrosious. In the manga he is seen sending invitations for Jareth's ball. He becomes Toby's physical education teacher. He is on friendly terms with Moppet. Professors Maelgrot, Nymblie, Glosspan, Glokensteal, and Jodhspur :Toby's teachers in how to become Goblin King. Maelgrot is an artistic goblin who has made the \\"Museum of Toby,\\" of which he is the founder as well as the collector of Toby's old junk, including Lancelot. Nymblie is Toby's drama teacher and fashion advisor. Glockensteal is Toby's economics teacher, money grubber. For goblins, \\"economics\\" seems to be mostly about the art of hoarding and swindling. Toby's philosophy teacher is a noted philosopher, Glosspan, while Jodhspur is Toby's jousting teacher. Ludo :An orange yeti who was being tormented by goblins until Sarah rescued him in the film. He makes a cameo in Volume 1 of the manga. The Blue Worm :A small blue worm who wears a red scarf and lives in the brick wall of the first passage of the Labyrinth. He had encountered Sarah in her journey in Labyrinth, and here he briefly encounters Toby. His wife is the Missus, who was never seen in the film but seen briefly in the manga. The Flegworts :An elderly goblin couple. They own a shop where they sell shoes to their fellow goblins as food. For a time, Hana lives with them, saving their business by making shoes. Irene Williams :Toby's mother, who in the manga is shown as very stern with her son. Irene and Toby have a cold relationship, while Sarah and Toby are shown as very close. Mr. Morrisey :Toby's high school math teacher. He believes Toby is cheating on his test, though this is really the result of Jareth's intervention. He sends Toby to the guidance counselor, who is Jareth in disguise. Release Written by Jake T. Forbes and illustrated by Chris Lie, Return to Labyrinth is published in North America by Tokyopop. Three volumes have been released from August 8, 2006 to May 1, 2009. Madman Entertainment distributes the series in Australia and New Zealand. Volume list=Reception The first volume debuted at the 40th spot in the list of 100 best-selling graphic novels for August 2006 with an estimated 2,400 copies sold. The second volume appeared at the 58th spot with an estimated 2,204 copies sold in October 2007. In May 2009, the third volume sold an estimated 1,386 copies and reached the 76th spot on the list. It also reached the 19th spot in Bookscan's list of the top twenty best-selling graphic novels for May 2009, and ranked 4th on the New York Times manga bestseller list for the week of May 10 to 16. Kristy Valenti, who works for The Comics Journal and Fantagraphics Books, wrote that the series \\"is the most successful at both whetting the nostalgia of the film's cult audience while mining the film's world-building for further narrative opportunities\\"; she noted \\"technical glitches\\" in the first volume, and the lack of bishōnen and bishōjo designs, which she thought the manga needed. IGN's A.E Sparrow praised the adaption, and liked how it was \\"mindful of the source material, but unafraid to strike out and cover some new ground as well\\" by including new characters. Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly and fan of the film, felt that the shift of Sarah to Toby as the protagonist weakened the adaption since it made the premise of the series common. Katherine Dacey rated the second volume a \\"C+\\", stating that while the series showed improvement since the first volume, it felt like a fan fiction and would only appeal to fans of the film. Pop culture references In addition to echoing and retelling elements from several classic fairy tales, Return to Labyrinth often references other Jim Henson projects and science fiction. Several shots of the castle staircases resemble drawings by M.C. Escher. Volume I Irene's note to Toby is held to the fridge by a Kermit the Frog magnet. Uncle Traveling Matt from Fraggle Rock shows up at the ball asking for radishes. Volume II When Maelgrot first sees Toby, he starts, \\"You remind me of the babe!\\", to which his assistant responds, \\"What babe?\\" These are lines from \\"Magic Dance,\\" a song from the film. Toby refers to having read his sister's Choose Your Own Adventure books. Though he doesn't call them by name, he does mention Harlowe Thrombey. When Toby meets the Wiseman, he says that he doesn't know if being Goblin King is what he wants. The Wiseman responds with, \\"You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get what you need.\\" The Wiseman's hat says that it was \\"gathering moss\\" waiting for the Wiseman to complete the phrase, another reference to the Rolling Stones. Mizumi says of Spittledrum, \\"Little hobgoblins consistently have foolish minds,\\" a reference to the quote, \\"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,\\" from Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance. Chef Eskubar, whom Skub replaces, is said to have been killed by exploding chickens. One of Toby's tutors says that he is \\"Quicker with riddles than Hobbits or Sphynxes [sic].\\" At the ministry of prophecies, Toby and Mizumi hear \\"When single shines the triple sun\\" from Dark Crystal and \\"sons of Adam and daughters of Eve,\\" a reference to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. While at the Ministry of Prophecies, there is a book in the top right corner with the name \\"Froud\\" on it, Brian Froud is the conceptual artist that worked on most of Henson's projects, and before his son was born he painted a picture of a baby sitting among goblins...after his son was born he bore a remarkable resemblance of the picture. Toby Froud starred as the \\"babe\\" in the final movie. This was explained in the making of and commentary on the DVD release of Labyrinth. Another book at the Ministry is titled Legend of Dark Crystal, referring to Tokyopop's 2 part Manga series Legends of the Dark Crystal based on the Jim Henson film. Toby's Philosophy teacher, Glosspan, is a reference to the character Pangloss from Candide by Voltaire. Volume III In Toby's flashback, Sarah reads the phrase \\"When the Wizard awoke, the six colored suns were shining...\\" which is from Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz. Cob the Exile's tiny robot, Mandelbrot, addresses Jareth by saying, \\"Please state the nature of the medical emergency,\\" a recurring line of the Doctor's on Star Trek: Voyager, then with \\"I am fluent in over 5000 forms of communication,\\" which is a take on C-3PO's job description, and then with \\"EX-TERMINATE! EX-TERMINATE!\\" like the Daleks from Doctor Who. Later on, he shouts, \\"Resistance is futile!\\" the motto of Star Trek's Borg. In addition, the name \\"Mandelbrot\\" is a reference to both the famous mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and his celebrated Mandelbrot set. The demons whom the jailer is seen playing cards with were featured in an episode of Jim Henson's The Storyteller. The story was about a soldier with a magical sack that he could capture anything in, including the demons, hence the \\"not again!\\" remarks at the mention of the word \\"sack.\\" Volume IV Hana mentions a happy ending for herself in which she seduces a 'Brownie', a fairie sized creature from the 1988 fantasy film Willow. One of the water demons is called \\"Sogglepuss\\" by Hana, referring to the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Snagglepuss. While Moppet is trapped in a dream, she and Sarah's mother recite Miranda and Prospero's lines from The Tempest, by Shakespeare. The play was previously referenced in volume III, when Sarah requests one of her students to read the ending lines of The Tempest during her English class as Jareth observes.

She was portrayed by Karen Drury from 1991 until the character's death in 2000. Susannah was no relation of later Brookside character Dan Morrisey. Storylines=Introduction Susannah is the first wife of Max Farnham (Steven Pinder), and is mentioned frequently from the very first introduction of Max and second wife Patricia (Gabrielle Glaister) to the Close in September 1990. Before arriving on Brookside, Max had begun an affair with Patricia whilst still married to Susannah. He walked out on her and their children Matthew (Gareth and Ryan Jones) and Emily (Victoria Bennett) to set up home with Patricia and they had a child of their own, Thomas (Kieran Warham), who is around eighteen months old when they arrive on the Close. Max continues to pay maintenance to Susannah and Matthew and Emily occasionally visit Max during the Farnhams' first year on Brookside. Patricia is initially uncomfortable with the arrangement, but begins to warm to Max's children and they start to enjoy a good relationship. Taking root Susannah was first seen in the episode transmitted on 15 May 1991, driving away from the Farnhams' house after having dropped the children off. Karen Drury was first credited in the episode transmitted on 22 July 1991, when Patricia arrives home to find her chatting to the Farnhams' nanny Margaret Clemence (Nicola Stephenson) in her living room. Throughout the latter half of 1991, Susannah remains on the Close and attempts to draw Max away from Patricia. In September 1991, when Patricia is unable to accompany Max to a business dinner, Max's partner Geoffrey invites Susannah to pose as Max's wife. On New Year's Eve 1991, Susannah tries to seduce Max while he is away from Patricia on business. He rejects her, and upon returning to Liverpool reconciles with Patricia who discovers that she has breast cancer. Susannah continues to hang around in January 1992, but Patricia heatedly tells her to leave. Susannah returns to the Close in April 1993 to inform Max of her plans to take Matthew and Emily to America for a year to live with her new boyfriend, Andrew. Max is incensed and refuses to sign any paperwork assenting to the move, but Susannah jets off with the children anyway. In June 1993, while Patricia is in London on business, Max takes Thomas to Disneyworld in Florida and whilst there makes a snap decision to kidnap Matthew and Emily and return them to Liverpool. Wracked with guilt at what he has done, he tries unsuccessfully to telephone Susannah's hotel room to explain his actions but finds her at his doorstep vowing to never let him see Matthew and Emily again. With the help of Patricia, Max persuades Susannah to let them have the children for three months until Susannah and Andrew have settled in in the States. Patricia is called away to another meeting in London, leaving Max and Susannah to finalise the children's arrangements but after too much wine, Max invites Susannah into his bed and sleeps with her. The next morning, Patricia's father, David Crosbie (John Burgess), who recently moved into No. 6, calls round and finds Susannah and Max together. Max pleads with David not to tell his daughter but when she finds out, she begins divorce proceedings. Driving Susannah to the airport, Susannah asks Max who he wants - her or Patricia - and he is unable to answer so she takes her flight as scheduled. Max and Patricia eventually reconcile, but Susannah returns to the Close again in September 1995, penniless and homeless after breaking up with Andrew - who has frittered away all her money. She asks Max to help her find a flat, much to Patricia's annoyance, but when he is unable to come up with anything suitable, she moves in with his business associate Dil Palmer to make Max jealous. In March 1996, still living with Dil, Susannah is reintroduced as a main character when Max is wrongfully accused of kerbcrawling. When he keeps this news from Patricia and she finds out from the local newspaper, she refuses to accompany him to court and tells him the trust in their marriage is gone. Whilst Patricia goes to visit her mother in France, Susannah supports Max through the trial and though Patricia returns to congratulate Max when he is acquitted, he walks out on her and moves into Susannah's flat while Dil is away. Patricia leaves the Close for good in April 1996 to live with her mother in France and takes Thomas with her. Max makes a last-gasp U-turn to try to make her stay, but he has lost her for good and they eventually begin divorce proceedings in October 1996. Max is reconciled with Susannah and she quickly moves herself and her children into No. 7 in May 1996. Car accident After Max makes a drunken pass at Sammy Daniels (Rachael Lindsay) in June, the rest of 1996 is a happy time for Susannah as she successfully wins Max round and starts to fill Patricia's shoes in No. 7. They holiday in Ollie (Michael J. Jackson) and Bel Simpson's (Lesley Nightingale) family cottage in the Cotswolds in July, and Susannah becomes a partner in Grants Restaurant in the Autumn. In early 1997, she tries to persuade Max to have a vasectomy and Matthew begins to excel at school hockey. However, tragedy strikes in April 1997, when Susannah and her children were involved in a car crash driving back from an open day at the fire station. Susannah suffered minor injuries but Matthew and Emily were badly injured. Matthew died shortly after reaching hospital and Emily died the next day. Susannah was wracked with guilt as she had been the one driving and had a drink before. Susannah is grief-stricken and collapses at the children's funeral. In May 1997, Max receives news from Patricia that she is moving to Quebec and Patricia's children come to stay at No. 7 before they go - but Susannah cannot cope with having them around and goes on to attempt suicide by overdosing on pills, but Max arrives in time to save her. She makes a recovery and begins to build her life again, but continues to yearn for children. Surrogacy Now desperate for a baby, Susannah agrees to pay neighbour Jacqui Dixon (Alexandra Fletcher) to be a surrogate mother in 1998. Jacqui later gave birth to a baby boy, Harry (Michael Garrett). Susannah and Jacqui had frequent arguments over the child, particularly when Jacqui discovered that Susannah was now pregnant herself. Her initial concern was that Max and Susannah wouldn't want the baby she was expecting but later became concerned that Susannah cared more for her new daughter, Emma (Molly Stewart), more than she did Harry. Her concerns were realised when Susanah became distraught on learning that one of her babies was ill but was clearly relieved that it wasn't Emma. This made Jacqui look into the legal possibility of getting custody of Harry and bond with Max as he was equally concerned about Harry. Single life Susannah and Max's relationship fell apart when she found out that Max had been having a secret affair behind both Susannah's and Patricia's backs for the last 20 years. Susannah threw Max out and began an affair with married neighbour, Greg Shadwick (Mark Moraghan). She also had relationships with local resident Mick Johnson (Louis Emerick) and GP Darren Roebuck (Timothy Deenihan). In August 1999, Susannah and Greg's naked bodies were found after The Millennium Club had exploded after Callum Finnegan (Gerard Kelly) planted a bomb. Greg was killed on impact while Susannah lay in a coma for two months. Greg's youngest daughter, Emily (Jennifer Ellison), blamed Susannah for her father's death, so she and boyfriend Tim O'Leary (Phillip Olivier) proceeded to make Susannah's life a living hell by waging a campaign of harassment against her. The two made peace just before Susannah died. Death On 5 November 2000, Susannah was found dead at the foot of her stairs. Max, Emily, Jacqui, Mick and Darren were all suspected of her murder. Each suspect had visited her at least one point that night and had an exchange of words. The true cause of Susannah's death was finally revealed to be Max, who pushed her in a fit of rage.

Personal life Valentin Rose was the son of mineralogist Gustav Rose (1798–1873), and a nephew to famed mineralogist Heinrich Rose (1795–1864) and to the pharmacist Wilhelm Rose (1792–1867), of whom he published a brief remembrance (Berlin 1867). His great-grandfather was pharmacologist Valentin Rose the Elder (1736–1771), and his grandfather was Valentin Rose the Younger (1762–1807), who was also a noted pharmacologist. His younger brother was the surgeon Edmund Rose. In August 1872 he married Marie Poggendorff, the daughter of Johann Christian Poggendorff. Academic career Rose received his doctorate from the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin in 1854. In 1855, he took a post at the Royal Library at Berlin, where he remained until his retirement in 1905. Under his leadership, the library's Manuscript Department (which he headed from 1886), gained a leading international reputation. He published catalogs of the collection between 1893 and 1905, and among the important discoveries made were texts in the history of medicine and in horticulture. Aristotelian fragments Rose's first edition of the fragments of Aristotle was Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus (1863). As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The third revised edition was published at Leipzig in 1886 with the title Aristotelis Qui Ferebantur Librorum Fragmenta. The engagement of Friedrich Nietzsche with this work has been described in the first chapter of James I. Porter, Nietzsche and the Philology of the Future, Stanford, 2000.

She served as a commissioned ship for 13 years and 4 months. Whiteside (AKA-90) was laid down on 22 April 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Co. under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1190), launched on 12 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Miriam C. Becker, delivered to the Navy on 11 September 1944, and commissioned that same day, Comdr. C. P. Woodson in command. Between 11 September and 7 November, the attack cargo ship fitted out, conducted shakedown training, and underwent post-shakedown availability. She then loaded her first cargo at San Francisco and got underway on the 18th for Hawaii. The ship arrived at Oahu on 24 November and remained in Pearl Harbor until 6 December. On the latter day, she put to sea to participate in Army amphibious exercises at Maui. During a night retirement exercise on the night of 13/14 December, rammed Whiteside on her starboard side near her number 2 hold. Whiteside returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 December to await repairs which began with drydocking on the 24th. She completed repairs on 12 January 1945 and resumed amphibious training with other ships of Transport Squadron (TransRon) 16 at Maui and Kahoolawe Islands. Those operations lasted until 18 January. World War II campaigns The next day, the ship began loading cargo and passengers in preparation for the Iwo Jima assault. She departed Pearl Harbor on 27 January in convoy, bound for Iwo Jima. She stopped at Eniwetok and Saipan along the way and arrived off the objective early on the morning of 19 February. The attack cargo ship participated in the D-Day landings sending supplies and ammunition ashore to the troops struggling to wrest the island from a tenacious foe. She continued to fuel the offensive ashore until 5 March when — with 188 battle casualties embarked — she set a course for Guam in the Marianas, where the casualties disembarked. She then moved on to the New Hebrides. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 19 March and began loading cargo the next day for the Army's 27th Division in preparation for the Ryukyus campaign. Whiteside steamed out of Segond Channel on 25 March bound — via Ulithi — for Okinawa. The attack cargo ship arrived in the Ryukyus on 9 April, eight days after the landings. She remained there a week conducting unloading operations that were frequently interrupted by enemy air raids. During her stay off Okinawa, Whiteside engaged two of the hordes of attacking aircraft, but claimed no kills. On 16 April, she departed Okinawa in company with the other ships of TransRon 16. After stops at Saipan and Guam, the ship arrived at Ulithi on 26 April. On 8 May, the ship stood out of the lagoon and set a course for the southern Solomons. She arrived off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, on the 14th, loaded cargo, and got underway soon thereafter for Munda on New Georgia. From there, she headed for Finschhafen, New Guinea, where she discharged one Army cargo and took on another, bound for the Philippines. Whiteside departed Finschhafen on 2 June and arrived at Leyte on the 6th. There, she discharged a portion of her cargo and then moved to Guiuan Harbor on Samar to unload a Navy cargo. On 12 June, she set sail for Subic Bay where she arrived two days later and unloaded her remaining cargo. She remained at Subic Bay until 25 June when she put to sea to participate in a month of amphibious exercises at Cebu with units of the Americal Division. She returned to Subic Bay on 26 July and began repairing her boilers, an operation which lasted until 7 August. On the latter day, she returned to sea for more amphibious training, this time at Luzon with units of the 1st Cavalry Division. Those exercises ended abruptly on 15 August when Japan capitulated. Whiteside returned to Subic Bay on 16 August and remained there until the 20th when she moved to Batangas on Luzon to load elements of the 1st Cavalry Division for occupation duty in Japan. On 24 August, she departed Batangas in company with Task Force (TF) 33, the Tokyo occupation force. After a 48-hour stopover in Subic Bay, occasioned by a typhoon, she arrived at Yokohama, Japan, on 2 September, the day of the formal surrender ceremonies conducted on board in Tokyo Bay. Over the next two days, she unloaded her embarked troops and their attendant cargo and, on the 4th, shaped a course for Leyte. Post- war Whiteside arrived at Leyte on 11 September, fueled and provisioned, and then headed for Mindanao to load troops and cargo of the Army's 41st Infantry Division. She completed her mission at Mindanao on 19 September and departed the island on the 20th, returning to Tacloban on Leyte. On the 22nd, the attack cargo ship stood out of Leyte Gulf on her way to Kure, Japan. Diverted to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, en route, the ship did not reach Japan until 5 October. She remained in Japan until 15 October at which time she got underway for Manila in the Philippines to load landing craft for duty in conjunction with the transfer of Nationalist Chinese troops. She arrived in Manila on 21 October and departed again on the 23rd. On the 26th, she arrived in Hai Phong, French Indochina, and began loading troops and cargo of the 583rd Regiment of the Nationalist Chinese Army. The attack cargo ship stood out of Hai Phong on 30 October and set a course for Chinwangtao where she arrived on 7 November. She disembarked the Chinese troops on the 7th and departed Chinwangtao the following day, bound for Taku. The ship remained at Taku until early December when she got underway for the United States. She arrived in San Francisco on 27 December. Whiteside remained at San Francisco until the summer of 1946. On 5 June, she got underway for the Marshall Islands to provide support services for \\"Operation Crossroads\\", the large-scale nuclear tests conducted at Bikini Atoll that summer. She reached Kwajalein Atoll on 17 June and remained in the Marshalls assisting the operation until the end of August when she embarked upon a voyage that took her to Okinawa, Guam, Eniwetok, and thence back to Pearl Harbor. The ship remained at Pearl Harbor from the end of October to the latter part of November. On 23 November, she departed Oahu and set a course for the Marshalls. She arrived at Majuro on 30 November, visited Kwajalein during the first week in December, and Eniwetok in mid-month, before beginning a voyage that took her via Guam and Japan to China. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 16 January 1947 and, for the next six weeks, made port visits to Sasebo, Tsingtao and Shanghai. On 5 March, she departed Tsingtao and shaped a course — via Okinawa and Oahu — for the California coast. She arrived at San Francisco on 28 April and remained there until 15 June when she headed back to the Far East. Whiteside reached Tsingtao on 3 July and stayed there until 27 July when she sailed for Shanghai. From there, she moved on to Sasebo and thence to Yokosuka where she lay in port from 10 August to 3 September. The ship visited Okinawa during the second week in September and then spent the rest of the month at Guam in the Marianas. She returned to Tsingtao on 7 October but departed again five days later headed — via Yokosuka — back to the west coast. Whiteside arrived in San Francisco on 29 October to begin a seven- month tour of duty plying the waters along the west coast of North America. She visited ports ranging south to San Diego and north to Adak and Kodiak in Alaska, though for the most part she remained in Californian waters. On 10 June 1948, she departed San Francisco to return to the western Pacific. She stopped at Pearl Harbor in mid-June and then continued on to Tsingtao where she arrived on 7 July. She visited Shanghai, Sasebo, and Yokosuka in July and August. Early in September, she stopped at Subic Bay in the Philippines before continuing on to the Marianas where she made port calls at Guam and Saipan. From Saipan, she set a course for Pearl Harbor on 21 September. Following a seven-day stop at Oahu, the attack cargo ship continued her voyage east on 7 October and arrived in Oakland, California, on the 12th. She remained there until 26 November when she got underway to return to the Far East. The ship made Yokosuka late in December and visited Kogo Saki, Sasebo, and Tsingtao before beginning the return voyage late in January 1949. On her way home, Whiteside made a 16-day stopover at Pearl Harbor before continuing on to San Francisco, where she arrived on 27 February. The ship remained there until 7 May when she moved to San Diego. After a pause at the latter port from 8 May to 11 May, she departed there on the 11th and steamed, via Pearl Harbor, back to Yokosuka, which port she entered on 9 June. Over the following five weeks, she stopped at Sasebo, Okinawa, Taiwan, and Subic Bay before departing the latter place on 18 July to return home. Following the customary stop at Pearl Harbor from 30 July to 6 August, she resumed her voyage and entered San Francisco Bay on 11 August. In late August and early September, she made a round-trip voyage from the west coast to Pearl Harbor and back before entering the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a three-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 4 January 1950 and departed Mare Island that same day, bound for the Orient. She enjoyed a month at Oahu, from 10 January to 11 February, and then continued on to Manila where she arrived on 24 February. During March, she visited Subic Bay, Guam, and Saipan before heading home on 6 April. On the night of 25 April and 26 April, Whiteside shifted to San Francisco where she remained for a month before embarking upon a voyage to the Marshall Islands. That voyage, which lasted from 26 May to 10 July, included both outbound and return voyage stops at Pearl Harbor in addition to visits to Eniwetok and Kwajalein Atolls. Korean War service While Whiteside completed the return voyage to the west coast, events in the Far East ordained her return to that theater of operations. On 25 June, the armed forces of communist North Korea invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the United States moved rapidly to bolster South Korea. With elements of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade (Reinforced) embarked, Whiteside stood out of San Diego on 14 July, bound for Japan. She made port at Yokosuka on the 30th and, by 2 August, was at Pusan, South Korea, the major port through which United Nations men and materiel were being funneled into the conflict, and landed her marines. She departed Pusan on 5 August and reentered Yokosuka two days later. On the night of 1/2 September, she moved to Kobe and, on the 10th, from there to Inchon carrying troops and supplies to assault Inchon and begin the drive on Seoul. She remained at Inchon from the day of the initial landings, 15 September, until D plus 6 at which time she headed back to Japan. She arrived in Sasebo on the 22nd but departed there again the next day to return to the United States. The attack cargo ship arrived at San Francisco on 8 October and remained there for three weeks before getting underway to return to the Far East. After a non- stop voyage, she arrived in Sasebo on 17 November. On the 23rd, she weighed anchor for Yokosuka where she entered port on the 25th. After a 10-day stay at Yokosuka and a brief stop at Sasebo, Whiteside arrived at Inchon on 10 December to participate in the evacuation of United Nations forces on the heels of the massive communist Chinese intervention. The ship returned to Yokosuka on 17 December and headed for home on the 20th. She arrived in San Francisco on 5 January 1951. Two round-trip voyages between San Francisco and Sasebo occupied her time between February and August 1951. From August to early December, she operated on the west coast and then headed back to the western Pacific. After stops at Sasebo and Yokosuka, Whiteside returned to San Francisco on 7 February 1952. The routine, voyages between San Francisco and Japan, occupied her for the remainder of her active career. She completed her last round-trip to the Orient on 28 February 1957 and, after almost a year of west coast operations, was decommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 30 January 1958. Whiteside remained in reserve with the Pacific Reserve Fleet until the spring of 1971 at which time she was sunk as a target. Awards Whiteside earned two battle stars for World War II service and four battle stars for service in the Korean War.

Leadlights, leaded lights or leaded windows are decorative windows made of small sections of glass supported in lead cames. The technique of creating windows using glass and lead came is discussed at came glasswork. The term leadlight could be used to describe all windows in which the glass is supported by lead, but traditionally and correctly, a distinction is made between stained glass windows and leadlights, the former being associated with the ornate painted images on windows of churches and other such works of architecture and the latter with the windows of vernacular commercial and domestic architecture and defined by its simplicity. Since the traditional technique of setting glass into lead cames is the same in both cases, in the late 20th century the divisions between \\"leadlight\\" and \\"stained glass\\" became blurred, and the terms are now often incorrectly used interchangeably for any window employing this technique, while the term \\"stained glass\\" is often extended to apply to any windows, sculpture, and works of art using coloured glass. Description of traditional leadlight Traditionally, leadlight windows differ from stained glass windows principally in being less complex in design and employing simpler techniques of manufacture. Stained glass windows, such as those commonly found in churches, usually include design components that have been painted onto the glass and fired in a kiln before assembly. The extra time and cost employed in painting and firing the glass usually prohibited its use in domestic architecture. While stained glass windows are found principally in churches and ornate buildings, leadlight windows, which rarely employ painted components, are much more common, and from the 1860s to the 1930s were a regular architectural feature in many private houses and cottages, where their style is often a clue to the age of the building. Unlike stained glass windows which are traditionally pictorial or of elaborate design, traditional leadlight windows are generally non-pictorial, containing geometric designs and formalised plant motifs. Leadlight windows almost always employ the use of quarries, pieces of glass cut into regular geometric shapes, sometimes square, rectangular or circular but most frequently diamond-shaped, creating a \\"diaper\\" pattern. A further difference between traditional stained glass and leadlight is that the former almost always has painted pictorial details over much of the glass, requiring separate firing after painting by the artist. In traditional leadlight this is not the case, painted quarries being separately produced and leaded in with those of plain glass, in the form of armorial crests and occasionally small scenes painted in grisaille (grey). Quarries painted in grisaille were employed both in the Medieval period and in the 19th century, the most famous ancient windows to have been decorated in this manner being in York Minster; these have inspired many 19th century imitations painted with little birds. Quarries may be mould-cast into patterns such as fleur de lys and imprinted with black and yellow stain. Used extensively during the 19th century in England and Commonwealth countries, these quarries are often the product of a single studio, James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars. Another form of decorative quarry is the etched or engraved quarry, which is made of flashed glass, most often ruby red or royal blue over a transparent layer. It then has a design cut into it using either acid or a lathe, the character of the resultant design differing accordingly. Etched quarries of Venetian glass are often employed, sometimes in conjunction with panels of stained glass, particularly in Italy and Eastern Europe. Lathe-cut quarries with a simple star-burst pattern are very common in the late 19th century domestic architecture of many regions, both in leadlighting and in simpler wooden-framed glazing. The colours employed in leadlight windows may range from delicate pastels to intense hues. The glass used may be textured or patterned or bevelled (as in the small panel from the 1920s illustrated above). However, since they are generally non-pictorial, and are primarily to illuminate the interior, with or without a decorative function, the glass is usually of pale hue, or transparent.

Origin and continuity The work of the leadlighter was essentially to provide windows that excluded the weather, but admitted light into buildings. Leadlight has been in use for over a thousand years, having its origins in the Roman and Byzantine windows that were made of thin sheets of alabaster set in armatures of wood or wrought iron. With the employment of small pieces of glass as the translucent material (rather than alabaster), lead \\"cames\\" of H-section were used to hold the glass in place, with the iron armatures being retained as support for larger windows. By the late Middle Ages the profession of domestic leadlighter was common across Europe. Until World War II most towns had a commercial shop producing domestic leadlight. These craftsmen did not refer to their product as \\"stained glass\\". The provision of decorative stained glass windows was a task requiring many more complex skills than the provision of domestic leadlight. However, some of the major stained glass studios that produced church windows also produced leadlight for commercial and domestic buildings, so that the division became blurred, and the leadlights, particularly for public buildings, were occasionally very ornate as in the windows of Central Railway Station, Sydney (below). In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the previously accepted division between leadlight and stained glass has almost disappeared, with the terms \\"stained glass\\" and \\"leadlight\\" often being used interchangeably. This is because the techniques of construction of a pictorial stained glass window and a domestic leadlight window are basically the same, and any glass that is coloured or carries a stain is generally referred to as stained glass.

File: Franz Wilhelm Seiwert Glasfensterentwurf Café Namur.jpg  A design for a cafe window by Franz Wilhelm Seiwert, 1928 History=15th–17th centuries Many buildings exist that were glazed at this period, Little Moreton Hall (1555–1559) in Cheshire, England, being particularly famous for the extensive nature of its leadlighting. During this period large sheets of glass were unavailable. Domestic windows were generally small and were made of broad glass or cylinder glass before crown glass was first made in England in 1678. Broad glass is usually around 1.5 to 2 mm thick and uneven, often with scars and marks on the surface where it has been 'ironed' flat, and often has a greenish tint. Later windows often had crown glass, which has a much better surface quality and shows slight concentric ripples that form as the disk is spun. Old windows often contain a mixture of several types of glass, as they will have been re- leaded about every 100 years, with the replacement of some of the quarries. The irregular glinting surface of diamond-pane windows is a distinctive feature of old European houses. The diaper shape of the panes gave greater stability than square-cut straight-set panes, and it is accordingly more common. It was also convenient to cut diamond-shaped panes from a single \\"crown\\" of glass with less waste than that caused by cutting square panes. Square panes are most often found in the grander or later buildings, and sometimes only on ground floor windows. In grander houses, the windows often contain small painted panes or stained glass panels containing heraldic emblems and coats of arms. Some European churches also retain diaper glass of this period, some, like York Minster, with painted and fired quarries. During the 19th and early 20th century a great number of important medieval houses were restored and had their windows returned to an earlier style of glazing. The glazing of the western range of Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, is particularly effective as each pane is set at a different angle to those adjacent, creating jewel-like facets when seen from the exterior. Late 17th–18th centuries With the development of sash windows, leadlighting became much less common in the domestic setting, giving way to larger panes of glass set into wooden frames. Doors were often surmounted by decorative fanlights in which the panes of glass might be supported by lead, but wood was also commonly used as the support for the glass in fanlights. Casement windows and fixed windows continued to employ leadlight, often with larger panes of rectangular rather than diamond shape. Large windows set in public buildings and churches of this period also employed rectangular panes of leadlight supported by armatures emphasizing the classical design of the windows. Heraldic motifs in stained glass were often set into the windows. 19th century By 1840 there was a growing fashion for the Medieval. The Gothic Revival brought about a new popularity for diamond-pane windows, which were initially found in homes of the wealthy. Soon the fashion for leadlight windows spread, promoted by the Arts and Crafts Movement. Leadlight became a commonplace feature of houses, generally to be found in or around the front door. The style might be medievalising, formal classical motifs or Arts and Crafts designs which often included among the motifs lilies, tulips and sunflowers. In the late Victorian period it was common for leadlight windows in wealthier homes to contain small rondels painted in grisaille (grey) and depicting birds or fruit and flowers representing the seasons. During this period also, many churches and public buildings were constructed in Revival styles. Many public buildings such as town halls, public libraries, museums and hospitals had their public spaces glazed with pale-coloured leadlight, creating a pleasant ambience in areas where good lighting was required, but a view was not. At this time also a great number of new churches were constructed, particularly in England, the United States, countries of the British Commonwealth, and Japan. Many of these churches were initially glazed with leadlight, often in pastel cathedral glass or Powell's cast quarries with impressed designs. Although frequently the windows have later been replaced with pictorial stained glass, many such windows remain, particularly in less visible locations such as organ lofts and ringing chambers. In Sydney, the Anglican Church of St. Philip's, Church Hill retains an intact set of Powell's impressed quarries.

Sydney 20th century Prior to World War I, in domestic architecture, the front entrance remained the focus for decorative leadlighting. It was also commonly used for stairwell windows, but was uncommon in other locations where large panes of glass were valued over small ones. The Art Nouveau or Secessionist style dominated the design, leading to the incorporation of many long curved sections of glass that were never previously a feature of leadlight windows. As in the 19th century, there was much application of leadlighting to the foyers and public spaces of public buildings. Many late 19th and early 20th century commercial buildings make extensive use of leadlighting, particularly in shopping arcades and tea rooms. Leadlighting in translucent glass was also used extensively for internal doors of public and commercial buildings, theatres and other such venues because it enabled people approaching the door from opposite sides to be visible to each other. In domestic architecture, after World War I, the focus on the decoration of the front door became less common, and the front windows became the location of leadlighting. Many houses of the 1920s and 30s have Mock Tudor elements, including gables decorated with pseudo half-timbering and leadlight casement windows in diamond panes at the front of the house. This architectural style is commonly found in public houses of the time, and also in school buildings. With the \\"bungalow\\" style of architecture becoming increasingly popular, sash windows were also often made with leadlighting, often incorporating sections of glass very much larger than in traditional diapered windows. This trend continued until World War II, the style evolving from Art Nouveau to Art Deco, which both employed a great variety of glass, including cathedral glass and opalescent glass, as well as bevelled glass. From 1940 until about 1980 domestic leadlighting was less common. The designs varied greatly in character and quality in this period, with the famous designers Louis Comfort Tiffany, Alphonse Mucha and Charles Rennie Mackintosh all having much influence on leadlighting, both commercial and domestic. Many of the larger-scale works in leadlight of this period, particularly in public and commercial venues, are artistic masterpieces. The medium responded to local character, and local events. A typical example is the effect of the unification of the Australian states through Federation in 1901, which brought a profusion of designs based on Australian flora and fauna to local leadlight production, a notable example being the windows of the booking hall of Sydney's Central Railway Station.

File:Karlstads domkyrka window straight.JPG  Post-Modern leadlighting combining traditional diamond pane form with the squareness of an iron armature and the arch of a church window in a design of great precision and subtlety. Karlstad Cathedral, Sweden. Late 20th century The late 20th century has seen a popular revival of the craft, which is now widely taught in technical colleges and practised by many artists, both commercial and hobbyists. With a revival of the craft, both abstract design and formalised pictorial motifs have flourished, as has the use of irregularly textured and patterned glass. Many leadlight artists employ simple pictorial forms that can be achieved without recourse to painting and firing. Recent formalised motifs have included butterflies, yachts on the ocean and a wide range of flora. Whereas in the early 20th century the product of a small leadlighting studio generally reflected trends in modern architecture and was produced with great competence by professional craftsmen fully trained through apprenticeship, modern leadighting is increasingly the province of amateurs. The resultant product often demonstrates a lack of formal design training on behalf of the craftsperson, and a lack of awareness of stylistic trends. The finer products of late 20th and 21st century leadlighting continue to display a mastery of the traditional technical skills, an awareness of design trends and original creative artistry. Artificial leadlight A commercially produced product, often referred to as \\"stained glass\\" or \\"leadlight\\", is made of single sheets of glass with self-adhesive lead placed on both sides to replicate lead cames, and either a film or stain placed on the surface to replicate coloured glass. This product has wide domestic application and may be mistaken for genuine stained glass or leadlight. Another method now available is the use of coloured resins that are floated onto the glass, with the different colours divided by a line of resin that emulates the lead came which is used in traditional pieces.

Houghton Mifflin) The Great Railway Bazaar: By Train Through Asia is a travelogue by American novelist Paul Theroux, first published in 1975. It recounts Theroux's four-month journey by train in 1973 from London through Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and his return via the Trans-Siberian Railway. The first part of the route, to India, followed what was then known as the hippie trail. It is widely regarded as a classic in the genre of travel writing.Travelliterature.org It sold 1.5 million copies upon release. In the book, Theroux explored themes such as colonialism, American imperialism, poverty, and ignorance. These were embedded in his accounts of sights and sounds he experienced as well as his conversation with other people such as his fellow travelers. It included elements of fiction such as descriptions of places, situations, and people, reflecting the author's own thoughts and outlook. Contemporaneous reviews noted how his background allowed him the breadth of insights to authoritatively describe people even when there are instances when he committed ethnic generalizations. Prior to the publication of The Great Railway Bazaar, Theroux lived in Africa, Singapore, and England. In a 2013 article, Theroux outlined several inspirations that led him to embark on his journey and publish his experiences. These include his fascination for trains, which offered what he described as an opportunity to break monotony as well as a respite from work. He wrote: > I could think clearly on the London trains and when, on the rare occasions, > I travelled out of London – on the Exeter line via Sherborne, Yeovil, and > Crewkerne, to visit my in‑laws, or on the Flying Scotsman on a journalistic > assignment, my spirits revived and I saw with clarity that it might be > possible to conceive a book based on a long railway journey. Sequel In 2006, Theroux retraced the journey, finding that people and places had changed, and that while his earlier work was known in many places, he was not recognised in person. His account of this second journey was published as Ghost Train to the Eastern Star.

History  The confederation was convened in 1834 by British Resident James Busby. Busby had been sent to New Zealand in 1833 by the Colonial Office to serve as the official British Resident, and was anxious to set up a framework for trade between Māori and Europeans. The Māori chiefs of the northern part of the North Island agreed to meet with him in March 1834. Rumours began spreading that the Frenchman Baron Charles de Thierry planned to set up an independent state at Hokianga. The United Tribes declared their independence on 28 October 1835 with the signing of the Declaration of Independence. In 1836, the British Crown under King William IV recognized the United Tribes and its flag. Busby's efforts were entirely too successful: as the islands settled down, the British began to consider an outright annexation. By 1839, the Declaration of the United Tribes had 52 signatories from Northland and a few signatories from other parts, notably from the ariki of the Waikato Tainui, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero. In February 1840, a number of chiefs of the United Tribes convened at Waitangi to sign the Treaty of Waitangi. During the Musket Wars (1807–1842), Ngāpuhi and other tribes raided and occupied many parts of the North Island, but eventually reverted to their previous territorial status as other tribes acquired European weapons. From a New Zealand standpoint under the settler government, the Confederation has been considered to have been assimilated into a new entity after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi; the Declaration is viewed in large part as merely a historical document. In recent times, questions have arisen regarding the constitutional relevance of the Declaration.  New Zealand Company use of United Tribes flag  In 1840 the New Zealand Company raised the flag of the United Tribes at their settlement in Port Nicholson (Wellington), proclaiming government by \\"colonial council\\" that claimed to derive its powers from authority granted by local chiefs. Interpreting the moves as \\"high treason\\", Governor William Hobson declared British sovereignty over the entirety of the North Island on 21 May 1840, and on 23 May declared the council illegal. He then despatched his Colonial Secretary, Willoughby Shortland, with 30 soldiers and six mounted police on 30 June 1840, to Port Nicholson to tear down the flag. Shortland commanded the residents to withdraw from their \\"illegal association\\" and to submit to the representatives of the Crown. Modern developments As of October 2010, the Waitangi Tribunal began investigating the claim by Ngāpuhi that their sovereignty was not ceded in their signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal, in Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry (Wai 1040) is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi 1840.

The winner of three designs put to 25 northern Maori chiefs at Waitangi by James Busby and Captain Lambert of the man-of-war HMS Alligator. New Zealand United Tribes flag, 1833–1835, drawn by Nicholas Charles Phillips of the man- of-war HMS Alligator. Waitangi, flying (left – right) the Flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, the Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Union Flag, 5 February 2006 The idea of a flag to represent New Zealand first arose when the New Zealand-built trading ship Sir George Murray was seized in Sydney for sailing without a flag or register in 1830. British navigation laws applied in Australia and ruled that every ship must carry an official certificate that included the nationality of the ship. New Zealand was not yet a British colony, so could not sail under a British flag or register. With no flag to represent the islands, trading ships and their cargoes could be confiscated. While a temporary licence was granted for the Sir George Murray by New South Wales authorities, it was clear that a more permanent solution was needed. Busby was approached by Maori chiefs in 1833 about the matter of a flag. Busby asked Reverend Williams and the Colonial Secretary Richard Bourke in New South Wales for assistance, and, with additional consultation with tribal leaders, three designs were drawn up. On 20 March 1834, three designs were put to 25 northern Maori chiefs at Waitangi by James Busby and Captain Lambert of the man-of-war HMS Alligator. By a vote of 12-10-3, the design now widely known as the United Tribes Flag was chosen. British, American, and French representatives witnessed the ceremony, which included a 13-gun salute from the Alligator.\\"History\\", united-tribes.com. Retrieved 7 February 2014. The flag was based in part on the St George's Cross that was already used by the Church Missionary Society, with a canton featuring a smaller red cross on a blue background fimbriated in black, and with a white eight-pointed star in each quarter of the canton. When officially gazetted in New South Wales in August 1835, the description did not mention the fimbriation or the number of points on the stars. The description was: \\"A red St. George's Cross on a white ground. In the first quarter, a red St. George's Cross on a blue ground, pierced with four white stars.\\" This version of the flag served as the de facto national flag of New Zealand from 1835 until the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in February 1840, although the United Tribes flag continued to be used as a New Zealand flag after the Treaty, for example the flag features on the medals presented to soldiers who served in the South African War (1899–1902). The version of the flag with black fimbriation and eight-pointed stars is widely used today as a flag by Māori groups throughout New Zealand, who also refer to it as the He Whakaputanga flag. In July 2009 it was proposed as one of four possible designs for an official Māori flag at a series of hui around New Zealand. The flag is also occasionally encountered with black or white fimbriation and six-pointed stars. As stated in E.M.C. Barraclough's book Flags of the World (), The Shaw, Savill & Albion Line used this flag (though with white fimbriation instead of black and a proportions change from 1:2 to 3:5) as its company flag during its existence from 1882 to 1974.

The first official world championships were held for men in 1956 and for women in 1970. Bikes Specialised stunt bicycle Pair artistic cycling The bicycles used for artistic cycling are a form of fixed gear bicycle. The gearing of the chainring and sprocket are run at or near a one- to-one ratio, but the chainring may not have fewer teeth than the sprocket. The wheels must be of equal size and are closely spaced in order to make tricks, such as wheelies, easier to perform. The handlebars are similar in form to a shallow drop handlebar found on a racing bicycle which has been turned upside down. Handlegrips or bar tape are applied to the top, horizontal portions of the bar. The handlebar, which can spin 360°, is mounted to a stem that has no horizontal extension, which puts the stem clamp in line with the steering axis and allows for the handlebars to remain in the same relative position no matter whether the front wheel is facing forward or backward.

Formula The newspaper aims at young, well-educated (HBO or University) readers in the 25-34 age group, most of whom currently do not read a newspaper, or only the free tabloids Metro and Spits. Secondarily, nrc•next aims at the 20-39 age group. nrc•next cooperates closely with the evening newspaper NRC Handelsblad, but has its own independent editors. About 60% of the content of nrc•next is taken from the NRC, the paper using a team of thirty people to reformulate its contents to a format more suitable for a younger audience. Furthermore the nrc•next is supplemented with graphics, columns, comics and puzzles. The newspaper is intended for \\"the new generation of interested media-users who use news and information in a different way\\", according to NRC executive editor Folkert Jensma. The news is delivered in concise format, because it is assumed that the readers have already picked up the basics from other sources. For the same reason, some news items are not covered at all. Background, analysis and opinion are thus the main focus of the paper. The paper was originally only published on Monday to Friday. It is marketed as a competitor for freesheets or, as the publishers claimed at the launch, it is \\"a newspaper for people who don't read paid newspapers.\\" It costs one euro and ten cents, less than other paid newspapers. Regular readers can take a weekday subscription, or they can opt for a subscription for of nrc•next on weekdays and the NRC Weekend (Saturday edition for NRC Handelsblad and nrc•next) Saturday.

It runs between Stillwater and Ngakawau via Westport on the West Coast of the South Island. It was one of the longest construction projects in New Zealand's history, with its first section opened in 1889 but the full line not completed until 1942.  Construction  A railway link from Greymouth east to Brunner was opened in 1876, but work on a link from this point to Westport became delayed for ten years by disputes over the best route to link the West Coast with Nelson and Canterbury. Ultimately, the New Zealand Midland Railway Company (NZMRC) was formed to construct the route, and in 1886, work recommenced. The junction of the route to Westport and the Midland Line to Canterbury was established just east of Brunner in Stillwater, and the NZMRC put most of its energy into the first portion of the SWL from Stillwater to Reefton. This was due to the comparatively easier terrain faced by the route in the valley of the Grey River, and in 1889, the line was opened to Ngahere. On 29 February 1892, the NZMRC opened the line all the way to the south bank of the Inangahua River, directly opposite Reefton, and with the Stillwater–Reefton portion complete in their view, they redirected their energy to the Midland route from Stillwater to Otira. In the mid-1890s the NZMRC ran out of funds and, after a dispute in the courts, was taken over by the central government. Work on the SWL recommenced in the 20th century, with the Inangahua River bridged, the present-day Reefton station established, and a further section to Cronadun opened in 1908. At the Westport end, construction also commenced, with a 9 km line opened in 1912 from Westport to Te Kuha at the western end of the Lower Buller Gorge. In 1914, the line from Cronadun reached Inangahua Junction, where the NZMRC intended its lines to Westport and Nelson to diverge (in fact, Inangahua remained the probable site for a junction until all work on the Nelson Section ceased in the 1930s). However, the outbreak of World War I brought a halt to construction with only the section through the Buller Gorge to complete. The Buller Gorge posed many difficulties for construction, and little work was done on the line for over two decades. Only after the 1935 election brought about a change in government was there a serious push to complete the line (as well as the similarly postponed Main North Line). The outbreak of World War II created further delays on construction, but this time, work continued through wartime, the 'last spike' ceremony being on 2 December 1941. The Public Works Department was in charge of construction and were able to operate trains the length of the line by July 1942, but ownership of the route was not transferred to the New Zealand Railways Department until 5 December 1943.  Operation  Before the line was completed, mixed trains operated on sections open for service, and between August 1936 and August 1938 a daily morning railcar service was provided from Hokitika on the Ross Branch to Reefton and return by a diminutive Midland railcar. Once the line was completed Vulcan railcars operated from Westport to Stillwater, where they connected with services to Christchurch, and a local service ran between Greymouth and Reefton. The poor roads in the region meant there was more demand for a passenger service than on many other rural routes in New Zealand that lost their passenger services by 1940, but road upgrades led to increasing competition from the private car and all passenger services on the line ceased in 1967. Commodities such as coal, timber, and cement have been the mainstay of freight on the line, and in the 1950s, when coal was still shipped from Westport and Greymouth, the occasional closure of one port meant every operational locomotive on the West Coast was pushed into duty to haul coal up or down the SWL to the other port. Today, the coal traffic still exists in substantial quantities, but it is no longer shipped from West Coast ports; it is carried by train to the deep harbour in Lyttelton on the east coast. When the line was completed, UC class steam locomotives were utilised on the line, with the B and BA classes introduced in 1957. This was the last mainline duty performed by the B and BA locomotives, and as bridges on the SWL were strengthened, they were displaced in the 1960s by the heavier A and AB classes. In 1969, the SWL became one of the last lines in New Zealand to be dieselised, with the DJ class introduced. In the 1980s, DC locomotives were also placed into service on the line. One notable feature was the necessity to bank heavy trains heading south from Reefton to Stillwater due to the difficult uphill grade. This was a common feature during the era of steam locomotives, and although banking was dispensed with on most lines when the conversion to diesel-electric motive power was made, the SWL was initially an exception. Some trains had two DJ class locomotives at each end, but this practice has now come to an end, with trains usually formed and loaded in such a way that banking is unnecessary.

He is known in the United States as the Spanish play- by-play announcer for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and the personal ring announcer for The Latin American Xchange, a stable in TNA. He has also worded for wrestling promotions in Puerto Rico. Melendez is bilingual, speaking both Spanish and English. Early life Early in his childhood Meléndez enjoyed wrestling, and his mother used to take him to the World Wrestling Council shows every Saturday. During this time, he became interested in Capitol Sports Promotions until Bruiser Brody was allegedly killed by José Huertas Gonzalez at an event. After this event Meléndez became interested in the programming of the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling. He continued watching Capitol's programming but his interest in local wrestling was not revived until the debut of the International Wrestling Association (IWA). Career=IWA Puerto Rico While working for a magazine publisher in Puerto Rico's metropolitan area, Meléndez pursued a job with the IWA. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Meléndez left Puerto Rico in 2004 and joined TNA, then based in Nashville, Tennessee, as a sportscaster and video editor and producer thanks to Dutch Mantel and Jeff Jarrett. He was originally partnered with Armando Quintero before Konnan began providing commentary, replacing Quintero. This would prove bad for Meléndez since allegedly he felt that Konnan was preventing him from doing his job as an announcer because of Konnan's disrespect for the position and lack of interest in doing a good job. In December 2005, Konnan formed a stable known as the Latin American Xchange (LAX), claiming that Latinos were discriminated against in TNA. The LAX had their own entrance with Moody making the introduction in Spanish becoming the voice of the LAX. In mid-2006, the LAX set up a \\"border zone\\" around the Spanish commentary table, attacking any wrestlers who crossed the \\"border\\". From TNA Victory Road 2006 Moody also interfered in matches on their behalf, helping them to defeat their opponents several times. In October 2006, Melendez quit Total Nonstop Action Wrestling because he felt that the pay raise he was offered was not sufficient to make up for his increased duties. It was rumored that he had a fallout with Jarrett for unknown reasons. It is also rumored that Melendez wanted to be more involved in the creating process and had already accepted a position as head booker for IWA, but Melendez issued a statement where he said that accepting that position was only \\" a fact after the matter just because I wasn't a yes man. \\" World Wrestling Council He then returned to Puerto Rico to work there full-time as the IWA head booker alongside Luke Williams. On the January 18, 2007 edition of TNA Impact! Meléndez returned to television in his previous role and also as the new manager of the LAX. Once again, he was occasionally involved in the outcome of LAX matches. This second stint didn't last long as Meléndez decided to take a breakfrom wrestling. This lasted around four months when shockingly Moody accepted a position as the head booker for the rival WWC in Puerto Rico. Meléndez then began working in the World Wrestling Council, where he worked not only as the booker, but also head of TV, and commentator. Asistencia Asesoría y Administración Since 2004, Melendez had been contacted by the president of AAA (Mexico), the late Antonio Peña. Peña wanted to revolutionize wrestling in México and he believed Melendez was the man that could help him do it offering him the job as booker alongside him. Moody declined this offer several times but with the latest developments in WWC he felt that it was time to go. Melendez quit WWC. After that he had a brief run on IWA Puerto Rico and then took a three-month break and accepted the booking position with AAA México where he resides working as a creative consultant to the Peña family, agent, TV producer and video editor. In 2011 he returned to Puerto Rico. He has since been replaced by Miguel G. Fonseca. World Wrestling League After mediating a collaboration between WWL and The Crash though Konnan, a talent exchange took place beginning at Golpe de Estado 2017. Following the WWL's summer season, Meléndez -who had an offer to book for The Crash- left WWL amidst internal differences with the owner of the promotion's ring and his tag team partner, returning shortly afterwards after the latter left for WWC. However, after hurricanes Irma and Maria passed over Puerto Rico during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Meléndez lost power for several months and WWL came to a halt and entered a hiatus. During this period of inactivity, Konnan also left The Crash for Aro Lucha, formally ending the talent exchange (though Konnan later expressed interest in returning individually). As the return of WWL approached during early 2018, Meléndez resumed his work as booker, appearing in several videos where he approached figures like Mr. Big (Miguel Maldonado) and Dennis Rivera in an effort to create a faction that would oppose the heels led by Manny Ferno.

Some other forms of diaspores, such as the stems of certain species of cactus also are covered with thorns and may function as burs. Bur-bearing plants such as Xanthium species are often single-stemmed when growing in dense groups, but branch and spread when growing singly.Noogoora burr, Californian burr, Italian cockleburr and South American burr (Xanthium species). New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. 2009.  Function  Burs catch on the fur of passing animals or the clothing of people. The hooks or teeth generally cause irritation, and some species commonly cause gross injury to animals, or expensive damage to clothing or to vehicle tires. Burs serve the plants that bear them in two main ways. * Firstly, burs tend to repel some herbivores, much as other spines and prickles do. * Secondly, plants with burs rely largely on living agents to disperse their seeds; their burs are mechanisms of seed dispersal by epizoochory (dispersal by attaching to the outside of animals).Magee, M. B. Plants With Burrs. San Francisco Chronicle. Most epizoochorous burs attach to hair on the body or legs of the host animal, but a special class of epizoochorous bur is known as the trample-bur (or trample-burr). Several species of Tribulus, Harpagophytum, and Grielum produce fruit in the form of trample-burs. As the name suggests, they attach themselves to the animal when trampled. They may hook onto the legs of animals as the large hooks of Harpagophytum do, sometimes causing serious injury, but sometimes hooking onto the leg of say, an ostrich, apparently without causing discomfort.Midgley, J.J. and Illing, N. Were Malagasy Uncarina fruits dispersed by the extinct elephant bird? South African Journal of Science 105, November/December 2009 It also might penetrate a hoof or foot pad or the tires of a vehicle, only to be shed after being carried for a considerable time and distance; most Tribulus and Grielum species are specialised for such attachment, variously being flat, but with upward-directed spikes as in say, Grielum humifusum, or shaped like a caltrop as in some species of Tribulus that have achieved the status of cosmopolitan weeds by sticking to the tires of aircraft.Holm, L. et al. A geographical atlas of world weeds. Krieger 1991, Relevance to humans Burs are best known as sources of irritation, injury to livestock, damage to clothing, punctures to tires, and clogging equipment such as agricultural harvesting machinery. Some have however been used for such purposes as fabric fulling, for which the fuller's teasel is a traditional resource. The bur of burdock was the inspiration for hook and loop fastener, also known as Velcro.  Common plants with burs  Common bur-bearing plants include: * Acanthospermum australe * Agrimonia pubescens (downy agrimony) * Anthriscus caucalis (burr chervil) * Arctium lappa (greater burdock) * Bidens pilosa (beggar ticks) * Cenchrus longispinus (longspine sandbur)Cenchrus longispinus.

History Beginning in 2000, in cooperation with the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, SunGold Foods' parent company, Red River Commodities, began a two-year project to develop a substitute for peanut butter that would be made from sunflower seeds. At that same time, Red River Commodities invested in new sunflower seed hybrids and specialized production areas, formed SunGold Foods, Inc. and created a peanut-free and tree-nut free food processing, packaging, distribution and shipping environment at both companies' locations. The substitute for peanut butter, introduced in 2002, became known as SunButter. Health benefits Sunflower seeds are a good source of protein, fiber, vitamin E, zinc and iron. SunButter is currently used as an added ingredient in a variety of foods, including energy bars from Enjoy Life Foods and EnerPro, granola, premade sandwiches and a no-peanut peanut sauce. Distribution SunButter is now available in a variety of flavors, and is found in grocery chains and health food stores. It is used in many institutional foodservice programs, including public and private schools and school districts that have become peanut-free and tree-nut free as part of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act (FAAMA), which calls for voluntary national guidelines to help schools manage students affected by food allergy and anaphylaxis.

Dice rolls are shown either as \\"4-2\\" or \\"42\\", denoting a roll of four on one die and two on the other. Moves are recorded using the notation: :4-2: 8/4 6/4 This denotes a roll of 4-2, and the corresponding checker moves from point 8 to 4 and from 6 to 4. After this move, the board will appear as shown in Figure 2. If a move results in a checker being hit, this is indicated by adding an asterisk to the number denoting the point at which the checker was hit. For example, 13/7* denotes a checker moving from the 13-point and hitting an opposing checker at the 7-point. Similarly, 13/7*/5 denotes a move corresponding to a roll 6-2 and a checker moving from 13 to 5 hitting a checker at the in-between step at point 7. Moves resulting from double rolls are often indicated by placing the number of checkers moved in parentheses after the move. For example, the effect of a roll 2-2, could be: 6/4(3) 13/11. Finally, it is common to use the words \\"bar\\" and \\"off\\" to describe moves where checkers are entered from the bar or taken off during bear off. For instance bar/22 17/9, and 5/off 2/off.

Directed by Akiyuki Shinbo, it aired from October 4, 2006 to March 28, 2007 in Japan. The anime was accompanied by a monthly manga series by Takuya Fujima called Negima!? neo. Both series feature the same characters and locations. This new season aired on TV Tokyo's late afternoon time slot rather than on late nights, like the original anime series did. Plot A dark sinister tale befalls ten-year-old Negi Springfield and class 2-A. One year after Negi's arrival at Mahora, two representatives from the Magic Academy arrive at Mahora with the news of the disappearance of a mysterious artifact known as the Star Crystal. The Star Crystal holds a power that not even the Thousand Master could control. Even though the reason or the cause behind the Star Crystal's disappearance is a mystery, the effects of the artifact begin to envelop Negi and his students. Surrounded by a menacing power, Negi and the class must cope as the dark power harasses and attack the class at a moment's whim. Simultaneously, Negi places his thoughts towards his missing father, while the supporting cast do all they can to provide assistance. Production Under the direction of Akiyuki Shinbo, animation studio Shaft took the production of this Negima series in a direction different from Ken Akamatsu's manga or the anime production from XEBEC. However, the first three episodes do cover a modified version of Evangeline's story arc in volume 3 of the manga and on episodes VI to VIII of the first anime. In the same vein as Shinbo's previous series, Pani Poni Dash!, the anime features a plethora of parodies and references to popular culture, many of which appear seemingly randomly on the chalkboards in classroom scenes. Abundant eyecatches and light-hearted omake shorts at the end of each episode are also of a generally parodic nature. The use of parodies adds to an already plentiful use of humor into the series. As an alternate series, the show makes references to the previous one. References range from the subtle, like some of Chiu's costumes, to the obvious, like the first series's theme song Happy Material utilized during the mass Pactio activation. Unlike its predecessors, sexual fanservice is minimal and is often shown either unwittingly or as part of a non-sexual gag. For instance, Setsuna exposes her black tight-fitting shorts worn under her skirt after she crashes into a dinnerware cabinet. In another case, a potential bath scene among the characters (Mana, Zazie, Sayo, and Kazumi) turns out to be exploration of the bathroom. Their civilian clothes simply expose Kazumi and Zazie's bare shoulders, and Mana's midriff. However, DVD releases of the episodes have lowered the censorship of the sexual fanservice or themes, allowing for nudity during Neo-Pactio transformation scenes and some of the yuri jokes about Konoka and Setsuna. With the wide array of characters, sometimes short scenes are used to allow air time for various characters. Often, they are sub-grouped and rarely seen alone. Also included are short side story plots, usually non- relevant to the main story. Some themes, gags, and motifs have been recurring throughout the series. Many of these have been cut scenes. Usually, these have little or no relevance to the main storyline. Also, artwork by the voice actors is shown. Usually they appear when the sponsor acknowledgements appear, although some of them appear also as eyecatches and transition markers. Each artwork depicts at least that VA's character and it appears on the episode where that particular character says the episode title. Art styles of each artwork vary, ranging from artistic to mediocre to crude. In fact, Yu Kobayashi's artwork of Setsuna as shown in the sixth episode is so crude that in the following episode, a badly-drawn Setsuna (done by Kobayashi) is seen talking to Konoka probably as a depiction of shame after Setsuna vows to Asuna to not wear a Chupacabra T-shirt and not let Konoka don one, which Konoka did. There are also two broadcast versions of the show: a pan and scan, 4:3 standard-definition version shown on TV Tokyo and a widescreen high-definition one shown on sister channel BS Japan. Even in the 4:3 version however, there are scenes meant to be shown in 16:9. This is addressed by having the scenes letterboxed, surrounded by gold decorated mattes at the top and bottom of the screen rather than the usual plain black ones. Of course, these \\"gold bars\\" do not appear in the widescreen version, which is used in the DVD releases of the episodes (with some minor modifications). Characters As a remake, characters appearing from the original Mahou Sensei Negima appear in this retelling. However, under Studio Shaft, the characters have taken a redesign. The redesigns are featured in the first episode, as all girls from Negi's class are introduced. The majority of the characters are drawn with a more youthful appearance than the first series, with finer details; yet they retain their basic character designs. This also includes some of their original characteristics, behaviors, and traits. Characters reappearing are Negi Springfield, Chamo, Takahata, Nekane Springfield, Anya, Konoka's grandfather, and the class 3-A. New characters A ' is used throughout the series to give light commentary, explain events, review and preview episodes, and occasionally interact or react to character involvement. Sometimes, his direct conversations cause certain characters to break the fourth wall. The narrator is voiced by Mugihito; in the English dub, he is played by Christopher Sabat. ' and ' are two \\"agents\\" from the Magic Academy sent with a report about the Star Crystals' disappearance. Their true forms are unknown since they took the images drawn up by Haruna; Shichimi is a cat, and Motsu is a frog. They then stay at Mahora and keep a close eye on Negi to ensure his magic secrecy, but if Negi lets his secret out he will be turned into an animal. Eventually, this role changes when all of class 3-A learn about magic and became Pactio partners. Early on, a few strange cutscenes show them playing with tissue paper and Bubble Wrap, but they ultimately end up intruding on other members of the class as mere annoyances. Occasionally, they are found with the Black Rose Baron. In the end, it is revealed that they don't in fact, work for the academy. They actually work for Negi's father, and he gives them to Negi as servants. Motsu is the comic among the two, providing some occasional comic relief by doing comedic action, making random remarks, and taking occasional disguises for hilarity. Whenever he is not in disguise, he is typically seen wearing either a necktie, a mustache, or a tuft of hair. In the later episodes, a bizarre sub-plot involves him and Makie, where Makie refers to him as \\"Daddy\\". Makie eventually explained that she never actually thought Motsu was her father; rather, she was simply comparing him to a pet dog her family used to own, who was named \\"Daddy\\" and who resembled Motsu. Motsu's favorite line is , which he often says in ironic circumstances, such as while crying on the tea he prepared for Takamichi and Evangeline after being \\"rejected\\" by Makie. Motsu appears to be based on Aboshi Frog, a character created by Mako Aboshi for the Pani Poni Dash! anime, which is also a Shaft production. Shichimi, on the other hand, provides voices of reason. She has no visible limbs, which only appear when holding or scratching something. She is also able to elongate her entire body like a snake. Having an inherent cuteness, she later begins to hang around with Nodoka often, with some of the moments ranging from Shichimi taking a nap on Nodoka's lap to the cat sitting on Nodoka's head while Nodoka is in her Armor form. True to her mostly feline form, she ends her sentences with , as if mimicking a cat's meow. Motsu is voiced by Chiwa Saito, and Shichimi is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro. In the English dub, Motsu and Shichimi are played by Trina Nishimura and Brina Palencia respectively. The made her presence known to Negi when he and his students were looking for information about the Star Crystal. Dressed in white formal attire with a black cape, hat, and a gold mask covering the left side of her face, she confronts Negi and occasionally members of the 3-A class. Sometimes, she targets Chamo with a black rose. As she comes and goes, black rose petals fly around her. Neither a friend or foe, her true identity is kept hidden until the last few episodes; during the anime, it had been speculated the Baron was actually Negi's father, even though the viewers can easily tell that the Baron is a she. Black Rose Baron's true identity is actually Negi's sister, Nekane. Konoka and Setsuna made observations about Nekane's movements and behavior. Then Konoka makes her deduction regarding the Black Rose and a connection to Nekane. So, for Nekane's sake, everyone decides to keep this knowledge a secret, even from Nekane herself. In episode 22, Takahata addresses the Black Rose Baron as Nekane in front of Negi. Nekane is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro, both in and out of the Black Rose Baron guise. In the English dub, she is voiced by Gwendolyn Lau, again in both identities. , first name never known, is an old watchman in Mahora's Library Island. He goes around the library's underground corridors with a lighted lamp on his left hand and an eyepatch on his right eye. He seems to live in Library Island's underground rooms and literally cooks at its indoor restaurant. He possesses extensive knowledge of the library's collection but ironically not the layout of the library itself. He also recognizes regulars to the place such as Nodoka. He has a habit of announcing himself by saying in a loud voice \\"I am Mr. Yamada!\\" and falling into obvious traps. He only appears in the episode wherein Negi and his students attempt to find the book about the Star Crystal and at the same time Kaede and Narutaki twins search for a book that will make the twins grow up faster. He is not seen since then, although Nodoka mentions him in a later episode. He is played by Yuichi Nagashima, who recently changed his stage name to . In the English dub, he is played by Cole Brown. Voice cast changes With a few exceptions, the cast of Negima!? is the same from Negima!: Magister Negi Magi. * Chiwa Saito replaces Ryou Hirohashi as Anya's voice actress. * Miyuki Sawashiro replaces Masami Suzuki as Nekane Springfield's voice actor and replaces Takehito Koyasu as Nagi Springfield's voice actor. * Megumi Takamoto replaces Chiaki Osawa as Chao Lingshen's voice actress. For the English version: * Brittney Karbowski replaces Kate Bristol as Anya's voice actress, Bristol reprises her role as Sayo Aisaka. * Carrie Savage replaces Jayme Westman as Satomi Hakase's voice actress. * Cherami Leigh replaces Dana Schultes as Setsuna Sakurazaki's voice actress, and Jenny Phagan as Akira Okuchi's voice actress. She also replaces Alison Viktorin as Fuka and Fumika Narutaki's voices in the last three episodes of the series. * J. Michael Tatum replaces Troy Baker as Nagi Springfield's voice actor. * Mary Morgan replaces Lucy Small as Madoka Kugimiya's voice actress. * R Bruce Elliott replaces the late Randy Tallman as Konoemon \\"Dean\\" Konoe's voice actor. Pactio cards In this new Negima!? series, the \\"Pactio\\" system that allows Negi to perform provisional contracts is revised. The Pactio system gives the new Negima!? series a more magical girl-like kind of style to the original one. Pactio Cards are now split into three types: Armor (Rare), Cosplay, and Dud (Suka). Typically, the Armor/Rare card is the strongest, bringing forth the true powers of the partner. The Cosplay card gives powers to the partner too, despite being weaker than the Armor ones. The strength comparison is clearly displayed with Nodoka's power. Her Cosplay card gives her one book that reads thoughts, while her Rare card gives her multiple books that can gather information. The Dud card transforms the partner into a super deformed, defenseless version of his/herself, wearing an animal costume (in Nodoka's case, she becomes a seal). Transformation can only be performed through Negi's activation spell; and a card is chosen at random. Duration of Pactio Power is dependent on satiation (the contract ends when the partner becomes hungry). The powers for each provisional contract differ from person to person. Media=Manga Negima!? neo is a manga retelling of the series made by Takuya Fujima under the guidance of original creator Ken Akamatsu and the supervision of Studio SHAFT. This is Fujima's first mainstream Negima work as he had previously worked on several Negima dōjin. The series started running on November 2006 in the monthly boys' manga magazine Comic BomBom. It had a brief hiatus a year later with the impending closure of Comic BomBom's publication, only to return on January 2008 in sister publication Magazine Special, this time with slightly more fanservice than it had during its run in Comic BonBon. This series rewrites the events of the anime, following a completely different route through the Star Crystal storyline, including reordering of events and changes in when and how Pactio are formed. It borrows certain elements and character designs from the original manga as well as both anime series. Much like the original manga, Del Rey Manga has licensed Negima!? neo for its English-language publication.Del Rey Adds Negima Neo, Orange Planet, Yokai Doctor, ANN, July 24, 2008.

Neo-Pactio Fight!! is a game for the Wiihttp://www.cubed3.com/news/6885/1/Latest_Nintendo_Updates_%28Panel_de_Pon_DS,_More_English_Training,_etc...%29 based upon the popular Japanese manga, Mahou Sensei Negima. It was released in Japan only on June 12, 2007. It's the third Negima game to be released on a Nintendo game console (After Mahou Sensei Negima! and its sequel on the GBA), and the first console Negima game not published by Konami. The arenas in the game are in full-time 3D, and the characters can move in any direction, as well as jump. Up to four players can play in Battle Mode. Controls are operated by using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk (the Classic Controller and Wii Remote (used sideways) are also supported as control methods). Certain attacks and moves involving quickly moving the Wii Remote left and right or up and down. By getting a Pactio Card, one can activate a Pactio transformation like in Negima!?, randomly (though possible to control) becoming one of the three different forms: Armor (powerful version of your character, using a very powerful attack), Cosplay (character dresses up in costumes, and boosts the characters abilities), and Suka (or \\"Miss\\", in which your character is transformed into a weak super-deformed animal, such as a Kappa in Kaede's case). The art style of the game (as well as many of its characters' moves) is based not on the original manga by Ken Akamatsu or the first anime. In between fights during the Story Mode, cut-scenes done in the style of Negima!? are shown, featuring voice acting from the voice actors of both anime adaptations. Ten characters from the Negima universe are playable as main characters. In addition, the other girls from the Negima series can be set as support (effectively a permanent power-up), similar to Marvel vs. Capcom, The King of Fighters '99, and The King of Fighters 2000. Up to two support characters can be equipped to each fighter. Ending shorts After the credits of every episode, short character skits are included. Each skit is irrelevant to the story or episode. Mahora Sentai Baka Rangers This series of shorts is seen on episodes 1 to 3, 7, 10, 14, 23 and 24. One of the most prominent set of shorts has to do with the Mahora Sentai Baka Rangers (Mahora Squadron Bakaranger), a parody of the Super Sentai series. The parody reimagines the study group as a super sentai. The five Baka Rangers are: * Asuna as Baka Red * Yue as Baka Black * Kaede as Baka Blue * Kū Fei as Baka Yellow * Makie as Baka Pink. They have their own title card, which parodies the sentai series Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan, and have their own theme song. They follow their own color coordination with the letter of their first name across the top half. They also have scarves like the original Super Sentai groups. Their roll call parodies Sun Vulcan as well, having some of the same gestures (Asuna, Kaede, and Kū Fei copy their same-color counterparts; Yue's and Makie's gestures are from the series Denshi Sentai Denjiman and a flash on each of their foreheads. In these shorts, the Baka Rangers fight in a battle against evil, particularly against the dreaded menace of their enemy Dr. Pooh. However, most of the humor revolves around the mishaps and mistreatment of Baka Pink (Makie), who always ends up being the butt of the jokes in this metaseries. This includes having her introduction cut off, the camera never focusing on her properly, her getting squashed by their mecha, and her accidentally blowing up the team with their enemy's bomb. One of the few moments where Baka Pink gets a moment to shine is in the creation of a special movie by the Yukihiro Group, \\"Yuke Yuke Baka Pink\\", the preview of which is shown as part of a later omake (yet ultimately is found not suitable for any audience as well as emphasizes the comedic rivalry between Makie and Ayaka in this rendition of the story). Jump Out, Chupa-ken! This series of shorts is seen on Episodes 4 to 6 and 25. Episode 4 through 6 had to do with the Chupacabra that Asuna believes roams the Mahora Campus. The first two involve Asuna trying to write a song about the chupacabra, leading to Haruna being surprised in regards to what she's doing. In the first one, both Asuna and Haruna are dressed as oni, while in the second, Asuna is composing while sucking on Chupa Chups lollipops. In the third short, the Chupacabra club ends up meeting about the possible existence of a chupacabra while all dressed in costumes, this time with Asuna (dressed as a robot) and Haruna (a grandfather clock) joined by Yuna (a bee) and Yue (a fairy). When Kū Fei shows up with a new costume Zazie made, Asuna takes matters into her own hands... By episode 25, Asuna finally gets a chupacabra as a present from Anya and promptly tries to make it autograph all of the T-shirts she had made throughout the series. Unfortunately, the little creature has ideas of its own. *Although Asuna is the primary actor of the chupacabra gags in this series from the beginning, the creature was originally brought up under different circumstances in the manga. When Evangeline attacked Makie, it was at first unknown what was the culprit. Misa suggested that it was a vampire, but Sakurako changes it around believing it was a \\"vampiric creature\\" that attacked her, leading Konoka to first imagine and draw the attacker...as a chupacabra. Upon seeing Konoka's drawing, Asuna dismisses it on the basis that a chupacabra has no reason to be in Japan. However, in this series it is Asuna who is the source of all the chupacabra comments from the get-go, with Haruna as her only main supporter. Chao's Ambition This series of shorts is seen on Episodes 8 and 9. Satomi creates a special arm for Chao called the Super Power Hand. When she tries it on, Kū Fei comes out (as Kū-Rōshi, or Old Master Ku) and a timer, health bar, and a power bar appear like in fighting games just like Street Fighter. Chao 'charges up' like when a fighter charges their special attack and punches Kū Fei with the metal arm, and a meat bun comes out. When Kū Fei catches it, the meat bun absorbs all her energy causing her to faint instantly. A K.O. sign appears on the screen. In the second short, Satomi creates a second version of the Super Power Hand. This time it can make two meat buns. Ah, I am the Young Yamamoto This series of shorts is seen on Episodes 11 to 13 The focus is on the sports girls, particularly Akira as she watches over a pet arowana in the aquarium in her room and listening in on roommates Yuna, Ako and Misora. But while she seems strange, the outfits of her roommates are even more questionable. In the second episode, the sports girls are still swimming (like they were earlier in the episode), where they discover each other's weird taste in swimsuits. In the last one, one of the girls asks if Yamamoto can do tricks, but Akira nearly defies common sense of what a fish can do. Misora is the straight man of these bits with Yuna and Ako as her foils...and Akira in her own world. Please Tea Room This series of shorts is seen on Episodes 15 to 17. Using a small Shinto shrine, three members of the Baka Rangers make offerings to the gods. In the first short, done in a stylized black and white animation, Asuna gives an offering of ramen asking the gods to buy a Chupacabra T-shirt. In the second one, Kū Fei makes a wish with her own cup of noodles (with \\"Chile source\\"), but it turns out she doesn't have a problem. In the third, Makie offers a plate of spaghetti but not even the gods acknowledge her. One-shot shorts The following shorts are each shown in the end of just one episode and are therefore stand-alone ones. *Haruna's Art Song (Episode 18): In rap verse, Haruna showcases her artistic skills in calligraphy. Chisame criticizes her, Zazie makes a pun off the criticism and Chachamaru scores the pun. Haruna ignores them and keeps rapping. *Tea Ceremony Suka (Episodes 19): The recurring tea ceremony scene of Evangeline and Chachamaru is shown with the pair in Suka form alongside Negi, Nekane, Shichimi and Motsu (who is forced to be inflated once again similar to an experiment with Akira in the same episode). Unlike the rest of class 3-A, Eva and Chachamaru are not transformed during the events of the episode as they have no Pactio with Negi yet. *Sayoth Park (Episode 20): This short is done in an animation style similar to that used in the American series South Park. Kazumi and Nekane encounter a ghost (Sayo). When Nekane asks whether it can cause a large explosion, one goes off that knocks both to the ground. *Ramen Takamichi Ad (Episode 21): Concluding the episode's gag, Chachamaru returns a bowl of ramen to a stranded and hungry Evangeline after being unable to find help to let them off their hut. *The Interviews' (sic) Room (Episode 22): Kazumi attempts to interview with Chamo and Motsu. *Epilogue (Episode 26): Negi departs with Anya and Nekane to search for his father once again. But a little bit of Mahora comes with him. Opening and ending themes The opening and ending songs and animations vary throughout the episodes. For the most part, the songs are the same (\\"1000% SPARKING!\\" for the opening, \\"A-LY-YA!\\" for the ending) - but the characters doing the singing frequently change. A full listing can be found here. Unlike previous episodes, the opening footage for episodes 17 onward has been given more color and different animations were used. In addition, the first part of the song is used instead of the \\"speaking characters\\" used in the original version. The DVD version slightly changed this, adding new animation and scenes to the opening, including a moving card with the Narutaki twins, as well as using certain song variations never used in the broadcast version. However, there are two major variations. During the period where Negi has been transformed, in Episode 14, a different theme song is used, with an animation of Negi running amongst the Suka forms for some of the girls, in his transformed state. Also, In episode 19, a nearly-full version of the opening song was used. In doing so, the animation opening was done twice. The first half was complete with all Suka versions of the thirty- one girls prior to the original version in the second half, in complete color with the quotes stanza for Evangeline, Chachamaru and Satomi. Of special note is that two special shots of Akira and Ayaka, both only used in the Suka version of the opening with those two never appearing in solo shot in the regular version of the opening. From episode 4 onward, \\"A-LY-YA!\\" was accompanied by a parade of twenty-seven of the girls scrolling left-to-right super deformed. When they reached a circle, they were highlighted and changed their super deformed form. At the bottom of that circle, the sequence begins with just super deformed Asuna dancing with a pair of maracas. As the series continues, super deformed forms of Konoka (tambourine), Setsuna (triangle), and finally Nodoka (snare drum) join Asuna to form a complete four-super- deformed-character band. All four change their manner of playing their instruments as the song progresses. Setsuna also falls asleep when the song reaches the chorus and wakes up at the end stunned and embarrassed. In episode 25, \\"Love Sensation\\" (the opening song from the Summer OVA) sees all 31 girls in their Suka forms. Many of these girls, though, does have one small element that ties back to either their Armor or Cosplay Neo-Pactio form. (including boar Asuna with a harisen, seal Nodoka with glasses and a book, koala Konoka with her armor whip, etc.) FUNimation created English dub versions for most of the title songs. 1000% Sparking featured the voice talent of Brina Palencia (Yue Ayase, No. 4), Luci Christian (Asuna Kagarazaka, No. 8), Jamie Marchi (Haruna Saotome, No. 14), and Leah Clark, (Nodoka Miyazaki, No. 27). Only one version of the songs were produced, instead of various versions as was the case for the original Japanese production. Brina Palencia is also the music director as well as the lyricist for the English dub versions of the songs, except for the English version of Hoshizora Letter (Starry Sky Letter), which was adapted by Mike MacFarland. Reception In the beginning episodes, the ratings for the show were relatively good. As the series progressed the show's ratings declined. By the time the last episode aired on March 28, 2007, the show placed a lower-than-expected 34th out of the 40 anime shown for the fall 2006 season. NotesReferences * \\"Negima!?\\".

The special received a primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Children's Program in 1992. Plot Two days before Christmas, Christopher Robin writes out a letter to Santa Claus for him and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood, asking for presents; Rabbit wants a new fly swatter to stop bugs from eating carrots; Eeyore wants an umbrella to keep the snow off his house; Tigger wants a snowshoe for his tail so he can bounce on the snow without his hands and feet; Robin wants a sled \\"big enough for me and maybe a friend or two\\"; and Piglet said Santa Claus could bring whatever he wanted. He sends the letter off into the wind, but on Christmas Eve, Winnie the Pooh realizes, after Piglet informs him, that he did not ask anything for himself, so they search for the letter, which has not gotten very far. Afterwards, they, along with Tigger and Eeyore, go to Rabbit's house and rewrite the letter to include Pooh's present, a pot of honey. Along the way, however, they become greedy and start upgrading their desires. Following this, Tigger, Eeyore, and Rabbit go off to get a giant Christmas tree, with help from a reluctant Gopher. Meanwhile, Pooh and Piglet go back to the point where Robin sent the letter and cast it off into the wind again. But the wind shifts southward, and the letter follows Pooh to his house. He goes to Piglet and informs him of what happened. Knowing that the rest of the gang will not get their presents as a result of this, Pooh tells Piglet they must take it into their hands to make sure the gifts are delivered. Pooh (disguised as Santa) sneaks out and delivers Tigger, Rabbit, and Eeyore a super-bouncer barrel, a bug sprayer made from a teapot, and a mobile home made from a suitcase, respectively - or rather, handmade versions of the said items that break apart upon use. Demanding to know what is going on, the three of them corner Pooh, who says that he is Santa. However, Piglet, disguised as a \\"sorry-lookin' reindeer\\", slips and makes his sled fall downhill before crashing, exposing Pooh's disguise. After explaining what happened, Pooh decides to try to deliver the letter to Santa himself, telling the rest of the gang it would be worth missing Christmas if he could \\"bring Christmas\\" to them. He does not get far, though, as the wind suddenly takes the letter, so he gives up. At the Christmas tree, Pooh's friends bemoan that spending time with him at Christmas is more important than getting gifts just as Pooh reunites with them.

The special was then accompanied by the Donald Duck cartoons The Hockey Champ and Bearly Asleep, as well as a promo for Beauty and the Beast. The first airing of the special ranked 53rd out of 92 shows that week, averaging a 10.8/20 rating/share, ranking second place in its first half hour behind The Golden Girls and first place in its second half hour ahead of Walter and Emily.http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1991/BC-1991-12-23.pdf The special was first released on VHS in 1994. The VHS was re-released in 1997, with a sneak peek at Recess before the special. Also, it was later partnered with Mickey's Christmas Carol. It was originally broadcast on ABC. The special was broadcast on CBS in 1995. After Disney's purchase of ABC, that network once again became the home of all subsequent broadcasts. It re-aired on ABC in 1996 and kept on air until 1999. It returned for the first time on December 11, 2007, but immediately edited down. The edited 2007 version aired on ABC Family (now Freeform), as part of their \\"25 Days of Christmas\\" as of December 2008. Currently, the only DVD release available is the direct-to-video release Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year, where it is edited into the main feature. However, Christopher Robin's lines are re-dubbed by his voice actor in the film's main story, and Rabbit's animation is recolored to have him in his usual yellow-furred appearance (as opposed to his greenish fur in the New Adventures series). Reception TV Guide ranked the special number 6 on its 10 Best Family Holiday Specials list.

Isotope fractionation describes fractionation processes that affect the relative abundance of isotopes, phenomena which are taken advantage of in isotope geochemistry and other fields. Normally, the focus is on stable isotopes of the same element. Isotopic fractionation can be measured by isotope analysis, using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry or cavity ring-down spectroscopy to measure ratios of isotopes, an important tool to understand geochemical and biological systems. For example, biochemical processes cause changes in ratios of stable carbon isotopes incorporated into biomass.  Definition Stable isotopes partitioning between two substances A and B can be expressed by the use of the isotopic fractionation factor (alpha): where R is the ratio of the heavy to light isotope (e.g., 2H/1H or 18O/16O). Values for alpha tend to be very close to 1.  Types  There are four types of isotope fractionation, of which the first two are normally most important: * Equilibrium fractionation * Kinetic fractionation * Mass-independent fractionation (or Non-mass-dependent fractionation) * Transient kinetic isotope fractionation Example  Isotope fractionation occurs during a phase transition, when the ratio of light to heavy isotopes in the involved molecules changes. When water vapor condenses (an equilibrium fractionation), the heavier water isotopes (18O and 2H) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes (16O and 1H) tend toward the vapor phase.

The New Villages were originally internment camps created by the British military as part of the Briggs' Plan, first implemented in 1950 to imprison rural civilian populations during the Malayan Emergency. Their location and designs were chosen by the British to eliminate rural communities, therefore lessening their contact with the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) communist guerrillas who lived in the Malayan jungles. According to British military historian John Newsinger, people forced to live in the New Villages had been \\"effectively deprived of all civil rights\\". Although the majority of inhabitants were Chinese, thousands of Orang Asli were forcefully uprooted from their ancestral lands and imprisoned in new villages. Historian John D. Leary in his study of the Orang Asli during the Emergency, argued that the forced resettlement used to create the New Villages brought \\"misery, disease and death\\" to many aboriginals. Today the New Villages are no longer internment camps and since the end of British colonialism in Malaya have evolved into ordinary civilian communities. History The original purpose of the new villages in Malaysia was to segregate primarily Chinese villagers from contact with the anti- colonial guerrilla fighters of the MNLA, which were led by the Malayan Communist Party during the Malayan Emergency. It was part of the Briggs Plan, a military plan devised by British General Sir Harold Briggs shortly after his appointment in 1950 as the British military's Director of Operations in Malaya. The plan aimed to defeat the MNLA communists, who were operating out of rural areas as a guerrilla army, by cutting them off from their sources of support mainly amongst the rural population. To this end, a massive program of forced resettlement of rural workers was undertaken, under which about 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya's population) were eventually removed from the land and housed in guarded camps called \\"New Villages\\". These New Villages were usually surrounded by barbed wire and sentry posts. In some cases 22 hour curfews were placed upon the populations of New Villages, such was the case in the infamous Tanjong Malim New Village. Although most victims of the forced relocation and New Villages were Malaysian Chinese, the aboriginal Orang Asli were also targeted due to their rural locations which meant they came into frequent contact with the MNLA communist guerrillas. Believing that the aboriginals were supporting the communists, the British targeted the Orang Asli for internment in New Villages. This plan however was halted after between a quarter and a third of those Orang Asli captured by the British had died. By isolating this population in the \\"new villages\\", the British were able to stem the critical flow of material, information, and recruits from peasants to guerrilla. The new settlements were given around the clock police supervision and were partially fortified. This served the twofold purpose of preventing those who were so inclined from getting out and voluntarily aiding the guerrilla, and of preventing the guerrilla from getting in and extracting help via persuasion or intimidation. Upon completion of the resettlement program, the British initiated a starvation campaign by rationing food and destroying rural farmland in an effort to starve the Communists guerrillas. Using internment to forcefully remove a population that might be sympathetic to guerrillas was a counter insurgency technique which the British had used before, notably against the Boer Commandos in the Second Boer War (1899-1902). Population During the Malayan Emergency, 450 new settlements were created and it is estimated that 470,509 people – 400,000 Chinese – were involved in the resettlement program. The Malaysian Chinese Association, then the Malayan Chinese Association, was initially created to address the social and welfare concerns of the populations in the new villages. It is estimated that today, about 1.2 million people live in 450 new villages throughout Peninsular Malaysia. About 85% of the population in new villages are ethnically Chinese. The ethnic Malays take up about 10% and ethnic Indians roughly 5%.

She served as a commissioned ship for 18 years and 8 months. Warrick — originally named Black Prince — was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1189) on 7 April 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Co., launched on 29 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. C. Wells Maren, and acquired and simultaneously commissioned by the Navy on 30 August 1944, at the Moore Dry Dock Company's west yard, Lt. Comdr. Ernest J. Grey, USNR, in command. Service history=World War II, 1944-1945 After loading stores at the Naval Supply Depot, Oakland, Warrick underwent a two-week shakedown out of San Pedro, California, concluding that necessary period of familiarization and training on 25 September. She subsequently conducted practice landings at San Clemente Island before undergoing repairs and alterations between 13 and 20 October. Taking on cargo at Wilmington, California, on the 24th, Warrick departed the west coast at 1430 the following day, bound for Manus in the Admiralties. The ship visited Manus, Hollandia, Finschhafen, and Langemak Bay, New Guinea; and Manus a second time before she returned to Hollandia to offload the 333 tons of general Army cargo. She then again shifted to Finschhafen, arriving at 1635 on 1 December. There, she loaded 1,137 tons of Army equipment — mostly vehicles — and, on the day after Christmas, embarked 17 officers and 210 enlisted men (Army) at Langemak Bay. After fueling on the 27th, Warrick sailed for Manus, joined en route, and rendezvoused with Task Group (TG) 77.9 on the 28th. Warrick stopped at Manus from 29 December 1944 to 2 January 1945, before getting underway on the latter day for Lingayen Gulf, on the northern coast of the island of Luzon, in the Philippines. En route, her convoy's escorts picked up three submarine contacts and depth charged them without obtaining results. No air attacks came the way of TG 77.9, fortunately, as American amphibious forces converged on Lingayen Gulf. Warrick reached her destination at 0500 on 11 January and came to anchor at 0830. One hour later, she commenced offloading her cargo, some two days after the first of the Army troops under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur had splashed ashore at Lingayen. Warrick continued her unloading of cargo over the next day. Landing craft, LCVP's and LCM's, from assisted in the unloading, continuing that task until 2200, when the operation ceased due to two factors: contact with her beach party had been lost and the beach itself was reportedly coming under shellfire. After resuming the unloading on the 13th, Warrick completed her assigned duties by 1015. Taking the boats on board from 1040, Warrick got underway for Leyte Island, joining Task Unit (TU) 78.11.3 formed around at 1745. She reached Leyte on the 16th. The attack cargo ship took on board two LCVP's from the attack transport to replace boats which she had lost at Lingayen Gulf on the 17th. She departed the Philippines on the 19th, bound for the Carolines. Reaching Ulithi on 23 January, Warrick fueled from on 1 February, five days before she headed for the Marianas. Arriving at Guam on 8 February, the attack cargo ship began loading cargo and embarking troops two days later. Her load was a varied one: a transportation company, a tractor- trailer platoon, an engineer company, a war dog platoon, medical companies, ordnance repair units, replacement drafts of personnel, plus water, fuel, rations, and other supplies. With elements of the 3rd Marine Division thus embarked, Warrick got underway for Iwo Jima on 17 February. As part of TU 51.1.1, the attack cargo ship participated in the Iwo Jima assault as part of TG 51.1, the Joint Expeditionary Force Reserve. Screened by four destroyers and two destroyer escorts, Warrick sailed for that soon-to-be-famous island in company with Transport Divisions 31 and 33. She arrived at point \\"Equity\\" on the 19th and, during ensuing days, cruised in operating area \\"Porch\\" in keeping with her reserve status. She moved in closer to Iwo Jima on the 22nd, but was still lying to, awaiting orders, on the following day. The attack cargo ship finally commenced unloading operations on the 24th in the transport area four miles off the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Warrick hoisted out her boats at 0750 and commenced lowering them soon thereafter. She dispatched all of her LCM's to assist in the unloading of nearby attack transports. She soon learned over the voice radio, however, that the smaller LCVP's were showing a tendency to broach and break up on the steep beaches. Beach-masters were accordingly waving off the LCVP's so that the beaches would not become fouled with the wrecks of numerous landing craft, thus impeding the flow of supplies necessary to keep the marines advancing against the stubborn Japanese defenders. Thus, with no lighterage, Warrick did not start unloading her own cargo until the following day. After returning from the night retirement area, the attack cargo ship hoisted out her boats at 0810 on the 25th. At that time, Warrick was noting that a strong sea was running with moderate to heavy swells, which, in connection with a good breeze, made unloading conditions decidedly unfavorable. came alongside at 1245 but, on her attempt, carried away two debarkation ladders and stove in some of Warrick's hull plating at two spots on her starboard side. At 1315, on her second attempt, LST-731 secured alongside and commenced taking on cargo. Over the next two days, beach conditions remained the same, with the small landing craft suffering considerably in the heavy swells, leading to many bans on craft the size of LCM's and LCVP's being waved off from the beachhead. Accordingly, LST's and LSM's were utilized as lighters for the cargo. Over the next few days, the ship offloaded her cargo to LCT-692 and LST-731. On 2 March, Warrick dispatched three LCM's to help unload ammunition from SS Columbia Victory. She then completed discharging cargo in ensuing days to LSM-266 and LSM-238. In addition, she embarked 23 Marine casualties from the beach and later transferred them to . On 6 March, after transferring smoke pots to LST-646, Warrick cleared Iwo Jima, bound for the Marianas. Sailing from thence to the Solomon Islands, the attack cargo ship reached Tulagi on 18 March. For the remainder of hostilities, Warrick performed her vital but unglamourous support role. She transported boats from Guam and Manus to Florida Island and New Guinea; lifted Army cargo and troops from Nouméa, New Caledonia, and New Guinea to Leyte, Cebu, and Manila, in the Philippines; and took return passengers to Manus. The end of hostilities in mid-August found the ship at Finschhafen, New Guinea. Inter-war years, 1945-1950 Between the end of World War II in the Pacific and the onset of the Korean War — a time span of a little under five years — Warrick operated primarily in the western Pacific and in the Far East. Soon after the Japanese surrender, the attack cargo ship made two trips from the Philippines to Honshū, Japan, touching at the ports of Aomori, Sasebo, and Yokosuka, carrying men and materiel to support the occupation of the erstwhile enemy's homeland. She participated in \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" — the return of discharged sailors, marines, airmen, and soldiers to the United States — and later supported the occupation of China and Korea, visiting ports that ranged from Tsingtao to Hong Kong; and Shanghai to Sasebo. In addition, during those \\"interwar\\" years, the attack cargo ship lifted cargo to such places as Johnston Island, Tarawa, Ponape, and Kwajalein. Besides performing her vital logistics functions, the ship also took part in exercises with the Fleet. Korea and the Pacific Fleet, 1950-1957 When elements of the North Korean People's Army crossed the 38th parallel into South Korean territory at 0400 on 25 June 1950, they triggered the Korean War. At that time, Warrick was in port at San Francisco. She sailed for the Marshalls on 1 July and made port at Eniwetok on the 14th. She subsequently returned, via Pearl Harbor, to the west coast of the United States on 8 August. On 16 July, while deployed to the western Pacific, she received orders to berth at the Naval Supply Center, Oakland, to load as fleet issue ship for the western Pacific. Moored at the supply center from 10 August to 24 August, Warrick loaded balanced dry provisions sufficient for 20,000 men for 90 days; ships' store stock; clothing and small stores; general stores material; and a deck load of bottled gases. When the task was complete, she sailed for the Far East, leaving San Francisco behind on 24 August. Diverted to Sasebo, Japan, en route, Warrick arrived at that port on 9 September and, from 10 September to 23 September, carried out duties of fleet issue supply ship. Attached to TF 79 on 11 September, the attack cargo ship sailed for the newly secured port of Inchon, North Korea, on 23 September, less than 10 days after American amphibious forces had attacked that port. After performing her stores issue duties at Inchon from 25 September to 1 October, the attack cargo ship got underway to replenish ships of TF 77\\\\. Making contact with the fast carrier task force built around the carrier , Warrick received the flattop alongside at 1143 on 2 October and commenced transferring cargo 12 minutes later. After delivering fleet freight, mail, napalm and drop tanks, Warrick set course to rendezvous with other men-of-war in the operating area off Korea's western coast. After issuing stores to the veteran destroyer from 2335 on 2 October to 0040 on the 3rd, Warrick set a return course for Sasebo and arrived at that port on 4 October. She carried out her duties as stores issue ship there from 5 October to 8 October before returning to Inchon to provide round-the-clock replenishment services to the ships of TF 90 from 11 October to 14 October. \\"For performing an efficient job under adverse conditions\\", Warrick's commander wrote later, \\"Warrick received a 'well done.' \\" Returning once more to Sasebo, the busy supply ship then proceeded to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she arrived on the 24th. She replenished stores of the seaplane tender before getting underway for Keelung, Formosa, on the 25th. Shifting to the Pescadores on the 28th, she arrived on the 29th to replenish the small seaplane tender at Shochi Wan anchorage. Underway for Okinawa at 1326 on 29 October, the ship received radio reports en route of the progress of typhoon \\"Ruby\\". Warned of the critical area, the attack cargo ship remained in the Formosa Strait into the early hours of the 30th, trying to ascertain the progress of the storm. When she had accurately plotted the typhoon's course — revealing her to be apparently out of danger — the ship resumed her voyage to her original destination. Taking on board cargo at Buckner Bay, Warrick returned to Sasebo, making port on 3 November. She unloaded the cargo lifted from Okinawa and discharged the remnants of her fleet issue stores at Sasebo before she got underway on 16 November, bound, once more, for the west coast of the United States. There was little rest for Warrick, however. No sooner had she reached home than she received orders to prepare for yet another Korean deployment. She accordingly loaded provisions, clothing and small stores; ship store items; general stores; and consigned cargo between 3 December and 23 December and embarked 135 Army and Air Force personnel for transportation to Sasebo. Departing San Francisco two days before Christmas 1950, Warrick reached Sasebo on 9 January 1951, mooring alongside stores ship upon arrival. Warrick remained at Sasebo, performing her duties as fleet issue ship, into mid- February. After taking on board approximately 800 tons of empty brass shell casings for shipment back to the United States, and unloading her dry provisions and clothing stores at Yokosuka from 16 February to 18 February, Warrick sailed for the United States on 19 February. Over the next four years, Warrick's routine changed little. She operated in the western Pacific in regular deployments, carrying fleet freight, and touched at the familiar ports such as Sasebo and Yokosuka, as well as Hong Kong and Manila. In between, there were the usual stops at Pearl Harbor and San Francisco in the course of the ship's transpacific voyages. After having spent her entire active career with the Pacific Fleet, Warrick commenced her last cruise to the Orient when she departed San Francisco on 28 January 1957. Her itinerary on the voyage included Yokosuka, Hong Kong, Sasebo, and Subic Bay, before she returned to San Francisco on 30 March. Decommissioning and disposal Warrick was placed in reserve at Astoria, Oregon, on 4 August 1957, and the workhorse cargo ship was decommissioned on 3 December 1957. Struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1961, Warrick was transferred to the Maritime Administration for lay-up at the reserve site at Olympia, Washington. Reacquired by the Navy on 20 April 1971 for use as a target ship, the ship was torpedoed and sunk by attack submarine 100 miles off Cape Flattery, Washington, in 1400 fathoms of water, on 28 May 1971.

While MPAs may have a genetic basis, they might also be caused by factors in the fetal environment: anoxia, bleeding, or infection. MPAs have been linked to disorders of pregnancy and are thought by some to be a marker for insults to the fetal neural development towards the end of the first trimester. Thus, in the neurodevelopmental literature, they are seen as indirect indications of interferences with brain development. MPAs have been studied in autism, Down syndrome, and in schizophrenia. A 2008 meta-analysis found that MPAs are significantly increased in the autistic population. A 1998 study found that 60% of its schizophrenic sample and 38% of their siblings had 6 or more MPAs (especially in the craniofacial area), while only 5% of the control group showed that many.Ismail, B I, Cantor-Graso, E, and McNeil, T P (1998). \\"Minor Physical Anomalies in Schizophrenic Patients and their Siblings,\\" American Journal of Psychiatry, 155:1695-1702 The most often cited MPA, high arched palate, is described in articles as a microform of a cleft palate.Baher Ismail, Elizabeth Cantor-Graae, Thomas F McNeil. \\"Minor physical anomalies in schizophrenic patients and their siblings.\\" The American Journal of Psychiatry.

His literary name was Ibukinoya. Biography=Early life Hirata was born as the fourth son of Ōwada Yoshitane, an Obangashira (low-ranking) samurai of Kubota Domain, in what is now part of the city of Akita in northern Japan. Little is known of his early childhood, but it appears to have been troubled by poverty and by hostility from his step- mother. He left home in 1795, renouncing his ties to his family and to the Domain and traveled to Edo and worked as a laborer and as a servant, while pushing opportunities to study rangaku, geography, and astronomy. In 1800, at the age of 25, he caught the attention of Hirata Tōbei, a scholar formerly of Bitchū-Matsuyama Domain, who adopted him and from whom he received the family name of Hirata. Around this time, he met Orose, the daughter of a hatamoto of Numazu Domain, whom he married the following year. Development of Kokugaku studies Atsutane's Portrait by his pupil While in Edo, Hirata was a student of the Neo-Confucianism of Yamazaki Ansai (1619–1682); however, his interests were very broad. He later turned towards Daoism as found in the works of the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi. He learned about the works of Motoori Norinaga, the founder of the kokugaku movement, in 1803, two years after Motoori's death. Hirata claimed later to have received the mantle of kokugaku teacher in a dream directly from Motoori Norinaga, but the story is apocryphal. He became a student of Motoori Haruniwa, and read voraciously the ancient and Chinese classics, foreign works by Nicolaus Copernicus and Isaac Newton and treatises on Buddhism and Shinto. He was also a prolific writer. Representative works in the study of ancient Japanese traditions include Tama no mihashira (The True Pillar of Spirit), Koshi seibun (Treatise on Ancient History), Kodō taii (True Meaning of the Ancient Way) and Zoku Shintō taii (True Meaning of Common Shintō), and the commentaries Koshi-chō and Koshi-den. He is also noted for his studies of ancient Indian and Chinese tradition (Indo zōshi and Morokoshi taikoden), and texts dealing with the spirit world, including Senkyō ibun (Strange Tales of the Land of Immortals) and Katsugorō saisei kibun (Chronicle of the Rebirth of Katsugorō). His early work Honkyō gaihen indicates an acquaintance with Christian literature that had been authored by Jesuits in China Though he is traditionally ranked fourth in the lineage of kokugaku scholars, Hirata actually represents a break with the purely scholarly urban culture characteristic of the revival of classical nativist learning, and represents a trend toward a populist message. Hirata laid particular emphasis on reaching the average man, and adapted his own style to them by employing at times the vernacular idiom. Hirata frequently expressed hostility to the Confucian and Buddhist scholars of the day, advocating instead a revival of the “ancient ways” in which the emperor was to be revered. Hirata's first published work, Kamosho (1803) was a scathing attack on the works of Confucian philosopher Dazai Shundai (1680–1747) on Buddhism, and resulted in an invitation to teach from the Yoshida family, the hereditary clan leading Yoshida Shinto. The contents of his 1841 treatise Tenchō mukyūreki (Chronicle of the Perpetual Rule of the Emperor) angered the ruling Tokugawa bakufu government, and he was sentenced to confinement in Akita until his death in 1843. Influence Hirata's activities eventually attracted over 500 pupils, including Okuni Takamasa and Suzuki Shigetane. His nationalist writings had considerable impact on the samurai who supported the Sonnō jōi movement and who fought in the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Meiji Restoration. Hirata's influence on kokugaku has recently been thought to be overestimated. While he is called one of the \\"four great men of kokugaku\\", this is a phrase he invented himself. His work more often influenced religious groups than the government in the Empire of Japan. Among Hirata's more enduring contributions to Japanese thought was the idea that all Japanese were descended from the gods, not only the Imperial family and certain aristocratic families. As he put it, \\"this, our glorious land, is the land in which the gods have their origin, and we are one and all descendants of the gods. For this reason, if we go back from the parents who gave us life and being, beyond the grandparents and great-grandparents, and consider the ancestors of ancient times, then the original ancestors of those must necessarily have been the gods.\\"Earl, David Margarey, Emperor and Nation in Japan, Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, 1964, p. 80 Hirata Atsutane grave Hirata Atsutane grave Hirata died at his home in Nakakame- cho, Akita in 1843, and as per the provisions of his will, was buried on a hillside in the city. The tombstone is a natural stone simply inscribed with his name, surrounded by a stone fence and a stone torii gate are placed at the entrance.

In 1948, he was approached by Edmund Ward, who had recently accepted the Revd. W. Awdry's stories for publication. Dalby illustrated The Railway Series books from the original title, The Three Railway Engines (which he re-illustrated, replacing the original art work by William Middleton), up until Percy the Small Engine. > Although Dalby's illustrations didn't entirely satisfy the author, and > errors in detail caused all kinds of problems, his pictures--with their bold > lines, lively energy and bright, gem-like colours--quickly caught the > imagination of young readers and he undoubtedly set the style for the > series. (Brian Sibley, Thomas the Tank Engine: The Complete Collection) In the end, the fractious relationship between Dalby and Awdry resulted in Dalby's resignation as illustrator of the series in 1956, following an argument over the portrayal of Percy the Small Engine in the book of the same name. Awdry had written to Dalby, \\"I beg, pray and exhort you not to make Percy look like a green caterpillar with red stripes!\\" He was replaced by John T. Kenney as illustrator.

Sometimes the students they serve are challenged with a single, or more special learning consideration or a defined social-emotional need. Much more often, however, these children face a combination of disabling factors that require modifications in all subject areas and a variety of programs to address unique needs. Concord provides the flexible curriculum and specialized programming within a small, nurturing, personal environment in which students feel they can learn and are able to thrive to learn. History Concord Academy was founded in 1983 by a group of parents who recognized that their students with disabilities were quickly falling behind their peers in large and highly competitive, educational settings. These founding parents recognized that students with special needs often have a painful awareness that they are “different” and experience great frustration when they can not “get” simple, everyday tasks that others master with ease. Therefore, Concord was established to provide programs that encompass all aspects of student development, combining specialized, academic instruction with social, emotional and vocational guidance. Since its beginning twenty-one years ago, Concord has served approximately five hundred students. As of 2009, 165 students have graduated from Concord Academy.

Career Keough graduated from Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach, California, in 1973. The Oakland Athletics selected Keough in seventh round of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. Keough with the Nashville Sounds in 1984 Keough was signed by Oakland as an infielder. He was supposed to replace departed Sal Bando at third base, but after leading the California league in hitting while playing for Modesto in his second year of professional baseball in 1975, he hit a disappointing .210 in Double-A in 1976. He was converted to a pitcher and joined Oakland a year later. He was selected to the All-Star Game in his rookie season for the Athletics, recording a 3.24 ERA despite his 8–15 mark. In , he tied a major league record by losing his first 14 decisions and finished with a 2–17 record. His winning percentage of .105 was the worst recorded by a major league pitcher with 15 or more decisions since , when Philadelphia A's teammates Jack Nabors and Tom Sheehan finished the season with winning percentages of .048 and .059, respectively. From 1978–79, Keough made 28 consecutive starts without a victory, tying Cliff Curtis (1910–11) for the longest streak in MLB history according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The streak was later tied by Jo-Jo Reyes (2008–11). But Keough resurged in with a 16–13 mark, earning AL Comeback Player of the Year honors. In the strike-shortened season he finished 10–6, helping Oakland to clinch the AL Division Series. He pitched well in a losing effort in Game Three of the AL Championship Series, giving up one earned run in innings in a game won by the New York Yankees 4–0. Keough slumped again in 1982, tying for the AL lead with 18 losses against 11 wins in 34 starts. He also walked more batters than he struck out (101-to-75) and led the league in home runs (38) and earned runs (133) allowed. A number of baseball historians and statisticians have put this down to manager Billy Martin overworking Keough and the other members of the 1981 rotation. In 2006, Rob Neyer estimated that Keough threw 131 pitches per complete game in 1981, a heavy workload for a young pitcher even then. In the 1983 mid-season, the Athletics traded Keough to the New York Yankees for Marshall Brant and Ben Callahan. Nursing a sore arm, he spent parts of two seasons in the minors and returned to the majors with the St. Louis Cardinals late in 1985. The next year, he divided his playing time between Triple-A, the Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs. In 1987 he joined the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball and pitched for them until 1990. He attempted a comeback to the major leagues with the Anaheim Angels in 1991 spring training but did not make the roster. In March 1992, he tried again with the Angels and had made the major league roster, but while sitting in the dugout during an exhibition game in which he was later scheduled to pitch, he was hit in the right temple by a foul ball off the bat of San Francisco Giants' John Patterson, seriously injuring him and ending his playing career. Following his playing career, Keough worked for the A's and Angels both as a roving pitching coach and as an executive from 1992 to 1999. After that, he scouted for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and was again an executive for the Oakland Athletics. Keough would occasionally throw a spitball. One time, however, his spitball backfired on him. Keough threw a spitball that Boston Red Sox second baseman Jerry Remy missed completely and had seemingly struck out. The umpire, seeing the tremendous break on the pitch, assumed Remy had fouled off the pitch and so he remained at bat with two strikes. On the next pitch, Remy hit a home run, the last of his career. In a nine-season career, Keough posted a 58–84 record with 590 strikeouts and a 4.17 ERA in 1190 innings pitched, including seven shutouts and 57 complete games. Personal life Keough was the son of Marty Keough and the nephew of Joe Keough, both of whom also played in the majors. Keough was married to actress and November 1980 Playboy Playmate of the month, Jeana Tomasino in 1984 but they later separated. The two appeared on reality television on The Real Housewives of Orange County.https://www.ocregister.com/2010/10/15/housewives-husband-gets-year-in- jail/amp/ The couple had three children: Shane, Kara and Colton. Shane, their oldest son, is a third-generation professional baseball player, making it as far as the Stockton Ports, a Class A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics, before being released in 2010. Daughter Kara married NFL player Kyle Bosworth. Keough died on May 1, 2020 in California at the age of 64. His former wife Jeana revealed the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism.

Located just south of the city of Minneapolis, it is one of fourteen Regional Priority Urban Wildlife Refuges in the nation. Many parts of the Refuge are near large establishments of the Twin Cities; the Bloomington Education and Visitor Center and two trailheads are located just blocks from the Mall of America, the Wilkie Unit is just east of Valleyfair and the Louisville Swamp Unit is just south of Minnesota Renaissance Festival. The Refuge stretches southwest through Minneapolis’ outer-ring suburbs to Henderson, Minnesota. There are eleven refuge units strung along of the Minnesota River. The various Refuge units are interspersed with units of the Minnesota Valley State Recreation Area. Although the National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the state recreation area by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, both agencies share a consistent signage to simplify visitation. The Refuge has two visitor centers: The Bloomington Education and Visitor Center is at 3815 American Boulevard East in Bloomington, MN and is part of the Long Meadow Lake Unit. There are two hiking trails that can be accessed from the visitor center and many exhibits to explore. The visitor center is open Tuesday-Sunday, 9AM-5PM during the summer season and Tuesday-Saturday, 9AM-4PM during the winter season. The Rapids Lake Education and Visitor Center is at 15865 Rapids Lake Road in Carver, MN and is part of the Rapids Lake Unit. There are two hiking trails that can be accessed from the visitor center and short hikes will lead to rewarding views of the Minnesota River and the Carver Rapids. The visitor center is open Tuesday-Friday, 9AM-4PM, but please call ahead to confirm that the facility is open, as staff may be leading school programs or other outreach events off-site. While the facilities may be closed certain days of the week, the Refuge's trails are open sunrise to sunset and are open year round. The Refuge does not groom trails during the winter season. Refuge units There are 12 refuge units, listed east to west. Long Meadow Lake Unit This 2,400 acre (9.7 km2) unit, on the left bank of the Minnesota River in Bloomington, is the most visited in the refuge. Lakes and ponds surrounded by wetlands are bordered by floodplain forest. of trails lead into the valley from the visitor center and three other access points. Pedestrians and bicyclists will be able to cross the Cedar Avenue Bridge into Fort Snelling State Park as soon as the spring of 2017. An interpretive trail circles the man-made Bass Ponds, where the Izaak Walton League raised several fish species to stock lakes statewide from 1926 to the 1950s.Map The bridge contractor finished refurbishing the dilapidated, long closed old Cedar Avenue Bridge about late October 2016. The bridge has a new concrete deck with two striped bike lanes down the middle and pedestrian paths on either side of the bridge. The old concrete piers were raised, poor steel was replaced, and the entire bridge was sand blasted and painted in an original gray color over its five refurbished trusses. One can now cross Long Meadow Lake from the as yet un-repaved Old Cedar Avenue Parking lot and take the former car road to the beginning of the 3.5 mile long, one way, Long Meadow Lake Trail. This takes one back to the Bloomington Visitor Center at 3815 American Blvd. East; Bloomington, MN. Once one reaches the old road’s terminus at the Minnesota River, you can also take a single track trail west (right) towards the Lyndale Avenue trail-head. This is about 4 miles in length and follows the bank of the river. You can also take the pedestrian/bike bridge over the Minnesota River to the Jens Caspersen State Landing parking lot. From there begins a state trail (Fort Snelling State Park) that leads down the Minnesota River to the 494 freeway bridge and then on to the Village of Mendota. The beat up parking lot, Old Cedar Avenue, bathroom structures, and other area improvements will take place in the spring/summer of 2017. Road access to this area will be very restricted until the work is done. To date, the FWS has done extensive restoration work to the Bluff Trail which heads west to the Lyndale Ave. trail-head. They have built a new elevated boardwalk trail system to the edge of Long Meadow Lake about 1/3 of a mile up-lake from the refurbished Cedar Bridge. It has high safety rails and a very large wildlife viewing platform. The FWS has plans to mount two heavy duty telescopes here next year. One will be for chair users and the other for people who stand. Access is about 150 yards up the new Bluff Trail as it follows Orchard Spring Marsh The FWS has carried out trail and landscaping improvements going down-lake from the old Cedar Bridge towards the MN 77 Bridge underpass. Work has stopped for the season with about 75% of the trail now fiber-matted and regraded with Class V aggregate. This trail runs alongside Kidder Marsh and Cedar Pond. Once it gets to the MN 77 Bridge a dirt trail passes under the bridge and emerges at Pond C. The old trails then continue further east towards the Bass Ponds, Hogback Ridge Pond, Fisher Pond, and Skimmer Pond and the exit road to the Bass Ponds parking lot at Old Shakopee Road and East 86th Street in Bloomington, MN. Black Dog Preserve Land leased by the FWS surrounds Black Dog Power Plant This 1,400 acre (5.7 km2) unit surrounds Black Dog Lake, on the right bank of the Minnesota River in Burnsville. The lake is named after Chief Black Dog, leader of a band of Mdewakanton Sioux who formed a permanent summer village here around 1750 and later sold game to American soldiers and settlers at Fort Snelling. The unit preserves prairie and calcareous fen. Xcel Energy’s Black Dog Power Plant rises in the center of the unit. Clean wastewater from the plant is pumped into Black Dog Lake so it may cool before reentering the Minnesota River. Because of this certain waterfowl remain on the lake longer into the winter. The unit was created in 1982 when Xcel Energy agreed to lease the lands to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The southwestern corner of the unit is managed as Black Dog Nature Preserve Scientific and Natural Areahttp://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/sna01010/index.html by the Minnesota DNR. A two-mile (3 km) trail runs through wetlands south of the lake. There is parking at either end of the trail, off River Hills Dr and Cliff Rd. There is an observation platform on the north shore of the lake off Black Dog Rd.Map Bloomington Ferry Unit The unit, located in the southwest corner of Bloomington, comprises 400 acres (1.6 km2) of marsh and floodplain forest. It is located predominantly in the river bottoms on the north side of the Minnesota River. A significant wetland area, Opus Marsh, encompasses a portion of the east half of the unit. A connecting trail and pedestrian bridge also allows access to the Refuge's Wilkie Unit. From a parking area there is a one mile (1600 m) linear trail along the riverbank and a bridge to the Wilkie Unit.Map Wilkie Unit These 2,100 acres (8.5 km2) are just south of the river in Savage and Shakopee. The Wilkie Unit is located predominantly in the river bottoms, and features three prominent lakes (Blue, Rice, and Fisher) and large areas of associated marsh. There are also extensive areas of bottomland forest, as well as stands of coniferous trees. A connecting trail and pedestrian bridge also allow access to the Refuge's Bloomington Ferry Unit. Five miles of trail and abandoned farm roads are open for hiking and cross- country skiing year-round. Additionally, the state’s largest great blue heron rookery, with over 600 nests, is found here. Because disturbances negatively affect the birds’ breeding, the west end of the unit is closed to the public from March 1 to August 31.Map Upgrala Unit Although 2,450 acres (9.9 km2) are authorized for this unit, most of the land has not yet been acquired from private owners. There is currently no public access to this mosaic of marshes, prairie, and floodplain forest. The authorized area for this unit stretches from the Old Highway 169 bridge (now County Road 101) north of Shakopee and eastward along the bluffs in the southern part of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. Upgrala is a shortened name for Upper Grass Lake. Chaska Unit This 600 acre (2.4 km2) unit was acquired in 2001 and occupies a bend in the Minnesota River stretching between the towns of Chaska and Carver. It consists of lake, marsh, old fields, and river bottom hardwood forest and a two-mile trail (3 km) trail runs through these habitats. There are ample opportunities for observing waterfowl, shorebirds and other waders during spring, late summer, and fall. There is parking at either end, at the Chaska Ballpark and Riverside Park in Carver.Map Louisville Swamp Unit Remains of the 1880 barn and a restored granary at Jabs Farm The centerpiece of this 2,600 acre (11 km2) unit is the marsh called Louisville Swamp. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service staff estimate that Louisville Swamp floods three out of every five years, and trail closures are common. A water control structure helps regulate the outflow into Sand Creek, a short course which flows into the Minnesota River. The unit also includes dry lands above the bluffs which bear old fields, prairie, and oak savanna. The unit is located on the Eastern bank of the river just north of Jordan, Minnesota. There was once a Wahpeton Sioux village called Inyan Ceyaka Otonwe, or Little Rapids, here. The unit’s Mazomani Trail is named after a Wahpeton chief. Jean-Baptiste Faribault built a fur trading post near the village in 1802 and lived here for seven years. The exact site of the village and trading post are lost, but the remains of two historic farmsteads are still visible. The Ehmiller Farmstead is in ruins, but at the Jabs Farm two buildings have been restored and a third stabilized. The barn was built in 1880 by Robert and Anna Riedel. Frederick Jabs bought the 379 acre (1.5 km2) farmstead in 1905 and his family lived there as subsistence farmers until 1952. The unit has thirteen miles (19 km) of trail for hiking and cross-country skiing. The parking lot for this unit is a few dozen yards past the Minnesota Renaissance Festival parking. Traffic during the festival (weekends from mid-August through September) significantly impedes access to the Louisville Swamp unit.Map Rapids Lake and San Francisco Units This 1,888 acres (6 km2) unit is on the left bank of the river across from the Louisville Swamp Unit. Old fields were restored to prairie and oak savanna and there is also bottom-land forest and a wetland that were restored in 1992. Part of the unit was once a turkey farm! The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has constructed the Rapids Lake Education and Visitor Center, which includes the visitor center, an outdoor education center, a bunkhouse for interns and a maintenance shop. The visitor center facility includes an outdoor restroom that is open sunrise to sunset. There are three miles (5 km) of trails in the unit. The two access points are on County Road 45, two miles (3 km) apart. Two small parcels in the southwest corner of the Rapids Lake Unit are considered part of a distinct unit: the San Francisco Unit. St. Lawrence, Jessenland and Blakeley Units These three units are new additions to the Refuge. The St. Lawrence Unit is 303 acres and is located in St. Lawrence Township. The Jessenland Unit is 1,827 acres and is located in Blakely Township and Henderson Township. The Blakeley Unit is 136 acres and is located in Blakely Township south of the town of Blakeley and north of Salisbury Hill Road. History Early plans to create a Refuge along the Minnesota River were forestalled by World War II. It wasn’t until the early 1970s that the threat of development inspired concerted efforts to preserve the valley. An act creating the National Wildlife Refuge was passed in 1976. Long Meadow Lake is spanned by a wood and steel bridge built in 1920. Known as the Old Cedar Avenue Bridge, it was turned over to the city of Bloomington in 1979 when the Minnesota Department of Transportation constructed a new bridge nearby. In poor repair, the old bridge was closed to vehicle traffic in 1993 but remained a crucial link for pedestrians and cyclists until officials closed the bridge entirely in 2002. The refuge managers, Bloomington and Eagan officials, and public interest groups have all expressed a desire to replace or restore the unsafe bridge. Construction began in May 2015 and should be completed during Fall 2016. In the late 1990s, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport planned a new runway which would route air traffic over parts of the refuge. A real estate appraisal firm arbitrated a settlement to compensate the refuge for the environmental impact of the noise pollution. The airport’s commission voted unanimously to accept the settlement in 1998 and ultimately paid $26 million into the Minnesota Valley Trust. Some of that money was used in 2004 and 2005 to purchase 420 acres (1.7 km2) between the Chaska and Rapids Lake Units.

The silver fern motif is associated with New Zealand, and a silver fern flag may be used as an unofficial flag of New Zealand, to which it is endemic. The silver fern itself is a quasi-national emblem, being used for various official symbols, including the coat of arms of New Zealand and the New Zealand one dollar coin. A number of New Zealand sports teams, such as the cricket team, the Silver Ferns and the All Blacks, use similar silver fern flags as part of their official merchandise. The All Whites association football team use a white background and a black version of the fern. 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics New Zealand officially boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics as part of the US- led boycott of the games. However, four New Zealand athletes competed under the flag of New Zealand's Olympic committee, which was a black flag with a white silver fern imposed over the Olympic Rings.1980 Moscow Olympics boycott NZ History.net.nz. National flag proposals The first suggestion that a silver fern flag be adopted as New Zealand's official flag came in 1998 from Cultural Affairs Minister Marie Hasler of the National Party. Hasler's proposal was backed by then Prime Minister Jenny Shipley. Along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, Shipley backed a white silver fern on a black background as a possible alternative flag, along the lines of the Canadian Maple Leaf flag. In 2003, New Zealand's America's Cup team, Team New Zealand, launched the \\"Loyal\\" campaign, using a silver fern flag and a song of the same name by New Zealand musician Dave Dobbyn. Whilst the All Blacks version of the silver fern flag was once favoured by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, opponents of the design believe it gives undue emphasis to the country's sport or resembles a pirate flag or the Islamic Black Standard as used by ISIL. 2005 referendum proposal In January 2005 the NZ Flag.com Trust, using a stylised silver fern flag designed by Cameron Sanders, launched a petition to initiate a referendum on the flag issue, but failed to attract enough signatures. File:The-Black-and-Silver.svgThe Black & Silver flag is based on a stylized version of the original silver ferns used in the emblems of the military and sports representative teams of the 1880s.

Biography Emmanuel Ghent was born in Montreal, Quebec. He grew up in Montreal and attended McGill University to study medicine. After graduating, he moved to New York City to continue his psychiatric training. He remained there all his life, practicing in New York and eventually becoming a clinical professor of psychology at the postdoctoral program in psychoanalysis at New York University. Throughout his life, Ghent worked to expand his field of psychoanalysis beyond psychiatric practitioners. Ghent was also an amateur oboist and composer of electronic music. In the 1960s, Ghent pioneered the concept of electronic music by adapting a computer system, initially designed to synthesize the human voice, to instead synthesize music. With the advent of more sophisticated computer systems in the 1970s, Ghent was able to synchronize the lighting of the theater with the synthesized music. Ghent could thus create music that combined music, dance and light patterns. In fact, several of his most famous compositions used this idea, most notably \\"Phosphones\\" and \\"Five Brass Voices for Computer-Generated Tape.\\" Ghent wrote non-electronic music too, including \\"Entelechy for Viola and Piano\\" and \\"25 Songs for Children and All Their Friends\\" (written to commemorate the birth of Ghent's third daughter, Theresa Ghent Locklear).

It was discovered at Ballaqueeney (Ballaquine) Isle of Man in 1874 by Reverend F. B. Grant during the process of excavating dirt for use as railroad ballast. The stone was kept in a garden in Ballaqueeney from its discovery until about 1885. This caused the stone surface to deteriorate, due to being exposed to wind and rain, with the result that two Ogham letters can no longer be read.

In the spring of 1967, Clark had had her biggest hit ever with \\"This is My Song\\" her first single since \\"Downtown\\" in 1964, not written and produced by Tony Hatch, whose 1966 collaborations with Clark had failed to maintain her US Top Ten presence and had missed the UK Top 50 completely. Clark had then cut the These Are My Songs album with producer Sonny Burke, reuniting with Hatch only for one track \\"Don't Sleep in the Subway\\"; although that track had been the album's second single and a strong follow-up to \\"This Is My Song\\", Clark had proceeded to record her next album with no planned involvement from Hatch. Clark continued to work with Burke but as his productions tended to be intensely easy listening, she signed with Koppelman-Rubin Associates, a Los Angeles-based music publishing and independent production company, to provide her with material with more Top 40 appeal. The submissions to Charles Koppelman and Dan Rubin for consideration for Clark to record included two songs: \\"Who Got the Credit\\" and \\"Bus Driver is a Fruit Cake\\" which if deemed suitable for Clark - which they weren't - would have been the first songs placed by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen. Eventually Koppelman-Rubin had Clark record a song by their staff writers Gary Bonner and Alan Gordon: \\"The Cat in the Window (The Bird in the Sky)\\". Bonner and Gordon had been signed as Koppelman-Rubin house writers on the strength of penning the Turtles' #1 hit \\"Happy Together\\" and had recently placed songs with Gary Lewis and the Playboys, the Mojo Men, Gene Pitney and the Righteous Brothers. \\"The Cat in the Window...\\" was reportedly written with Clark in mind;Toledo Blade 12 November 1967 p.36 the song was also cut by the Turtles whose version had no contemporaneous release.1 Recorded by Clark at Wally Heider Studios, \\"The Cat in the Window...\\" is a brief (at 1:55) track richly orchestrated with strings and flutes - Jack Nitzsche arranged the session - difficult to categorize by specific musical genre. The lyrics have the singer empathize with a cat (\\"with a tear in his eye\\") seemingly eager to \\"fly out the window, go where the wind goes\\" like the birds flying by. Resolving to \\"glide to a rainbow off where the clouds go dancing by,\\" she ends with the plaintive comment, \\"You won't find me . . . don't even try to.\\" Another Bonner/Gordon composition: \\"Fancy Dancin' Man\\", was recorded to serve as the track's B-side. Released in August 1967, \\"The Cat in the Window...\\" proved a chart disappointment its #26 peak on the Billboard Hot 100 making it Clark's least successful US release to date. In the UK \\"The Cat in the Window...\\" afforded Clark her lowest chart showing since her 1964 breakout with \\"Downtown\\" with a #66 peak.

Their music was often darkly comedic and satirical, and was frequently featured on Dr. Demento's weekly radio program. Popular songs from Ogden Edsl included \\"Dead Puppies\\", \\"Kinko the Clown\\". and \\"Daddy's Money\\". Over the years, the band has achieved a cult following in American sub-culture. The band's name is a reference to poet Ogden Nash; Nash Motors and Edsel are both brands of automobile. History Ogden Edsl's career began by playing the Omaha and Lincoln circuits for about four years. The shows featured not only satirical music and parodies, but also comedy sketches. During this time, they also recorded a 65-episode radio serial. In 1974, the members of Ogden Edsl expanded their territory by playing gigs throughout the Midwest with a ten-piece band. They also added TV monitors to their act, which displayed video effects synchronized to their music. Between 1974 and 1976, the band recorded an LP, Stuffed, released on the Sunburn record label. In the late 1970s, the band moved to Los Angeles to work on some TV shows and produce a local radio series. For a long period of time, Ogden Edsl's \\"Dead Puppies\\" was the most requested song on the Dr. Demento radio show, and remains the only song to ever hit number one on the annual \\"Funny 25\\" countdown two years in a row (1982 and 1983). Ogden Edsl formally disbanded in 1983. An anthology of their hits featuring Bill Frenzer was released in 1995 by Oglio Records, entitled Mower of the Ogden Edsl. Clips of Ogden Edsl songs, namely \\"Dead Puppies\\", frequently circulated amongst AOL users as chatroom-playable .wav files in the mid and late 1990s. Ogden Edsl was inducted into the Nebraska Music Hall of Fame on 27 October 2001 at the Ranch Bowl in Omaha, and performed one last time before a hometown crowd. The song \\"Kinko the Clown\\", about a pedophile who poses as a clown to lure children, appears on The Rhino Brothers Present the World's Worst Records.

His courtesy title was Ukyō-no-kami, and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. Biography Tozawa Masamori was the eldest son of Tozawa Moriyasu, but as his mother was a peasant girl whom Moriyasu had raped while engaged in a falconry hunt, he was not expected to inherit. Masamori's mother was subsequent married off to a yamabushi and Masamori was raised as a peasant. However, Moriyasu's death in 1590, followed by that of his uncle Tozawa Mitsumori in 1592, left the clan leaderless and to avoid the possibility of attainder, the clan's retainers tracked Masamori down, murdered his stepfather, and brought him before Toyotomi Hideyoshi as heir, with Mitsumori's widow as his adopted mother. He fought in the Battle of Sekigahara for the eastern side, and was subsequently awarded a 40,000 koku domain of Matsuoka Domain in Hitachi Province and this he became daimyō under the Tokugawa shogunate. During the winter campaign at the Siege of Osaka he was assigned as castellan of Odawara Castle and during the summer campaign he was castellan of Edo Castle. For these services, Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu arranged a marriage between Tozawa Masamori and a daughter of Torii Mototada. Following the attainder of the Mogami clan, he accompanied Torii Tadamasa to Dewa Province and was subsequently assigned a portion of the former Mogami lands, which became Shinjō Domain (60,000 koku).

She first appears in Amazing Fantasy (vol. 2) #7 and was created by Fred Van Lente and Leonard Kirk. Fictional character biography After the vicious murder of her adoptive parents, Carmilla discovered her biological mother, Monica Rappaccini, is the Scientist Supreme of the worldwide terrorist network A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics). Carmilla is now trying to find her real mother under the auspices of S.H.I.E.L.D., who are attempting to use her to infiltrate A.I.M. She appears in Incredible Hulk #87, a one-shot story that takes place immediately after House of M. Peter David, who wrote her appearances in Hulk, made suggestions that Bruce Banner may be her biological father. Captain Universe Carmilla and her S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, agent Derek Khanata, had been sent to New York under orders to track down and capture The Uni-Power before it could fall into the hands of the terrorist organization A.I.M. Watching over the spot where a Captain Universe empowered Daredevil fought four Class Three A.I.M. Commandos, Scorpion and Khanata waited to see if A.I.M. (who was also at the site) would find anything. A group of kids interrupted the A.I.M. Agents work and were nearly killed until Laura Kinney a.k.a. X-23 stepped in. The A.I.M. Commandos who fought Daredevil before begin to assault X-23 when she becomes Captain Universe. Scorpion entered the fray, helping X-23/Captain Universe defeat the Commandos. Soon afterwards X-23 began to search for a hidden base. Scorpion joined her so that she could capture Captain Universe and get the information on it from A.I.M., however X-23 convinced Scorpion to see the light and let Captain Universe go. X-23 took Captain Universe to a safe hiding place while Scorpion brought an A.I.M. scientist back to S.H.I.E.L.D. for interrogation.  Civil War/The Initiative  Carmilla has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book Avengers: The Initiative #1. In Spider-Man Family #3 (set prior to Civil War: Choosing Sides #1) she appears in a short story again written by Van Lente and drawn by Leonard Kirk. Here she is infiltrating the unregistered superhero underground for S.H.I.E.L.D., and is sent on missions to establish a presence as a superhero. When the current Venom and former Scorpion Mac Gargan finds out about her, he challenges her to a fight, since he is negotiating for a movie based on his life story and does not want her diluting his trademark. She defeats him by absorbing some of his webbing, creating a \\"neo-symbiote\\" which disintegrates after she has defeated him. World War Hulk Carmilla is seen trying to aid S.H.I.E.L.D. upon the Hulk's return. When she finally got to battle the Hulk, she filled his body with a S.H.I.E.L.D.-devised poison concoction specially designed to kill him, but the sole effect was to cause boils to erupt on his skin. The Hulk's healing factor returned him to normal after just a few minutes, after which he was prompted to a sudden rush of anger by Amadeus Cho. Cho reveals to her the relationship her mother and the Hulk had back when they were in college. Cho asks her if she thought about the origins of her green hair. Carmilla attacks a S.H.I.E.L.D. truck transporting Bruce Banner to his underground prison, destroying the truck and knocking out both agents. Intending to get a DNA sample from Banner, she opens his casket, only to discover it was one of three decoys.Hulk Family #1 Dark Reign It is revealed that Carmilla is now Hardball's lover and is the co-leader of the HYDRA Training Facility in Madripoor that the Shadow Initiative is supposed to be taking out.Avengers: The Initiative #22 Carmilla and Hardball confront the Shadow Initiative along with an army of HYDRA agents shortly after learning they were searching for Hardball and has them pinned down in an old alleyway somewhere deep within the slums of Madripoor.Avengers: The Initiative #22 It is later revealed that she was actually working undercover for an unknown source, implied to be Nick Fury. She convinces Hardball to turn himself in and escapes, but not before secretly stealing his S.P.I.N. Tech dart while kissing him.Avengers: The Initiative #24 The Gauntlet Carmilla appears in a new costume during The Gauntlet storyline. She reveals that after quitting S.H.I.E.L.D., she began taking independent contracts. She was hired by Kraven the Hunter's family in order to steal Mac Gargan's original costume from The Hood (who had received the costume from Norman Osborn), who is planning to give the Scorpion costume to the low-level crook that impresses him. The Scorpion stings Spider-Man and he temporarily loses his powers. She then proceeds to fight The Hood and his allies and is quickly overwhelmed. However, Spider-Man regains his powers and saves her. She then delivers the suit to Sasha and Ana.The Amazing Spider-Man #626 Powers and abilities Genetically designed by her \\"mother\\" as part of a group of similar kids called Wakers that were designed to be immune against environmental toxins, Scorpion mutated - greatly heightening her comparative abilities and equipping her with a left arm that allows her to release filtered toxins at her will. Her lymphatic system produces a \\"ludicrous\\" variety of life-saving chemicals, for example atropine to defend against nerve gas or amyl to overcome blood agents like cyanide. Her sweat glands excrete dimercaprol and chloramine to counteract blistering agents such as mustard gas. Her cell nuclei float in a solution of iodized salt to deflect gamma rays and other radiation. Like activated charcoal, the cilia lining Scorpion's trachea are highly adsorptive, neutralizing harmful particles before they reach the lungs. The axillary node in her left armpit is unusually swollen. Toxins seem to be accumulating there, to be released along the arm and hand. Since lymph fluid absorbs the chemicals it fights this is highly dangerous. This absorption ability is potent enough to assimilate even the toxins that compose the Venom symbiote; in contact with her, the symbiote fled, fearing that she may be capable of truly destroying it.Spider-Man Family #3 Essentially her unique body chemistry makes her immune to most types of poisons and unhealthy chemicals, gases, radiation (in fact she can absorb and possibly gain nutrients from them), and diseases. She is even capable of overcoming poisons designed to be allowed in by the other members of the Wakers, and in fact the mind controlling chemicals meant to make her loyal to her mother's agenda were what she originally absorbed and accidentally used to kill her boyfriend. She's physically gifted since her body's chemistry keeps her in top physical shape regardless of what she ingests. Originally her power is uncontrolled and results in her boyfriend's death at their high school prom. But after 3 years she's gotten relative control over it and can alter the strength of her poisonous touch from merely making people sick, to knocking someone out, to killing them. She also gained nearly indestructible mind controlled gauntlets packed full of SHIELD technology and a body suit that manages to stop most if not all weapons and has other built in gadgets. Since Madripoor she has added a tail (similar to Mac Gargan's) to her costume with a stinger that injects S.P.I.N. tech nanites after ingesting the contents of the dart that she stole from Hardball. The effects only last half an hour. Since she has said that the source of the nanites is her own body, it is hinted that, unlike the previous Scorpion, her tail might be semi-organic. There's also evidence that she may have honed her skills as a thief in the three years she spent on the street. Other versions In the House of M reality, the Scorpion was raised by her mother, and has a good relationship with her (as she was never adopted, she also goes by her birth name of Thasanee Rappaccini, although she retains the Scorpion codename). She is thus an agent of the semi-heroic AIM, and helped recruit the Hulk, her mother's former lover, to overthrow Exodus' totalitarian Australian government.Incredible Hulk #83-86 Behind the scenes * The name Rappaccini is an allusion to the short story \\"Rappaccini's Daughter\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne.Richards, Dave; \\"Angst & Espionage: Van Lente on Amazing Fantasy; comicbookresources.com; March 28, 2005 The title character of that story is a beautiful young woman whose breath and touch have been rendered poisonous by the experiments of her father. * Scorpion was originally intended to be the daughter of Silver Samurai and Viper, thus explaining Carmilla's hair color.

This installment is produced by Shigenobu Matsuyama. Gameplay Lethal Enforcers 3 has players play as six different law enforcement roles in various scenarios in present-day Tokyo, Japan. Players make their way towards checkpoints while shooting criminals, terrorists, or fugitives. Weapons such as submachine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and assault rifles are also available during each mission. Like Konami's earlier Warzaid/World Combat, players point and/or shoot outside the screen to deploy their shields. Raising the shield allows players to protect themselves from incoming enemy fire at the expense of an inability to advance towards the goal. Unlike Lethal Enforcers I and II, players can compete with each other in making their way to checkpoints in various areas, in addition to capturing wanted criminals and earning promotions. Also, players do not lose lives when they shoot innocent civilians, instead they face being demoted. Much of the game's gameplay, music and mannerisms are reminiscent of Police 911, so much to the point where it could be considered a quasi-sequel. Scenarios Lethal Enforcers 3/Seigi no Hero allows the player to play the stages in the order they desire (with the exception of the Congress Building a.k.a. \\"Lethal Enforcers 3/Seigi no Hero\\" stage). With the exception of the Cops in the City stage, players have access to a 10-round Glock handgun as a standard munition. There are 6 stages in all. * In the first stage \\"Cops in The City\\", the player plays as a police officer of Tokyo Police to chase after an armed robber gang in Akihabara. * In the second stage \\"Port Invader\\", the player plays as Japan Coast Guard officer to intercept a cargo ship which entered the port illegally. * In the third stage \\"Rival Heat\\", the player plays as a detective of the Metropolitan Police Department to put a mafia boss under arrest in the subway. * In the fourth stage \\"Airport 2004\\", the player play as Special Assault Team operative to quell an airport riot caused by radicals. * In the fifth stage \\"Justice & Judgment\\" the player plays as a soldier of JGSDF to conduct an anti-terrorist operation in a nuclear power plant occupied by terrorists. * In the last stage \\"Lethal Enforcers 3\\", the player play as a SAT operative to stop a coup d'état orchestrated by a JGSDF Eighth Kanto Infantry Regiment commander in the Diet Building. Trivia *All Japanese hostiles, with the exception of Akihito Kawanishi, are named after Konami's veteran employees. *The game is spoken entirely in Japanese throughout gameplay (i.e. when players lose a life, the announcer will say \\"Player junshoku\\" (殉職) or \\"Player died on duty\\")--this was the case in The Keisatsukan and The Keisatsukan 2. The reason is to simulate the players' experience working as a Japanese authority. *The JGSDF soldiers the player play as in Justice and Judgment and the enemies in the Diet Building are not related to each other although they are from the same regiment (The Eighth Kanto Infantry Regiment), as the enemies in the Diet Building are from a JGSDF's Coupists join the Coup d'état and thrust 12 demands to the Prime Minister, while the Fourth Platoon is a special platoon who doubles as Tokyo's Military Police unit, a reason why players don't see the JGSDF soldiers during the end credits. *The police woman (seen in the title screen and in the cabinet) is a hidden character players have to unlock by an unknown code.

(Translation by Shmuplations. ). In Rally Bike, players compete against computer-controlled opponents on races across various locations in the United States. Initially released for the arcades, the title was later ported to other platforms by different third-party developers including the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sharp X68000, with each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original version. Rally Bike was met with mixed reception from video game magazines and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game when it launched in arcades and its ports. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.  Gameplay  Arcade screenshot Rally Bike is a top-down motorcycle road racing game where players observe from above and races across six increasingly difficult stages, along with two bonus stages, taking place in North America with the main objective of crossing the finish line by passing an established number of competitors before doing so.Rally Bike instruction booklet (Nintendo Entertainment System, US) Along the way, players must also dodge incoming obstacles scattered on the stages to avoid any accident, which causes a great reduction of fuel. Fuel is a major obstacle of the game as well, as players must refuel their bike by stopping at the filling station, however this will also cause competitors to take advantage, as they never run out of fuel and running out of it results in a game over unless more credits are inserted into the arcade machine to continue playing. On occasions, a helicopter will come and drop an item to the road during races, ranging from turbo (which can be increased a second time by picking up the turbo item again) to helper bikers that guards the players from crashing against rival racers. In the NES version, a shop mechanic where players can buy new parts to improve their vehicle is introduced after completing each race. The title uses a checkpoint system in which a single player will respawn at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before crashing.  Development and release  Rally Bike was released in arcades worldwide on May 1988 by Taito. The soundtrack was composed by Osamu Ōta under the alias \\"Ree\\". (Translation by Shmuplations. ). On 25 June 1989, an album containing music from the title and other Toaplan games was published exclusively in Japan by Datam Polystar. On 15 June 1990, a Nintendo Entertainment System port of Rally Bike developed by Visco Corporation was first released in Japan and later in North America by Romstar on September of the same year. The NES version does not keep the same stages and backgrounds, likely due to hardware limitations. On 23 May 1991, The title later received a faithful conversion to the Sharp X68000 by SPS and only published in Japan by Sharp Corporation, although it contains several minor differences when compared to the original version such as the modified aspect ratio, missing animations, among other changes.  Reception and legacy  In Japan, Game Machine listed Rally Bike on their July 1, 1988 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Vulcan Venture. Rally Bike received mixed response from critics since its release in arcades and a equally mixed reception as well with its ports. Commodore User criticized the controls but praised the graphics. Both Robin Hogg and Cameron Pound from The Games Machine commended the presentation, visuals and gameplay but noted the design in later levels to be one of the game's negative points. Andy Smith of ACE regarded the title as \\"challenging stuff that's bound to appeal to driving and racing fans\\". Anthony Baize of AllGame deemed it to be a difficult but enjoyable experience. In more recent years, the rights to the game and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

The institution is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) and is a member of the North Carolina Community College System. FTCC serves more than 41,000 students annually by providing over 190 occupational, technical, general education, college transfer, and continuing education programs. It is the 4th largest community college in the state, and boasts one of the largest Continuing Education departments. Located adjacent to Fort Bragg, the college has provided education to the military since 1961. History Led by John Standridge in 1961, the Fayetteville Area Industrial Education Center (IEC) was created to provide job training and educational opportunities to high school graduates and adult learners in Cumberland County and the surrounding areas including: Bladen, Harnett, Hoke, Robeson, Sampson and Scotland counties, as well as Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base. After the North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill creating the statewide Community College System in 1963, Fayetteville Area IEC officially became Fayetteville Technical Institute (FTI) that July. Mr. Howard Boudreau was the first president of the institution. Accreditation was first received by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) in 1967. Through encouragement by the North Carolina Department of Community Colleges and the North Carolina General Assembly, FTI became Fayetteville Technical Community College in January 1988. The purpose of the name change was to broaden and enhance the public image of technical and vocational postsecondary education and job training opportunities to new and expanding industries. Fayetteville Tech celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011 under the leadership of its current President, Dr. Larry Keen.FTCC Fact Book  faytechcc.edu Academics FTCC offers associate degrees, diplomas, certificates, and continuing education programs. Athletics The college will have men's and women's basketball and golf teams beginning in the 2016-2017 season.

It was named, as is customary in Latin Rite ecclesiastical documents, for the first word of the document that contained it, Chapter 1, Session 24 of the Council of Trent. It added the impediment of clandestinity and established the canonical form of marriage for validity in the regions in which it was promulgated. Clandestinity This was the document that added the impediment of clandestinity to the marriage law of the church. It was also the decree which ended a long debate about validity of marriage and produced sought after reform. Since the Sacrament of Marriage is administered by the parties to the marriage to each other, and not by clergy it is unique among the Sacraments. Fear of possible change in this doctrine prompted the debate, since prior to the Council of Trent (1545-1563), clandestine marriages had been considered valid. These marriages had resultant problems - questions over legitimacy of children; difficulties over inheritance, and the potential for conflict between those who considered they had a right to a voice in the matter. It declared that while the Church has always disapproved of marriages contracted secretly, or without the consent of parents, \\"Tametsi\\" declared that clandestine contracts of marriage freely entered into are valid, unless rendered null by the non-observance of regulations made by the Church, and anathematizes those who hold the contrary as well as those who falsely assert the invalidity of a marriage contracted without parents' consent, or who affirm that parents by their approval or disapproval may affect the binding force of such contracts.Meehan, Andrew. \\"Tametsi.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14.

Banns were to be read before the marriage was to take place. For the first time, a record of marriage was to be kept. A liturgical form for marriage was established.

They posit that God has either ceased to exist or in some way accounted for such a belief. Although theologians since Friedrich Nietzsche have occasionally used the phrase \\"God is dead\\" to reflect increasing unbelief in God, the concept rose to prominence in the late 1950s and 1960s, before waning again.Gundry, S.N. \\"Death of God Theology\\" in Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, ed. Walter A. Elwell, Grand Rapids: Baker (2001), p. 327. The Death of God movement is sometimes technically referred to as theothanatology, deriving from the Greek theos (God) and thanatos (death). The main proponents of this radical theology included the Christian theologians Gabriel Vahanian, Paul Van Buren, William Hamilton, John Robinson, Thomas J. J. Altizer, Mark C. Taylor, John D. Caputo, Peter Rollins, and the rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein.  History = Revisionist interpretations  The theme of God's \\"death\\" became more explicit in the theosophism of the 18th- and 19th-century mystic William Blake. In his intricately engraved illuminated books, Blake sought to throw off the dogmatism of his contemporary Christianity and, guided by a lifetime of vivid visions, examine the dark, destructive, and apocalyptic undercurrent of theology. Most notably, Blake refused to view the crucifixion of Jesus as a simple bodily death, but rather, as a kenosis, a self-emptying of God. As Altizer writes, Blake \\"celebrates a cosmic and historical movement of the Godhead that culminates in the death of God himself.\\".  19th-century philosophy  In the 19th century, Death of God thought entered philosophical consciousness through the work of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Drawing upon the mysticism of Jakob Böhme and the Idealism of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, Hegel sought to revise Immanuel Kant's Idealism through the introduction of a dialectical methodology. Adapting this dialectic to the chief theological problem, the nature of God, Hegel argued that God (as Absolute or Father) is radically negated by the concrete incarnation of God (as Christ or Son). This negation is subsequently itself negated at the Crucifixion of Jesus, resulting in the emergence of the Holy Spirit, God as both concrete (the church) and absolute (spiritual community). In Hegelian thought, therefore, the death of God does not result in a strict negativity, but rather, permits the emergence of the full revelation of God: Absolute Consciousness. One of the more notable out of the Death of God philosophers was the German philosopher and proto-existentialist Friedrich Nietzsche, who was largely responsible for bringing the phrase \\"God is Dead\\" () into public consciousness. This phrase first appears in The Gay Science (), in sections 108 (New Struggles), 125 (The Madman), and for a third time in section 343 (The Meaning of our Cheerfulness). It is also found in Nietzsche's work Thus Spoke Zarathustra (German: Also sprach Zarathustra), which is most responsible for popularizing the phrase. The idea is stated in \\"The Madman\\" as follows:  20th-century philosophy and theology  Though he preceded the formal Death of God movement, the prominent 20th-century Protestant theologian Paul Tillich remains highly influential in the field. Drawing upon the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Friedrich Schelling, and Jacob Boehme, Tillich developed a notion of God as the \\"ground of Being\\" and the response to nihilism. Central to this notion was Tillich's rejection of traditional theism and insistence upon a \\"God above the God of theism.\\" In The Courage to Be he writes: In 1961, Gabriel Vahanian's The Death of God was published. Vahanian argued that modern secular culture had lost all sense of the sacred, lacking any sacramental meaning, no transcendental purpose or sense of providence. He concluded that for the modern mind \\"God is dead\\". In Vahanian's vision a transformed post- Christian and post-modern culture was needed to create a renewed experience of deity. Altizer offered a radical theology of the death of God that drew upon William Blake, Hegelian thought and Nietzschean ideas. He conceived of theology as a form of poetry in which the immanence (presence) of God could be encountered in faith communities. However, he no longer accepted the possibility of affirming belief in a transcendent God. Altizer concluded that God had incarnated in Christ and imparted his immanent spirit which remained in the world even though Jesus was dead. Unlike Nietzsche, Altizer believed that God truly died. He was considered to be the leading exponent of the Death of God movement. Richard L. Rubenstein represented that radical edge of Jewish thought working through the impact of the Holocaust. In a technical sense he maintained, based on the Kabbalah, that God had \\"died\\" in creating the world. However, for modern Jewish culture he argued that the death of God occurred in Auschwitz. Although the literal death of God did not occur at this point, this was the moment in time in which humanity was awakened to the idea that a theistic God may not exist. In Rubenstein's work, it was no longer possible to believe in an orthodox/traditional theistic God of the Abrahamic covenant; rather, God as a historical process. Although the direct linkage between the Lacanian-Marxist critical theory of Slavoj Žižek and Death of God thought is not immediately apparent, his explicitly Hegelian reading of Christianity, defended most conspicuously in the 2009 The Monstrosity of Christ, strongly lends itself to this tradition. Strongly influenced by both Dietrich Bonhoeffer and G.K. Chesterton, Žižek advocates a variant of christian atheism, more or less strongly depending upon context. As early as Adam Kotsko's 2008 Žižek and Theology a direct linkage between Žižek and this tradition has been maintained. Initially, reviewers vigorously rejected this connection, but following the publication of The Monstrosity of Christ as well as subsequent co-paneled sessions,. the direct relation between Žižek and Thomas Altizer has become clear..  Theology = Secularism  Vahanian, Van Buren, and Hamilton agree that the concept of transcendence had lost any meaningful place in modern thought. According to the norms of contemporary secular modern thought, God is dead. In responding to this collapse of transcendence, Vahanian proposes a radically post-Christian alternative to traditional theism. Van Buren and Hamilton offered secular people the option of Jesus as the model human who acted in love. The encounter with the Christ of faith would be open in a church community.  God's existence  To what extent God may properly be understood as \\"dead\\" is highly debated among death of God theologians. In its strongest forms, God is said to have literally died, often as incarnated on the cross or at the moment of creation. Thomas J. J. Altizer remains the clearest proponent of this perspective. Weaker forms of this theological bent often posit this \\"death\\" as a metaphor or existential recognition of God's existence outside of (or beyond) Being.  Time magazine cover  The cover of the April 8, 1966, edition of Time magazine asked the question \\"Is God Dead?\\". and the accompanying article addressed growing atheism in America at the time, as well as the growing popularity of Death of God theology.

If an omission happens deliberately and freely, it is considered a sin. The degree of guilt incurred by an omission is measured, like that attaching to sins of commission, by the dignity of the virtue and the magnitude of the precept to which the omission is opposed, as well as the amount of deliberation. A person may be guilty of a sin of omission if he fails to do something which he is able to do and which he ought to do because he has put himself into a state or situation whereby he is unable to complete the action. For example, if a person chooses to become inebriated and is therefore unable to perform a necessary task, that person is responsible for that failure, even though that person is physically unable to perform the task because he or she knowingly put themselves into a state (drunkenness) where accomplishing the task was impossible. Paul the Apostle refers to this sin directly when he states \\"For I do not do the good I want ...\\" (Romans ). :see James the brother of Jesus more exactly defines this sin when he states, \\"Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.\\" (James ) :see James 4, New King James Version :see :see :see :see \\"In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.\\" —Martin Luther King Jr. Lie of Omission In Catholicism the ninth commandment is \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.\\" This includes lies of omission which are also known as exclusionary detailing or continuing a misrepresentation.

The franchise consists mainly of two game genres, but also includes additional spin-off titles of various genres. The games of the first genre are mostly single-screen platform/action puzzle types, featuring Donkey Kong as the opponent in an industrial construction setting. Donkey Kong first made his appearance in the 1981 arcade machine called Donkey Kong, in which he faced Jumpman (Mario), now Nintendo's flagship character. This game was also the first appearance of Mario, pre- dating the well-known Super Mario Bros. by four years. In 1994, the series was revived as the Donkey Kong Country series, featuring Donkey Kong and his clan of other apes as protagonists in their native jungle setting versus a variety of anthropomorphic enemies, usually against the Kremlings, a clan of crocodiles, and their leader King K. Rool. These are side-scrolling platform games. Titles outside these two genres have included rhythm games (Donkey Konga), racing games (Diddy Kong Racing), and edutainment (Donkey Kong Jr. Math). A hallmark of the Donkey Kong franchise is barrels, which the Kongs use as weapons, vehicles, furniture, and lodging. The Donkey Kong character is highly recognizable and very popular; the franchise has sold over 40 million units worldwide.  Characters  Donkey Kong first appeared in the eponymous arcade game in 1981 as the opponent. He became the player character in later games. Donkey Kong Jr. first appeared in the arcade style game Donkey Kong Jr. released in 1982. The plot was that Donkey Kong Jr. saves his father, Donkey Kong, from Mario (initially known as Jumpman in the Japanese arcade version of Donkey Kong). Cranky Kong is the original Donkey Kong who has alternately been called the modern DK's grandfather and father.Donkey Kong Country instruction manual He is elderly and frequently berates the younger generation of heroes. Diddy Kong was first introduced in Donkey Kong Country and is featured in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest as the main character. Dixie Kong first appeared in Donkey Kong Country 2 as a sidekick to Diddy Kong and has been referred to as his girlfriend. She later starred in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble alongside Kiddy Kong. Other notable members of the Kong family include Funky Kong, Candy Kong, Wrinkly Kong, Tiny Kong, and Lanky Kong. King K. Rool is the main antagonist of the Donkey Kong series, though additional villains have appeared as well, including Wizpig (Diddy Kong Racing), Ghastly King (Donkey Kong Jungle Beat), the Tiki Tak Tribe (Donkey Kong Country Returns), and the Snowmads (Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze). Characters from the Donkey Kong series have appeared in Nintendo's crossover titles such as the Super Smash Bros. and the Mario Kart series.  Games =Original seriesDonkey Kong= The original Donkey Kong video game running on the Nintendo Entertainment System The original arcade Donkey Kong game was created when Shigeru Miyamoto was assigned by Nintendo to convert Radar Scope, a game that had been released to test audiences with poor results, into a game that would appeal more to Americans. The result was a major breakthrough for Nintendo and for the videogame industry. Sales of the machine were brisk, with the game becoming one of the best-selling arcade machines of the early 1980s alongside Pac-Man and Galaga. The gameplay itself was a large improvement over other games of its time, and with the growing base of arcades to sell to, it was able to gain huge distribution. In the game, 'Jumpman' (the character later became Mario) must ascend a construction site while avoiding obstacles such as barrels and fireballs to rescue Pauline, his girlfriend, from Donkey Kong. Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports include the Atari 2600, Colecovision, Amiga 500, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to the Family Computer in 1983 as one of the system's three launch titles; the same version was a launch title for the Famicom's North American version, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in Donkey Kong 64 for the Nintendo 64, Animal Crossing for the GameCube and as an item for purchase on the Wii's Virtual Console. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader and for the Game Boy Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The game was once more ported to Nintendo consoles Wii, Wii U and 3DS in 2013 and 2014, under the name Donkey Kong Original Edition. =Donkey Kong Jr.= The success of the original game spawned several ports, and a sequel, Donkey Kong Jr. In this game, Donkey Kong Junior is trying to rescue his father Donkey Kong, who has been imprisoned. Donkey Kong's cage is guarded by Mario, in his only appearance as a villain in a video game. The game was developed by Nintendo R&D1; and released in August 1982. In the arcade version, Donkey Kong Jr. has to touch a key, then it moves up to the top screen. Donkey Kong Jr. has to climb to the top screen while avoiding things such as electrical wires. When he gets to the top screen, Donkey Kong Jr. will have to touch the key again, and it will move to the keyhole of one of the chains. Donkey Kong Jr. has to climb up the rope below the keyhole, while avoiding birds. When he gets to the top of the rope, one of the chains will unlock. He has to do this 4 times until he saves Donkey Kong. After that, the game will start over, at a somewhat faster pace. =Donkey Kong II= Donkey Kong II was developed by Nintendo R&D1; and was released in 1983, as part of the Game & Watch Multi Screen series. =Donkey Kong 3= Donkey Kong 3 did not feature Mario. Its protagonist, Stanley, is a bugman. Donkey Kong has taken refuge in his greenhouse and it is now up to him to stop the ape from stirring up any more insects that will soon destroy his flowers. Stanley saves the flowers by spraying bug spray on Donkey Kong. =Donkey Kong for Game Boy= In 1994, Donkey Kong, a homonymous remake of the original game was released for the Game Boy, adding 96 new levels. This game was also the first game released with Super Game Boy enhancements, to help sell the new SNES peripheral. Later, Nintendo revamped this style of gameplay into the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games. Donkey Kong Country series Donkey Kong Country series logo, as seen in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze =Rare era (1994-2005)= Released in November 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by British game developer Rare, Donkey Kong Country took the Donkey Kong series in a new direction, becoming a showcase title to show off then-revolutionary CGI graphics. In Donkey Kong Country, the original Donkey Kong's grandson, also called Donkey Kong, is the hero and he and his sidekick Diddy Kong have to save his hoard of bananas from the thieving King K. Rool and his Kremling Krew. The game was an action sidescrolling title similar to the Mario games and was enormously popular for its graphics, music and gameplay. The sequel, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest involves Diddy and his girlfriend Dixie Kong embarking on a journey to Crocodile Isle to rescue DK from the clutches of K. Rool. In Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! both DK and Diddy are kidnapped by a mysterious robot named KAOS⁠—who is, in actuality, being operated by K. Rool⁠—and Dixie and her cousin Kiddy Kong have to venture to the Northern Kremisphere to save them in the final game of the series for the SNES. The Donkey Kong Country SNES trilogy games are primarily platforming games in which players complete side-scrolling levels to progress forward. Each game contains approximately 6 to 8 different 'worlds,' each of which contains 5 or 6 levels and a boss character battle which advances the player to the succeeding world. Each world is uniquely themed and levels consist of tasks such as swimming, riding in mine carts, launching out of barrel cannons, or swinging from vine to vine. Each game also includes two main playable Kong characters; if both Kongs are together, one follows the other (which the player controls), and the player can switch between them as needed. If the lead Kong then gets hit by an enemy, he runs off the screen and the player will take control of the other Kong until they can later free the first one from a barrel. If the Kong is hit by an enemy when traveling alone, the player loses a life. To defeat an enemy, players can either execute a roll, jump or ground slam which can also unveil secret items. However, some enemies cannot be taken down like this, so the player must either throw a barrel or use the assistance of a friendly animal. The player can gain additional lives by collecting items scattered throughout the levels, including 100 bananas; all four golden letters that spell out K–O–N–G; extra life balloons; and golden animal tokens that lead to bonus levels. There are also many secret passages that can lead to bonus games where the player can earn additional lives or other items. In several levels, players can gain assistance from various animals, who are found by breaking open crates. These \\"animal friends\\" include Rambi the rhino, Expresso the ostrich, Enguarde the swordfish, Winky the frog, and Squawks the parrot, among others. These animals have certain unique abilities that the player can use such as Rambi's ability to charge at enemies. Animal friends can sometimes give players access to otherwise inaccessible bonus games, examples being Rambi and Enguarde busting through walls. =Retro Studios era (2010-present)= thumbupright=1Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong riding in a mine cart in Donkey Kong Country Returns. These iconic levels are known for their difficulty. In the newer games that succeed the original trilogy, new gameplay elements were added such as levels in which the characters and foreground environments appear as silhouettes, spawning several new gameplay mechanics. In Donkey Kong Country Returns and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, collecting K-O-N-G letters will not award any lives to the player, but instead unlock various bonuses and hidden levels. Additionally, in these games collecting puzzle pieces unlocks artwork from the games. In Tropical Freeze, the Kongs are able to pluck items from the ground and pick up and throw stunned enemies. Additionally, filling up a 'Kong-POW' meter allows Donkey Kong and his partner to perform a special move which defeats all on-screen enemies and converts them into items depending on the partner. In the original trilogy, the player can switch between characters if they are both on the screen. This is changed in the Retro Studios games, where the player has to choose character(s) before each level. Starting with Donkey Kong Country Returns, each character has their own specific characteristics: Donkey is the larger and stronger of the two, and can defeat enemies more easily, while Diddy is faster and more agile, but not as powerful, and can use his barrel jetpack to glide the air over short distances and his peanut gun to stun enemies. Tropical Freeze marked the debut of Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong, and Funky Kong as playable characters in the Retro Studios era. Dixie, returning from Donkey Kong Country 3, can spin her ponytail into a propeller and slowly descend through the air, with an initial boost in height at the start, allowing her and Donkey Kong to fly up out-of-reach platforms or items, and can also use her candy gun to stun enemies. Cranky, in a similar mechanic to the DuckTales video game, can use his cane to bounce on dangerous surfaces such as spiky thorns and reach higher areas and defeat certain enemies the other Kongs cannot. Funky is featured as a playable character in the Nintendo Switch port of Tropical Freeze, functioning similarly to Donkey Kong but with additional hit points, an extra jump, and the ability to stand on spikes. Donkey Kong Land series The Donkey Kong Land games were handheld counterparts of the Country games adapted to the hardware of the Game Boy. Donkey Kong Land was released in 1995, Donkey Kong Land 2 in 1996 and Donkey Kong Land III in 1997. They were presented in distinctive yellow cartridges instead of the typical grey ones. A port of Donkey Kong Country was released for the Game Boy Color in 2000, featuring mini-games and an exclusive new level. Following the success of the Donkey Kong Land series and the GBC port of Donkey Kong Country, ports of the original trilogy were released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003, 2004, and 2005, and a handheld port of Donkey Kong Country Returns was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. Donkey Kong 64 A successful Nintendo 64 sequel to Rare's Donkey Kong Country games was also developed. In Donkey Kong 64, Donkey Kong once again has the starring role as he joins forces with the DK crew to save Donkey Kong Island from destruction at the hands of King K. Rool. The playable characters include Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and the newly introduced Lanky Kong, Tiny Kong and Chunky Kong. Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D platform game in the same vein as Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie; players must navigate 3D environments while collecting Golden Bananas and other items as they advance through the game. It also features multiplayer arena-battle modes for up to four players. Like the Donkey Kong Land titles, this game features a unique banana yellow cartridge, and is only playable with the included Expansion Pak. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat Donkey Kong Jungle Beat was released in Japan in December 2004 and elsewhere in 2005, this platform game used the DK Bongos as a controller; tapping one drum repeatedly made Donkey Kong run, tapping both at the same time made him jump, tapping both alternately made him attack, and clapping or blowing in to the microphone caused an explosion, shown by a ripple in the screen, attracting assorted jewels or clearing obstacles to progress. A New Play Control! remake of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat was released for Wii in Japan on December 11, 2008, and in North America and Europe the following year. The bongo controls were replaced with a more traditional control scheme; players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to control Donkey Kong instead of tapping on the DK Bongos. There were two arcade titles released exclusively in Japan based on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. The first was Donkey Kong Jungle Fever, a medal game released in 2005, and the second was a sequel, Donkey Kong Banana Kingdom (released on November 16, 2006). Both games were developed and published by Capcom on the Triforce arcade system board. Neither title has been released outside Japan. Other gamesRacing games= ;Diddy Kong Racing: Diddy Kong Racing was a 1997 racing game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Rare. It is the first game to spin off from the Donkey Kong Country series. It currently stands as the Nintendo 64's sixth-most best selling game. A racing game like Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong Racing also has a distinctive adventure mode and allows players to choose between three different vehicle types; cars, planes, and hovercrafts. This game notably features the debut of Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel, who appeared later in their own franchise titles. Banjo and Conker were replaced by Dixie Kong and Tiny Kong in Diddy Kong Racing DS, an enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS released in 2007. ;Donkey Kong Barrel Blast: Donkey Kong's first title role on the Wii was released in the form of Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, a racing title originally in development for the GameCube. It was to make use of the DK Bongos peripheral that was introduced alongside Donkey Konga. Due to the declining sales of the GameCube, development shifted to the Wii console where the Bongo control scheme was replaced by motion controls. =Donkey Konga series= The first game in the Donkey Konga series, Donkey Konga, was released for the GameCube in 2004. Created by Namco, this musical rhythm action game relied upon use of the DK Bongos accessory (purchasable separately or included, depending on the package) to hit a beat in time with the tune. The tunes included pop songs and themes from some previous Nintendo games, including the Super Smash Bros. Melee version of the DK Rap. Its sequel, Donkey Konga 2, was released in 2005, and Japan got Donkey Konga 3 exclusively that same year. =Mario vs. Donkey Kong series= Nintendo's first Donkey Kong title for the Game Boy Advance after Rare left was Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a return to the earlier arcade-style games that incorporated many elements from the Game Boy version. While its style was that of other games, the Rare design for Donkey Kong carried over. Donkey Kong, originally a villain, returns to this role in the game: wanting a Mini Mario clockwork toy, he finds that they are sold out at a local toy store. Enraged, he terrifies the Toads at the factory and steals the toys. This sets up the game's plot, where Mario chases Donkey Kong until he can take the Mini Marios back from Donkey Kong. The game was followed by March of the Minis for the Nintendo DS, Minis March Again on DSiWare, Mini-Land Mayhem in 2010 for the DS, Minis on the Move for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013 and Tipping Stars for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2014. =Miscellaneous genres= ;Donkey Kong Circus: Donkey Kong Circus was a Game & Watch Panorama series game released in 1984. In this game, the player controls Donkey Kong, who is placed on a barrel while juggling pineapples and avoiding flames. This game is very similar to Mario the Juggler, the last Game & Watch game, as they both involve a character juggling while avoiding objects. ;Donkey Kong Jr. Math: Donkey Kong Jr. Math was an edutainment game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), wherein players must solve math problems in order to win. It is the only game in the \\"Education Series\\" of NES games in North America. The game features one and two player modes, both of which are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. Donkey Kong Jr. Math was made available in the video game Animal Crossing, along with several other NES titles. It has also been released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America. ;Donkey Kong Hockey: It was developed by Nintendo R&D1; and released in 1985 as part of the Game & Watch Micro Vs. series. The game features one LCD screen and two attached control pads. The hockey features Donkey Kong as one of the players and Mario as the other. DK series ;DK: King of Swing: DK: King of Swing is a puzzle- platform game developed by Paon that features gameplay similar to Clu Clu Land. Here, the player must navigate levels using only the GBA's left and right shoulder buttons. ;DK: Jungle Climber: A sequel to the aforementioned game, DK: Jungle Climber is Donkey Kong's only title role on the Nintendo DS. It features pseudo-3D visuals that more closely resemble the Donkey Kong Country games, dual screen gameplay, and a team-up mechanic with Diddy Kong. Cancelled games ;Return of Donkey Kong: A Nintendo Entertainment System game announced in the Official Nintendo Player's Guide in 1987. Not much is known about the title; whether it was cancelled or a working title for a game released under a different name is unknown. ;Super Donkey: In 2020, a prototype for a platform game featuring similar graphics to the Nintendo game Yoshi's Island was discovered, featuring a new protagonist wearing a pilot suit. The name, Super Donkey, suggests it may have been considered as a new Donkey Kong game before being repurposed for Yoshi. ;Donkey Kong Racing: A demo for a racing game on the GameCube, Nintendo's sixth generation console, was shown at Space World 2001. It showed various characters, including Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, and Taj the Genie of Diddy Kong Racing fame racing on Rambi, Enguarde, Expresso, and Ellie, and Zinger, Necky, Army, and Chomps Jr. that had been introduced in previous Donkey Kong games. Following the sale of Nintendo's 49% stake in Rare to Microsoft in 2002, Rare announced that they were concentrating their efforts on Xbox games. Although they had continued to support Nintendo's portable consoles, the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, the game was cancelled. Rare later reworked the game into Sabreman Stampede, which incorporated a lot of the same ideas without the racing aspect, but was also later cancelled. ;Diddy Kong Pilot: Diddy Kong Pilot was a planned sequel to Diddy Kong Racing, but with flying as the only means of transportation. After Rare was sold to Microsoft, which caused the company to lose the rights to the Donkey Kong characters, Diddy Kong Pilot was converted into the game Banjo-Pilot in 2005. However, on November 5, 2011, a collector who had purchased a prototype cartridge leaked its ROM onto the internet. ;Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers: Donkey Kong Coconut Crackers was a puzzle game for the Game Boy Advance that was being developed by Rare. Similar to Donkey Kong Racing and Diddy Kong Pilot, the game was cancelled in 2002 due to Microsoft's acquisition of Rare. The game was eventually reworked into It's Mr. Pants, and was released on December 7, 2004. ;Diddy Kong Racing Adventure:A rejected pitch made by the Climax Group for a Diddy Kong Racing sequel on the Nintendo GameCube around 2004. The project was never announced to the public in any capacity and only became known after an amateur video game archivist acquired the prototype and published a video about it in November 2016. Spin-offs ;Mario franchise:After appearing in the original Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr., Mario starred in the Mario franchise, beginning with the arcade game Mario Bros. and resulting in the Super Mario series—becoming Nintendo's mascot in the process. The Super Mario series had its own spin-offs, including Mario Kart and Mario Party. Donkey Kong appears as a playable character in the vast majority of these spin-offs. The roots of the Mario franchise in Donkey Kong are further acknowledged in Super Mario Odyssey, with many elements of the DK franchise featured in the New Donk City level. DK and Diddy have their own Amiibo figures as part of the Super Mario line. ;Banjo-Kazooie series: Following his appearance in Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo went on to star in Banjo- Kazooie, leading to the Banjo-Kazooie series. Although originally owned by Nintendo, Microsoft is the current owner of the Banjo-Kazooie series due to their acquisition of Rare in 2002. ;Conker series: Following his appearance in Diddy Kong Racing, Conker the Squirrel went on to star in Conker's Pocket Tales, leading to the Conker series. Unlike Banjo, Conker was never under the ownership of Nintendo. Crossovers ;Mario Kart series: The Donkey Kong series has been represented in every game of the Mario Kart series. Donkey Kong appears racing alongside characters from the Super Mario, Pac-Man, Tamagotchi, The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing and Splatoon franchises. The first character from the Donkey Kong series to appear as a playable character in the Mario Kart series was Donkey Kong Jr. in Super Mario Kart. The adult Donkey Kong first appears in Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart Tour, Funky Kong appears in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart Tour, and Dixie Kong appears in Mario Kart Tour. Additionally, the Mario Kart series features several Donkey Kong themed tracks, most notably DK Jungle from Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart 8, which is based on the world of Donkey Kong Country Returns. ;Mario Party series:In the Mario Party series, Donkey Kong debuted as a playable character in Mario Party for the Nintendo 64, a role he kept until Mario Party 5. Here, he was given a space on the board maps as a foil to Bowser. He returned as a playable character in Mario Party 10 for the Wii U and Mario Party: Star Rush for the Nintendo 3DS. Diddy Kong makes cameo appearances in Mario Party DS and Mario Party 9, and is an unlockable character in Mario Party: Star Rush and Super Mario Party. ;Mario sports series: Donkey Kong has appeared as a playable character in almost every game of the Mario sports series since the Nintendo 64 era, including Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, Super Mario Strikers, and Mario Superstar Baseball. The first character from the Donkey Kong series that appear as a playable character in the Mario sports series was Donkey Kong Jr. in Mario's Tennis. Diddy Kong is also featured as a playable character in many titles, while additional characters from the Donkey Kong series, such as Dixie Kong, Funky Kong, Tiny Kong, Baby Donkey Kong, but also Kritter and King K. Rool, have made sporadic appearances. Donkey Kong appears as playable character in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games and every game in the Mario & Sonic series thereafter. Diddy Kong was introduced to the series in Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. ;Super Smash Bros. series: Donkey Kong has appeared as a playable character in every game of the Super Smash Bros. series first appearing as one of eight characters in the original Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. He was the first heavy fighter in the series, and featured many slow but powerful attacks. Diddy Kong was later introduced as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as an agile fighter. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, King K. Rool was introduced as a playable character, bringing with him an arsenal of his attacks from the Donkey Kong Country and Land series. Banjo and Kazooie were revealed as part of the first Fighter Pass for Ultimate in 2019 in a trailer set at Donkey Kong's treehouse, acknowledging Banjo's origins in the Kongs' world. Other characters, like Cranky Kong and Dixie Kong, have appeared throughout the series as collectible trophies. There have been many stages based on games in the Donkey Kong series, including Congo (Kongo) Jungle in Super Smash Bros., Kongo Jungle and Jungle Japes in Super Smash Bros. Melee, Rumble Falls and 75m in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Jungle Hijinx in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Kongo Jungle from Super Smash Bros. Melee, renamed Kongo Falls, returns in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, along with the N64 Kongo Jungle, Jungle Japes, and 75m.  Other media = Television series  The Saturday Supercade was the character's first role in a television series. In it, Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales) has escaped from the circus and Mario (voiced by Peter Cullen) and Pauline (voiced by Judy Strangis) are chasing the ape. As with the original game, Donkey Kong will often grab Pauline, and Mario has to save her. The Donkey Kong Country television series was developed based on game of the same name. Airing in France in 1997 and in the US in 1998, the series lasted two seasons with 40 total episodes featuring exclusive characters including Bluster Kong, Eddie the Mean Old Yeti and Kaptain Scurvy. The Planet of Donkey Kong, later DKTV.cool was broadcast in France from September 4, 1996 to September 1, 2001. It was presented by Mélanie Angélie and Donkey Kong, voiced by Nicolas Bienvenu. After the departure of Angélie, the program continued without a host and was renamed DKTV.cool on July 1, 2000. The show had several variations, especially during the summer, including \\"Diddy's Holidays\\", airing on Saturdays and Sundays around 7 am during the summer of 1997, and \\"Donkey Kong Beach\\" at 9:30 on Saturday mornings in the same year.  Film  A 2007 documentary, The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, chronicled the competitive following for the arcade version of Donkey Kong. The original arcade iteration of Donkey Kong is the final villain of the 2015 film Pixels.  Reception = Critical response  The Donkey Kong series has received a positive critical reception. Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Country are frequently cited as two of the best video games of all time; the former for its impact on the golden age of arcade video games, and the latter for its \\"groundbreaking\\" usage of pre-rendered 3D graphics and atmospheric music. Maxim included Donkey Kong Country at number 14 on their list of 'The 30 Best Video Game Franchises of All Time,' describing the series as \\"some of the best platforming games on Nintendo’s consoles.\\" In the 2017 book the 100 Greatest Video Game Franchises, Donkey Kong was characterized as \\"a symbol, representing both the timelessness and timeliness of video games.\\"  Impact and legacy  After the first Donkey Kong was released, Universal Studios sued Nintendo, alleging that the video game was a trademark infringement of King Kong, the plot and characters of which Universal claimed for their own. In the case, Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd., a United States District Court ruled that Universal had acted in bad faith, and that it had no right over the name King Kong or the characters and story. The court further held that there was no possibility for consumers to confuse Nintendo's game and characters with the King Kong films and their characters. The case was an enormous victory for Nintendo, which was still a newcomer to the U.S. market. The case established the company as a major player in the industry and arguably gave the company the confidence that it could compete with the giants of American media. The success of the Donkey Kong series has resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series with seven world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. The records include: \\"First Use of Visual Storytelling in a Video Game\\" for the rudimentary cut scenes featured in the original Donkey Kong arcade game, and \\"Most Collectible Items in a Platform Game\\" for Donkey Kong 64. \\"It's on like Donkey Kong\\" is an expression used in pop culture that is inspired by the game. Nintendo requested a trademark on the phrase with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in November 2010.The Application for trademark was filed on 11/09/2010, the serial number is 85173084. The original game was the focus of the 2007 documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. In 2007, the USHRA Monster Jam racing series licensed Donkey Kong's appearance for a monster truck. The truck is driven by Frank Krmel, and is owned by Feld Motorsports. The truck is decorated to look like the character and has Donkey Kong's tie on the front. The truck made its debut in the Monster Jam event at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US on December 8, 2007. It went to the Monster Jam World Finals 9, as well as World Finals 10, where it was the fastest qualifier.

The Supreme Court found that for the purposes of section 91(24), Inuit should be considered Indians. Background The case arose due to controversy as to whether Inuit in Quebec were under federal or provincial jurisdiction. The Supreme Court noted that when the British North America Act was originally adopted, there were \\"few, if any\\" Inuit in Canada, which was then a much smaller country. However, the Constitution always left open the possibility of joining Canada with other lands, and thus the Inuit in Rupert's Land were now within Quebec's borders. The federal government at the time of this case did not want to take responsibility over the Inuit. It argued that the term \\"Indians\\" as defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 would not include the Inuit, and that this document could be used to help interpret the British North America Act. Decision=Duff Chief Justice Lyman P. Duff, in his opinion, consulted what he believed to be \\"the most authoritative\\" evidence, namely evidence from the Hudson's Bay Company which governed Rupert's Land. A British House of Commons committee examined how the company dealt with the Inuit in 1856 and 1857. The Hudson's Bay Company prepared a report for the committee, and as Duff noted, the report referred to Inuit as a type of \\"Indian.\\" Later, after the British North America Act was adopted, the Parliament of Canada declared in December 1867 that if it gained jurisdiction over Rupert's Land, it would take responsibility for the Indians there. In 1870, the territories were awarded to Canada. Duff then added that the Inuit of Labrador, as well, had been widely referred to as Indians from around 1760 and were when the British North America Act was adopted. Official records from 1762 called Inuit \\"savages\\", and Duff compared this to how Indian tribes such as the Montagnais and Huron were called savages. In 1869, a judge from the Court of Labrador prepared a report for the Governor of Newfoundland which referred to \\"Esquimaux\\" (Inuit) as a type of Indian. Duff also found some missionaries referred to Inuit as Indians. In this context, Duff found it important that in 1879, Sir John A. Macdonald, one of the chief negotiators of the British North America Act and Prime Minister of Canada, discussed the Inuit with Sir Hector Langevin, and the discussion referenced the Inuit as Indians. As defined by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Indians are \\"the several nations or tribes of Indian with whom We are connected and who lived under Our protection.\\" The federal government argued this would not include the Inuit, as the words \\"nations\\" and \\"tribes\\" were not used to describe Inuit communities. However, Duff found evidence contradicting this. Duff also said the Inuit under the Hudson's Bay Company to an extent lived under the \\"protection\\" of the Crown, \\"under either charter or license from the Crown.\\" Duff also doubted that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 could guide interpretation of the British North America Act. Justices Albert Hudson and Henry Hague Davis each wrote brief opinions concurring with Duff. Cannon Justice Cannon wrote his own opinion finding the Inuit should be considered Indians. He noted the report by Sir George Simpson in 1857 calling Inuit Indians. Cannon then concluded, \\"the report of the Committee must have been known to the Legislature at Westminster in 1867.\\" He also pointed to the Quebec Conference of 1864, in which Resolution 29(29) of the Quebec Resolutions declaring the (Federal) Parliament should govern \\"Indians and Lands reserved for the Indians,\\" in which the latter term was translated into French as \\"Les Sauvages et les terres réservées pour les Sauvages.\\" This meant all natives in British North America, including Newfoundland. Kerwin Justice Patrick Kerwin also wrote an opinion finding that Inuit were Indians. He felt the British North America Act, in referring to Indians, was intended to mean Aboriginals. He noted evidence that Samuel de Champlain, missionaries and others classified Indians as \\"sauvages\\" and Inuit as \\"sauvages esquimaux.\\" Books which Kerwin speculated that the Fathers of Confederation and the British Parliament in 1867 might have seen also used this classification. Editions of Webster's Dictionary from 1913 and the 1920s did not count the Inuit as Indians, but earlier dictionaries did. Crocket Justice Oswald Smith Crocket wrote an opinion briefly concurring with Justices Cannon and Kerwin.

The station was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1903 during a track depression to serve Newark's Roseville neighborhood. It once had two tracks (one each eastbound and westbound) on the Lackawanna mainline and two low-wall platforms, with an additional platform along the Montclair Branch. The station remained in service during most of the 20th century, until New Jersey Transit closed the station on September 16, 1984. Today, the only landmarks that mark the former station site are a metal utility box labeled \\"Roseville,\\" and several flights of concrete stairs in the sides of the concrete-lined depression in which the track of the Morristown Line runs between the East Orange and Newark Broad Street stations. Shortly east of this structure, the Montclair-Boonton Line splits from the Morristown Line on its way to Montclair, Boonton, and Denville.  Station structure  Roseville Avenue station consisted of two different sets of double track to serve passenger trains for the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad's Montclair Branch (now the Montclair-Boonton Line) and the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad's Morris & Essex Lines (now the Morristown Line and the Gladstone Branch). The tracks were below the street level, and the station below street level was a brick passenger station extending to the Roseville Avenue bridge at Seventh Avenue. The other structure stood on street level, above the cut, served the Morris and Essex Line just north of the fork at Roseville. The station had four platforms, two for the Montclair Branch and two for the Morristown/Gladstone Lines in both direction. Roseville Tower was the interlocking tower at street-level in Roseville that handled the nearby fork of the three lines (Montclair, Morristown and Gladstone). The tower was used on limited services, with only three different shifts, two of which were manned. The tower was run from 5 a.m. in the morning to 10 p.m. in the evening manned. The rest of the time, the tower was set on automatic.  History = Original station and track depression  Roseville Avenue station before the track depressing in the 1890s The original Roseville Avenue station dates back to the opening of the Morris & Essex Railroad Station in 1856, when tracks were constructed through the Roseville district of Newark. These tracks ran between Orange Street and Seventh Avenue, until the Morris & Essex line branched off at Roseville Avenue and continued northwest, the original station serving both branches. The station was designed with two platforms, one along each line, the Morris & Essex first made use of the Montclair Branch property in April 1868 after buying the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad. In April 1901, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad announced track depression and raising throughout portions of the line through Newark and the Oranges. Although the depression went into Newark, most of the debate over localities of stations was basically into the Oranges. In 1903, the track depression reached the Roseville Avenue Station, and the lines were depressed through Roseville. The new station built during the track depression was of similar style, with the station in the middle of the five-track interlocking, with one platform servicing the Montclair Branch's two tracks and one for the Main Line's two tracks. Rather than crossing at-grade, Roseville Avenue was bridged over the tracks with a brand new street-level interlocking tower present at the intersection of Roseville and Seventh Avenues.  Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, and Erie–Lackawanna ownership  An Erie-Lackawanna train at Roseville Avenue in 1969 During the ownership of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, Roseville Avenue prospered, soon receiving sixty-eight stops by trains daily. This caught attention during a 1913 complaint to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by Charles McCausland. The major complaint from McCausland cited that the Lackawanna was not providing quality seating service on trains that stop at Roseville, and several which led to overcrowding, while several bypassing trains did not suffer from such effects. The plaintiff, McCausland, cited that the need for the sixty-eight trains was \\"additional but unnecessary\\". The Board of Public Utility Commissioners did not justify any changes or wrongdoing by the railroad, and as a result, no changes to service were made at Roseville Avenue. The station continued receiving major service over the next five decades, but by 1966, fewer trains stopped at the station, with limited daily service to the station past the 4:33 p.m. train from Hoboken Terminal. Six years later, on June 24, 1972, the Erie–Lackawanna Railroad, who now maintained the station, announced further cutbacks on station service, axing twenty-three train stops at Roseville Avenue for both directions of service. The changes were made as part of major commuter service appropriations and the lack of patronage at the station. From that point, Roseville Avenue went from 37 westbound trains to 14, while eastbound was cut from 37 to 16. Service on Saturdays were cut to flag stops only, while the station received no Sunday service at all. On April 1, 1976, the Erie–Lackawanna Railroad became defunct, and merged into Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), with service sponsored by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.  New Jersey Transit use and eventual closure  Roseville Avenue's former Montclair Branch platforms in September 2014, 30 years after closing After the takeover of service along the former Morris & Essex Lines by New Jersey Transit from Conrail in 1982, the service at the Roseville Avenue station remained minimal. Many trains bypassed the station in favor of going to the nearby Newark Broad Street Station. Trains continued to serve the Roseville Avenue station throughout 1982 and 1983, and service continued to be condensed during 1984. However, as of the official September 1984 timetables, service was cut from Roseville Avenue in favor of Newark Broad Street to Grove Street, East Orange (on the Morris & Essex) or Ampere (on the Montclair Branch), both of which closed in April 1991. On September 16, 1984, trains began bypassing Roseville Avenue, and the station was closed permanently. Although the station was closed, Roseville Tower, for the interlocking between the Montclair Branch and Morris & Essex Lines, remained in service for almost two more decades. In 2002, during construction of the Montclair Connection, the tower was demolished in favor of expanding the cut in Roseville for a second track of the new Montclair-Boonton Line.

She was named for Irving Wiltsie. The destroyer entered service in 1946 and remained active with the United States Navy until 1977, when Wiltsie was decommissioned and sold to Pakistan in 1977. The vessel entered service with the Pakistan Navy as PNS Tariq (D165) in 1978. In 1990, the ship was renamed PNS Nazim to allow the name Tariq to be given to a newly-acquired Type 21 frigate. The ship was then transferred to the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency and used as an alongside \\"at sea\\" headquarters for the agency. Though afloat, the vessel no longer sails. Service history Wiltsie was laid down on 13 March 1945 at Port Newark, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. The destroyer was launched on 31 August 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Irving D. Wiltsie, the widow of Captain Wiltsie. The vessel was commissioned on 12 January 1946 at the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, Commander Raymond D. Fusselman in command. 1946–1950 Following a shakedown cruise which took the ship to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Wiltsie transited the Panama Canal on 8 July 1946 and proceeded to San Diego, California. She spent the fall and winter of 1946 engaged in training exercises before departing the west coast on 6 January 1947, bound for the Far East. She subsequently operated out of Tsingtao, China, on exercises and maneuvers while standing by the American community in that port during rising local tensions between the communist and Nationalist Chinese. Wiltsie remained at Tsingtao until June 1947, when she shifted to Sasebo, Japan, for occupation duty. Departing Sasebo on 8 March 1948, the destroyer proceeded to Bremerton, Washington, for an overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. After training off the west coast, Wiltsie sailed once more for the Far East, departing San Diego on 1 October. Late that autumn, she again operated out of Tsingtao during the evacuation of Americans from that port to Yokohama because of the Chinese Civil War then raging. During this period, Wiltsie briefly visited Hong Kong and Okinawa before returning to Tsingtao. Chinese Communist forces rolled southward, and Nanking fell in April 1949. Wiltsie arrived at Shanghai on 22 April, to stand by during the evacuation of all foreign nationals from the city. Over the ensuing days, Wiltsie watched a veritable parade of merchant vessels of many nationalities—Chinese, Dutch, Norwegian, French, Danish, British, and American—as well as American, British, and Chinese naval vessels. On 5 May 1949, 20 days before the fall of the city to the communists, Wiltsie departed Chinese waters for the last time, bound for Buckner Bay, Okinawa. From there, Wiltsie soon headed homeward and made port at San Diego on 4 June 1949. She later moved up the coast; embarked NROTC midshipmen at Treasure Island, near San Francisco, California on 1 August; and departed the following day for a training cruise to Balboa, Panama, and the Galápagos Islands. Returning to San Diego on 31 August, the destroyer soon sailed for Hawaii, where she participated in Operation \\"Miki\\", a mock invasion of the Hawaiian Islands in which Army, Navy, and Air Force units all took part. Returning to the west coast soon afterwards, Wiltsie spent the period from December 1949 to April 1950 at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, undergoing an overhaul. 1950–1953 (Korean War) In July 1950, Wiltsie sailed for the Far East to augment the American naval presence in Korean waters. On the evening of 16 August, , with four landing ship tanks (LSTs) and escorting destroyers, closed the coast. Captain J. R. Clark, Commander, Destroyer Division 111, embarked in the recently arrived Wiltsie, assumed direction of the embarkation operation for the Republic of Korea (ROK) troops. He ordered the four LSTs to beach at a pre-arranged site, guided in by jeep headlights from shore. Before sunrise the next day, 327 officers and 3,480 soldiers of the 3rd ROK Division, 1,260 civilians, and 100 vehicles had been loaded. American forces went ashore at Inchon on 15 September 1950. Wiltsie participated in one phase of this assault, screening the fast aircraft carriers of Task Force 77 (TF 77)— , , and —as their aircraft hit enemy ground targets to support the advance of troops ashore. For the remainder of the deployment, Wiltsie supported United Nations troops ashore with call-fire support; screened TF 77 as it conducted air strikes against supply lines and troop concentrations; and patrolled in the Taiwan Strait. Wiltsie returned to San Diego in March 1951, underwent repairs at Long Beach, California and subsequently departed the west coast for her fourth tour of duty in the Far East. In Korean waters, she resumed her screening, call-fire, and interdiction duties. Highlighting her blockading activities of Wonsan, Wiltsie fired retaliatory gunfire missions against enemy shore batteries. Wiltsie returned to the west coast late in 1952, but soon found herself back in the Far East for her third Korean War deployment. After leaving the west coast on 2 January 1953, the destroyer patrolled the Formosa Strait for a time and operated off the North Korean coast before shifting to Wonsan. The Navy continued it operations to support UN ground troops, interdicted enemy supply lines by air and by surface gunfire, and blockaded the enemy's coasts. Eight days after Wiltsie and had destroyed a train near Tanchon on 3 June, enemy shore batteries took Wiltsie under fire off Wonsan, lobbing 45 shells in her direction, scoring a hit on the destroyer's fantail. The ship suffered no casualties and soon resumed her local patrol operations. On 15 June, Wiltsie evacuated 13 Korean civilians from Yo-do Island to Sokcho-ri. While preparing to abandon the Wonsan siege in accordance with the armistice stipulations, Wiltsie screened minesweeping operations and joined in the last-minute shelling of enemy ground targets. In company with and , Wiltsie shelled targets at Wonsan until a few minutes before the 2200 deadline. On 27 July 1953, the Korean armistice finally came into effect. However, Wiltsie remained in Korean waters, screening the continuing minesweeping operations between Hungnam and Wonsan until 6 August 1953. 1953–1961 Wiltsie conducted seven Western Pacific deployments between 1953 and 1961. During each tour, she carried out training and patrol assignments in Far Eastern waters, operating off the coasts of Japan, Korea, and Okinawa; visiting such ports as Yokosuka, Kobe, and Sasebo, Japan; Hong Kong; and Philippine ports such as Olongapo and Manila. Also during this time, she plane-guarded for fast carrier task forces, patrolled the Taiwan Strait, and undertook antisubmarine warfare and gunnery training exercises. Between deployments to WestPac and the Far East, Wiltsie underwent regular overhaul and repair periods at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. In addition, she conducted an NROTC midshipman training cruise; visited Seattle, Washington, and Esquimalt, British Columbia; and visited Melbourne, Australia, in May 1959 to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. 1961–1964 In November 1961, Wiltsie began a 10-month scheduled overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Pearl Harbor, in which she underwent Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) alterations. She received an enclosed bridge; a helicopter hangar and landing platform; triple- mounted Mk. 32 torpedo tubes; an ASROC launcher; and late model radar and sonar. She also received many improvements in accommodations for both officers and enlisted men. Following this \\"face lift\\", Wiltsie conducted refresher training and upkeep before becoming flagship of DesDiv 72, home-ported in San Diego. Following sonar calibrations at Puget Sound, Wiltsie spent one week off southern California, participating in exercises. After the conclusion of this maneuver, Wiltsie departed the west coast for the Far East, leaving San Diego on 18 May 1963. Arriving at Yokosuka on 6 June, via Pearl Harbor and Midway, Wiltsie soon got underway for a 30-day Taiwan Strait mission. During this time, she visited Keelung and Kaohsiung, Formosa. Her scheduled rest period at Hong Kong at the end of the assignment had to be cancelled because of a typhoon. Returning to Yokosuka for upkeep on 30 July, Wiltsie departed in early August for participation in Exercise \\"Tire Iron.\\" Wiltsie subsequently operated out of Sasebo and Yokosuka into the fall of 1963; she departed Sasebo on 29 October and operated briefly with TG 77.6 until 10 November, when she was detached to return home. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, the destroyer made port at San Diego on 24 November. In January 1964, Wiltsie joined , Theodore E. Chandler, and in anti-aircraft warfare exercises off the west coast and served as a plane guard for the carrier. She subsequently moved westward to the middle Pacific with Ticonderoga and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 18 February. After completing her exercises in Hawaiian waters, she returned to the west coast in the spring and participated in anti-submarine and anti-air warfare training with and . In June, Wiltsie embarked midshipmen for a six- week training program and later underwent ten days of hull repairs at Long Beach. Later in the month, she participated in exercises in support of Marine Corps units engaged in night reconnaissance and in amphibious and paratroop landing training at San Clemente Island and at Camp Del Mar, California. Drydocked during August and September for hull and sonar dome repair, Wiltsie put to sea soon afterwards for tests and trials of her DASH (drone antisubmarine helicopter) qualification system which ended successfully on 3 November. The destroyer subsequently participated in Operation \\"Union Square\\", an extensive fleet exercise, before returning to San Diego to prepare for the ship's 14th WestPac deployment. 1965–1969 Wiltsie sailed for the western Pacific on 5 January 1965, in company with the 16 other ships of Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 7. Wiltsie was diverted to duty with Coral Sea and during bombing raids on Viet Cong positions in South Vietnam in February. The destroyer spent 69 of her next 80 days at sea in Vietnamese waters. She served in a variety of roles, including antisubmarine warfare screening ship, plane guard destroyer, and early warning picket ship. In March, before proceeding to Hong Kong, she shadowed a Russian intelligence ship which was gathering information on American task groups. Wiltsie again sailed for Vietnam and operated with TG 71.1 on Operation Market Time, engaged in patrolling the South Vietnamese coastline. In May and June, Wiltsie conducted several gunfire support missions against Viet Cong supply depots and troop concentrations in South Vietnam. During this deployment, Wiltsie transferred of stores from by the vertical replenishment method. Following a visit to Japan in mid-June, Wiltsie returned to the United States, arriving at San Diego on 2 July. Wiltsie next underwent a period of repairs and refresher training which carried over into 1966. After taking part in training evolutions off the west coast in the spring, Wiltsie again headed for the Orient on 4 June 1966. While at Guam for a refueling stop, the destroyer suffered slight damage on 22 June when a fuel barge collided with the ship, necessitating repairs which delayed her for 15 hours. On 2 July, Wiltsie commenced duty with TU 70.8.9, a naval gunfire support unit. After a brief period of upkeep, Wiltsie proceeded to the northern search and rescue (SAR) station, approximately east of the North Vietnamese port of Haiphong, to stand by with Towers ready to recover downed airmen. For two periods—from 31 July to 2 September and from 28 September to 1 November, Wiltsie patrolled the northern search and rescue (SAR) station. In August and again in October, the destroyer participated in rescues from the waters off the North Vietnamese coast, saving a total of nine men. The ship acted as a refueling vessel for units of Helicopter Squadron 6. Upon completion of these SAR duties, Wiltsie prepared for her homeward voyage. She called at the port of Hualien, Taiwan, on 4 November, for a five-day visit. She departed Nationalist Chinese waters on 10 November, made a fuel stop at Okinawa the next day, and arrived at Yokosuka on 14 November. Wiltsie joined TG 77.8, based around , and stood out of Yokosuka on 22 November, bound for the west coast. Three days out, the task group ran into bad weather. High winds prevailed for five days, and all ships suffered moderate storm damage. The heavy seas battered open a seam forward in Wiltsie; caused three cracks in the fantail area of the main deck and the loss of two ladders; and ripped two holes in the port bow of the motor whaleboat. An underway replenishment with on the evening of 29 November turned out to be a difficult affair. Only after three separate approaches, seven fuel hose separations, and seven hours alongside was the fueling completed. The ship remained blackened by oil on parts of her superstructure and hull sides until after she arrived at San Diego on 3 December. Wiltsie moored at San Diego for upkeep which would last into the new year, 1967. Following operations off the southern California coast, Wiltsie departed San Diego on 19 September 1967. After stopovers at Pearl Harbor and Guam, the destroyer arrived at Subic Bay on 11 October. Shifting to Da Nang, South Vietnam, soon afterwards, Wiltsie moved to the northern SAR station on 21 October and shifted to the southern SAR station five days later. Typhoon \\"Emma\\" forced the ship to sortie from Tonkin Gulf on 5 November, before the storm abated enough to allow the ship to resume her operations on 7 November. During this tour, she assisted in the search for two men lost overboard from . and also took part, but high seas and strong winds hampered search operations and prevented any of the ships from sighting the men. On 13 November, Wiltsie relieved on the northern SAR station, only to be relieved in turn by . After rest and relaxation at Hong Kong, an upkeep alongside , and an in-port period at Subic Bay, Wiltsie returned to the SAR station in Tonkin Gulf, operating in company with King. During this second deployment, Wiltsie participated in six rescues involving 10 men. The first took place at 1420 on 22 December, when an A-7 Corsair II aircraft from VA-147 went down at a position some northwest of King. An intensive search failed to locate the downed plane's pilot, and all search aircraft were vectored back to their base. Wiltsie refueled a helicopter during this period when the chopper approached the ship low on fuel. The Christmas cease-fire which went into effect on 25 December resulted in only photo-reconnaissance flights being run against North Vietnam; no SAR opportunities were thus presented to Wiltsie and King until 29 December, when an F-4 Phantom aircraft of VF-161 (Coral Sea) crashed from the northern SAR station among some islands off the coast near Haiphong. King guided a helicopter to the scene and it picked up both pilots—cold but well—and returned them to their carrier, Coral Sea. Monsoons limited air action over the last few days of 1967 and the first few days of 1968. Two Oriskany planes went down on 10 January 1968; Wiltsie provided communications relays where necessary and closely plotted aircraft positions, while King assumed air control function and direction. The latter's UH-2 helicopter picked up two pilots from one of the planes while a logistics helicopter plucked the crewman of the second plane from the water. Later in the day, King picked up two more downed pilots, giving her a total of four for the day. After being relieved by and , King sailed to Subic Bay and Wiltsie to Hong Kong before she, too, headed for Subic Bay, where she arrived on 23 January. Three days later, while at Subic Bay, Wiltsie received word of the capture of the American intelligence-gathering vessel . On the following day, Wiltsie and King sailed for SAR station to relieve De Haven and Reeves a day early. When the SAR station was shifted south, Wiltsie, King, and the PIRAZ station ship conducted joint patrols in the heavy weather hanging over the station. Wiltsies SAR tour was largely uneventful, as monsoon activity curtailed American air strikes over the north, and no opportunities presented themselves to pick up airmen. Relieved by on station on 17 February, Wiltsie sailed to Subic Bay where she offloaded part of her ammunition in preparation for the cruise home. Departing there on 22 February in company with Buck and King, Wiltsie and her consorts made a fuel stop at Darwin and visited Brisbane from 2 to 7 March before proceeding on to the west coast of the United States. Following stops at Pago Pago, American Samoa, and Pearl Harbor, for fuel, Wiltsie moored at San Diego on 23 March and remained there into May. On 22 May, she became school ship for an engineering officers' course and performed this duty until 9 June Assigned plane guard duties for Hancock during that ship's carrier qualification evolution from 10 to 22 June, Wiltsie put her own motor whaleboat in the water on one occasion when one of the carrier's F-8 Crusader aircraft went into the water immediately after takeoff. However, Hancocks rescue helicopter effected the rescue before the destroyer's boat arrived. On 26 June, Wiltsie sailed for San Francisco Bay to undergo an overhaul at the naval shipyard at Vallejo, California. Emerging from the yard on 6 November, Wiltsie spent the remainder of 1968 in refresher training which continued into the spring of 1969. Departing San Diego on 16 April 1969, in company with the remainder of DesDiv 72—Buck, , and —Wiltsie participated in type training evolutions with Oriskany before arriving at Pearl Harbor on 24 April. Underway again soon afterwards, bound for the ship's WestPac deployment, Wiltsie refueled at Midway, steamed on picket station ahead of Oriskany, and arrived at Subic Bay on 10 May. Underway for Yankee Station soon afterwards, Wiltsie arrived there on 16 May and was soon shuffled between three carriers—Oriskany, , and Ticonderoga—within a 24-hour span, serving successively as plane guard for each. Returning to Subic Bay in company with Ticonderoga on 20 May, Wiltsie underwent a tender upkeep alongside Klondike before being shifted to Sasebo, Japan. At Sasebo from 29 May to 6 June, Wiltsie then deployed to Yankee Station to provide \\"shotgun\\" services for . When Wiltsies evaporators broke down on the 10th, the destroyer was relieved by and headed back to Sasebo for repairs. She subsequently operated in the Sea of Japan escorting for three weeks before returning to Sasebo on 13 July. Eleven days later, the destroyer departed Japanese waters, bound for the Vietnam war zone. Wiltsie provided plane guard services for Bonhomme Richard until detached to join and on the south SAR station. After conducting anti- submarine warfare exercises en route, Wiltsie spent from 7 to 10 August on south SAR before deploying to the PIRAZ station with King on 10, 11, and 12 August. Returning to south SAR the next day, she remained at sea there for the remainder of August. Witsie, foreground, being replenished with off Vietnam in 1969 After rejoining Bonhomme Richard, Wiltsie escorted the carrier to Sasebo, Japan, from 2 to 4 September. Following a period of upkeep and recreation there, the destroyer visited Hong Kong en route to her final commitment in the Vietnam War zone. She was deployed on Yankee Station for the remainder of September, and the destroyer then shifted to Subic Bay. There, she prepared for a gunnery exercise and proceeded to sea on 10 October for operations with and . On that day, Wiltsie participated in sinking the after section of the hull of , the destroyer that had been cut in two during a collision with Australian aircraft carrier the previous 3 June. Rendezvousing with Bonhomme Richard soon afterwards, Wiltsie and the carrier steamed to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 15 October. Two days later, with ComDesDiv 72 embarked, Wiltsie got underway with the remainder of her division to escort Bonhomme Richard back to the United States and arrived at San Diego at the end of a fortnight's voyage. For the remainder of 1969, the destroyer remained in her home port. Wiltsie conducted an ASW training operation early in January 1970 and returned to San Diego on 8 January. Between that day and 15 April, Wiltsie remained in port. During this time, she suffered hull damage while moored alongside John W. Thomason. \\"Exceptionally high winds\\" buffeted the ships together when a mooring camel between the two ships overturned, opening riveted seams in Wiltsies hull. On 13 March 1970, Wiltsie was drydocked at the San Diego Marine and Shipbuilding Co. and was under repairs there until 7 April. 1970–1977 After operating locally out of San Diego into the summer, Wiltsie departed her home port on 27 July 1970. Following stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam, she arrived at Subic Bay on 18 August. There, she took on additional .50-caliber machine guns and flak jackets before getting underway on 21 August for the Gulf of Tonkin. Relieving three days later as picket for on TF 77's northern SAR/PIRAZ station, Wiltsie operated on station until 9 September. During that assignment, the ship provided in-flight refueling services to ship and shore-based helicopters standing ready to rescue downed aircrews. Although the ship originally headed for Kaohsiung for upkeep, the track of Typhoon Georgia resulted in a re-routing to Subic Bay. Departing Luzon on 18 September, Wiltsie sailed for regions II and III of South Vietnam to perform 22 days of gunfire support duty to assist operations of the United States 1st Air Cavalry Division; the 1st Australian Task Force, South; and an ARVN battalion. During the deployment on the \\"gun line\\"—her first since 1967—Wiltsie fired 3,365 rounds of 5-inch ammunition before she departed the station on 11 October and headed for Taiwan for rest and recreation at Keelung. While there, Wiltsie was preparing to move on to Japan when urgent orders arrived on the evening of 19 October to report back to the \\"gun line.\\" Typhoon \\"Joan\\" had damaged another destroyer severely enough to limit her ability to fight, so Wiltsie was substituted. Arriving at her station in the Gulf of Thailand on the morning of 23 October, Wiltsie supported the ARVN 21st Division with gunfire, shelling communist troop concentrations, gun positions, and supply lines for five days, expending 485 rounds of 5-inch projectiles. Refueling and rearming from on 29 October, Wiltsie headed north, for Japan, sidestepping Typhoon \\"Kate\\" en route. She reduced her speed to in the worsening weather conditions before putting into Buckner Bay, Okinawa, to refuel on 2 November before again setting out for Sasebo. The next morning, while underway and approaching the coast of Kyushu, a sailor was swept over the side. Wiltsie, joined by Richard B. Anderson, and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force vessels Asagunmo, Makiguma, and Hic- kugo, conducted a day-long search for her missing sailor but came away empty- handed. A few days later, his body was discovered washed up on a nearby island. Later departing Sasebo on 6 November, she served as screen for King as a Peacetime Aerial Reconnaissance Program (PARPRO) picket in the Sea of Japan from the 8th to the 10th, before returning to Sasebo. Shifting to Korean waters for a port visit to Pusan, South Korea, from 27 to 30 November, and replenishing at Sasebo, Wiltsie served a second tour as PARPRO picket ship for from 30 November to 6 December. Subsequently, returning again to Sasebo to replenish, Wiltsie refueled at Keelung and spent Christmas at Hong Kong before shifting to the Philippines where she spent the remainder of 1970. Early in 1971, the destroyer returned to Vietnamese coastal waters to render gunfire support for South Vietnamese army units between 4 and 18 January 1971. Returning to Subic Bay, she offloaded the special equipment taken on board for the \\"gunline\\" deployments—flak jackets, .50-caliber machine guns (for use against possible sappers or small boats), and \\"pool radio equipment\\"—and departed the Philippines on 20 January, bound for the United States. After stopping en route at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, Wiltsie arrived at San Diego on 11 February. During the ensuing year, Wiltsie remained on the coast of southern California, for the most part at San Diego. In March and April, she served plane guard duty for Oriskany and ; and, in June, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which lasted until mid-November 1971. On 19 February 1972, the destroyer was notified that, effective 1 July, she would be assigned to the Naval Reserve Force and based at San Francisco for training duty. While she was in the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard preparing for her new role, however, she received word on 22 May that—instead of beginning reserve duty in July—she would head back to the Far East for her 19th deployment in the western Pacific. On 25 July, Wiltsie sailed for the Orient in company with and and touched at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam before arriving at Subic Bay on 16 August. Undergoing four days of upkeep and repairs alongside , Wiltsie prepared for another \\"gun line\\" mission off the Vietnamese coast. The destroyer loaded the extra equipment necessary for her specialized support role—flak jackets for exposed personnel, .50-caliber machine guns, and special radio equipment for contacting shore units calling for gunfire support. Wiltsie departed Subic Bay on 21 August. On 23 August, Wiltsie became part of TG 75.9, operating off the Northern Military Region I. While providing gunfire support for Operation \\"Lam Son 72\\", the destroyer fired some 1,803 rounds of 5-inch shells to support the ARVN 147th Brigade in efforts to destroy enemy forces in their area. Typhoon \\"Elsie\\", which was approaching near the DMZ, temporarily suspended Wiltsies gunfire support operations while she sidestepped the tropical disturbance by moving to safer waters. Resuming her operations after three days of typhoon evasion, Wiltsie returned to the \\"gun line\\" and supported ARVN operations around Quang Tri City. Ordered to proceed south on 6 September, Wiltsie departed the waters off northern South Vietnam to fire gunnery missions supporting the 2d ARVN Division in the vicinity of Chu Lai. Terminating her operations supporting the 2d ARVN Division to shift to interdiction of waterborne logistics craft and surveillance of merchant ships in the Hon La anchorage in North Vietnam, Wiltsie found diversified operations and hostile fire in store for her. Her 5-inch guns wreaked havoc on storage dumps, coastal defense sites, radar installations, and supply routes. On 14 September, she spotted a crippled A-7 Corsair aircraft plunging into the Gulf of Tonkin and rescued the pilot from the water. Two days later, she conducted a single-ship raid against a bridge on a major North Vietnamese supply route. During the action, she came under fire from North Vietnamese shore batteries that fired some 70 rounds at the destroyer. This was the only time that the ship came under hostile fire in Vietnam. The next day, Wiltsie and two other ships conducted a \\"reactive strike\\" on the coastal defense site, pounding it with 5-inch gunfire. Supply route and waterborne supply interdiction continued thereafter until Wiltsie, relieved by , departed the area on 20 September. Returning to Subic Bay for upkeep the next day, the destroyer remained in port until 27 September when she sailed for the Gulf of Thailand for gunnery support duties off the west coast of Vietnam. Between late September and early November, Wiltsie operated on station in the Gulf of Thailand. During the gunfire operations, she expended 1,940 5-inch rounds into the U Minh forest, supporting the ARVN 21st Division. Gunfire direction was provided by air spotting, but the dense foliage of the U Minh forest often prevented assessment of results. In addition to her gunfire support duties, Wiltsie was given the task of detecting and tracking waterborne supply traffic. Supported in this operation by P-3 Orion patrol planes, Wiltsie discouraged the enemy from attempting supply by sea along the western coastline of South Vietnam. Henry W. Tucker relieved Wiltsie on 2 November. After a week of upkeep at Singapore, Wiltsie resumed gunfire support operations in Military Region I near the DMZ. She spent a week firing round-the-clock gunfire support missions before joining with TU 72.0.1, as plane-guard destroyer. Between 21 November and 8 December, she escorted the attack carrier as she launched air strikes against enemy forces ashore. In the predawn hours of 28 November, an A-6 Intruder aircraft crashed upon takeoff; and Wiltsie proceeded to the scene of the accident, pinpointing the location and vectoring rescue helicopters from Saratoga to the point. One of the aircraft's crew was rescued quickly and returned to his carrier, but the other pilot, despite the combined efforts of Bainbridge and helicopters from , was never found. Wiltsie proceeded to Hong Kong for rest and recreation and to Kaohsiung for an upkeep alongside . During this availability, all four of her 5-inch guns were rebarreled due to the excessive wear experienced during her gunfire support deployments. The ship departed Taiwan on 27 December to return to the \\"gun line.\\" Arriving on station two days later, she resumed her operations off Quang Tri City, south of the DMZ, and continued these operations until 22 January 1973, when she was detached from TG 75.9 to proceed to Yokosuka. Prom there, the ship sailed for home, arriving at her new home port, San Francisco, on 16 February. However, Wiltsies time on the west coast was comparatively brief for—following a yard period at Willamette Shipyard, Richmond, California—she got underway again for WestPac on 16 June 1973. Arriving at Yokosuka, via Adak, Alaska, on 28 June, the destroyer shifted to Kure before conducting ASWEX 7–73 with Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force units from 9 to 12 July. Moving to Kaohsiung on 22 July, the ship participated in Exercise \\"Sharkhunt II\\" with Chinese units before spending an in-port period at Keelung from 28 July to 1 August. Wiltsie returned home via Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Francisco on 30 August. She participated in COMPTUEX 11–73 in October and served as plane guard for Coral Sea in local operations off the California coast in December. The destroyer continued the routine of local operations out of San Francisco for the remainder of her active service, embarking Naval Reserve units for active duty training on cruises off the west coast and to Hawaii and, on occasion, serving as escort vessel for submarines on their sea trials out of Mare Island. Wiltsie received nine battle stars for Korean War service and seven for Vietnam. As of 2006, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named Wiltsie. Decommissioning preparations began at Alameda in November 1975, and Wiltsie was decommissioned there on 23 January 1976. Simultaneously struck from the Navy List, the veteran of Korean War and Vietnam service was transferred, via sale, to Pakistan. Pakistan service On 29 April 1977, the United States Government announced the transfer of Wiltsie from the United States Navy to the Pakistan Navy, following an overhaul in 1977. After the Pakistan Navy received the destroyer in mid-1978, the vessel was recommissioned in the Pakistan Navy and renamed Tariq (D165). She was renamed Nazim after the Pakistan Navy acquired a former Type 21 frigate and recommissioned it as on 25 January 1990. The Pakistan Navy later transferred the ship to its coast guard branch, the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency, which renamed the vessel PMSS Nazim. In its present condition, she is still active with the Maritime Security Agency and serves as an \\"on sea\\" headquarters. The vessel is moored some kilometers away from Naval Base Karachi and is painted white. The ship is now considered non-operational and has not been moved in years. In this capacity, it remains the flagship of the Maritime Security Agency (MSA).

Burantashi is used as a food additive to barbecued meat (suya) in Nigeria, especially the Northern parts. The extracts contain the alkaloid yohimbine, an alpha-2 antagonist that has been studied for treating erectile dysfunction, but the whole bark of the tree was not studied until recently. In one recent study, pure Burantashi powder obtained from a local suya vendor in Lagos, Nigeria was extracted aqueously and studied on the renal circulation of Sprague-Dawley rats.Ajayi AA, Newaz M, Hercule H, Saleh M, Bode CO, Oyekan AO. Endothelin -like action of Pausinystalia yohimbe aqueous extract on vascular and renal regional hemodynamics in Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods. Find. Expt. Clin. Pharmacol. 2003, 25(10): 817-22. In the in vivo study, the extract code-named \\"CCD-X\\", caused a rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and a rise in renal medullary blood flow (MBF). This systemic vasoconstrictor and renal medullary dilator action was attenuated separately by the endothelin -A receptor blocker - BMS-182874, ET-B blocker -BQ788, but blocked by their combination. Further, the nitric oxide inhibitor (NO), L-Nomega - nitro-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) 10 mg/kg totally inhibited the rise in medullary blood flow due to CCD-X. In vitro studies in isolated perfused kidneys (IPK) and in pressurised microvessels (PMV) confirmed the in vivo effect to cause vasoconstriction, which was inhibited by endothelin A and B antagonists. The pressor dose response characteristic of CCD-X on PMV was similar to that of endothelin-1 with EC50 close to 100 ng. It was concluded from these studies that, the aqueous extract exhibited a vasoconstrictor effect -possibly alpha-2 mediated like yohimbine. However, it possessed additional effects as an andothelin receptor A and B agonist, and also released nitric oxide. The possibility of a post-receptor cross-talk among ET-B, alpha-2 receptors and NO release was also considered. Thin layer chromatography showed that the bark is rich in sesquiterpenes, and has antifungal and antibiotic properties as well. Whether CCD-X will be useful in sickle cell disease (releasing NO) is unknown. Further basic and clinical research are needed before the effects of Burantashi can be effectively evaluated.

It was built by the Mittelthurgaubahn; MThB), which was a Swiss private railway based in Weinfelden. It was liquidated in 2003, including its subsidiary Lokoop, and its activities and the infrastructure it owned were mainly taken over by a Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) subsidiary, Thurbo, which was originally formed as a joint venture between the MThB and the SBB.  History After an initiative committee for the construction of the Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn (Central Thurgau Railway; MThB) was established in Kreuzlingen on 11 August 1890, the committee made its first contacts with the Westdeutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (West German Railway Company; WeEG) based in Cologne in 1899. An application for a concession for a standard-gauge railway, which had been prepared by engineer Jakob Ehrensperger from Winterthur, was submitted to the Federal Council in 1901. The Swiss Federal Assembly granted the concession for a railway from Wil via Weinfelden to the state border at Konstanz on 19 December 1902. The Grand Duchy of Baden State Ministry approved the entrance of the line into Konstanz station in 1903. The initiative committee concluded a 15-year non-terminable contract for the construction and operation of a standard-gauge Wil-Weinfelden-Konstanz railway with the WeEG in 1906. This contract used the name Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn - MThB for the first time and a joint stock company was founded under this name on 28 April 1908. The issue of stock began on 26 November 1906. The largest share purchase was made by the canton of Thurgau, other notable share purchases were made by the three cities of Konstanz, Weinfelden and Wil as well as the canton of St. Gallen. Another 27 municipalities along with private interests joined the share register. The WeEG raised bonds worth CHF 3 million. The ground-breaking ceremony was held between Weinfelden and Thur on 10 September 1909. 60,000 cubic metres of earth were moved. Among the seven engineering structures to be built were four large structures. Work on the Bussnang viaduct was started late and the last section to be built was from the Weinfelden mountain down to Weinfelden because detailed approvals were delayed. The inspection of the iron bridges began in 1911. The Thur bridge was loaded with three type B 3/4 tender locomotives of the SBB, each weighing approximately 85 tons. Further investigations of the substructure and superstructure, the intersections of the railway with power lines, the structures and the rolling stock, finally allowed the opening of the Wil–Weinfelden–Kreuzlingen–Konstanz line on 16 December 1911. The WeEG operated the line under contract. The contract for operations was transferred to Vereinigte Kleinbahnen AG (VKA) of Frankfurt am Main in 1931. It sold its interest, in particular the interest-bearing bonds, to the AG für Verkehrswesen in Berlin Wilmersdorf, with a small proportion going to the Overseas Trust Corporation Ltd. of Johannesburg. A package of bearer shares had been issued to Midland Bank Ltd. of London, but the VKA bought them back in 1938. The contract for operations was temporarily suspended during the war years. After the First and Second World Wars, the MThB was an important source of hard currency for German counterparties in the periods of high inflation. The contract was terminated at the end of 1950 and the MThB took over its own operations. SBB Interregio on the former MThB Konstanz–Weinfelden route on the double-track section between Tägerwilen and Kreuzlingen-Bernrain (2013) The 41-kilometre, standard-gauge and single-track line from Kreuzlingen via Weinfelden to Wil lies predominantly in the canton of Thurgau, while only the last, four-kilometre section is in the canton of St. Gallen. It was opened on 20 December 1911 for passenger and freight traffic and operated with steam trains. From 1938 it was also operated with a diesel railcar, initially rented. As the last significant private railway in Switzerland, it introduced electrical operations on 24 September 1965. The Reisebüro Mittelthurgau, which operates river cruises, was founded as a subsidiary in 1969. The trains generally began and ended in Konstanz, where a connection to the German state railway network existed. They used the 1 km-long Kreuzlingen–Konstanz line, which had been opened by the Swiss National Railway (Schweizerische Nationalbahn; SNB) on 17 July 1875 and later transferred to the SBB. Shortly before its end, the MThB expanded and also took over lines that ran to Germany. However, investments in infrastructure and rolling stock meant that it assumed considerable debt. Mittelthurgaubahn AG was finally dissolved on 11 October 2002. The chief executives were Peter Joss, longtime director, and Hermann Lei (a former member of the Grand Council of Thurgau). The rolling stock and the equipment were taken over by Thurbo AG.  Extended operations of the Mittelthurgaubahn In addition to its main line, MThB took over the management of operations in the 1990s on the following routes in Germany and Switzerland: *Germany: ** Seehas: Konstanz – Radolfzell – Singen – Engen, on behalf of Deutsche Bahn ** Seehäsle: Radolfzell – Stockach on the non- electrified Radolfzell–Mengen railway, on behalf of the district of Konstanz *Switzerland ** Romanshorn – Kreuzlingen – Stein am Rhein – Schaffhausen ** SBB Lake Line (Seelinie); the operation of the line was won in competition with the SBB; it included the upgrade of the infrastructure, the procurement of new rolling stock and regular interval operations. These tasks have been taken over by the SBB subsidiaries, SBB GmbH (Germany) and Thurbo (Switzerland). The latter is now also the owner of the (Kreuzlingen–) Tägermoos – (Weinfelden) – (Wil) line. The infrastructure of the Lake Line was returned to the control of the SBB, which also operates the infrastructure of the Wil–Kreuzlingen railway on behalf of Thurbo. Part of the historic rolling stock, such as the Mostindien-Express with the steam locomotive Ec 3/5 number 3 (built in 1912) together with the associated cars, a railcar (ABDe 4/4 number 12) and a few others Vehicles are maintained and operated by the Verein Historische Mittel-Thurgau-Bahn for nostalgia, social and excursion trips. These are to be exhibited in the Locorama rail adventure theme park in Romanshorn. Current operations Services are operated every 30 minutes between Wil and Weinfelden as line S10 and between Weinfelden, Kreuzlingen and Konstanz as line S14 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn.

Legge's hawk-eagle is named after him as is Legges Tor, the second highest peak in Tasmania. Biography Legge was born at Cullenswood, Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land). His father, Robert Vincent Legge had moved from Ireland to Tasmania in 1827 along with his sisters and was married to Eliza Graves (née de Lapenotierre). He was granted 1200 acres (486 ha) which he named \\"Cullenswood\\" after his home in Ireland. William was sent to study at Bath after which he continued studies in France and Germany, picking up several languages before joining the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1862 he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, serving first in Bath, England, and then in Melbourne for several years. From Melbourne his battery was transferred to Colombo, Ceylon, where he was stationed 1869–1877. He then took a staff appointment at Aberystwith, Cardiganshire, for five years. Subsequently, he moved back to Tasmania. He was involved in the defence of the River Derwent and setting up batteries to defend Hobart with new guns. With a recommendation from Sir Peter Scratchley he served for eleven years as Commandant of the Tasmanian Defence Forces, retiring as Lieutenant-Colonel from the Imperial service in 1883. He trained Tasmanian forces for the Second Boer War and organised in 1900, the reception for the Duke of Cornwall. He continued in service until 1904, when the forces were taken over by the Commonwealth. Legge had early shown great interest in the defences of the River Derwent, and for this and a recommendation by he was offered the command of the forces in Tasmania. He took up his new command on 6 December 1883, retiring from the imperial service with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In April–May Legge had completed the torpedo course on H.M.S. Vernon at Portsmouth, and with advice from Scratchley and General Hardinge Steward ordered the new breech-loading guns for the colony from the Elswick Works at Newcastle upon Tyne. During his command the forces were entirely reorganised and the batteries defending Hobart were completed and armed with several of the latest types of guns, but many of his other recommendations went unheeded. He was twice re-engaged before his appointment ended in June 1890 through government retrenchment. When Colonel A. T. Cox retired in 1898 the command was again offered to Legge. He trained Tasmanian contingents for the Boer war and was in charge of the reception of the Duke of Cornwall in 1900, and held his post until the forces were officially taken over by the Commonwealth in 1904. Scientific career Colonel Legge had a strong interest in ornithology. He spent his free time in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) studying the birds of the region, a work started by Edgar Leopold Layard, which led to his authorship of History of the Birds of Ceylon, comprising two quarto-sized volumes, with coloured plates by Keulemans, published in three parts between 1878 and 1880 in London. The work consisted of over 1200 pages with 34 plates in colour; some woodcuts became the standard book on the subject due to their high quality. He was also the secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society in Colombo. Part of his collection of Ceylonese birds were presented by him to the Natural History Museum at South Kensington, and the remainder was given to the museum at Hobart. He also published short notes on the ornithology of Ceylon and later Tasmania. Legge was elected the founding President of the RAOU in 1901 and served various offices within it, notably on the Check-list Committee, until his death. He was also a Colonial Member of the British Ornithologists' Union, an Honorary Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the Zoological Society of London, the Linnean Society. He was also a founder and president of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union and vice-president of the Royal Society of Tasmania. The highest point on the Ben Lomond plateau is named Legges Tor to honour his survey of the region. He served on the biological consultation committee of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, acting as vice-president in 1902 and president in 1904 at the conference in Dunedin. His works included contributions to the sixth report of the committee, a \\"List of Vernacular Names for Australian Birds\\" in 1898.

An overwhelming majority of these refugees and immigrants were Bengali Hindus.US State Department, \\"Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976\\", Volume XI, South Asia Crisis, 1971\\", Page 165 During the Bangladesh liberation war with West Pakistan, an estimated 10 million people of East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) fled the country and took refuge in India particularly in the Indian states of West Bengal and Indian North East region, especially Tripura and Assam.  History  In 1947, Bengal was partitioned into the Indian state of West Bengal and the Pakistani province of East Bengal. East Bengal was later renamed East Pakistan, which subsequently broke away from Pakistan to form the independent country of Bangladesh. Most of Sylhet district in Assam also joined East Pakistan and was subsequently considered to be East Bengal. East Bengal was the area of agricultural growth whereas West Bengal was meant for industrial development.  Settlement  The majority of East Bengali refugees settled in the city of Kolkata (Calcutta) and various other towns and rural areas of West Bengal, but a significant number also moved to the Barak Valley of Assam and the princely state of Tripura which eventually joined India in 1949. Around 0.5 million were also settled in other parts of India, including the East Pakistan Displaced Persons' Colony (EPDP) in Delhi (subsequently renamed Chittaranjan Park), Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. The estimated 0.5 million Bengalis in Delhi and 0.3 million in Mumbai are also largely East Bengali refugees and their descendants.  Scope  The exact number of refugees has never been officially collected and estimates vary considerably. In the immediate aftermath of partition, commonly attributed figures suggest around 3 million East Bengalis migrating to India and 864,000 migrants from India to East Pakistan. Indian government estimates suggest around 2.6 million migrants leaving East Bengal for India and 0.7 million migrants coming to East Pakistan from India. As per the Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Department of the Government of West Bengal, the census figures show the number of refugees from East Pakistan in 1971 was nearly 6 million (60 lakhs) and in 1981, the number was assessed at 8 million (80 lakhs).A district-wise break-up in 1971, shows the main thrust of the refugee influx was on 24-Parganas (22.3% of the total refugees), Nadia (20.3%), Bankura (19.1%) and Kolkata (12.9%).  Further migration = 1950s  In 1950, it is estimated that a further one million refugees crossed into West Bengal, particularly in the aftermath of 1950 Barisal riots and Noakhali riots. The 1951 Census of India recorded that 27% of Kolkata's population was East Bengali refugees mainly Hindu Bengalis and they contributed the economic growth of Kolkata in various fields. Millions of Hindus particularly Bengali speaking from East Pakistan took refuge mainly in India's various state. A number estimated that around 3.2 lakhs Hindus from East Pakistan migrated mainly to Kolkata and various rural areas and towns of West Bengal during 1947.  1960s  Migration continued, primarily from East Pakistan to India, right up to the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, both on an ongoing basis and with spikes during periods of particular communal unrest such as the 1964 East Pakistan riots and the 1965 India-Pakistan War, when it is estimated that 600,000 refugees left for India. Estimates of the number of refugees up to 1970 are over 5 million to West Bengal alone. This includes around 4.1 million coming between 1946 and 1958 and 1.2 million coming between 1959 and 1971.  1970s  Another major influx into India came in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War, when Hindu refugees escaped systematic mass killings, rapes, lootings and arson. It is estimated that around 10 million East Bengali refugees entered India during the early months of the war, of whom 1.5 million may have stayed back after Bangladesh became independent.

(1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp. 27-41 It is an ancient umbrella term for numerous Hindu texts that describe arts, crafts, and their design rules, principles and standards. In the context of Hindu temple architecture and sculpture, Shilpa Shastras were manuals for sculpture and Hindu iconography, prescribing among other things, the proportions of a sculptured figure, composition, principles, meaning, as well as rules of architecture.For Śilpa Śāstras as basis for iconographic standards, see: Hopkins, Thomas J. (1971). The Hindu Religious Tradition. Belmont, California: Dickenson Publishing Company, p. 113. Sixty-four techniques for such arts or crafts, sometimes called ' \\"external or practical arts\\", are traditionally enumerated, including carpentry, architecture, jewellery, farriery, acting, dancing, music, medicine, poetry etc., besides sixty-four ' or \\"secret arts\\", which include mostly \\"erotic arts\\" such as kissing, embracing, etc. (Monier-Williams s.v. '). While Shilpa and Vastu Shastras are related, Shilpa Shastras deal with arts and crafts such as forming statues, icons, stone murals, painting, carpentry, pottery, jewellery, dying, textiles and others.Misra, R. N. (2011), Silpis in Ancient India: Beyond their Ascribed Locus in Ancient Society, Social Scientist, Vol. 39, No. 7/8, pages 43-54M. Chandra (1973), Costumes, Textiles, Cosmetics and Coiffures in Ancient and Medieval India, Delhi, Vastu Shastras deal with building architecture – building houses, forts, temples, apartments, village and town layout, etc. Description Shilpa (शिल्प) refers to any art or craft in ancient Indian texts, while Shastra means science. Together, Shilpa Shastra means the science of art and crafts. The ancient Sanskrit texts use the term Shilpin (शिल्पिन्, male artist)Śilpin Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany and Shilpini (शिल्पिनी, female artist)Śilpini Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany for artists and crafts person, while Shilpani refers to works of arts of man. The meaning of Shilpa, according to Stella Kramrisch, is complex. She writes that it consists of \\"art, skill, craft, labor, ingenuity, rite and ritual, form and creation.\\"Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, (Jul. - Sep., 1958), pp. 224-230 The range of crafts encompassed by the term Shilpa extends to every aspect of culture, includes sculptor, the potter, the perfumer, the wheelwright, the painter, the weaver, the architect, the dancer, the musician, the arts of love, and others. Ancient Indian texts assert that the number of the arts is unlimited, they deploy sixty four kala (कला, techniques)Vatsyayana, Kamasutra I.3, Jayamangala and thirty two vidyas (विद्या, fields of knowledge).Vatsyayana, Kamasutra, Book I, Chapter 3 Shilpa is discussed in Agamas, Puranas and Vastu Shastra where it is linked to the mythology of Vishvakarma. In painting Shilpa Shastras include chapters on paintings, both miniature and large.Isabella Nardi (2006), The Theory of Citrasutras in Indian Painting, Routledge, , pages 180-187 For example, Narada Shilpa Shastra dedicates chapters 66 and 71 to painting, while Saraswati Shilpa Shastra describes various types of chitra (full painting), ardhachitra (sketch work), chitrabhasa (communication through painting), varna samskara (preparation of colors).S. Dabhade, , pages 7-12 Other ancient Shilpa Shastra on painting include Vishnudharmottara Purana and Chitralakshana, former is available in Sanskrit while the only surviving copies of latter are in Tibetan (both were originally written on birch bark, and have been translated into English and German).Isabella Nardi (2006), The Theory of Citrasutras in Indian Painting, Routledge, These Sanskrit treatises discuss the following aspects of a painting: measurement, proportions, perspective of the viewer, mudra, emotions, and rasa (meaning). Such an approach of Indian paintings, states Isabella Nardi, make Shilpa Shastra not only canonical textual sources but also a means to transmit knowledge and spiritual themes.Isabella Nardi (2009), Re-evaluating the Role of Text in Indian Art - Towards a Shastric Analysis of the Image of Shri Nathji in Nathdvara Miniature Painting, South Asia Research, July, vol. 29, no. 2, pages 99-126 In carpentry The first chapter of Shilpa Shastra Manasara discusses the measurement principles for carpentry.Ram Raz, Henry Harkness (1834), , pages 3-6, (footnote on page 4) The 9th-century version of Mayamata text of Tamil Nadu and 16th Century version of Shilparatna of Odisha describe takshaka and vardhaki as wood Shilpins; takshaka possesses the knowledge of wood types and practices the art of cutting wood, while vardhaki possesses the knowledge of wood forms and practices the art of carpentry.Naoki Ideno (2007), The Artisans' Duty and Ability in Shilpa- Shastras, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 55(2), pages 788-784 One of the earliest mentions of carpentry arts is in Book 9, Chapter 112 of Rig Veda.R Vyas (1992), Nature of Indian Culture, South Asia Books, , pages 20-21 Carpentry was also an essential Shilpa Shastra during the construction of a Hindu temple.C. Purdon Clarke (1883), Some notes upon the Domestic Architecture of India, The Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol. 31, No. 1594 (JUNE 8), pages 731-756 In metallurgy The 4th-century CE 99.7% pure Iron pillar in Delhi reflecting the metal-related shilpa in ancient India. The pillar was moved and reinstalled near Qutb complex about 1000 years later. The upper part of the pillar remains without any rust damage; the lower, reinstalled in-ground part shows signs of rust. The Vedas, in particular Atharva veda and Sthapatya veda, describe many kinds of arts and crafts in their discussion of Shilpa Shastra and Yantra Sarvasva. The Rig veda, states Ravi,B. Ravi (2003), Investment casting development - Ancient and Modern Approaches, National Conference on Investment Casting Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur, IIT Bombay mentions equipment used in casting, such as dhamatri (cupola), gharma aranmaya (crucible) and bhastri (blower). These discussions are in the context of making idols, and describe rules to achieve best talmana (proportions), mudra (stance) and bhava (expression). Sanskrit texts such as ShilparatnaHans Losch, Sources of Sri Kumara's Shilparatna, Anal. Bhandarkar Orient. Res., Vol. 31, pages 152-164 and ManasaraWhile Manasara, sometimes spelled Manava sara, has extensive discussions on architecture, guidelines for ancient village and town planning, it has section on metal art works as well; See: Koenigsberger (1952), New towns in India, Town Planning Review, 23(2): 95-99; Acharya (1933), Manasara on Architecture and Sculpture, Mansara Series 1-4, Oxford University Press - A version was reprinted in 1995 as describe in detail the process and principles for art work with metals, particularly for alloys such as panchadhatu (five metals – zinc, tin, copper, silver and gold) and ashtadhatu (eight metal alloys – which adds iron, lead and mercury to panchadhatu). Madhuchista Vidhana (cire perdue or lost wax) casting process is the most discussed process in these ancient shilpa shastras with metals.Pupul Jayakar(1984), Metal Casting from Kerala, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 4, DESIGN: TRADITION AND CHANGE (December 1984), pp. 63-68 Kirk suggests that these Shastras diffused from India to other ancient cultures in Asia.Kirk, W. (1975), The role of India in the diffusion of early cultures, Geographical Journal, Vol. 141, No. 1, 19-34 While there is empirical evidence of high purity metallurgy and art works with other metals, some ancient Shilpa Shastras have been lost. For example, the 5th century Iron Pillar of Delhi, which stands 23 feet, weighs 6 tonnes and contains 99.72% iron without showing any signs of rust, is empirical evidence of the state of metallurgical arts in 5th century India.R Balasubramaniam (1998), The decorative bell capital of the Delhi iron pillar, JOM, 50(3): 40-47, Shilpa Shastra education in ancient India ;Birth was no barrier All arts were the domain of all classes, castes and both genders in ancient India.Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, The ancient texts of Parashara states that all crafts were practised by anyone irrespective of family's occupation. The Buddhist Jatakas mention Brahmin carpenters, the 4th century text Baudhayana describesBaudhayana, XXV.13.22 chariot builders, carpenters, brick- workers, potters and metal workers from people of people classified as Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. Suttavibhanga describes builders and wheelwrights born to Shudra father and Brahmin mother, who by later texts would be described as untouchables. The goldsmiths of Maharashtra included children born in cattle herding families. ;Apprenticeship Apprentices joined and trained under masters. The best were adopted and recognised as members of various art guilds. The training began from childhood, and included studies about dharma, culture, reading, writing, mathematics, geometry, colors, tools, as well as trade secrets – these were called Tradition. ;Guilds Shilpins had formed Śreni (guilds) in ancient India. Each guild formed its own laws and code of conduct, one the ancient Hindu and Buddhist kings of India respected by tradition. In some cases, the king established the laws of the guilds;Manusmriti VIII.41 in some cases, the king's treasurer had the final word and served as judge of various guilds in a kingdom.Nigrodha Jataka VI.427 These guilds, in the 1st millennium BC, included all those who practised the art irrespective of the artist's caste or creed.Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, Traditional India: Structure and Change (Jul. - Sep., 1958), pp. 228 The income of each guild came from fees paid by new members joining the guild, from fines on those violating the code of conduct established by the guild, and levies on tools used for that art. The guilds also performed charity and gifted collective works of art by their members to temples and other social works. During festivals and social celebrations, each guild would contribute their own performance and pavilions with flags and emblems. ;Art is spiritual Creative work and artists were granted the sanctions of a sacrament in ancient Indian culture, states Stella Kramrisch.Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, An artist expresses the spiritual and holiness in his or her art. This belief continues to manifest itself in modern India in the form of rituals, where in an autumn festival (Dashahra), craftsmen in parts of India worship their tools with incense, flowers and unhusked rice. Brhat Samhita at verses 57.10-11 describes the practice of carpenters offering prayers and seeking forgiveness of a tree before cutting it for wood. The axe used to cut the tree would be rubbed with honey and butter to minimise the hurt to the tree which was considered to be a living being. Craft was seen as application of essence of Purusha (Universal Principles) to parts of nature so as to transform it into a work of art.Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1 & 2, Motilal Banarsidass, Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, , Bloomsbury Academic, pp 121-125 Treatises on Shilpa Shastras Some known Shilpa Shastras-related manuscripts include:Acharya P.K.

Its eastern terminus is at a T-intersection with State Route 93 just over north of Ironton. Route description State Route 522's path takes it through portions of Scioto and Lawrence Counties. No segment of this highway is included within the National Highway System, a network of highways deemed most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. History State Route 522 was designated in 1947. The original routing of the state route followed the majority of today's routing, running from its junction with what was then a two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 52 (now known as Gallia Street) on the southern fringe of Wheelersburg to its present eastern terminus at what was then known as State Route 75 (now State Route 93). In 1971, with the completion of a new four-lane expressway through the Wheelersburg vicinity, U.S. Route 52 was routed onto this expressway. State Route 522, in turn, was extended southerly along the former two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 52 to its present-day western terminus where this roadway meets the U.S. Route 52 expressway at a diamond interchange.

Biography Hoos was born in Neuwied, Germany, on August 31, 1850. He was an upholsterer who, after immigrating to the United States, he started a furniture business in Jersey City. His wife Dora Wilkins, of Hanover, Germany, died in 1890. In 1897, he was pushed by Democratic political boss, Robert Davis, to run for Mayor of Jersey City. The mayoral election of 1897 was very controversial. The Republican controlled state legislature passed the McArthur Act which postponed Jersey City and Newark's elections from the Spring to November to make them coincide with the state elections. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that this was unconstitutional. The Republicans appealed the Supreme Court's decision to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals. Since the decision was under appeal, the Republicans claimed that the elections planned for April 14 should not be held at that time until the court ruled on their appeal and if they were held then their results would not be valid until after the appeal was ruled on. The Democrats claimed they would be held and their results would be valid. Hoos won the election against Republican J. Herbert Potts, 15,264 votes to 12,018. however, Mayor Peter F. Wanser refused to vacate the mayor's office claiming the election was not valid until their appeal was heard in court. Hoos had to formally demand Wanser to leave the office on May 3, 1897. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled in September in favor of Hoos. Hoos won re-election over Republican Edward M. Watson by an even bigger margin of 7,000 votes on April 11, 1899. Hoos had served two terms (May 3, 1897 to December 31, 1901), but Boss Davis knew the voters wanted a change and dumped Hoos from the ticket in 1901 in favor of Edward L. Young, son of Edward Faitoute Condict Young (Davis' financial backing). It did not matter to the voters who swept in Republican Mark M. Fagan as mayor. Hoos died on October 24, 1912 and was buried in Bayview – New York Bay Cemetery in Jersey City alongside his wife and three of his children.

The blue–white screen is a screening technique that allows for the rapid and convenient detection of recombinant bacteria in vector-based molecular cloning experiments. DNA of interest is ligated into a vector. The vector is then inserted into a competent host cell viable for transformation, which are then grown in the presence of X-gal. Cells transformed with vectors containing recombinant DNA will produce white colonies; cells transformed with non- recombinant plasmids (i.e. only the vector) grow into blue colonies. This method of screening is usually performed using a suitable bacterial strain, but other organisms such as yeast may also be used. Background Molecular cloning is one of the most commonly used procedures in molecular biology. A gene of interest may be inserted into a plasmid vector via ligation, and the plasmid is then transformed into Escherichia coli cells. However, not all the plasmids transformed into cells may contain the desired gene insert, and checking each individual colony for the presence of the insert is time- consuming. Therefore, a method for the detection of the insert would be useful for making this procedure less time- and labor-intensive. One of the early methods developed for the detection of insert is blue-white screening which allows for identification of successful products of cloning reactions through the colour of the bacterial colony. The method is based on the principle of α-complementation of the β-galactosidase gene. This phenomenon of α-complementation was first demonstrated in work done by Agnes Ullmann in the laboratory of François Jacob and Jacques Monod, where the function of an inactive mutant β-galactosidase with deleted sequence was shown to be rescued by a fragment of β-galactosidase in which that same sequence, the α-donor peptide, is still intact. Langley et al. showed that the mutant non-functional β-galactosidase was lacking in part of its N-terminus with its residues 11—41 deleted, but it may be complemented by a peptide formed of residues 3—90 of β-galactosidase. M13 filamentous phage containing sequence coding for the first 145 amino acid was later constructed by Messing et al., and α-complementation via the use of a vector was demonstrated by the formation of blue plaques when cells containing the inactive protein were infected by the phage and then grown in plates containing X-gal. The pUC series of plasmid cloning vectors by Vieira and Messing was developed from the M13 system and were the first plasmids constructed to take advantage of this screening method. In this method, DNA ligated into the plasmid disrupts the α peptide and therefore the complementation process, and no functional β-galactosidase can form. Cells transformed with plasmid containing an insert therefore form white colonies, while cells transformed with plasmid without an insert form blue colonies; result of a successful ligation can thus be easily identified by the white coloration of cells formed from the unsuccessful blue ones. Molecular mechanism A schematic representation of the Blue-white assay, used to screen for recombinant vectors β-galactosidase is a protein encoded by the lacZ gene of the lac operon, and it exists as a homotetramer in its active state. However, a mutant β-galactosidase derived from the M15 strain of E. coli has its N-terminal residues 11—41 deleted and this mutant, the ω-peptide, is unable to form a tetramer and is inactive. This mutant form of protein however may return fully to its active tetrameric state in the presence of an N-terminal fragment of the protein, the α-peptide. The rescue of function of the mutant β-galactosidase by the α-peptide is called α-complementation. In this method of screening, the host E. coli strain carries the lacZ deletion mutant (lacZΔM15) which contains the ω-peptide, while the plasmids used carry the lacZα sequence which encodes the first 59 residues of β-galactosidase, the α-peptide. Neither is functional by itself. However, when the two peptides are expressed together, as when a plasmid containing the lacZα sequence is transformed into a lacZΔM15 cells, they form a functional β-galactosidase enzyme. The blue/white screening method works by disrupting this α-complementation process. The plasmid carries within the lacZα sequence an internal multiple cloning site (MCS). This MCS within the lacZα sequence can be cut by restriction enzymes so that the foreign DNA may be inserted within the lacZα gene, thereby disrupting the gene that produces α-peptide. Consequently, in cells containing the plasmid with an insert, no functional β-galactosidase may be formed. The presence of an active β-galactosidase can be detected by X-gal, a colourless analog of lactose that may be cleaved by β-galactosidase to form 5-bromo-4-chloro-indoxyl, which then spontaneously dimerizes and oxidizes to form a bright blue insoluble pigment 5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro-indigo. This results in a characteristic blue colour in cells containing a functional β-galactosidase. Blue colonies therefore show that they may contain a vector with an uninterrupted lacZα (therefore no insert), while white colonies, where X-gal is not hydrolyzed, indicate the presence of an insert in lacZα which disrupts the formation of an active β-galactosidase. The recombinant clones can be further analyzed by isolating and purifying small amounts of plasmid DNA from the transformed colonies and restriction enzymes can be used to cut the clone and determine if it has the fragment of interest. If the DNA is necessary to be sequenced, the plasmids from the colonies will need to be isolated at a point, whether to cut using restriction enzymes or performing other assays. Practical considerations The correct type of vector and competent cells are important considerations when planning a blue white screen. The plasmid must contain the lacZα, and examples of such plasmids are pUC19 and pBluescript. The E. coli cell should contain the mutant lacZ gene with deleted sequence (i.e. lacZΔM15), and some of the commonly used cells with such genotype are JM109, DH5α, and XL1-Blue. It should also be understood that the lac operon is affected by the presence of glucose. The protein EIIAGlc, which is involved in glucose import, shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell. The media used in agar plate therefore should not include glucose. X-gal is light-sensitive and therefore its solution and plates containing X-gal should be stored in the dark. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), which functions as the inducer of the lac operon, may be used in the media to enhance the expression of LacZ. X-gal is an expensive material, thus other methods have been developed in order to screen bacteria. GFP has been developed as an alternative to help screen bacteria. The concept is similar to α-complementation in which a DNA insert can disrupt the coding sequence within a vector and thus disrupt the GFP production resulting in non-fluorescing bacteria. Bacteria that have recombinant vectors (vector + insert), will be white and not express the GFP protein, while non-recombinant (vector), will and fluoresce under UV light. GFP in general has been used as a reporter gene where individuals can definitively determine if a clone carries a gene that researchers are analyzing. On occasion, the medium in which the colonies grow can influence the screen and introduce false-positive results. X-gal on the medium can occasionally degrade to produce a blue color or GFP can lose its fluorescence because of the medium and can impact researchers capabilities to determine colonies with the desire recombinant and those that do not possess it. Drawbacks Some white colonies may not contain the desired recombinant plasmid for a number of reasons. The ligated DNA may not be the correct one or not properly ligated, and it is possible for some linearized vector to be transformed, its ends \\"repaired\\" and ligated together such that no LacZα is produced and no blue colonies may be formed. Mutation can also lead to the α-fragment not being expressed. A colony with no vector at all will also appear white, and may sometimes appear as satellite colonies after the antibiotic used has been depleted. It is also possible that blue colonies may contain the insert. This occurs when the insert is \\"in frame\\" with the LacZα gene and a STOP codon is absent in the insert. This can lead to the expression of a fusion protein that has a functional LacZα if its structure is not disrupted. The correct recombinant construct can sometimes give lighter blue colonies which may complicate its identification.

The bridge's length is 334 meters, the width is 23 meters. The bridge features three spans; the central one can be drawn. __TOC__ History The initial idea to build a bridge near the Okhta river was circulated in 1829. Even before the Saint Petersburg was founded, there were settlements in the Okhta region, and with the growth of the city, it quickly grew to become big industrial center. Powder factories and shipyards existed here. However, in the 19th century, Okhta district wasn't officially part of Saint Petersburg. The bridge was essential for the developing industry, and Nicholas I approved the bridge as part of strategic city development plan. However, at that time the necessary funds were not found. Next time the possibility of building a bridge was raised in 1860-th, when the Emperor approved the decision to join the Okhta district to Saint Petersburg. The city Duma organized international contest. There were total of 16 projects submitted including projects from France, Germany, Austria, Spain and USA. There also were three projects submitted out of contest. And one of these out of contest projects was declared winner. That was the project by professor of Nikolaevskay engineering academy colonel Krivoshein and military engineer Apyshkov. But even after selecting the winning project, the work didn't start for a long time. The 100-year-old bridge in 2012. In spring of 1907, the passenger ship Arkhangelk which transported people from the left bank of Neva to the right bank sank. This tragic event set things in motion, and on September 24, 1907 the contract for building the bridge was signed. The ceremony of bridge founding took place on June 26, 1909, exactly two hundred years from the Battle of Poltava. Hence the bridge was named after the victor of that battle: Emperor Peter the Great Bridge. As the result, the bridge itself was manufactured in Warsaw (Firma Braci Ruckich - Rucki Bros. Metalworks in Warsaw), and components were transported to the construction site and assembled. This is described by the bronze plaque (120 cm by 180 cm) that can be seen from the pedestrian walkway on the right pylon if crossing from the left side of Neva. The bridge was open for traffic on October 26, 1911. In 1956 the bridge was renamed Bolsheokhtinsky after the Big Okhta river, but in 2004 the original name was partially restored, although the title of Emperor was dropped from the name. Today people call this bridge both Peter the Great Bridge and Bolsheokhtinsky Bridge. The city rumor has it that one of the clenches in the bridge is made from pure gold, and colored to be the same color as the rest of clenches. Unfortunately it is virtually impossible to verify, since the bridge has more than one million clenches. In 1963, an Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-124 landed on the Neva just behind the bridge in what remains one of the very few successful controlled water landings in aviation history with no lives lost.

He established the first fish hatchery in the United States in the Town of Caledonia, New York. He was also a successful commercial fisherman, operating a large and profitable fish and game market in Rochester, New York, and fishing in Lake Ontario. After many years of operating his commercial hatchery in Caledonia, he entered government service with the New York State Fish Commission and eventually became Superintendent of Fisheries for the state of New York. Seth Green's pioneering efforts to raise fish stocks and restore fish populations for sporting purposes established a standard of aquaculture recognized internationally. He also planted American Shad in California rivers near Sacramento. He is commonly referred to as the \\"Father of fish culture in North America.\\" Early life Seth Green was born in 1817 in Rochester, New York, the son of farmer Adonijah Green and his wife Betsy Bronson. He had one brother and two sisters. He grew up as an outdoor enthusiast in the small village of Carthage along the Genesee River near Rochester, learning fishing skills from his father and the local Seneca people. His formal schooling was limited to finishing fifth or sixth grade at a local Carthage district school. When the financial Panic of 1837 severely affected the economy of Carthage, Green left home and decided to take up commercial fishing along the Genesee River. In 1848 he married Helen Cooke, a local Rochester girl. They established a fish and game market in downtown Rochester, which he operated with his brother and partner, Monroe Green. By 1857 the market employed more than 100 people. It was one of the largest and most prosperous fish markets in the region. To supply his market, Green traveled the shores of Lake Ontario over the years for fish. He and his fishermen survived many storms and hardships on Lake Ontario to supply the market with from daily. Early in his commercial fishing business, he observed Atlantic salmon spawning near Cobourg, Ontario and conceived the idea of propagating his own stocks of fish, not only for market but to restock streams for sport fishing. Caledonia Fish Hatchery Caledonia Fish Hatchery circa 1879 Based on his own observations, ancient writings on fish culture, and his experimentation along the Genesee River, Green pioneered a new method of fertilization he called \\"dry impregnation\\". In 1864 he set up a small hatchery in Caledonia, New York along a spring creek. Green's hatchery was the first in the Western Hemisphere. He kept his methods secret for many years while successfully and profitably raising Atlantic salmon and brook trout for market.Caledonia Fish Hatchery Later, he expanded his techniques to other species, including shad, rainbow and brown trout. In 1867–1869 he experimented and pioneered methods to successfully propagate American shad in the Connecticut River near Holyoke, Massachusetts. Restocking the river with shad fry, resulted in an 1870 harvest that was 60% larger than the largest ever recorded in 1811. Government service From an early age, Seth Green recognized that fish were not a limitless resource and over harvest would easily deplete rivers, lakes and streams of fish. In 1868, working with like- minded New York sportsmen, especially Robert B. Roosevelt and ex-governor Horatio Seymour, he encouraged the state legislature to form a fishing commission. Green, Roosevelt and Seymour were appointed as the state's first fish commissioners and charged with examining lakes and rivers and working to increase the production of fish in the waters of New York State. Their annual budget was $1,000. Between 1868 and 1875, the commission established a regular stocking program in the state's rivers and lakes, being supplied by Seth Green's hatchery in Caledonia. During this period, Seth Green sold the hatchery to A.S. Collins, a friend and partner. In 1870, Green resigned his position as fish commissioner and the governor appointed him Superintendent of Fisheries. In 1875, the state bought the Caledonia hatchery. It has continued as a functioning fish hatchery in New York into the 21st century. Although Green represented New York State, he promoted his propagation and stocking methods throughout the east coast. He is credited with reestablishing American Shad populations in coastal rivers as far south as the Savannah River in Georgia. California In early 1871, at the request of the California Fish Commission, Green transported more than 12,000 American Shad fry to Sacramento, California to plant in the Sacramento River. In June 1871, after a train trip of seven days from Albany, New York, Green arrived with some 10,000 shad fry. They were stocked in the river near the town of Tehama, California. The project was a complete success, and in 1873 the state offered a $50 reward for the first shad to be caught from Pacific Ocean tributaries. They paid the reward on May 10, 1873. The fish was caught in a tributary of San Francisco Bay. The shad was a male fish 1 year, 9 months, and 12 days old. It was long and weighed . American shad were the first non-native fish introduced into California waters. Recognition and honors By the early 1870s, Seth Green was internationally recognized as a leading expert on fish culture. He corresponded regularly with fisheries authorities around the world, especially in Germany, France and New Zealand. He wrote extensively about fish culture, publishing his first work Trout Culture in 1870 and his most comprehensive work, Home Fishing in Home Waters-A Practical Treatise in Fish Culture, in 1888. For many years he was the editor of the sports department of American Angler. His work and contributions to fish culture were recognized in both the U.S. and abroad. In 1872 and 1875 the Imperiale d'Acclimatation of France awarded Green solid gold medals for his work in pisciculture. In 1876, the U.S. Centennial Commission gave Seth Green a certificate of award at the International Exhibition held at Philadelphia. In 1880, the German Fishing Society in Berlin awarded Green a gold medal for his work in fish culture. Death In 1882 Green was on a fishing trip off the coast of the Carolinas with his friend Robert Barnwell Roosevelt. During the trip he contracted typhoid pneumonia. He never fully recovered from this disease. Although still able to function, he suffered a decline in his physical and mental health from that point on. In January 1888, Green and his son William were traveling to a museum when their carriage overturned. Green severely injured his back in the accident, an injury that confined him to his house for the remainder of his life. At the age of 71, senile and bed-ridden, Green died on August 18, 1888 in Rochester, New York. Legacy Green and his Caledonia Fish Hatchery are credited with the introduction of rainbow trout into non-native waters east of the continental divide, brook trout into the west, and brown trout throughout the U.S. Rochester, New York named Seth Green Drive and the Seth Green Trail along the Genesee River, near the former location of Carthage, in his honor. The Rochester, New York chapter of Trout Unlimited is named after Green. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation operates a , research vessel on Lake Ontario named Seth Green. In 1987, the Fish Culture Hall of Fame, an institution of the American Fisheries Society, enshrined Seth Green as the \\"Father of Fish Culture in North America.\\" The Caledonia Fish Hatchery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

A station, originally called Kilmore Junction, was opened at the site on 17 March 1890, at the point where the former Heathcote branch line left the main line.Heathcote Junction Vicsig History A crossing loop named Summit was opened at the location in November 1885, but closed in January 1886, after duplication works on the North East line were completed. Soon after, surveyors planning the route of a branch railway to Kilmore, and later to Heathcote, selected the site as the junction of the branch. In 1887, a junction was provided for construction trains on the new Kilmore line, which branched off to the west of the station, passing behind the Down platform, with the points facing Melbourne. In 1888, a signal box named Kilmore Junction opened on the eastern side of the main line, but a station was not provided until March 1890. It had only small passenger shelters and no goods facilities. Even though the branch line was extended north-west to Heathcote, and thence to Bendigo in 1890, the station was not renamed Heathcote Junction until 15 May 1922. In 1962, the Melbourne-Albury standard gauge line opened. It ran behind Platform 1, so the signal box had to be replaced by a new structure to the west of the main lines, between those lines and the branch line. The branch line closed in 1968, with the signal box following in 1970. The signal box was demolished in February 1973, although the foundations can still be seen today.

Soon after that, a short platform was provided alongside the road level crossing, and named Wandong. In 1896, the crossing gatehouse was converted into a station building and signal box, and in 1899, a timber bridge replaced the level crossing. Sidings for timber loading were also provided, and a narrow gauge tramway brought saw timber from nearby sawmills. A permanent station building was provided in 1900, along with interlocking for the signals and a lever frame. The present road bridge dates to 1961, while all signals were removed in 1978. The station building on the Down platform was removed in 1979, while the bus shelters on the platforms were provided in 1990. A weatherboard shelter on the Down platform was removed by August 1991.

Byzantine culture was oriented towards Greek culture and Christianity, rather than Roman paganism, in development of the arts. The Byzantine Empire existed for more than a thousand years, from the 4th century AD to 1453.  History  Ancient Greek dance in classical antiquity was originally held to have educational value, as Plato's dialogues on this point evidence in the Laws. However, as Greek culture gradually conquered Rome, dancing had less educational value and was more for entertainment purposes. At this time dancers were given a lower social status than other artists. The influence of Christianity brought change too, first as the Eastern Roman Empire sought to ban dance and condemned it for its pagan origins. However, as the Eastern Orthodox Church gradually began to grant concessions to the vast number of Greeks who had converted to Christianity, rendering dance acceptable by refining and spiritualizing it. This was similar to Christian reinterpretations of pre-Christian holidays, legends, and symbols. There are also similarities between Byzantine dance and modern Greek dance. Dance types  The dances that won the approval of the church were group dances, typically processions or circles in which men, separated from women, performed solemn decorous movements. However, the information on dancing at this period is very scarce. Actually, since the Byzantine art is mainly ecclesiastical, the references to dance are rare. Some images from the Byzantine and meta- Byzantine dances have been saved on sculptures, miniatures, and manuscripts – but mainly in church frescos amongst religious subjects. In his book Life and Culture of the Byzantines, Phaidon Koukoules assembled all known references to dance in texts of that time. From his writings, we learn that there were women's dances on Easter, nocturnal satirical dances in disguise on the Kalends, dances by itinerant bands of young men on the Roussalia. There were dances at weddings, in taverns, and at banquets. The wealthy invited professional harpists and youths and maidens to dance, being especially appreciated for their bodily agility and deft footwork. Dance spectacles staged in the theater in the accompaniment of flute and guitar were also mentioned. David glorified by the women of Israel, an example of Byzantine dance from the Paris Psalter manuscript. Though we have so few descriptions of Byzantine dances, we know that they were often 'intertwined'. The leader of the dance was called the koryphaios (κορυφαίος) or chorolektes (χορολέκτης) and it was he who began the song and made sure that the circle was maintained. Efstathios of Thessaloniki mentions a dance which commenced in a circle and ended with the dancers facing one another. When not dancing in a circle the dancers held their hands high or waved them to left and right. They held cymbals (very like the zilia of today) or a kerchief in their hands and their movements were emphasized by their long sleeves. As they danced, they sang, either set songs or extemporized ones, sometimes in unison, sometimes in refrain, repeating the verse sung by the lead dancer. The onlookers joined in, clapping the rhythm or singing. Professional singers, often the musicians themselves, composed lyrics to suit the occasion. In Constantinople, important events were celebrated with large public dances. On the return of the victorious Byzantine army, for instance, the citizens thronged the streets, danced with the soldiers and shouted in jubilation. There are instances recorded of people dancing inside the church, on Easter and Christmas, after Patriarch Theophylactos had granted his permission. Other times they danced and sang extemporized songs, making fun of the emperor. The soldiers danced as part of their drill and danced after maneuvers for amusement. The charioteers danced in the Hippodrome when they won their races and, the sailors danced an unmanly dance, full of twists and turns, as if imitating the spirals of the labyrinth.  Popular dances  Byzantine dances in popular culture included: *Syrtos (Συρτός; literally \\"dragged dance\\") *Geranos (Γερανός or Αγέρανος \\"circle dance\\") *Mantilia (Μαντίλια or Μαντήλια \\"kerchiefs\\") *Saximos (Σάξιμος) *Pyrrichios (Πυρρίχιος or Πυρρίχη \\"war dance\\") Court dances At the height of the Empire, court life \\"passed in a sort of ballet\\", with precise ceremonies prescribed for every occasion, to show that \\"Imperial power could be exercised in harmony and order\\", and \\"the Empire could thus reflect the motion of the Universe as it was made by the Creator\\", according to the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who wrote a Book of Ceremonies describing in enormous detail the annual round of the Court. Special forms of dress for many classes of people on particular occasions are set down; at the name-day dinner for the Emperor or Empress various groups of officials performed ceremonial dances, one group wearing \\"a blue and white garment, with short sleeves, and gold bands, and rings on their ankles. In their hands they hold what are called phengia\\". The second group do just the same, but wearing \\"a garment of green and red, split, with gold bands\\". These colours were the marks of the old chariot-racing factions, the four now merged to just the Blues and the Greens, and incorporated into the official hierarchy. Some dance historians imagine that these court dances by high officials were more like a restrained \\"stylized walk\\". Runciman However, enamel plaques on the Monomachus Crown, sent by the Byzantine Emperor to Hungary in about 1050, show courtly women dancing, with their hands over their head and one leg pulled back sharply behind them. They are shown waving long strips of fabric above their heads, such as when 'skipping rope'. Instruments Instruments in Byzantine music for dance included: *Organon *Single, double, or multiple flute *Sistrum (Σείστρον, \\"tambourine, instrument with bells\\") *Timpani (Τυμπάνι, \\"drum\\") *Psaltirio (Ψαλτήρι(ο)ν, \\"psalter\\") *Lyre (Λύρα) *Keras (Κέρας, \\"horn\\") *Kanonaki (Κανονάκι)  See also  * Byzantine music * Greek dances  References  *\\"Life and Culture of the Byzantines;\\" by Phaidon Koukoules. *\\"Medieval Byzantine Dance in Sacred and Secular Places;\\" article in 'Archaeologia and Techne' - March 2004. * \\"Byzantine Style and Civilization;\\" Steven Runciman; Penguin Books-1975. * \\"L'iconografia della danza nell'arte bizantina; in \\"Venezia Arti e Storia.

D.\\" Lewis (born October 16, 1945) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at Mississippi State University and was drafted in the sixth round of the 1968 NFL Draft. Lewis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2001. Early years Born in 1945 in Knoxville, Tennessee, Lewis was the youngest of 14 children. Lewis was named Dwight Douglas after two great generals in World War II, Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur. He attended Fulton High School, where he was a Tennessee All-State linebacker in 1963. College career Lewis starred at Mississippi State University from 1965 to 1967 as a two-way player and three-year starter. He led Mississippi State in tackles and assists all three of his varsity seasons and was named team captain his senior year. Despite being on teams that went 7-23, Lewis earned All-Southeastern Conference honors twice and was a first team All-American selection his senior year. Repeatedly anointed as the top linebacker in the Southeastern Conference, Lewis made a distinct impression on rival coaches. Hall of Fame coach Bear Bryant called D.D. Lewis \\"the best linebacker in the country\\". Bill Yeoman applauded Lewis' ability to recover and pursue and said he was the finest linebacker he had seen that year. Following the 1967 season, Vince Dooley said he was the best linebacker Georgia had faced – \\"He's terrific.\\". Lewis won numerous awards: SEC All- sophomore team (1965), All-SEC (1966–67), SEC defensive player of the year (1967), UPI second-team All-American (1967), outstanding athlete (1968). At the end of his senior year, Lewis was selected to play in the Senior Bowl, the Coaches All-America Game, and the Blue–Gray Game. For his accomplishments while at Mississippi State University, Lewis was inducted into the nation's College Football Hall of Fame in 2001. In 1987, Lewis was inducted into the state of Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame. Lewis is also a member of the Mississippi State, Blue–Gray Game, Knoxville, Mississippi and Tennessee sports Hall of Fame. Professional career Although he was a great college player, Lewis was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (159th overall) of the 1968 NFL Draft, because teams thought that he was too small to play in the NFL. As a rookie at training camp, the team tried him at center, before moving him to outside linebacker. In 1969, he spent what would have been his second season doing military service. In 1973 after serving as a backup for four seasons, Lewis took over the weakside linebacker position, when Chuck Howley retired, and held this position for nine straight years. His best game was in the 1975 season NFC Championship Game, when he intercepted two passes in a 37-7 victory against Los Angeles Rams, helping the Cowboys become the first wild-card team to make it to the Super Bowl. To this day, he holds the Cowboys playoff record with 27 games played. During his NFL career, Lewis played in 12 NFC Divisional Contests, one NFC Wild Card Contest and nine NFC Championship Games. He made five Super Bowl appearances while winning Super Bowl VI and Super Bowl XII. During the 1980 season, he became along with Larry Cole, the first three-decade players in franchise history. Lewis played for 13 years and started 135 consecutive games (third in team history), until his retirement after the 1981 season.

It was discovered by and named after, John W. Huffman. JWH-133, alongside WIN 55,212-2 and HU-210, is responsible for preventing the inflammation caused by Amyloid beta proteins involved in Alzheimer's Disease, in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers . This anti-inflammatory action is induced through agonist action at the CB2 receptor, which prevents microglial activation that elicits the inflammation. Additionally, cannabinoids at this receptor completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglia activation in rat models. It may be linked with anti-cancer properties, according to pre- trial data from a 2010 study in Madrid. Legal Status As the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration criminalizes any extract \\"containing one or more cannabinoids,\\" JWH-133 is a scheduled substance in the U.S. This is despite the low potential for abuse relative to its sister compounds such as JWH-018, as JWH-133 is selective for the non-psychoactive CB2 receptor and thus lacks significant psychoactive effects.

The duplication of the line was carried out north to Tallarook in 1883, and then south to Wandong in 1886. The first station building was provided in 1878, and for many years, the station had two goods sheds, one each side of the line, along with lengthy platforms for timber traffic. They were removed in 1909, and a cool store was erected. The present station building dates to 1960, when the station was rebuilt to accommodate the new standard gauge line to Albury. For the same reason, the goods shed, crane and livestock race were relocated to the west side of the main line. The majority of goods sidings have since been removed, along with a number of points leading into the sidings. Broadford Loop opened on the parallel standard gauge line in 1962, along with the line. In February 2019, the station was abolished as a double line block post, and the signal box, signals and all associated equipment was removed. Platforms & services Broadford has two side platforms.

Marcovaldo is a collection of 20 short stories written by Italo Calvino. It was initially published, in 1963, as Marcovaldo ovvero Le stagioni in città (Marcovaldo, or The Seasons in the City). The first stories were written in the early 1950s. Description The book is made up of a collection of twenty stories, of which the first takes place in the spring, the second in summer, the third in the autumn and the fourth in the winter and so on, so that together they represent the yearly seasonal cycle five times. An Author's note explains that: \\"The first in the series were written in the early 1950s and thus are set in a very poor Italy. The last stories date from the mid-60s, when the illusion of an economic boom flourished\\". In September 1983, an English translation of the book by William Weaver was published by Secker & Warburg. Plot summary The Marcovaldo series depicts the life of a poor rural man with his family living in a big industrial city in northern Italy. The central character of Marcovaldo is an unskilled labourer for the company Sbav and Co. who has an affinity with nature and a distaste for city life. He is married to Domitilla and they have a growing family, which includes their daughters Isolina and Teresa, and their sons Michelino, Pietruccio, Filippetto and Fiordaligi. Other characters include Marcovaldo's foreman, Signor Viligelmo, the street-cleaner Amadigi, and the night watchman Tornaquinci. In each story Marcovaldo succumbs to something that appears natural and beautiful but actually disappoints him. Common themes in the stories include pollution, appearance vs. reality, failure, poverty and consumerism. The stories in the book are: :*Mushrooms in the city – Marcovaldo spots some mushrooms growing at his tram stop and jealously guards them until it rains and he can harvest them for a much-anticipated supper. :*Park-bench vacation – Marcovaldo spends a hot summer night sleeping on a park-bench, but it is not the peaceful experience he had longed for. :*The municipal pigeon – Seeing a rare flight of autumn woodcock flying over the city, Marcovaldo schemes to lure and catch them on the roof of his building. :*The city lost in the snow – Marcovaldo’s daydreams in the snow end abruptly. :*The wasp treatment – Marcovaldo enlists the help of his children in catching wasps, which he uses to cure the rheumatism of his neighbours. :*A Saturday of sun, sand, and sleep – The children bury their father in the warm sand on a river barge as a treatment for his rheumatism. :*The lunch-box – Marcovaldo and a rich young boy exchange their lunches. :*The forest on the superhighway – The children help their father find firewood in an unusual forest. :*The good air – Marcovaldo takes his children to the hills on the outskirts of the city for some fresh air. :*A journey with the cows – Marcovaldo is envious of his son, Michelino, when the boy spends the summer in the mountains after following a herd of cows crossing the city at night on their way to their alpine pastures. :*The poisonous rabbit – After spending time in a hospital convalescing, Marcovaldo inadvertently takes a rabbit home and then plans to fatten it up for Christmas. :*The wrong stop – Marcovaldo gets lost in thick fog after a night at the cinema. :*Where the river is more blue? – After a series of health scares in the city involving contaminated food, Marcovaldo attempts to feed his family fresh fish. :*Moon and Gnac – Marcovaldo’s efforts to teach his children about the night sky are thwarted by the neon sign on the roof of the building opposite his own. :*The rain and the leaves – Marcovaldo tries to nurse a potted plant to health. :*Marcovaldo at the supermarket – Marcovaldo’s family get carried away when they dream of emulating the wealthy consumers they see around them. :*Smoke, wind, and soap-bubbles – The children start collecting coupons for free washing powder. :*The city all to himself – Unable to afford a holiday, Marcovaldo wanders the deserted streets of the city. :*The garden of stubborn cats – Following a cat during his lunchbreak, Marcovaldo discovers the secret refuge of the city’s cats. :*Santa’s Children – The company he works for chooses Marcovaldo to dress as Santa and deliver Christmas presents to its important clients; his children unwittingly start a new trend in gifts.  Critical reception  Writing in The New York Times in 1984, Franco Ferrucci noted of Calvino that: \\"Even early in his career, his rhetorical virtuosity disguised the subtlety and depth of his vision - especially in some of the stories in Marcovaldo, like The City Lost in the Snow, A Saturday of Sun, Sand and Sleep and The Wrong Stop. He writes lightly and jauntily; any trace of effort is concealed. But what catches the reader goes beyond the unspotted perfection of the style; it is his uninhibited poetic sense of life.\\" Ferrucci added that, \\"What is so much admired by the readers of Mr. Calvino's later Invisible Cities was already at work in Marcovaldo and with a more cogent narrative drive. Invisible Cities seems like a memory, while Marcovaldo conveys the sensuous, tangible qualities of life\\".  TV adaptation In 1970, Italian state TV company RAI broadcast a six-episode mini-series based on Marcovaldo with Nanni Loy in the title role and Didi Perego playing his wife, Domitilla.

Retrieved 30 September 2014. They like to visit their local pub together where their friends Winston Ingram, Tam Mullen and Eric often hang about. Other main characters include: Boabby the barman, Navid Harrid, owner of the local corner shop, and Jack and Victor's nosy neighbour Isa Drennan. Many of the main characters' relatives make recurring appearances in the show such as; Navid's wife Meena, Tam's wife Frances and Isa's ex-husband Harry. Jack's daughter and Victor's son John make few appearances in the show, but have major plot roles in the few episodes they do appear in. Other recurring characters include: Chris the Postie, Stevie the Bookie and several other pub-goers. Main characters= Jack Jarvis : Appears in all 62 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Jack Jarvis is played by Ford Kiernan. He has been best friends with Victor for sixty years and they are neighbours who live on the same floor of Osprey Heights, a tower block in Craiglang. Jack is a widower; his wife Jean died in 1991. The couple had a daughter, Fiona, who emigrated to Toronto. Jack spends most of his time with Victor, often visiting their local pub - The Clansman. Jack is shown to be slightly less smart than Victor, and more likely to be swayed by peer pressure from Winston and Tam. Additionally, he is prone to malapropisms, such as saying \\"discretion\\" instead of \\"desecration.\\" However, Jack has shown himself to be more observant than Victor on several occasions—notably when, in the episode \\"Wummin,\\" he recognises (albeit incorrectly) that Bert Findlay's strange behaviour shows signs of an impending suicide. Jack seems to have less of a way with words than Victor, sometimes trying to say something witty but only coming up with a one-word insult. Jack also seems to be more easily offended and quick to anger than Victor. In his younger days, Jack worked in his father's butcher shop, and was an amateur boxer. In the first episode, \\"Flittin',\\" Jack was said to be 74 years old, the same age as Victor. In all other episodes, his age is stated as 72. Jack is a stout, squat man with white hair (though it was once ginger) and a moustache. He can frequently be seen wearing a bunnet when outdoors. In a sketch on the sister programme Chewin' the Fat, his surname was given as McAlpine.  Victor McDade : Appears in all 62 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Victor McDade is played by Greg Hemphill. He has been best friends with Jack for sixty years, who also lives on the same floor at Osprey Heights. Victor has lived in Osprey Heights for much longer than Jack, as revealed in the first episode of the first series \\"Flittin'.\\" Like Jack, Victor is a widower; his wife Elizabeth (Betty) died in 1993, though in the episode \\"Courtin,\\" Victor states that his wife has been dead longer than Jack's. Victor has a son, John (called Jamie in the first episode), who lives in Johannesburg with his family. Victor seems to be slightly more intelligent than Jack, sometimes correcting Jack or cutting him off when he begins to ramble by saying: \\"That's plenty, Jack.\\" Of all the pensioners in Craiglang, Victor is frequently shown to be the most honest; for example, in \\"Cauld,\\" Victor is the final holdout when all of the pensioners begin stealing electricity (he condemns all who participate in the scheme as thieves), and expresses disapproval at Winston's decision to fake a bad leg in order to acquire a home help. Victor is 74 at the beginning of the series, but had his birthday in \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" making him 75. In his youth, Victor worked with \\"Babcock & Wilcox\\", presumably an engineer. He is a tall man, with grey hair, formerly black, and a moustache like Jack. Initially Victor wore a bunnet like Jack's; this was changed after the first episode to a trilby hat to add visual distinction between the two characters.  Winston Ingram : Appears in all 62 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" A good friend of Jack and Victor's, Winston Ingram is played by Paul Riley. He is known for his scheming and attempts to cheat the system, usually in search of extra money, for example committing benefit fraud to make his life a little more comfortable. However, he seems to have some sense of morality, often reprimanding Tam for his meanness. In the episodes \\"Dug\\" and \\"Holiday,\\" he also pretends to have a relationship with Isa to fend off the attempts of her ex-husband, Harry, to get back with her. He has several enemies, including Stevie the Bookie. In the episode \\"Scran\\", it was revealed Winston used to work in the Clyde shipyards, at Yarrows. Winston has his leg amputated at the end of the third series after his eighty-a-day cigarette habit catches up with him. He is known to have a daughter named Margaret, a son named Brian, and two grandsons, Joe and Thomas. Winston often takes advantage of Isa's kindness and soft spot towards him in order to receive free food from her. In the ninth series, he meets Winnie, a wheelchair-bound woman that he first meets on Tinder. The two marry in the episode \\"Hitched.\\" In the earlier stage play, he mentions a brother living in Nevada and a son who died in a car accident in the 1960s but it is unknown if this is correct with the television series. In the TV canon, he does have a brother named Walter.  Boabby (The Barman) Taylor : Appears in all 62 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Boabby (West of Scotland version of 'Bobby'; real name Robert Taylor) is played by Gavin Mitchell. Boabby is the landlord of the Clansman, the local pub. He is not a believer in the phrase \\"the customer is always right\\" and prefers to hand out snide comments with his pints, though the locals are not the type of people to take them lying down. He has a new nickname for Jack and Victor each time they enter The Clansman but Jack and Victor always have a wittier comeback, putting him in his place, often with the catchphrase \\"Two pints, prick!!\\". It has been revealed that he had a brief career as an amateur porn star, where he went under the name of \\"Troy the Gardener.\\" In the episode \\"Who's the Daddy?\\" Boabby reveals he has been working behind the bar of the Clansman since he was eighteen, though apparently he previously worked as a bouncer at QM Union at Glasgow University. He usually has grievances with either Winston (usually barring him for various antics), or Tam (who refuses to pay for his drinks). Although Boabby is sarcastic and mouthy by nature, he occasionally shows he that he has a charitable and honourable side, and demonstrates more respect for Isa than do the pensioners . In the episode \\"The Fall Guy,\\" Boabby is revealed to be fifty years old. In the last scene of the final episode \\"Over the Hill\\", Boabby is seen some years later as a substantially older man still working in The Clansman, where he welcomes the viewers to the pub.  Isa Drennan : Appears in 61 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Isa Drennan is played by Jane McCarry. Isa is the third resident of Jack and Victor's landing in Osprey Heights. She is known as the local gossip and will stop at nothing in her quest to find out the latest news. Isa works as a cleaner in Navid's shop, and she is shown to be a practicing Roman Catholic. She has an estranged husband named Harry who frequently carried out illicit affairs with younger women while they were together. In the episode \\"Gairden,\\" she mentions that she has a son named Colin. In \\"Dug\\" and \\"Hoaliday\\", she had a pretend relationship with Winston; although unrequited, Isa has a secret flame for Winston but her obsession with gossip and tendency to be nosy often sabotages her chances with him, as he finds these qualities highly irritating. Isa is heavily involved with community projects and charities, attends dance classes and enjoys aiding others. Winston maintains this is her way of keeping in touch with people to 'keep on tap with everyone's business.' Despite the fact that many people outwardly profess to be annoyed by Isa, she is still regarded as a vital member of the community, with the other pensioners immediately leaping to defend her if they feel she is being treated unjustly.  Thomas \\"Tam\\" Mullen : Appears in 60 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Thomas \\"Tam\\" Mullen is portrayed by Mark Cox. A self-confessed \\"miserable bastard\\", he is always tricking people into giving him free belongings or buying him a drink, and is known for his unapologetic greed. (In Scottish patois, \\"miserable\\" is equated with \\"miserly\\", \\"thrifty\\", or \\"stingy\\", not \\"sad\\" or \\"mean\\" as in many other cultures.) Tam enters competitions to get hold of free goods (which, much to the others' annoyance, he always wins), and in some episodes appears to be almost delirious at the thought of getting freebies. He married the local librarian, Frances Drummond, in the episode \\"Ring.\\" His materialistic attitude often causes a rift between himself and his wife, but at 70, Tam became father to Tam Junior and Frances became Britain's oldest mum. Tam is a DJ at the Western General Hospital and often manages to con the terminally ill out of their valuable possessions. He tends to be Winston's 'double act' partner, and Winston is the best man at Tam and Frances’ wedding. Tam occasionally demonstrates a more generous side. For example, in the two- part episode \\"Dead Leg\\", Tam fakes his death in order to use his life insurance money to pay for Winston to go to Switzerland to save his remaining leg, which was due to be amputated.  Navid Harrid : Appears in 57 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Navid Harrid is played by Sanjeev Kohli. Navid runs the local shop with his soap opera-loving wife Meena. Navid and Meena came to Craiglang in 1975 after having secretly eloped from India as Meena was due to be wed in an arranged marriage. Navid has many witty one- liners but has to put up with Meena's constant nagging and insults. Although he and Meena spend most of their time verbally sparring, he occasionally reveals he is still in love with her and grows jealous when she goes to India to visit her sister but ends up instead visiting an old flame. They have a daughter who got married in the first series. Navid is a Muslim who laments the fact that his religion forbids both gambling and the consumption of alcohol. Ford Kiernan has stated the name of Navid's shop 'Harrid's' is a play on the famous department store, 'Harrods.'  Eric : Appears in 56 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Grim up north\\" \\"Auld\\" Eric is played by James Martin. He sees himself as \\"a young man trapped in an old man's body.\\" He is often seen talking with Tam and Winston. Eric seems to have spent all his time in The Clansman or else in the local bookies. In \\"Hot Seat\\" it is revealed that he served in the fire service and the navy. When Boabby couldn't be in the pub, Eric was often chosen to cover for him, much to the joy of the regulars. Eric dies in series 8. Along with Shug (below), he is one of the few characters who is played by an actor who is genuinely of pensionable age. Recurring characters=Meena Harrid : Appears in 27 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to Over The Hill Meena, portrayed by Shamshad Akhtar, is Navid's wife. As a tribute to Maris Crane from the sitcom Frasier, her face is never seen (except for a brief moment in the final episode), and she always appears in the room near the counter. Although she seems to understand English, she mostly speaks in Hindi and Punjabi, frequently insulting the other characters without their knowledge.  Peggy McAlpine  : Appears in 15 episodes from \\"Flittin'\\" to \\"Over The Hill\\" Peggy is Jack's overweight ex-neighbour. She is very violent, often manhandling her husband, Charlie. Despite her aggressive nature, she seems to be friendly with Isa and many other locals. She also seems to enjoy irritating Winston, especially when it comes to buying the last gigot chops at the butchers. She is known to have an 18-year-old son, Simon, who was charged with drunk driving at the age of 12.  Pete the Jakey : Appears in 13 episodes from \\"Cauld\\" to \\"Plum Number\\" Peter McCormack (better known as \\"Pete The Jakey\\") is a familiar sight to residents of Craiglang. The archetypal tramp, Pete also has a very active imagination. Ignored by many, he seems to have always been about; he often is seen sleeping outside Navid's. A man of many secrets, it is later revealed that he was the father of the property developer who wanted to demolish The Clansman and that he may or may not work for the government. He also may be the inventor of the famous \\"Beefy Bake.\\" As actor Jake D'Arcy died shortly before the writing of the seventh series, Pete's funeral took place during the second episode of that series. In Pete's will, it is revealed that Boabby gave him fry-ups free-of-charge for his breakfast and as a gesture of goodwill, had nominated Boabby for a Glasgow Good Citizen's Award.  Shug  : Appears in 11 episodes from \\"Faimly\\" to \\"Over The Hill\\" Hugh \\"Shug\\" McLaughlin (played by Paul Young), who has extremely large ears (earning him the nickname \\"Shug the Lug,\\" lug being the Scots word for ear), seems to be a self-proclaimed expert in radios and sound waves. He was a communications officer during World War II and he often tells long, rambling stories about it, much to Victor's and Jack's annoyance. Despite this, due to his technological knowledge, Jack and Victor often rely on Shug for help. Shug can apparently hear through walls and across streets due to his ears. Shug has a part-time job as an overnight security guard in Delanys department store. In \\"Cat's Whiskers\\", Shug and Edith become the cover stars of Twilight Monthly magazine. In the final episode, it is revealed that Shug and Edith are now in a relationship. Methadone Mick :Appears in 10 episodes from \\"The Undrinkables\\" to \\"Over the Hill\\" Methadone Mick (portrayed by Scott Reid), is a young recovering drug addict who lives under a bridge and was a friend of Pete the Jakey. In \\"Job\\", Jack and Victor give him a clean up for a job interview, which he gets at Glasgow City Chambers. However, in the following episode \\"Small Change\\", he is once again jobless. He was once seen with rotting teeth but in \\"Job\\", he acquired a set of false teeth that he unknowingly claimed from a home dentist and since then, is now always seen with them. He also briefly took on the job of being a football mascot and a lifeguard. At the end of the final episode he is shown to have cleaned up his act and is working at the Craiglang library and still has his false teeth. Chris \\"the Postie\\" Armstrong : Appears in 10 episodes from \\"Waddin'\\" to \\"Gadgets\\" Played by Sandy Nelson, Chris is Craiglang's local postman. Not exactly the brightest young lad, it often falls to one of the older gentlemen to explain a seemingly easily understandable situation to him. Chris seems to be a very lazy postman, and often leaves \\"Sorry You Were Out\\" cards deliberately when he can't be bothered delivering people's parcels. Despite these shortcomings, Chris is revealed to be a talented painter and decorator, managing to satisfactorily redecorate Isa's flat after Jack and Victor spectacularly botch the job. Frances Mullen : Appears in 10 episodes from \\"Doacters\\" To \\"Over the hill\\" Played by Kate Donnelly, Frances (whose maiden name has been given as both Kirkwood and Drummond) works at the library in Craiglang and is married to Tam. In series 2, Winston and Tam both battle for her affections and Tam is eventually victorious. The couple marry in the episode \\"Ring\\" in series 4. In \\"One in One Out\\" Frances has a baby at the age of 64, whilst Tam is aged 70. Frances also has a sister, played by Dorothy Paul. Stevie Reid : Appears in 8 episodes from \\"Cauld\\" to \\"Hitched\\" Stevie Reid (better known as \\"Stevie the Bookie\\") is another of Winston's nemeses; he often taunts Winston about his betting. He is arrogant and is disliked by many people in Craiglang. In \\"Cairds\\" he is bankrupted by Winston. After stealing Winston's winnings and fleeing, he returns in \\"Drama\\" posing as his fictional older brother Frankie. While everyone else in Craiglang falls for this act, Winston sees through it and confronts him, ultimately forcing Stevie to give him his earnings. In \\"Seconds Out,\\" Stevie and Bobby fight each other for the girl who works in the Pizza shop. Neither of them are successful, as the girl's dad is the boxer Jim Watt, who knocks both men out. In early episodes his name was listed on his shop as Stevie Barret. Joe Douglass : Appears in 4 episodes from \\"Cairds\\" to \\"Cat's Whiskers\\" A footballer in his youth, Joe Douglass was once quick on his feet, but in his old age, he is confined to a mobility scooter. In \\"Lights Out\\" He moves into the flat below Winston since it is lower down and allows Winston to offer him assistance. Edith : Appears in 7 episodes from \\"Courtin'\\" to \\"Over The Hill\\" Edith, played by Maureen Carr, is the sister of the charity shop worker Barbara. She has a hunchback, numerous moles, and misshapen teeth. She first appears as Victor's \\"date\\" in the episode \\"Courtin'\\" and is also featured in the episode \\"Swottin',\\" where she has the role of quizmaster during Bobby's quiz night. She enjoys a pint of Guinness. Despite her unflattering appearance, she seems to have no problems getting men in bed, once waking up in bed with Winston, and once more with Boabby. In \\"Hot Seat\\" she strikes up a conversation with a man as ugly as she is and they discuss past sexual encounters. In \\"Cat's Whiskers\\", Edith gets a makeover (e.g. having her moles removed and having fluid drained from her, which was the reason for her hunchback) and becomes a cover star of Twilight Monthly magazine along with Shug. Guest stars ; As themselves : *John McCririck appears on Winston's television set, giving him tips on which horse to back at the bookmakers in \\"Drama\\". *Jim Watt appears in \\"Seconds Out\\" as the celebrity guest for a charity bottle smash at the local pub, The Clansman. He hands out passes for his gym in Shawbank. *Michelle McManus also appears in \\"Seconds Out\\". She turns up to The Clansman as the celebrity guest but is told by Bobby that he had got Jim Watt instead. In the closing scene Winston delivers five pizzas to Michelle's house and she explains the reason is that she has just split up with her boyfriend. *Lorraine Kelly appears in \\"One in One Out\\" on her own breakfast television show and interviews Frances and Tam after Frances became the oldest mother in Britain at 64 years old. *Midge Ure *Clare Grogan *Amy Macdonald appears in \\"Hitched\\", as somebody that Boabby knew from his days at QM.

Fiona was born and raised in Craiglang but now lives in Canada with her husband Tony and two sons Jack Jr. and Stephen. She is close to her father, regularly phoning him, unlike Victor's son John. Jack and Victor both visit her at the end of Series 2, when Jack gives her the wedding ring that belonged to her mother.

He pulls some strings so Jack could move in to the flat next door to Victor. He also is responsible for Winston moving to Finport on the episode \\"All the Best\\": when he realises that Winston is on invalidity benefits, he suggests a new housing initiative in Finport which turns out to be sheltered housing. Wullie MacIntosh (2002, 2004) - Wullie MacIntosh was a pensioner who gained a reputation for borrowing things from the Craiglang residents - and never returning them. In episode \\"Waddin\\", he was wrongly thought to have died in hospital (it was a younger man with the same name) and everything he had borrowed was claimed back by their rightful owners. In the episode \\"Swottin'\\", he auditioned for the role of quizmaster, but was not chosen. Shortly after that episode was broadcast, Johnny Irving, the actor who portrayed Wullie, died, so the character was never seen again.

Sinead (2003, 2005–2006, 2016) The waitress at the local cafe, Sinead doesn't put much enthusiasm into her job. She was supposed to be marrying Fergie. She had made a reappearance in “Small Change” Series 7, and then again in \\"Dead Leg: Part Two\\". Margo (2004) The Clansman Quizmaster whom Bobby takes a liking to. He asks out on a date, but ends up getting beaten up by her for playfully slapping her on the bum, which Winston teases him about afterwards. Big Arthur (2003-2007) Another Clansman regular, often seen helping out Jack, Victor, Winston or Tam. Jack has commented he has \\"plenty of padding\\" and he doesn't seem to know the rules of Blackjack. Mick (2005-2006) Mick appears to be a tough bloke from the rough yet clean Eagle Heights flats, and is also a friend of Tam. He was first seen during the time Jack and Victor were rumoured to be gay and later made an appearance as one of the cast for \\"Blightly's Hardest Boozers\\". Neddy Mum (2007) The bane of Navid, always coming in to complain of the state of his confectionery and asking for refunds. Navid in return refuses to do so and insults her and her toddler son, whom she refers to as \\"Ma Wee Justin\\" and makes numerous insulting insinuations about her being a drug addict, primarily with the phrase \\"Git oot, you junkie bastard!\\" Charlie (2006-2007) A very large man, seemingly obese, enough even to make the Osprey Heights lift break. Joe (2002) Winston's grandson. Winston managed Joe for boxing, but was unsuccessful. Winston wanted his friends to offer Joe as much support as possible. Everyone in Craiglang thought that Joe was a rubbish boxer, much to Winston's annoyance. Barbara (2002) Played by Eileen McCallum. A lady who volunteers in the local charity shop and Edith's sister. She is attractive and has big breasts. Jack fancied her but was reluctant to ask her out because he feared it would betray the memory of his late wife Jean. Victor encouraged him by saying that Jean would want Jack to be happy. Jack and Barbara started a relationship during which Victor was left on his own. Eventually Isa told Victor that Barbara was married and Victor confronted Barbara telling her that she should not be with Jack. This ended their relationship and Jack and Victor became friends again. Ronnie (2003) An elderly man, formerly a quiz show contestant, who took a 'goofy turn' in George Square: he stripped down to his boxers and began bawling and shouting. The police came and arrested him. His son, Norman, put him in an asylum. Jack and Victor visited him in the hospital and he seemed fine to them. Ronnie explained that he had a dream that he was 10 years old and that he was on a beach. Jack and Victor believed this was reasonable and signed their friend out of the asylum by pretending to be his brothers. Mrs Begg (2003) Played by Celia Imrie. A 'home help' worker. She is attractive and is employed to help out pensioners in the Craiglang area who have disabilities. In particular, Mrs Begg was Winston's home help; however, she was highly suspicious of Winston's sore leg. After finding out about his deception, she banned him from using her services. However, she is forced to resume being Winston's home help after he, Jack and Victor discovered that she was having an affair with Bert Findlay. Bert Findlay (2003) Played by Brian Pettifer. A friend of Jack and Victor's. He is depressed because his wife, Annie, has died. Jack and Victor being widowers themselves try to help their friend and prevent him from committing suicide.

Vince Gallagher (2003) Played by David Hayman. The local mobile snack bar owner, Vince used to run the canteen at Yarrows where Winston worked, but he was very unhygienic. He made a stew, which caused Winston and hundreds of other men to have food poisoning. Vince was sacked but, years later, Winston confronted him and saw that he was running a mobile snack bar. Vince claimed that he had changed his ways but Winston does not trust him. Vince proves that he is immaculate and the builders are satisfied with his food. At the same time, Navid is away in India for his brother's funeral and Jack and Victor are running the shop in his absence. Winston takes advantage of this and along with Jack and Victor, turns Navid's shop into a snack bar, distracting the workers from Vince. Vince took his revenge by sabotaging the soup, causing the customers of Navid's shop to have diarrhoea. Winston then planted cockroaches on Vince's van, making out Vince's food to be contaminated. With his business and his reputation shattered, Vince broke down and drove his van through Navid's shop when the latter returned from India. Vince got out of the van and is still at large. Big Innes (2004) Played by Clive Russell. A large man who is friendly with the Craiglang locals. He is so big, he drinks four pints at a time and eats cornflakes from a soup pot. When he lived in Craiglang, he did not stand for any nonsense from Neds and would sort them out. However, he moved away up north to Elgin. Recently, the Neds in Craiglang have become worse than ever. Jack decided to phone Innes up in Elgin and ask him if he could come down and sort out the Neds. Innes' wife agrees to let Innes go down, but makes Jack promise not to give him any Midori. Innes likes to drink Midori, but it has a strange effect on him. Jack lets Innes stay at his house and Innes sets to work. After two days of Innes' arrival, the neds never bother anyone again. Not for a while. Unfortunately, Isa unwittingly gives Innes a bottle of Midori causing him to go mental in the Clansman. Kevin (2004) Played by Jordan Young. A young supermarket worker. Kevin is 24 and is extremely ageist. He is cocky and is a bully at heart. One night he accidentally switched off a fridge, ruining a pile of dairy products.

Recently, Winston had to take a job at FoodFare due to his excessive spending. Kevin hassles Winston from their first meeting. Andy offers Winston advice on how to beat Kevin, but Winston ignores Andy. Eventually, Jack and Victor came into FoodFare. It was an emergency attempt to take all the bottles of Midori away before Big Innes came. They succeeded but Kevin, seeing the three old men, insults Winston. By this time, Winston has had enough. He punches Kevin and quits his job. Andy witnesses this and is glad that Winston defeated Kevin. Archie (2004) Played by Sylvester McCoy. A reclusive man. Despite being a friend of Jack and Victor, he hasn't set foot outside his house since the mid-1960s. His reason for this is that he was evacuated during the war to a farm and was comfortable with a peaceful life. When he returned to Craiglang, it was like New York to him. In 1966, he put his boot through his TV after England's victory in the World Cup. Because of his reclusive lifestyle, the social services would visit him, making sure he was alright for food, clothes and money. In 2004, his house was to be demolished so he came out his home for the first time in decades. Jack, Victor and the Craiglang locals welcomed him out and encouraged him not to shut himself in again, without success. John McDade (2004) Victor and Betty's son. John only appeared once in Still Game, but was regularly referred to. John lives in South Africa with his family. He doesn't keep in contact with his father much. This upsets Victor, because he misses his son deeply. Victor is so annoyed with John, he sometimes refers to him as an \\"uncaring bastard\\". To try to get more attention from his son, Victor pretended he was ill. This news worried John so much that he flew over from South Africa to Craiglang to be at his father's side. John later discovered that Victor was only pretending to be ill and he was annoyed. Victor apologised, but pointed out to John that it was due to lack of contact. John understood he was on the wrong as well and they made up. At least for now. Rena (2005) The lady who works in the cafe. Rena is a widow and she is having an affair with Wullie Reid, a man almost twice her age. Wullie is a friend of Jack and Victor's. They believe it's good for Wullie that he's found love, but Isa believes that Rena is trying to kill Wullie in order to keep his house. For example, Rena has Wullie working hard for her and Isa thinks Wullie will end up dying from being overworked. Nobody believes Isa until Rena comes into Navid's and buys a bottle of white spirits, a box of matches and a packet of Jammie Dodgers. Even Navid believed that Rena was going to set a trap for Wullie and felt that Isa was not as crazy as he had thought. That night, there is a storm. Wullie is on the roof of his house fixing the TV aerial when he slips and crashes through the greenhouse. Isa looks out her window and sees the police and an ambulance outside his house. She knocks on Jack and Victor's and asks them to come with her. However, it is revealed that Wullie has survived the fall, but Rena has died. Rena had heard the noise and came running down the stairs, but tripped and broke her neck. Wullie Reid (2005) A Craiglang pensioner. Wullie is friendly with Jack and Victor but is having a relationship with Rena, a woman half his age. He believes he is really in love, but Isa suspects that Rena means to kill Wullie. Jack and Victor think it's funny that Wullie is \\"shagging\\" Rena. One stormy night, Wullie is on the room fixing the TV aerial for Rena when he slips and falls off the roof. He ended up crashing through the greenhouse. Miraculously he survived, but Rena heard the noise, and fell down the stairs breaking her neck. Wullie is devastated at her death, but fancies the female paramedic. Davie (2005) Played by Robbie Coltrane. A bus driver working for Dial-a-Bus. Although Davie appears to be friendly and helpful, he suffers from manic depression. This is due to his mother not being well. His mother's illness means that she only eats doughnuts from Greggs and causes her to be cranky with her son. Despite this, Davie determines to work hard and doesn't charge the pensioners for the fares. Jack and Victor get used to this service. One day, he returns to work very quickly after being off with his depression. Because Isa had doughnuts from Greggs, the sight of this causes Davie to have a mental breakdown and he terrorises the passengers. He stops when he nearly ran over Boabby who was riding his bike. The passengers attempted to shut him out the bus but let him in when he promises to take them to a pub. He explains his sad story and Jack, Victor, Isa and Boabby forgive him. Thomas (2005) Winston's other grandson. Thomas is a ned, who causes trouble for his parents. His mother, Margaret, warned him that if he didn't behave, he wouldn't be coming on holiday with them. This ended up happening and Thomas had to stay with Winston, while his parents were away. Winston was cross and was determined to straighten out Thomas. However, Thomas smuggled in a girl, a cannabis plant disguised as a tomato plant and his friends. His friends made cookies containing cannabis, making Winston believe they killed his tomato plant. They even ate Winston's pies that were meant to be for his dinner. Winston was very annoyed and was going to grass on Thomas until he ate the cookies. Winston got stoned and Thomas was off the hook. Chris Howden (2005) A property developer. Chris had made plans to demolish the Clansman. This news upset Boabby and the regulars. Even Navid was concerned because, if the only pub in town was to close, his shop would be next. Jack, Victor and Winston made a protest, but it didn't go well. Chris offered to buy them a drink, which they accepted. Chris explained that he wanted to demolish the Clansman in order to recreate the houses that used to stand there. This is because his mother was brought up in one of these houses. However, he reveals that his mother's name was Jenny Turnbull, a woman who Jack, Victor and Winston had sexual relationships with. This meant that one of them could be Chris' father. They are worried that their families would be disgusted, but Boabby believes that this could save the pub, since no one would demolish their father's favourite pub. None of the men is successful in finding out but it is Isa who susses it out when she sees an old photo of Winston's that she took. Isa worked out that Pete 'the Jakey' was missing from the photo and he must have had sex with Jenny. Furthermore, Pete has a letter from Jenny proving he is the father of Chris. Chris decides to keep the pub, but renames it 'Jennys' in honour of his mother. Molly Drummond (2006) Played by Dorothy Paul. The sister of Frances (Tam's wife) and Tam's sister in-law. Molly lives in Finport, on the coast and came to Craiglang to visit her sister. Molly didn't manage to make it to Tam and Frances’ wedding. In the past, Molly was a famous singer and was recognised by Jack. Tam claims that Frank Sinatra bought her a drink when she performed in New York, although this is probably a lie in order to get a free round from Boabby. Tam discovered that Molly was just as tight fisted as he is. Tam thought this was a turn on saying as Frances disapproves of his stinginess. Because Frances is busy at the library, Tam has to show Molly around Craiglang. Eventually, Tam decides to lay his feeling for Molly to rest since he is already married and rejects her: Molly is upset and grabs Tam's balls. Cameron \\"Cammy\\" Hastie (2016) Played by Kevin Whately. A home dentist who is a friend of Jack and Victor. He used to be a professional dentist before he got struck off for removing four teeth from a woman who, unbeknownst to Cammy, appeared in toothpaste adverts. When preparing Methadone Mick for a job interview, Jack and Victor notice that his teeth are rotten and take him to Cammy to tend to them. Cammy gives Mick a pair of white false teeth to replace the rotten ones. Appears in \\"Job\\". Mrs Fletcher (2016) Played by Ronni Ancona. The owner of a residential care home that Jack, Victor and Isa temporary stay at whilst waiting for new homes, as Osprey Heights is set to be demolished. She starts off as friendly, but reveals her true nature as being stern and strict when she confiscates the home's remote control from Jack and Victor after they \\"forced\\" the other residents to watch the programme they were watching. She also places a 9 pm curfew for the residents not to leave the home due to the residents escaping after Jack and Victor leave the doors open to go to the Clansman. Jack and Victor contact Boabby and inform him that they won't be able to come to the party at the Clansman due to the curfew. This results in Boabby, Winston, Tam, Navid and the other party guests going to the home to have the party there. The following morning, Mrs. Fletcher sees Jack, Victor, Isa and the guests escaping and discovers Navid asleep in one of the chairs. After Navid wakes up, Mrs. Fletcher tells him that the doors are locked and she has called the police. Luckily, Navid is able to escape by throwing a water cooler through the home's glass doors. Iain Duncan \\"I.D.\\" Sheathing (2018-2019) played by Bruce Morton. The new Undertaker in Craiglang after the previous one, Mr McLeary, died. Isa starts telling stories that Sheathing is the Grim Reaper and that anyone he touches dies within a week. This is re-enforced by his ominous appearance: he is a tall, gaunt man who always wears a full-length black leather coat and fedora. At first, people dismiss the stories as nonsense but suspicion grows when Eric drops dead shortly after Sheathing pats him on the arm. He follows Isa home and talks to her, Jack and Victor. He explains that Eric was 85 and had a heart condition, and goes on to explain that the only reason he was following them was so he could learn more about Eric's life in order to deliver a fitting eulogy at his Funeral. The name I.D. Sheathing is an anagram of Death is Nigh. Callum Coburn (2018) played by Craig Ferguson. An old friend of Isa, who left Craiglang to become a stuntman in Hollywood. Callum returns to Craiglang 49 years later and hopes to reconnect with Isa and his old life after deciding to retire from his job. During filming for Lassie, he had his penis bitten off by a dog. He appeared to be a handsome man with short hair and white teeth, but when Isa agrees to start a relationship with him, she is shocked to see that he is actually overweight and toothless, with long balding hair. Upset about Isa not loving his true self, Callum (whilst giving Boabby a driving lesson) attempts to commit suicide by driving the car into a canal. Jack and Victor attempt to save them, but get into trouble. Fortunately Methadone Mick is able to save the four men by throwing them life buoys. Afterwards, Callum leaves Craiglang, but not before apologising to Isa for not being what he seemed and promises to keep in touch. He appears in \\"The Fall Guy\\".

It serves the town of Tallarook, and opened on 18 April 1872.Tallarook Vicsig Former station School House Lane / Dysart Sidings / Goulburn Junction was located between Tallarook and Seymour. History The station opened in 1872, along with the line though it, and became a junction for the Mansfield branch line to Yea in 1883, with the line extended to Mansfield in 1891, and Alexandra in 1909. A turntable was added when the station became a junction, and the main line was duplicated from Broadford in the same year, with the double track being extended north in 1886. The first interlocked signal box was erected in 1885, controlling three platforms and a four road yard. The crossovers for the branch line initially faced Seymour, requiring Melbourne-bound trains to reverse; a Melbourne-facing crossover was added in 1911. When the parallel standard gauge line was built through the station in 1961, it cut right through the middle of the station, with three gauge crossings provided between the broad gauge main line and the sidings on the other side. A new signal box was also opened at this time, with a crossing loop on the standard gauge line opening in 1969, the only one added after the initial construction of the line. Tallarook served as the junction for the Mansfield line to Mansfield and Alexandra until 1978, with the last regular passenger train to Mansfield operating in 1977. After the line to Mansfield was closed, one of the gauge crossings was removed in 1979, with another removed at the Down end in 1981. The last connection to the goods yard was abolished in 1984, but the signals for them remained, until the signal box was closed in 1987, and the station left as straight track. Work on extending Tallarook Loop on the standard gauge line into a 6.8-kilometre-long passing lane commenced in 2008. Work included extending the existing loop southwards, installation of higher speed points at each end, and resignalling.Program of Works South Improvement Alliance Platforms & services Tallabrook has two side platforms.

His chambers are located in Portland, Oregon. Early life Born in New York City, New York, O'Scannlain received a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. John's University in 1957, a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1963, and a Master of Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1992. He was in the United States Army Reserve, JAG Corps from 1955 to 1978. In September 1960, O'Scannlain attended the founding conference of Young Americans for Freedom, held at William F. Buckley Jr.'s estate in Sharon, Connecticut. At that conference O'Scannlain was elected to serve on YAF's original Board of Directors.M. Stanton Evans, Revolt on the Campus (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1961), 109–10. He was a tax attorney for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and New York City from 1963 to 1965, and in private practice in Portland, Oregon from 1965 to 1969. He was a deputy state attorney general in the Oregon Department of Justice from 1969 to 1971, then an Oregon public utility commissioner from 1971 to 1973, and finally Director of the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality from 1973 to 1974. Run for Congress In 1974, O'Scannlain was the Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives representing Oregon's 1st congressional district, but lost to Democrat Les AuCoin, the first time the district had ever elected a Democrat. He returned to private practice in Portland from 1975 to 1986, also working as a consultant to the Office of the President-Elect of the United States from 1980 to 1981, and as a team leader for the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control (\\"Grace Commission\\") from 1982 to 1983. He chaired an advisory panel for the United States Secretary of Energy from 1983 to 1985. Federal judicial service On August 11, 1986, President Ronald Reagan nominated O'Scannlain to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated by Judge Robert Boochever. O'Scannlain was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 25, 1986, and received his commission on September 26, 1986. He took senior status on December 31, 2016. In 2006, he was one of the judges in the panel that upheld the imprisonment of journalist Josh Wolf.Josh Wolf v. United States Ninth Circuit O'Scannlain has sent many of his law clerks on to become Supreme Court clerks, and he is regarded as a \\"feeder judge.\\" O'Scannlain continued to be involved in the politics of the federal court system after assuming senior status. He is a strong supporter of splitting the Ninth Circuit. He testified in 2017, before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in support of breaking up the 9th Circuit. On July 31, 2018, he testified again in the Judiciary committee in support of breaking up the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. He was joined on a panel by his former clerk, Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. Senator Mazie Hirono from Hawaii noted that his written testimony was almost word-for-word what he had contributed a year earlier. He supported the nomination of Ryan Bounds, another former clerk, to the 9th Circuit Court vacancy created by his taking senior status. That nomination was withdrawn after controversial newspaper writings by Bounds as a student at Stanford University on the subject of the civil rights of minorities and women were discovered. Bounds had failed to deliver them to the Committee, and Oregon's Democratic Party senators withheld their blue slips. O'Scannlain was ultimately succeeded by another of his former clerks, Danielle Hunsaker. Rulings In a controversial March 2010 case, O'Scannlain joined the majority opinion that Seattle police officers did not employ excessive force when they tasered a pregnant woman.David Kravets: Court OKs Repeated Tasering of Pregnant Woman – Wired News Threat Level column, 29 March 2010 He was joined by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall in a contested 2–1 decision (judge Marsha Berzon dissented). On February 13, 2014, O'Scannlain wrote the majority opinion in the case of Peruta v. San Diego, and issued a ruling that stated California's may-issue concealed carry rules, as implemented by the County of San Diego, in combination with a ban on open carry in most areas of the state, violate the Second Amendment, because they together deny law-abiding citizens the right to bear arms in public for the lawful purpose of self-defense.Dolan, Maura, and Perry, Tony (February 13, 2014). \\"Court Overturns Restrictions on Concealed Guns in Much of California\\", Los Angeles Times.

Robins, O'Scannlain found that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act a plaintiff had standing to sue an allegedly inaccurate website.. After that decision was found to be in error by the Supreme Court of the United States and remanded, O'Scannlain, again, found the plaintiff had standing to sue.. On July 24, 2018, O'Scannlain wrote the majority opinion in the case of Young v. Hawaii, which said that the Second Amendment protects the right to open carry in public.. On February 10, 2020, O'Scannlain wrote an opinion respecting the denial of en banc. The original panel had ruled that a prisoner with gender dysphoria had 8th amendment rights to sex reassignment surgery. O'Scannlain explained that as a judge in senior status, he cannot vote on these petitions, but he can issue statements respecting the denial of en banc. In the opinion, he mentioned that the 9th circuit is the first circuit to rule that denying gender reassignment surgery violates the 8th amendment, and that the 9th circuit is in conflict with other circuits' rulings, causing a circuit split. http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/02/10/19-35017.pdf ReferencesExternal links 1937 births 20th- century American judges 20th-century American lawyers Harvard Law School alumni Judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Lawyers from Portland, Oregon Living people Oregon Republicans Lawyers from New York City St. John's University (New York City) alumni United States court of appeals judges appointed by Ronald Reagan University of Virginia School of Law alumni ","title":"Diarmuid O'Scannlain"},{"id":"6286396","title":"İDO"},{"id":"6286401","text":"The Orkney Antiquarian Society was founded in 1922 by Dr. Hugh Marwick, Archdeacon James Brown Craven, Joseph Storer Clouston and John Mooney, and continued in existence for 17 years. Its focus of interest was the history and archaeology of Orkney, in Scotland, in the United Kingdom. During its lifetime, the Society published 15 volumes of Proceedings, the last being in 1939. An Orkney Research Agenda commissioned by Historic Scotland describes the society's founding in 1922 as a \\"major advance\\" in Orkney archaeology which provided a \\"vital outlet for discoveries and research in Orkney\\".Research Agenda - Part 2 Early 20th century writing on the islands often emphasised their distinct character and Nordic elements in their history, and this influenced subsequent scholarly thought. However, work exploring \\"Orkneyness\\" or \\"Norseness\\" varied from \\"excellent\\" to \\"suspect\\" and must be \\"used critically\\". Orkney Research Agenda - Part 4 Articles from the society's Proceedings are regularly cited by modern writers on archaeology and historical linguistics.For example, in this introduction to the Papar Project Members of the society could be on site shortly after an accidental discovery, observing, advising and recording, and finds were sometimes given to the society for their own museum in Kirkwall. The society had links with other learned societies in Scotland and Scandinavia. It came to an end with the beginning of World War II, although its name is on some of Marwick's post-war notes about finds made after 1939.

They began playing together as The Shroud at Toccoa Falls College in the early 1990s, and changed their name to Luxury just before signing with Tooth & Nail Records and releasing their debut album, Amazing And Thankyou, which was one of the few non-hardcore releases on the label at the time. Luxury toured extensively in the months following Amazing And Thankyou's release. In late 1995, a bad highway collision between touring engagements resulted in most of the band's members being hospitalized. Consequently, Luxury took a year-long hiatus before going back on tour to support their second album, The Latest & The Greatest, though with fewer dates than initially anticipated. After growing more and more unhappy with the continually waning resources and promotion provided them by Tooth & Nail, they opted (in 1997) not to renew their contract with the label, and instead released their third album, Luxury (1999), on Bulletproof Records, a smaller and more artist-friendly label. Soon after, Luxury broke up, and the band members went their separate ways. Jamey Bozeman started a new band called Canary, which soon became They Sang as They Slew, while Lee Bozeman recorded a solo project, Love & Affection, under the moniker All Things Bright and Beautiful. In 2005 Luxury reconvened in Toccoa to make a new record, after a six-year hiatus. The result was their fourth effort as Luxury, called Health And Sport, which was released on Northern Records. The new recording featured all the original members of the band: Lee and Jamey Bozeman, Glenn Black, Chris Foley, and Matt Hinton (described by Jamey in a 1999 interview as the band's \\"fifth leg\\"). In May 2008, Luxury became involved in a dispute with a Boston-based band using the name \\"Luxury\\", resulting in confusion relating to the latter's album sales on Amazon.com. Subsequently, the latter took on the name \\"The Luxury.\\" In February 2013, the members of Luxury reunited to begin the process of song writing for a new album. In 2015, they released their fifth full-length album Trophies which has been described by music reviewers as the band's best work. Luxury is currently releasing its records as an independent act. In March 2019, Eleventyseven lead singer Matt Langston interviewed drummer Glenn Black on the Eleventylife podcast and discussed the music industry, as well as the upcoming film documentary about the band entitled Parallel Love: The Story of a Band Called Luxury. Religious association Luxury's record label Tooth & Nail Records, originated in the independent Christian music scene.

It opened on 20 November 1872.Seymour Vicsig A locomotive depot previously operated north of the station. Today it is the home of the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre and is still used to stable V/Line trains. The station also had a goods yard opposite the main passenger platform. North of Seymour the Tocumwal line branches off. History 4472 Flying Scotsman arrives at Seymour in 1989 N474 at Seymour in 1989 The railway line to Seymour officially opened on 20 November 1872. Due to the bridge over the Goulburn River not being finished, the line from Essendon station had opened on 18 April 1872 as far as a temporary terminus at School House Lane. Former station Mangalore was located north of Seymour at the junction of the North East and Shepparton lines. School House Lane / Dysart Sidings / Goulburn Junction was located between Seymour and Tallarook. Station building & platforms When the station opened only a single platform was provided, with temporary timber station buildings and three tracks.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 7 A brick building was erected in 1874/75, with extensions and alterations made in 1883/84, including a new street façade.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 9 In 1886 a subway was provided to the platform from Station Street, and in 1887 the street entrance to the station was removed to permit the opening of the back platform. A level crossing was constructed to provide access to the station. There were more alterations in 1926. To support the station, a number of Departmental Residences were erected by the Victorian Railways to house railway employees and their families. Around the start of the 20th century there were 29, increasing to 82 by the 1960s. They have since been sold to private owners.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 41 Although the station looks like one large building from Station Street, it is made up of numerous smaller buildings behind a common façade. The refreshment room is a grand two-storey building, while the ticket office and waiting room is a collection of smaller buildings. Though the standard gauge line to Albury, which opened in 1962, passed the station, a platform was not provided on the line until 1974. It was only one carriage long and was not used for regular services, being removed in 2008 when Platform 1 was converted to standard gauge.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 51 The station was altered to the current interior layout in 1997, when a general refurbishment was carried out, with the parcels office being converted into a waiting room and toilets.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 10 In 2008 there was a $1.5 million upgrade of the bus interchange, with the access subway to the station being rebuilt on a shallower grade to allow wheelchair access. These works were done in preparation for the North-East Rail Revitalisation Project, during which all V/Line trains north of Seymour were replaced by buses while the gauge- conversion of the line was undertaken. As part of the North-East Rail Revitalisation Project, a new broad gauge Platform 3 was built on the western side of the yard opening in November 2009. The existing Platform 1 broad gauge track was converted to standard gauge.Program of Works South Improvement Alliance$500 million rail link upgrade for Victoria's north-east The Age 30 May 2008North East rail project will bring local and national benefits Australian Rail Track Corporation 13 March 2009 Refreshment room A railway refreshment room was opened at Seymour station in 1873, replacing the one at Kilmore East.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 14 It later became the largest country refreshment rooms in the state. By 1875, the room was serving at least six trains per day, with 15 minutes permitted for passengers to eat. In 1884, the rooms were expanded with new buffet and dining rooms. Buffet patrons ordered and collected their food from a counter and ate elsewhere, while dining room patrons sat down and received table service.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 15 They were originally managed by a leasee, but were taken over by the Victorian Railways in 1919 in preparation for the creation of their Refreshment Services Branch in 1920.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 16 The rooms catered for 150 standing in the buffet, and 112 seated in the dining room, and was staffed at its peak by 34 employees who lived in a cottage complex near the station. By 1976 the rooms were in decline, serving light refreshments only by a staff of only 11. The rooms closed on 8 October 1981 when on-train catering was rolled out to all trains passing through the station.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 19 The buffet room was refurbished in 1993–1995 for community uses, but the dining room is used for storage.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 20 The refreshment rooms reopened as a cafe in November 2008, to cater for V/Line Albury/Wodonga line passengers who used Seymour to transfer from coach to train while the line was being upgraded to standard gauge. Locomotive depot The locomotive depot at Seymour existed from the opening of the station until 1993.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 26 It was the home of the S class 4-6-2 Pacifics as used on the Spirit of Progress . The depot was originally located just to the north of the station, with a two locomotive shed and a 42 ft turntable. It was moved to the current location in 1889 where a new 9 track roundhouse-style shed was erected in timber and corrugated iron, along with a coal stage and brick offices. In 1902 it was extended to 13 bays, and in 1910 to twenty bays that almost made a complete circle. The original 40 ft turntable was replaced in 1890 by a 50 ft version, and by a 70 ft in 1907. In the 1930s an electric turntable was provided, until replaced by a more modern version in 1954. At the peak of operation in June 1950, 245 railway men worked at Seymour Locomotive Depot, made up of 60 drivers, 57 firemen, 41 cleaners, 14 mechanics, 53 shed staff, 9 rail motor staff, and 11 train examiners.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 27 By 1958 the number of staff had declined to 181 with the arrival of diesel locomotives, the last steam locomotive housed there withdrawn in 1966. Much of the roundhouse was removed in 1961 in conjunction with construction of the standard gauge line alongside, with the rest of the roundhouse removed in May 1971 leaving just workshop buildings. By 1976 only 125 were employed at the depot, and by the 1980s locomotives were no longer based at the depot. It was officially closed on 8 April 1993.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 28 Today it used to stable V/Line trains, as well as being the home of the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre.

It was lengthened in 1909 and again in 1930. Until the 1960s the main outbound traffic was agricultural produce, wool, firewood, timber; along with incoming supplies for town. By the 1970s small consignments of goods were only handled by a number of larger stations, with road transport used the rest of the way. The Seymour Freight Centre opened on 8 February 1978 to serve the local area, and remained in used until 27 April 1985.Seymour - A Railway Town p. 39 Platforms & services Seymour has three platforms, one island with two faces and one side.

History Mount Palung was first protected in 1937 as a forest nature reserve covering . In 1981, the size was increased to and its status raised to a wildlife reserve, and on 24 March 1990 the area became a national park.  Geography The park is notable for its diversity of habitat types, ranging from mangrove and freshwater swamp forest, to lowland alluvial (empran bench) forest, to montane forest, and for its diversity of wildlife. It is one of only a handful of parks in the world where orangutans can be seen in the wild. A research station (Cabang Panti) was established at the western foot of the main Mount Palung mountains in 1985, and is owned and operated by the park management authority. Research there has contributed significantly to our understanding of Borneo forest biology. Illegal, non-mechanized, 'hand logging' has been a problem in the park, especially from ca. 2000-2003. Initiatives by park authorities and NGOs (increased policing, monitoring by microlight, educational activities) contributed to a reduction of illegal activities, however, illegal logging continues at several hot-spots. In 2007, Alam Sehat Lestari (ASRI) clinic was established to provide affordable health care and alternative livelihood training for villagers living around the park. This intervention has greatly reduced illegal logging throughout Mount Palung as locals with reliable health care access and more economic opportunities are less likely to rely on income from illegal timber. The park was one of the key sites of the EU-funded Illegal Logging Response Center (ILRC, now continued in FLEGT). Research In 1985 Dr. Mark Leighton established the Cabang Panti Research Camp deep within the National Park. The site encompasses over 2,100 hectares networked by over 25 km of well-marked trails extending throughout all seven forest types including the upper montane forest. Following a short period of non-occupation from 2004-2007, Cabang Panti Research Station was rebuilt in 2007 with money provided by two research teams from the United States. Projects led by Dr. Andrew Marshall of the University of California at Davis and Dr. Cheryl Knott of Boston University funded the reconstruction. The current facilities include a main two-story wooden building complete with six private rooms, three office areas, a kitchen, living area and a mezzanine. Three out-buildings include one five-room bunkhouse for local research assistants, and two one-room houses for Principal Investigators. These buildings were donated to Mount Palung National Park in 2011. Cabang Panti is currently home to a number of researchers including two long-term interests: the Mount Palung Orangutan Project, and the Gibbon and Leaf-Monkey Project. In September 2011, all researchers were expelled from Cabang Panti by the local Park Office after an NGO sent a letter to Jakarta detailing encroachment by illegal logging into the research site. The park justified the reaction by saying they needed all four buildings to house the rotating 4-6 person teams of forest police. After an appeal to Jakarta, researchers were allowed back into the area, however were not granted access to the buildings. Orangutan conservation The orangutan is considered the umbrella species for conservation in the National Park, and is also an important ecological agent for seed dispersal and seed predation. It is believed that orangutans at Mount Palung constitute one of the most dense and largest populations on Borneo. A census conducted in 2001, part-funded by The Orangutan Conservancy, gives an estimate of 2500 individual orangutans, about 4.5% of the estimated population in Borneo and close to 4% of the world’s population. The Mount Palung Orangutan Project was established in 1994 by Dr. Cheryl Knott.Website of Gunung Palung Orangutan Project This project integrates scientific research about orangutan biology and ecology with conservation programs aimed at the preservation of this endangered species and its habitat. Cheryl Knott is conducting scientific investigation of the factors governing orangutan reproduction and population viability, increasing awareness on the local level to encourage support for conservation of the park and community education around the park and capacity-building for National Park Office staff.http://www.orangutan.com/projects/gunung-palung Illegal logging, in conjunction with fires raging across the Indonesian rain forests, make immediate conservation action in this area of paramount importance. The Mount Palung Orangutan Conservation Program was initiated to address the threat to orangutans and their habitat. Tourism The park has potential for ecotourism, and has a number of attractive sites for visitors. The only way to gain permission to enter the park is by paying for a package offered by Nasalis Tour and Travel or one of its partners. Nasalis is a for-profit corporation owned and operated by local National Park staff and administrators. As of August 2011, the park had not approved any other tourism companies to operate within the park boundaries.

It is restricted to cars; trucks and buses are not permitted on it. Boston drivers use the route for quick access to downtown locations. The parkway is named for James J. Storrow, an investment banker who led a campaign to create the Charles River Basin and preserve and improve the riverbanks as a public park. He had never advocated a parkway beside the river, and his widow publicly opposed it. Route description The segment between the interchange with Route 28 near Copley Square and Leverett Circle, the road is officially David G. Mugar Way (formerly Embankment Road), although still signed as Storrow Drive. The entirety of this segment is concurrent with Route 28. To the west, Storrow Drive ends and becomes Soldiers Field Road at its partial junction with the Boston University Bridge (Route 2). In between, westbound Storrow Drive has a junction with the Harvard Bridge (Route 2A, Massachusetts Avenue). Both Storrow Drive and Soldiers Field Road are maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and are part of the parkway system interconnecting the Emerald Necklace in Boston and Brookline. Together with Memorial Drive and the Cambridge Parkway, Storrow Drive is also part of the Charles River Basin Historic District (listed in the National Register of Historic Places). Prior to 1989, Storrow Drive also carried the U.S. Route 1 designation; US 1 is now routed concurrently with Interstate 93 through the O'Neill Tunnel. Traffic issues Storrow Drive mid-afternoon The road is notorious for speeding and aggressive driving because police enforcement along the road is difficult without a breakdown lane. Radio traffic reports have warned motorists about \\"ponding\\" on Storrow Drive, which occurs when snow and frozen ground prevent water from draining properly into storm drains. The underpasses also commonly flood during heavy rains, sometimes stalling low- riding cars.Has Boston outsmarted Storrowing? Additional problems include narrow lanes and very limited visibility on short entrance ramps. Concert parking During some summer night concerts at the Hatch Shell, many drivers park their cars in the outbound lanes of Storrow Drive. The free concerts and fireworks displays attract 200,000 people, and many take advantage of the free parking. Low clearance There is an abundance of signs giving road clearance height. Despite the signs, a truck or other large vehicle will periodically get wedged under a bridge, which causes traffic to back up for several miles. In one incident a truck full of scissors became stuck and spilled its cargo, causing more than 30 cars to get flat tires. There is a height limit for the entire parkway.Cambridge, MA policy order resolution, February 11, 2013. Local media has taken to referring to these kinds of accidents as a truck being \\"Storrowed\\",Universal Hub and the city of Boston has annual advisories in August to those renting box trucks for college move- ins to avoid the city's low-clearance parkway system, including Storrow Drive. Pedestrian crossings Because Storrow Drive is a high-speed limited- access road, pedestrian access is prevented by a series of perimeter fences. To connect the Charles River Esplanade (a popular park and recreational area along the south bank of the river) to adjacent Boston neighborhoods, a number of pedestrian overpasses have been constructed. Listed in order from downstream to upstream, they are: *Blossom Street bridge (near Massachusetts General Hospital) *Frances Appleton Bridge (at Cambridge Street, next to Longfellow Bridge) *Arthur Fiedler Bridge (connecting to the Hatch Memorial Shell near Arlington Street) *Dartmouth Street bridge *Fairfield Street bridge *Harvard Bridge (at Massachusetts Avenue) *Silber Way bridge *Boston University Marsh Chapel bridge *Boston University Bridge History Between 1958 and 1971, Storrow Drive was designated Massachusetts Routes C1 and C9. Early opposition James Storrow had been instrumental in earlier projects along the Charles River, in particular the Charles River Dam. Additions to the Charles River Esplanade had been made during the 1930s only by omitting an important part of the project, a proposed highway from the Longfellow Bridge to the Cottage Farm (Boston University) Bridge, which had provoked tremendous protest. After Helen Storrow, the wife of the now deceased James Storrow, supported a group opposed to the highway, it was dropped; part of the funding was to have come from a million-dollar gift from her.\\"Fight begins on $4,855,000 Basin Project\\", Boston Evening Transcript, March 6, 1929. Soon after Helen Storrow's death in 1944, a new proposal for the construction of the highway was pushed through the Massachusetts Legislature. In spite of still strong opposition, and through some dubious parliamentary procedures, the bill approving construction of the highway and naming it after James Storrow was passed in 1949.\\"Embankment Road approved by House in stormy session\\", The Boston Globe, April 29, 1949. Construction Construction took place in the years 1950–1951. As part of the attempt to preserve park land, any land used by the highway had to be replaced by reclaiming new land along the shoreline.Massachusetts General Court Acts of 1949, Chap. 262 Storrow Drive was officially opened in a ribbon cutting ceremony by Governor Paul A. Dever on June 15, 1951. An on-ramp leading from southbound Massachusetts Avenue to eastbound Storrow Drive was constructed but later removed, leaving an island of greenspace between the inbound and outbound carriageways. Overpasses to Fenway via Charlesgate and in the vicinity of Massachusetts General Hospital were completed a few years later; the Arthur Fiedler Footbridge was completed in 1953. In 1960, high-pressure air from a sewage tunnel under construction caused a geyser-like eruption and damaged the roadway near the BU bridge. The pedestrian overpass near the Longfellow Bridge was constructed in 1962. A \\"Reverse Curve\\" sign near downtown was vandalized to say \\"Reverse the Curse\\", a reference to the Curse of the Bambino; the sign was removed after the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series. Future The Storrow Drive Tunnel, through which Storrow Drive runs along the Esplanade just north of Clarendon, Berkeley and Arlington Streets, has been deteriorating since it was built in 1951. By mid-2007, the Department of Conservation and Recreation determined that repairing the tunnel may be impossible because it was not waterproofed when it was built, and damage in the intervening years has been significant. Consequently the tunnel may have to be rebuilt at a cost upward of $200 million, a project that would require closing critical sections of Storrow Drive to traffic. Despite the chaos this project would cause to drivers, it also could present an opportunity for the city to improve the area. For example, former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino proposed covering Storrow Drive near the pedestrian Arthur Fiedler Bridge, replacing the old overpass with a wide, ground-level park space that would better connect the green space of Boston's Public Garden with the Esplanade. Other plans for the road propose closing it to traffic on Sunday mornings in the summer, much as is done across the river on Memorial Drive in Cambridge. This would create a recreational area for walking, biking and roller blading on weekends, though this has been criticized as unnecessary due to the presence of the nearby Esplanade paths and the existing Memorial Drive road closure. Regardless, Storrow Drive east of Massachusetts Avenue is usually closed to traffic and open to pedestrians and cyclists during the Independence Day (July 4) celebration at the Esplanade. Exit list Mileposts continue east from Soldiers Field Road. The entire route is in Boston, Suffolk County.

He was born and educated in Leeds, and was a pupil at Leeds Modern School, a grammar school, where his father was the music teacher. Along with composer Derek Bourgeois he played tuba in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. Both arrived at Cambridge where there was only one tuba position. Fletcher switched to horn, even performing Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings. He returned to the tuba upon his graduation from studying Natural Sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge. In autumn 1964, he moved to London, where he was appointed Principal Tuba of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He left the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1966 to join the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). In 1966, he also joined the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble (PJBE), with whom he played until 1986. Known to his friends as \\"Fletch\\", he was highly regarded as a tuba player and teacher. He taught many UK professional tubists, including Patrick Harrild, who succeeded Fletcher as the LSO's principal tuba. Fletcher also regularly tutored members of the National Youth Orchestra. Fletcher's recordings included the Vaughan Williams Tuba Concerto.Ottaway, Hugh, Review of LP recording of Vaughan Williams Pastoral Symphony and Tuba Concerto (1972).

It stayed in business for only 21 years.  History  Hicks Locomotive and Car Works was founded in 1897 by Frank M. Hicks, who had owned an ironmaking company called F.M. Hicks and Company for ten years. Originally the new company was focused on purchasing used steam locomotives and refurbishing them for continued operation, but it quickly branched out into passenger car and freight car construction. Construction expanded for the first ten years of the company's life, and in 1905 the Car Works claimed the ability to manufacture 10 railroad coaches per month and 25 freight cars per day in addition to its locomotive rebuilding activities. The size of the workforce varied considerably but normally the company employed at least 100 men. Near the end of the first decade of the century, orders for railway cars slowed and the company went into decline. In 1910 the company suffered two major fires, causing severe financial hardship. In September of that year the company was forced into receivership and was sold in February 1911. The purchaser, William Barbour of New York, changed the name to Central Locomotive and Car Works and continued the company's operations. In the 1910s the company continued its slow decline, and the last of the 480 passenger cars built at the Chicago Heights works was constructed in 1914. In 1916 there were two more fires at the plant. Two years later, Central went bankrupt and ceased operations. The plant was sold to the Liberty Car and Equipment Company.  Physical Plant  The Chicago Heights plant West Works. The company's offices were originally located in the Fisher Building in Chicago's Loop district while the plant was located 30 miles to the south in Chicago Heights, Illinois. In 1905 the company's offices were moved to Chicago Heights. The Chicago Heights plant consisted of two main complexes. The older of the two was the West Works, or locomotive shop, which dated to 1901. This plant included a machine shop, erection shop, boiler shop, blacksmith shop, coach shop, mill, upholstery workshop, tender shop, tin shop, veneer shop, and pattern shop. It also included a storehouse. The West Shop was used for building and repairing passenger cars and for rebuilding steam locomotives. The newer complex, the East Works, was an adjacent tube mill purchased by the company in 1905. After conversion this plant included a wood machine shop, truck shop, storehouse, blacksmith shop, boiler house, oil house and two erection shops. This plant was used for construction and repair of freight cars and opened in 1906. In 1910 there were two fires. In the first, the west plant burned down, while the second fire destroyed the offices and storehouse. The East Works survived the bankruptcy of both Hicks and Central and was bought in 1918 by Liberty Car and Equipment.  Surviving Traces  None of the buildings of the Chicago Heights plant have survived, and the site is an empty lot. The Fisher Building in downtown Chicago survives and is an historic landmark. No freight cars built by Hicks are known to survive, however nine wooden passenger cars have been preserved: * Chicago Aurora and Elgin 309 (1907 electric interurban coach), at the Illinois Railway Museum * Green Bay and Western 20 (mail-baggage car), privately owned near Rapid River, Michigan * Green Bay and Western 21 (1908 mail-baggage car), at the National Railroad Museum * Kewaunee Green Bay and Western 76 (mail express car), privately owned near Baraboo, Wisconsin * Kewaunee Green Bay and Western 77 (1909 mail-baggage car), at the Mid- Continent Railway Museum * Lake Superior and Ishpeming 63 (1910 combination baggage-coach), at the National Railroad Museum * Munising Railway 64 (1910 coach), at the Mid-Continent Railway Museum * Virginia and Truckee 20 (1907 combination baggage-coach), at the Orange Empire Railway Museum * Yosemite Valley 330 (1907 parlor-observation), at the Niles Canyon Railway In addition, Hicks purchased four Jackson & Sharp Co. narrow gauge coaches from the Ulster & Delaware R.R. between August 1899 & June 1900 and resold them to the White Pass and Yukon Route in May 1901 (WP&YR; ##218, 220, 222, and 224). These four cars have been rebuilt several times under White Pass ownership and remain in service.  References   Kaaterskill R.R.

He has also contributed to several films by Director Paul Cox as production designer. He was born in Israel, and began his career as an artist soon after arriving in Australia in 1956. From the start, his art has been abstract, with particular emphasis on technological experimentation. His technique changes as he investigates the use of new media, but his work always reflects his fascination with light, and his love of music and science, especially cosmology.  Early life  Bilu was born in Tel Aviv on 16 December 1936. At the age of fourteen he was sent to Kibbutz Mizra in the Jezreel Valley where he lived and studied until his mandatory army service began in 1954. From the age of eight he studied classical violin. The art teacher at the kibbutz, Rafael Lohat, developed a love of painting in the young musician, and eventually, during his term of army service, the instrument was abandoned and painting became his preferred mode of artistic expression. Early in 1956 he was excited by an exhibition in Tel Aviv of abstract work in the style of Vieira da Silva and was lucky enough to meet and befriend the artist Efraim Modzelevich whose encouragement for his early paintings was pivotal in forming his career. Asher Bilu has not had any other formal art training. However he has continued his musical expression through study of classical Hindustani music on the Indian instrument, the sarod, learning with Pandit Ashok Roy and Dr. Adrian McNeil.  Art career  Bilu arrived in Melbourne, Australia, in December 1956, after completing his Israeli army service. He came to join his parents and sister who had migrated two years earlier. He quickly settled into a studio in St. Kilda Road, completing work for his first solo exhibition at Allan David's Dalgety Street Gallery in 1959. The exhibition was opened by the acclaimed architect Ernest Fooks and was attended by artworld personalities John & Sunday Reed and Georges Mora, the artist Don Laycock and the Brazilian dancer and sculptor Antonio Rodrigues, who all became close friends. This exhibition was followed by two solo exhibitions at John Reed's renowned Museum of Modern Art of Australia and exhibitions in Sydney and Adelaide soon established his reputation. In 1963 Asher Bilu moved to London, where he lived for two years, exhibiting at the Rowan Gallery in London and Kunst Kring in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Shortly after his return to Melbourne in 1965, he won the prestigious Blake Prize for Religious Art for a work entitled I form Light and Create Darkness – Isiah 45:7 which is dominated by a large meteor shape suggesting a dramatic moment in the birth of life out of chaos.Crumlin, Rosemary. \\"The Blake Book/ Art, Religion and Spirituality in Australia\\" MacMillan Art Publishing, 2011, p.58-59. In 1967 Sculptron was exhibited at George Mora's Tolarno Galleries Melbourne. Sculptron was the first electronic sculpture in Australia (Patrick McCaughey, \\"The Age\\" 11 July 1967)McCaughey, Patrick. \\"The Age\\" 11 July 1967 and was designed with engineering assistance by Tim Berriman.Jones, Stephen, Synthetics/Aspects of Art & Technology in Australia 1956–1975, MIT Press, 2011 In 1970 he won the First Leasing Prize which was an invitational non-acquisition exhibition mounted at the National Gallery of Victoria, with a first prize of $7,000 the largest prize to date. Second prize winner was Brett Whiteley and third prize winners (shared) Jan Senbergs and Alun Leach-Jones.  Art materials  Early paintings used raw pigments combined with resins sourced from industrial applications and acetone. Textures were achieved by the use of water and fire. 1974 saw the first painting to break the two-dimensional surface (Zone 1) with cut out sections of the painting extending into space. Later dimensional paintings were formed with plywood, then cut out and mounted on wooden blocks, set on a variety of levels. His discovery of a self-supporting paint – a polyvinyl alcohol resin that can be applied on nonporous surfaces, then peeled off when dry – opened up further possibilities. The first major use of this medium was [Amaze (1982)], a walk through painting suspended from the ceiling 42 metres long and 3 metres high and which used 1 ton of paint, exhibited first at United Artists Gallery in Melbourne. Other installations using this medium are [Heavens (2006)] and [In-Visible (2007)]. Found objects and other unconventional materials have also formed the basis of installations and sculpture. [Escape (1992)] utilized 16 tons of paper offcuts from machinery for envelope manufacture, [Explanandum (2002)] utilized industrial wire mesh and [Mysterium (2003)] utilized wooden match splints.  Installations  Bilu transformed Realities Gallery, Melbourne for his exhibition Infinities in 1979, working with lighting designer John Comeadow to install theatre spotlights to light the paintings edge-to-edge, and speakers for music which he had composed and recorded on the Fairlight Synthesiser with the assistance of musician Duncan McGuire. In 1982 Amaze was first exhibited at United Artists Gallery in Melbourne, later touring to Mount Gambier, Sydney and Armidale. Escape (1992) was commissioned by the Melbourne International Festival as an interactive experience for the seven thousand people who visited in ten days. Sanctum (1993) was included in the art component of the Melbourne International Festival. Explanandum (2002), was shown to an invited audience in Melbourne and Adelaide. Mysterium (2003) was commissioned as a non-competitive work for the inaugural sculpture prize at the McClelland Gallery. Heavens (2006) was commissioned by the [Jewish Museum of Australia] and was travelled by [NETS (National Exhibition Touring Support)] to regional galleries in Mornington, Latrobe Valley and Benalla. In-Visible (2007), with lighting designer John Comeadow, was commissioned by Wilson Street Gallery, Sydney. M –Theory(2010), Plexus (2011), Cosmotif (2012) and resurrection (2016) are installations exhibited in the artist’s studio.  Exhibitions and collections  Bilu has had 50 solo exhibitions in Australia, and in London, Rotterdam and Los Angeles. His work has been represented in group exhibitions which include Australian Art Today, touring exhibition to SE Asia (1969), McCaughey Prize, National Gallery of Victoria (1979), I Had a Dream – Australian Art in the 1960s (1997), National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, O Soul O Spirit O Fire, Queensland University of Technology Art Museum, Brisbane & touring (2001), After Van Gogh: Australian Artists in homage to Vincent, Mornington Peninsular Regional Gallery (2005), Earthly reflections of heavenly things, 3 person exhibition with Leonard Brown & Emily Kame Kngwarreye, The Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne (2007–08), Volume One: MCA Collection, Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (2012).

Richards Memorial Prize, Brisbane. * 1965 Blake Prize, Sydney. * 1970 First Leasing Prize, Melbourne. * 1973 Grant, Visual Arts Board, Australia Council  United Artists Gallery  Bilu and Ivan Durrant were the initiators of United Artists Gallery, an artist cooperative situated in the room vacated by Georges Mora's Tolarno Gallery in Fitzroy Street St Kilda. The cooperative flourished from 1982 till 1985, run by a group of mainly mid career artists who wanted to reach the public with innovative work exhibited accessibly. Members included Mike Brown, Joel Elenberg (estate), Dale Hickey, Don Laycock, Peter D. Cole and David Larwill. Asher Bilu painted Amaze to celebrate the spirit of United Artists Gallery which was to provide an art experience that reached viewers across the whole range from the art uneducated to the cognoscenti and to demonstrate that \\"art\\" and \\"the public\\" were not mutually exclusive.  Film  Bilu has contributed to several films by Director Paul Cox as production designer,\\"Senses of Cinema\\" Issue 53, 28 December 2009, Paul Cox Dossier Man of Flowers (1983), My First Wife (1983), Cactus (1984), Human Touch (2003) which also features the two installations Explanandum and Amaze and Force of Destiny (2015) in which he created a room using several of his paintings and a sculpture \\"Time Piece\\". For the film Vincent: The life and Death of Vincent van Gogh (1987), he designed the scenes to illustrate the paintings of the bedroom and the potato eaters, and painted eleven copies of original Van Gogh paintings to be used for filming.

According to Amatus of Montecassino, Hervé and other Norman mercenaries fought for the Byzantine Empire under George Maniakes against the Muslims in Sicily in 1038-1040.. Between 1040 and 1043, he took part in the campaign against the Greeks of Apulia and received the city of Avellino (1042/3). At about 1050, he appears as the leader of the Norman mercenaries under Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder and one of the Greek's two chief lieutenants. In the same year, he and Katakalon Kekaumenos were defeated by the Pechenegs near the Danube. In 1056, he demanded the high court title of magistros from Emperor Michael VI Stratiotikos (r. 1056–1057). Refused, he withdrew to his estate in the Armeniac theme. From there, he gathered a following of 300 Normans, and in the spring of 1057 he marched into eastern Asia Minor, around Lake Van. There, he possibly aimed to set up a state for himself and entered into wars with the Armenians and the Seljuk Turks.. After initial success, he was captured by a ruse by the emir of Ahlat, Abu Nasr. Hervé was shipped back to Constantinople in chains, but there he was apparently reconciled to the Byzantine emperor: a surviving seal records his having received the title of magistros, and the positions of vestiarites and stratelates of the East in the army of Emperor Isaac I Komnenos (r. 1057–1059). In circa 1063, however, Matthew of Edessa records that the Turks of Amida bribed a certain \\"Frankabol\\", to avoid battle. Whether this was indeed Hervé is uncertain, but he was executed by Emperor Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059–1067) shortly after. He was possibly the founder of the late Byzantine Phrangopoulos family..

It is based on the 1976 semi-autobiographical novella A River Runs Through It by Norman Maclean, adapted for the screen by Richard Friedenberg. Set in and around Missoula, Montana, the story follows two sons of a Presbyterian minister, one studious and the other rebellious, as they grow up and come of age in the Rocky Mountain region during a span of time from roughly World War I to the early days of the Great Depression, including part of the Prohibition era. The film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1993 and was nominated for two other Oscars: Best Music, Original Score and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film grossed $43 million in US domestic returns. Plot The Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, grow up in Missoula, Montana with their father, Presbyterian minister John, from whom they learn a love of fly fishing for trout in the Blackfoot River. Norman and Paul are home taught and must adhere to the strict moral and educational code of their father. As young men, the brothers navigate a dangerous waterfall. Norman leaves to attend college at Dartmouth; when he returns six years later, he finds that Paul has become a skilled fisherman. Norman attends a July 4th dance, and meets Jessie Burns. Paul has become a fearless muckraking reporter at a newspaper in Helena. He has angered many of the locals by falling behind in a big poker game in Lolo Montana where a bar is a front for gambling and prostitution. He is also dating a Native American woman, Mabel, who is deemed inferior by the white community. Paul is arrested after fighting a man who has insulted her, and Norman is awakened in the middle of the night by a phone call from the police to come and bail Paul out of jail. After Norman and Jessie go on several dates, she asks that Norman make an effort to get along with her brother Neal, who is visiting from California. Norman and Paul do not like Neal, but at Jessie's insistence they invite him to go fishing. Neal shows up drunk with Rawhide, a woman he met at a bar the night before. Norman and Paul decide to fish anyway and return to their car hours later to find that Neal and the woman have drunk all the beer and passed out naked in the sun. Norman returns a painfully sunburned Neal home, where Jessie is waiting for them. She is angry that the brothers did not fish with Neal. Norman asks Jessie to drive him home, as he had brought Neal back in Neal's car, and he tells her that he is falling for her. She drives away angry but a week later asks Norman to come to the train station to see Neal off. After the train departs, Norman shows Jessie a letter from the University of Chicago: a job offer for an English Literature teaching position. Norman tells Jessie that he does not necessarily wish to leave and when it becomes clear that it's because of her - her face lights up and she quickly embraces him. alt= When Norman tells Paul about the job offer and marriage proposal, he urges Paul to come with him and Jessie to Chicago, concerned that Paul is making powerful enemies. Paul says that he will never leave Montana. Just before leaving for Chicago, Norman, Paul, and their father go fly fishing one last time. Paul catches a huge rainbow trout that drags him down the river through a set of rapids before he finally lands it. John proudly tells him what a wonderful fisherman he has become, and how he is an artist in the craft, much to Paul's delight. They pose for pictures with the huge fish. Soon after the fishing excursion, Norman is called by the police, who tell him that Paul has been found beaten to death in an alley. Norman goes home and tells his parents the news. Years later, Mrs. Maclean, Norman, Jessie, and their two children listen to a sermon being given by John, who dies soon after.

The waterfall shown is Granite Falls in Wyoming.A River Runs Through It filming locations. Filming was completed in early September 1991. An article published in the Helena Independent Record in July 2000, based on recollections of people who knew both brothers, noted a number of specifics about the Macleans — notably various chronological and educational details about Paul Maclean's adult life — that differ somewhat from their portrayal in the film and novella. Music Mark Isham, who would go on to compose the scores to most Robert Redford-directed films, composed the musical score for the film. Originally, Elmer Bernstein was hired to score the film. However, after Redford and Bernstein disagreed over the tone of the music, Bernstein was replaced by Isham. Rushed for time, Isham completed the score within four weeks at Schnee Studio of Signet Sound Studios in Hollywood, CA. Upon release, the music was met with positive reviews earning the film both nominations for Grammy and Academy awards. The A River Runs Through It (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on October 27, 1992. In some home video releases of the film, Elmer Bernstein is credited as the film's composer despite his score being rejected during post-production.

Critical response The film received positive reviews from critics. It holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 45 polled critical reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Tasteful to a fault, this period drama combines a talented cast (including a young Brad Pitt) with some stately, beautifully filmed work from director Robert Redford.\\" Much of the praise focused on Pitt's portrayal of Paul, which has been cited as his career-making performance. Despite the critical reception, Brad Pitt was very critical of his performance on the movie: \\"Robert Redford made a quality movie. But I don’t think I was skilled enough. I think I could have done better. Maybe it was the pressure of the part, and playing someone who was a real person — and the family was around occasionally — and not wanting to let Redford down.\\"https://ew.com/movies/2011/09/16/brad- pitt-ew-interview/ Awards and honors The film was nominated for three Academy Awards in 1993, including Best Cinematography (Philippe Rousselot); Best Music, Original Score (Mark Isham); and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Richard Friedenberg).

Plot summary Remy is an eighteen-year-old who is about to leave for college. Her father, a musician, wrote his one and only hit song the day she was born. The song, called \\"This Lullaby,\\" became extremely popular, but he died soon after its release. Now, Remy's mother is getting married for the fifth time. After her mother's previous failed marriages, love is something that Remy doesn't believe exists. One day, she randomly meets Dexter at a car dealership that her mother's fiancé owns. He claims to feel a connection with her the second he saw her. He is messy and a musician, two of her least favorite traits. But he is persistent. She slowly finds herself falling for him. She doesn't want to care about him, but somehow she just can't bring herself to get rid of him. Eventually, they start dating and she is surprised by how open and honest and caring he is. When Dexter overhears Remy saying that she only wants him to be a summer fling, they break up. Remy begins to date another guy, but she finds herself always thinking about Dexter. Meanwhile, her brother is getting engaged, her mother's new husband is cheating with his secretary, and her friends are all having problems of their own. But in the end, Remy realizes that she truly does love Dexter, and they get back together. Remy still leaves for college but in Just Listen it is revealed that Remy and Dexter are together because Remy is shown with Dexter while Remy is on fall break from college.  \\"This Lullaby\\" lyrics  This lullaby is only a few words A simple run of chords Quiet here in this spare room But you can hear it, hear it Wherever you may go I will let you down But this lullaby plays on... Note: When Truth Squad does a cover of \\"This Lullaby\\", Dexter sings the 6th line as \\"Even if I let you down\\" instead. Characters * Remy Starr – Remy is the protagonist of This Lullaby and is cool, calm, and cynical. After seeing her mother's failed marriages, she proclaims that she doesn't believe in love. She believes that she has the upper hand in all of her relationships. She is also obsessive about cleanliness and does not allow anyone to eat or smoke in her car. Remy is named after an expensive brand of cognac that her mother saw in Harper's Bazaar. She is emotionally scarred by her past, as her father – whom she never knew – wrote her the song \\"This Lullaby\\" the day she was born, and then left soon after. The song becomes a one-hit wonder, and Remy constantly hears it in her life. She claims to have relationships all figured out, in logical, mathematical terms. She used to be known for sleeping around and partying. * Dexter Jones – Dexter is the lead singer of a band called Truth Squad (also known by their wedding persona, the G-Flats). Gangly and sociable, he bumps (literally) into Remy at her stepfather-to-be's car dealership, claiming to have sensed a special bond with her. It is later revealed he dropped out of college for music, \\"breaking his mother's heart\\", as Remy's stepfather Don says at the Fourth of July barbecue. Don's sister is Dexter's aunt, but Don is not Dexter's uncle. Dexter's dog is named Monkey because he wanted a monkey when he was ten, but got a dog instead. He is carefree, kindhearted, and funny; he loves to throw down ridiculous challenges at every given opportunity, as shown when he dares John Miller to eat ten bananas (later changed to 9 and a half due to Remy's judging abilities), and also when he dares Chloe to stand on her head for 20 minutes. During the novel, he works at a one-hour photo place where he saves funny pictures. One of these photos is evidence of Remy's stepfather's affair, and Remy mistakenly believes Dexter shows it to her on purpose to hurt her. Also, Dexter hates English muffins. * Barbara Starr – Barbara is Remy's mother, who also happens to be a famous author. Her books are the romantic type, all about exotic locations and women who have everything yet nothing. Her latest book is 'The Choice'. She has been married numerous times, each time changing her outward personality to match her newest husband, yet still believes in love despite her failed relationships, in direct contrast to Remy's view on love. * Christopher Starr – Chris is Remy's brother. He used to be a juvenile delinquent, before he met his girlfriend, Jennifer Anne, whom he met at his job at Jiffy Lube. Since then, he's shaped up considerably. He breeds lizards in his room. He is named after his mother's favorite saint and he is very close to Remy because of their shared childhood. Towards the end of the book, he and Jennifer Anne state that they are engaged to get married. * Jennifer Anne Baker – Jennifer Anne is Chris's girlfriend, who is described as being small with big blond hair, and whip smart. She is seen as an uptight, annoying perfectionist in Remy's eyes only, and is the only one who refers to Chris as \\"Christopher\\". Later in the book, she and Chris become engaged. Remy often cannot tolerate Jennifer Anne; however, she means well. Jennifer Anne reads many self-help books and greatly dislikes Chris's obsession with his lizards. * Don Davis – Don is Barbara's fifth husband. They met at the car dealership when Barb and Remy went to buy a new car. A lifelong bachelor, he has habits that annoy both Chris and Remy: his paintings and statues, which often seem to have sexual or violent themes, and his pyramids of Ensure cans. After his marriage with Barbara, he is caught having an affair with his secretary, Patty.... * Jess – Jess is Remy's oldest friend. She is generally very emotionless, and clashes a lot with Chloe. Remy describes her as \\"big,\\" but not fat. She is the \\"mother\\" of their group of friends because she's been raising her two younger brothers since her mom died in fifth grade. She disagrees and fights with Chloe often. She is also the most responsible of the group; she doesn't drink or smoke, always drives. Jess avoids dating problems by not dating at all for the most part. She is somewhat Chloe's polar opposite. * Lissa – Lissa is Remy's friend, the \\"emotion\\" of the bunch. Unlike Chloe and Remy, she believes in true love. She plans to attend the local university to be together with her boyfriend, Adam, whom she gave her virginity to. However, when Adam abruptly breaks up with her, she is miserable. She becomes more upset when she sees Adam with another girl. She has an \\"infamous\\" sweet tooth – Remy considers her the only person she knows who can thoroughly explain the difference between chocolate-covered raisins and Raisinettes. She also thinks that all of Remy's boyfriends and exes are nice and are keepers. Not that Remy cares, because, as she tells Lissa, \\"You like everybody.\\" * Chloe – Chloe is one of Remy's friends. She shares Remy's skeptical views on love. Her mother is an airline stewardess, and often brings home small mini-bottles of liquor that the girls steal and drink. Her mom is also a compulsive shopper, so Chloe is often seen in new clothes and is referred to as \\"our little trendsetter\\". Chloe doesn't understand Remy's attraction to Dexter, and is often insensitive. Jess and Chloe often argue over mundane things. * John Miller – When John Miller first appears, he is referred to as Ringo, as in Ringo Starr, by Lola, Remy's boss. John Miller is the redheaded drummer of Truth Squad, and possibly the one who makes the most appearances (following Dexter). He is \\"madly in love\\" with Scarlett, one of the main characters in Someone Like You. Scarlett later finds him \\"immature\\" and \\"not husband material\\" as John Miller points out while he is drunk at the Quick Zip. * Ted – Ted is the guitarist for Truth Squad. Unlike the others, he is uptight about everything and feels very deeply about how their music is accepted and understood. He does not like doing covers, as this reminds him of their G-Flats wedding persona. So he helps to write \\"The Potato Song\\", a song which he feels strongly about. During the novel, he works at a grocery store where he often brings home bruised but edible fruit, like crates of tangerines. In Just Listen, he and Owen are good friends. * Lucas – Lucas is the keyboardist for Truth Squad. He has \\"been in several bands\\", including a hair metal band. He has a tendency to be an \\"eggbert\\". He and Dexter both work at Flash Camera, and Lucas is the technician there. * Paul – After Remy and Dexter break up, Remy agrees to go on a blind date with Paul, who she immediately christens \\"Perfect Paul\\". Lola often raves about his perfect hands and the fact that he is bilingual. One of his favorite bands is Spinnerbait, a band Truth Squad considers talentless frat boys. * Patty – Patty is Don's secretary. She has an affair with Don. She ran off with another guy who we later know was her husband. In the novel she gets a divorce with her husband to be with Don. She later sends a picture of herself in lingerie to Barbara, which was taken in Don and Barbara's bedroom, when Barbara was in Florida. * Scarlett Thomas – The manager of Jump Java and also Remy's brother's ex-girlfriend. John Miller had a crush on her. She is a character in Someone Like You. Allusions to other books * Scarlett, who is the manager of Jump Java, was Michael Sherwood's girlfriend and Halley's best friend in Someone Like You. * In Just Listen, Annabel meets Remy and Dexter while she goes backstage when she goes to Bendo to watch Truth Squad. * When Owen first drives Annabel home in Just Listen, there are Truth Squad CDs in the back of his car. * In The Truth About Forever, Macy notices that Stella, the woman who gives her the directions to Delia's house, is reading a book by Barbara Starr. Barbara Starr is Remy's mother. * In Lock and Key, Ruby is introduced to Barbara Starr during the holidays. Her sister Cora was her divorce lawyer. * In The Moon and More, Spinnerbait is playing a gig while Emaline is on a date with Theo. * In Saint Anything, Spinnerbait and Truth Squad are mentioned by Eric. * In \\"Once and For All, Spinnerbait is mentioned. * In \\"The Rest of the Story, Spinnerbait is mentioned.

Isaac played a major role in the rise to the throne of his younger brother, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (), and remained a leading figure in his brother's administration until his death. Isaac was born to the highest aristocracy of mid-11th century Byzantium, a position reinforced through marriage ties to the imperial Doukas dynasty. Well educated and brave, in 1073–1078 Isaac occupied two of the highest military positions in the Byzantine Empire, as Domestic of the Schools and doux of Antioch. His military record against the Seljuk Turks was not particularly distinguished, but on his return to Constantinople in 1078 he gained the favour of Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates, and of Empress Maria of Alania. Isaac and Alexios used imperial favour to further their own designs on the throne, launching a revolt in early 1081 that saw Alexios crowned emperor. As a reward, Alexios created the title of sebastokrator for Isaac, which put him almost on par with the emperor. During Alexios' reign and until his death, Isaac played an important role in domestic affairs in matters of public order and justice, being called to examine several cases of conspiracy or heretical teachings. Early life and career Isaac was the second-eldest son and third child of the domestikos ton scholon John Komnenos, and his wife Anna Dalassene. The exact date of his birth is unknown, but was likely around 1050. According to his niece, the historian- princess Anna Komnene (Alexiad, 77–78), he was physically similar to his younger brother, the future emperor Alexios, though he was paler and his beard was less bushy. According to Anna, he enjoyed hunting and war, where he would put himself in the vanguard during battle. Anna and other contemporaries, like Theophylact of Ohrid, underline Isaac's virtue and his capability of befriending people, although Anna also mentions that he was often short- tempered, and that he could suddenly explode on account of a single word. According to all sources, Isaac was extremely well educated; the Patriarch of Antioch, John the Oxite, records that he was competent in the interpretation of scripture, while Basil of Euchaita credits him with an extensive knowledge of philosophical matters. Only a handful of his writings survive: three treatises on philosophy, directed against the Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus, and a theological compilation against Leo of Chalcedon. As a result of his parentage, he belonged to the highest aristocracy of mid-11th century Byzantium, being the nephew of Emperor Isaac I Komnenos (). Following the trial and exile of his mother in late 1071 or early 1072, he was exiled to the island of Prinkipo alongside her. In order to reconcile the powerful Komnenos clan to himself, the Emperor Michael VII Doukas () soon recalled him and married him (sometime after 4 August 1072) to Irene, a Georgian princess, the daughter of the ruler of Alania, who was first cousin to Michael's wife, Maria of Alania. Shortly after, probably in 1073, he was appointed as domestikos ton scholon of the East,Anna Komnene claims that he also commanded the western, or European, troops. and sent as commander-in-chief (strategos autokrator) to campaign in Anatolia against the Seljuk Turks, who had invaded the area following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. At the first battle, near Caesarea, he was captured by the Turks, and was released only after a ransom was paid. He then returned to Constantinople, via Ancyra, with his younger brother Alexios. In the next year, he was sent east again, this time as doux of Antioch. His predecessor, Joseph Tarchaneiotes, had died, and his son Katakalon, was unable to control the unrest sweeping the city, orchestrated by the Patriarch of Antioch Aemilian, suspected of collusion with the Armenian warlord Philaretos Brachamios, who in the aftermath of Manzikert had established a semi-independent domain in the Taurus Mountains north of the city. Isaac used a ruse to remove the patriarch from the city, but his partisans rose in revolt, and had to be suppressed by force. While confronting a Turkish raid in the spring of 1075, he was again captured by the Turks, and had to be ransomed by the citizens of Antioch for 20,000 gold pieces. The same battle saw the death of his brother-in-law Constantine Diogenes, son of Romanos IV Diogenes (). Isaac remained in Antioch until the first half of 1078, when he returned to Constantinople. Plotting the coup d'état Once back in the capital, he quickly gained the favour of the new emperor, the elderly Nikephoros III Botaneiates (), reportedly due to the latter's fondness for Syrian textiles, which Isaac often gave him as gifts. Accordingly, Botaneiates often called Isaac to dine at his table, gave him the high title of sebastos and the right to reside in the imperial palace. Despite the favour shown to them by Botaneiates, Isaac and Alexios plotted to advance the position of the Komnenos clan by deposing the emperor and seizing the throne. When Botaneiates' Bulgarian confidantes, Boril and Germanos, learned of their intentions, the brothers sought the protection of Empress Maria, who adopted Alexios. The empress feared for status of her son by Michael VII, Constantine Doukas, whom Botaneiates intended to sideline in favour of a certain Synadenos. According to Anna Komnene, the brothers used the opportunity to reveal their plans to the empress, pledging to safeguard Constantine's rights to the succession. Thus, and through Alexios' marriage to Irene Doukaina, the Komnenos brothers secured the support of the still powerful Doukas family. The brothers found an opportune moment in late January 1081, when the sack of Cyzicus by the Seljuks led to a concentration of troops in Thrace, close to the capital. On Sunday, 14 February, the brothers and their partisans met, and on the next day they secretly left Constantinople and made for Adrianople, and then Tzouroulos, where they joined the army. Gaining control over it, they moved it towards Constantinople, setting up camp at the suburb of Skiza. At Skiza, there was contention that Isaac could be proclaimed emperor instead of Alexios, who according to one anonymous chronicle had already been crowned emperor at Adrianople, but the Doukai and the bulk of the army threw their support behind the latter, and Isaac acquiesced. He even demonstratively clasped the imperial purple boots on his brother's feet. The Komnenoi entered Constantinople on 1 April, and Isaac with the rest of the family established themselves in the palace. Career under Alexios I Portrait of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, from a 12th-century Greek manuscript After Alexios gained power, Isaac proved one of his most loyal, steadfast and enthusiastic supporters. Alexios in turn rewarded him by awarding him with the new title of sebastokrator which marked him as a near-equal; in the words of Anna Komnene, an \\"emperor without the purple\\". Isaac already bore his new title in May/June, when he was charged with leading Empress Maria of Alania to the Mangana Monastery, where she was confined on the insistence of the Doukas clan. According to the historian Paul Gautier, Alexios appears to have entrusted his brother with the role of \\"grand inquisitor and guardian of public order\\". As such, Isaac headed a special tribunal, and was charged by Alexios with a number of delicate assignments. Thus, when Alexios left for the Dyrrhachium campaign against the Normans in autumn 1081, Isaac was left in charge of keeping order in Constantinople. During the campaign, Alexios was constantly in need of money to pay his troops. A first appeal for financial aid was met by the Komnenoi themselves, as well as their relatives and supporters, but when a second appeal came soon after, Isaac and his mother, who had been left in charge of the government, were at an impasse. After long deliberation, they decided to turn to the treasures of the Church—following a precedent set by previous emperors all the way back to Heraclius (). Thus, in the winter of 1081/1082, and without prior warning, Isaac went to the Hagia Sophia, convened the patriarchal synod, and in a forceful speech convinced the clergy to allow the confiscation and melting of gold and silver items to cut coin to pay the troops. Only a single member of the synod, the deacon John Metaxas, opposed the move, and even went as far as ridiculing Isaac, but once the confiscation began, Leo, the Metropolitan of Chalcedon, who had not been present at the synod, started to publicly denounce the decision as well as Isaac, its chief instigator. This led to Leo's trial and dismissal by a mixed court composed of senators and senior clergymen in January 1086. Because of his extensive education, according to Anna Komnene, Isaac was placed in charge of the inquest against the philosopher John Italos in February 1082. Finding him guilty of unorthodox teachings, Isaac sent Italos before an ecclesiastical tribunal. In 1083, he donated precious sacral vestments to the Monastery of Petritzos, founded by the general Gregory Pakourianos. In 1087, on account of the Pecheneg raids into the Balkans, the confiscation of ecclesiastical treasure was repeated. According to John the Oxite, some recalcitrant monks who tried to hide precious vessels were even whipped and imprisoned. Once again Leo of Chalcedon began to denounce these measures, and in late 1087 Isaac, who once again was left in charge of Constantinople in his brother's absence, exiled him to either Sozopolis or Mesembria on the Black Sea coast of Thrace. In 1092/1094, his son John Komnenos, recently named doux of Dyrrhachium, was accused by Archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid of plotting against Alexios. A trial was held in front of the emperor at Philippopolis, to where Isaac went in haste. According to Anna Komnene, who gives a detailed account of the proceedings, Isaac himself was not certain of his son's innocence, and maintained a cautious stance until he realized that Alexios himself did not intend to press the matter. Then he intervened forcefully in his son's defence, and even quarreled with his younger brother Adrianos, whom he accused of slander. In the meantime, the affair of Leo of Chalcedon had flared up again. Leo's nephew, Nicholas of Adrianople, in a letter to his uncle, wrote that Isaac denounced those who opposed the confiscations as \\"worshipers of matter\\" (ὑλολάτραι), claiming that they accorded to the precious decorations of the icons the same veneration as to the saints depicted on them. Leo of Chalcedon responded to his nephew with a long theological defence of his positions, which caused great uproar. To defend himself from Leo's criticism, Isaac set about compiling a corpus of patristic and synodal texts against Leo's teachings. As a result, in late 1094, a church council was held at the Palace of Blachernae that examined the affair, under the direct presidency of Alexios I, with Isaac as one of the three judges, along with the patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem, Nicholas Grammatikos and Symeon II. The council ended with Leo's admission of his errors, whereupon he was reinstated in his see. In the words of the historian Konstantinos Varzos, it was \\"a theological and political triumph for Isaac\\". Isaac also became involved in the affair of the doux of Chaldia, Theodore Gabras, and his son Gregory. Gregory was affianced to one of Isaac's daughters, until Theodore married again, to an Alan princess. As the latter was a cousin of Isaac's own wife, the prospective marriage of Gregory and Isaac's daughter was called off as uncanonical. Sometime between 1094 and 1098, when Gregory was held as a hostage for his father's loyalty in Constantinople, Isaac hosted Theodore Gabras at his palace on the shores of the Propontis. Isaac also played a leading role in the uncovering of the conspiracy of the four Anemas brothers, which took place sometime between 1097 and 1104 and involved several senior military and civil officials. Isaac persuaded the senator Solomon to reveal the members and details of the plot. Shortly after that he also led the inquiries against the Bogomil leader Basil the Physician. Towards the end of his life, Isaac entered a monastery, taking the monastic name John. He died \\"one year and a few months\\" after his mother, sometime between 1102 and 1104. His wife also entered a monastery under the name Xene. She died about a year after him, and Emperor Alexios took his children under his care. Isaac is commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Synodikon of Orthodoxy, which is read on the Sunday of Orthodoxy. Family Isaac Komnenos was married to the Georgian princess Irene, by whom he had four sons and at least two daughters: * John Komnenos (1073 – after 1136), protosebastos and governor (doux) of Dyrrhachium from 1092 to 1106, married Maria Doukaina, niece of Empress Irene Doukaina. * Unnamed daughter (born ), married a son of the protoproedros Constantine Doukas. Varzos suggests the name of Anna for her. * Alexios Komnenos (born – after 1108), sebastos and doux of Dyrrhachium from 1106 until after 1108, married a lady called Zoe, of unknown family. * Unnamed daughter (born ), engaged to Gregory Gabras until the engagement was broken off as uncanonical in 1094. Varzos suggests the name Maria for her. Her later fate is unknown. * Constantine Komnenos ( – after 1147), sebastos and doux of Beroea in 1107, later megas droungarios. Married a lady issued from the Antiochos and Euphorbenos clans. * Adrianos Komnenos ( – 1157/64), sebastos and doux of Chaldia. Married a lady of unknown name or family, and became a monk. In he became Archbishop of Bulgaria as John IV. * Sophia Komnene ( – ), married the sebastos Dokeianos. * Eudokia Komnene ( – after 1150), married the sebastos Nikephoros Botaneiates.

He attended Long Beach State University. He is the father of former NFL wide receiver and kick returner Eric Metcalf. Metcalf finished his NFL career with 3,489 rushing yards, 245 receptions for 2,457 yards, 936 punt return yards, and 3,087 yards returning kickoffs. He also scored 36 touchdowns (24 rushing, 9 receiving, 1 punt return, 2 kickoff returns). He holds the record for most games with 250+ all purpose yards: 7. In the 14-game 1975 season, Metcalf set a then-NFL record for combined yards with 2,462. This feat has since been eclipsed during the 16-game era (instituted in 1978), with Lionel James of the San Diego Chargers being the first to do so in 1985. James' head coach was Don Coryell, who also coached Metcalf during his record-setting season. He also became the first player in NFL history to average at least 30 yards per kick return and 10 yards per punt return in the same season. Joshua Cribbs of the Cleveland Browns became the second in 2007. Metcalf also played three full seasons in the Canadian Football League with the Toronto Argonauts. In 1978, he rushed 169 times for 669 yards, and caught 31 passes. In 1979, he carried the ball 141 times for 691 yards and caught 55 passes, and in his final year, 1980, he rushed for 540 yards and caught 51 passes. While he was a division all star in 1979, his rushing average is below the 5 yards per carry expected by a good running back in the CFL (with its three down game) and his performance in Toronto was seen as underwhelming.

History Before 1970, the area that is now Pedernales Falls State Park was a working ranch, known as the Circle Bar Ranch. The state of Texas purchased the land for the park in 1970, and the park opened in 1971. Recreation Many of the activities in Pedernales Falls State Park center around the Pedernales River: swimming, tubing, wading and fishing. The park also has a number of picnic areas and campsites, including some primitive campsites that require a hike of over two miles to reach. There are also of hiking and mountain biking trails, 10 miles of equestrian trails, and 14 miles of backpacking trails. There is a park store where you can purchase gift items and ice. The entrance fee is $6 daily for persons 13 years or older, children 12 and under are allowed in at no cost.https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/pedernales-falls Like many rivers in central Texas, the Pedernales is prone to variable water levels.

Note that gear ratio, also known as speed ratio, of a gear train is defined as the ratio of the angular velocity of the input gear to the angular velocity of the output gear, and thus a higher gear ratio implies a larger speed reduction, i.e. the input speed is reduced more at the output. The highest gear ratio is obtained at either first gear or reverse gear, but only first gear is typically taken into consideration while talking about crawl ratio. A potentially confusing terminology is that although a better crawl ratio is achieved by a higher gear ratio, it is common to refer to a better crawl ratio as “lower crawl ratio” rather than “higher crawl ratio” because it’s for driving at lower speeds. The crawl ratio is aptly named because when a vehicle is driven using the lowest gear (i.e. first gear), it moves the slowest (i.e. crawl speed) at a given engine rpm, and thus produces the highest output torque (i.e. crawl torque) at the road wheels due to conservation of power. Since crawl ratio of a vehicle represents the total reduction of the engine speed until the road wheels, it is determined by combining the contributions of different elements on the entire drive train, including transmission and differential, both of which typically introduce a certain amount of speed reduction. Since a lower crawl ratio (higher gear ratio) implies a larger output torque on the road wheels, it is desirable for vehicles that need to pull large loads, climb steep inclines, or drive over obstacles on the road or terrain, such as rocks, which is sometimes referred to as crawling over the rocks. Therefore, crawl ratios are most often discussed for large SUVs, trucks and off-road vehicles. Note that tire size (or dimensions of the road wheels) does not affect the gear ratio of a vehicle, and thus using a different size tire on the same vehicle does not affect the torque on the road wheels or the crawl ratio. However, for a given engine speed and a gear ratio, the output force on the road wheels decreases as the tire size increases. A lower force in turn decreases the acceleration of rotating wheels. Therefore, the smallest tires that are still big enough to drive over obstacles perform better for a given crawl ratio. Crawl ratio can vary greatly among vehicles. Crawl ratios in the 60's (i.e. a gear ratio of 60:1) are quite capable; in the 80's, very respectable; in the 110's, impressive; and anything beyond the 130's is usually considered as the point of diminishing returns.

Initially, the audience knows very little about Sam, much as Sam knows little about himself due to holes in his memory dubbed the \\"Swiss cheese effect\\"—a side effect from the time travel (and an effective trope to allow the writers to add to Sam's character as the show went on). Eventually, it turned out that Sam was a true Renaissance Man, equally good at math/science and the arts. His skills allow him to adapt to the various situations that he finds himself in, although many of those situations still take Sam off guard with comical results. Sam tends to fall in love easily, yet be naive about women; his traveling companion Al Calavicci has playfully called him a \\"Boy Scout.\\" Sam also learned painful things from his past that likely inspired him to travel through time in the first place. Sam tries to do the right thing no matter what, although when the leaps hit close to home, he tends to lose perspective and make irrational decisions; at those times, he requires Al to guide him back to the right path.  Backstory  Sam Beckett was born at 12:30 p.m. EST on August 8, 1953, in \\"fictional\\" Elk Ridge, Indiana to dairy farmer John Samuel Beckett and his wife Thelma Louise Beckett.Quantum Leap episode \\"Mirror Image\\", aired May 5, 1993 As a child, he had two cats, named Donner and Blitzen, but never had a dog. Sam was a child prodigy, learning to read at age 2 and do advanced calculus in his head at age 5. By the time he was 10, he could beat a computer at chess. Sam also played piano in a concert at Carnegie Hall when he was 19, plays guitar, is a good dancer, sings tenor, and his favorite song is John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\". Sam has a photographic memory, an IQ of 267, likes dry or light beer, and microwave popcorn. Sam also knows several kinds of martial arts and has been afraid of heights since he was 9 years old. In his teen years, Sam's family was dealt a hard blow when his older brother, Tom, was killed in Vietnam on April 8, 1970, but Sam leaps into his brother's unit and saves him on that day. Tom (Thomas Andrew Beckett) was a good athlete, an All- State basketball player, an Annapolis graduate, is a Navy SEAL Commander, and has a wife named Mary. Sam has one sister named Katie (Katherine Elizabeth Beckett), born during a flood in 1957, whose first husband was an abusive alcoholic named Chuck. They divorced and she is now married to Navy officer Lt. Jim Bonnick. They have lived in Hawaii with Thelma Beckett since 1974. Sam graduated from high school at age 16 and, following his brother's advice, attended MIT in the early 1970s. While at MIT, Sam and his mentor, Professor Sebastian LoNigro, developed a string theory of time travel (\\"Her Charm\\"; see below). Sam went through four years of MIT in two years, and continued through various colleges to eventually obtain seven doctoral degrees in music, medicine, quantum physics, archaeology, ancient languages, chemistry, and astronomy, but not psychiatry or law. In the pilot episode, Sam is told he only has six doctorates; this was later retconned to seven. He speaks six modern languages including English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, and Japanese, but not Italian or Hebrew. He knows four extinct languages, including Egyptian hieroglyphics. He's proficient in martial arts such as Judo, Karate, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo. He has won a Nobel Prize for physics, which he remembers during one leap (\\"Disco Inferno\\"). For this, TIME called him \\"the next Einstein\\". Sam's father suffered a fatal heart attack in 1974 while Sam was in college; the guilt of his absence during his family's time of need would stay with Sam for years. One of the few things that Sam cannot do is cook; two of his onscreen attempts at this, in the episodes \\"Another Mother\\" and \\"Good-bye, Norma Jean\\" failed humorously, as did his attempt at baking in \\"Liberation.\\" He did however cook a meal for the colleagues of the husband of the woman he leaps into in \\"Liberation,\\" and there was nothing to suggest that it was anything other than a normal meal that everybody ate with no problems. No one ate the breakfasts he made in \\"One Strobe Over the Line,\\" \\"What Price Gloria?\\" or \\"Liberation.\\" He was able to make chitlins with Al's help in \\"The Color of Truth,\\" but it isn't shown whether or not anyone ate them. As a young adult in the 1980s, Sam was a key member of the Starbright Project (details on the nature of the project were not revealed on the show), where he would meet some of his closest and most trusted friends: Al Calavicci, a decorated naval officer; a brilliant computer programmer known simply as Gushie; and Dr. Donna Eleese, the love of Sam's life, whom he met in 1984. Five years after the Starbright Project, Sam and Donna were engaged, but Sam was jilted at the altar on June 5, 1989 and never saw Donna again. On Sam's third leap, he meets Donna years before their actual engagement. Realizing that Donna's damaged relationship with her father is the reason why she can never commit to a relationship (as her father left her, she subconsciously feels that any man she meets will inevitably abandon her and thus prevents them from doing so by leaving herself), Sam drives Donna out to reconcile with her father so that she might get some closure. We learn later in the episode \\"The Leap Back\\" that as a result of this, Donna never leaves Sam at the altar, and they are married to this day. However, before \\"The Leap Back\\" Sam has no memory of Donna and his marriage. The reason for this is twofold. First, Sam's \\"Swiss cheesed\\" brain caused him amnesia in regards to his marriage. Second, Donna understood that in some cases, in order for Sam to successfully leap, it would be necessary for Sam to have romantic encounters with various women. In order to spare the \\"choir-boy\\" Sam mental anguish (it is established that, unlike Al, Sam takes vows of marriage very seriously) and to facilitate his leaping, Donna forbids Al or anyone else from alerting Sam that he is married. A few months later in 1989, Sam and Al spearheaded Project Quantum Leap, a time travel experiment based on the string theory Sam had developed while at MIT. The PQL facility was located in Stallion's Gate, New Mexico, in a primarily underground complex. In 1995, after constructing the necessary machinery, including a holographic imaging chamber and a supercomputer (\\"Ziggy\\") with access to vast historical databases, the project's funds were running thin. Eager to prove his theories, Sam prematurely stepped into the nuclear accelerator chamber and propelled himself back in time.  Time traveller  In the pilot episode, Sam awoke in 1956, having exchanged places in time with an Air Force test pilot. He is startled to see a stranger in the mirror as he prepares to shave. Others also see Sam as the person he displaced. As Sam would soon discover, quantum-leaping had an unforeseen side-effect: He was struck with partial amnesia; he describes his own situation with the analogy of his brain being like a hunk of Swiss cheese, with his memory full of holes and lacking some personal information about his past, the most consistently absent detail being his marriage to Donna (with Donna preferring that Sam not be reminded of their marriage so that he can more easily commit to the people his hosts are in love with and thus solve whatever he is there to accomplish, consoling herself about Sam's 'cheating' by reasoning that his amnesia means that he isn't technically cheating on her but is the equivalent of a man unaware that someone else is in love with him). To lead Sam and the audience from this confusion comes Al, an observer from Sam's own time, except Al has to convince Sam he is not a hallucination; but a hologram tuned to Sam's brainwaves that only Sam can see and hear, convincing an amnesiac he is real is difficult. Al conveys to Sam a theory to return Sam to the present: that an unknown influence (God, Fate, or Time) was using Sam to correct a mistake in the past — in this case, saving the life of the pilot Sam had displaced, who was killed in an experimental aircraft in the original history. When Sam corrected the timeline, he leaped forward, but not all the way home; this time, he found himself assuming the identity of a minor-league professional baseball player named Tim Fox. For the rest of his life (an epilogue in the series finale tells us Sam never gets home, but in our terms, it was the next four years/five seasons, the duration of the show) Sam would continue to travel back and forth through time; swapping identities with various people and as a tagline for the show reiterated, \\"setting right what once went wrong.\\"  Dr. Beckett's string theory  Sam's theory of time travel, developed with Professor LoNigro, is based on an expanding, but finite, universe. A person's life is like a length of string; one end represents birth, the other represents death. If one were to tie the ends of the string together, their life becomes a loop. Next, by balling the loop together, the days in one's life would touch one another out of sequence. Therefore, jumping from one part of the string to another would allow someone to travel back and forth within their own lifetime, thus making a \\"quantum leap\\" between each time period. (How exactly these things are accomplished is never explained, but it has been suggested that this theory borrowed heavily from van Strickum's closed timelike curve.) Keeping this principle in mind, Sam's leaps were generally limited to periods within his own lifetime; he could not leap to a date prior to his birth or into his own future. There were, however, a few exceptions. In \\"The Leap Back,\\" Sam switched places with Al, who leaped back into 1945, and later in the episode was able to leap himself back into Al's place in the past. The explanation was that the simo- leap with Al had left Sam with enough of Al's genetic coding that he could leap back past his own lifetime (since it was still within Al's). In \\"The Leap Between the States,\\" Sam was able to leap outside of his own lifetime and found himself in the American Civil War in the life of his great-grandfather; the explanation was that Sam's close genetic link with his ancestor allowed him to do this. This was also partly due to an \\"error\\" that was referenced and then corrected by Ziggy, implying that Sam would not be able to pull off a similar feat again and was once more limited to his own timeline. Two early episodes, \\"Play It Again, Seymour\\" (which took place on April 14, 1953) and \\"The Americanization of Machiko\\" (which took place on August 4, 1953) had Sam leaping into dates prior to the date later given as his birthday, August 8, 1953. Although these would appear to be continuity errors on the part of the show, creator Donald P. Bellisario has proffered the explanation that Sam's life dates from his conception rather than his actual birth, and thus dates such as these which are less than nine months prior to August 8, 1953, would be valid leap dates. However, once Sam's proper birthday is established, there are no further leaps prior to that date aside from the exceptions mentioned above. Al explains the string theory in the pilot episode, and Sam, recovering his memory of the theory, turns around and explains it to Donna in the second episode, \\"Star-Crossed.\\" This theory is later revealed to have been relayed to by the leaped Sam Beckett to an actor and would-be time traveller Moe Stein in \\"Future Boy\\" (whose original theory was simply connect the beginning and end of one's life) who explains the full version on his television show in response to a viewer question from young Sam Beckett who, at that time, was still a child living in Indiana; only his own lack of resources prevented Moe from creating Project Quantum Leap decades before Sam.  Changes in his own life  Though explicitly forbidden by his own guidelines to alter the past for his own benefit, Sam did alter his own history and those of his loved ones on a number of occasions: * In the second episode of the series, \\"Star- Crossed\\", Sam reunited the 19-year-old version of his future fiancée, Donna, with her estranged father (while unknowingly exposing the Watergate Scandal). Sam will later learn (season four, see below) that Donna's fears of being abandoned by the people she cared for never became an issue, resulting in her not leaving Sam at the altar, and the couple was married. This change combines with the changes in the season two premiere (see below) to save Project Quantum Leap (PQL). Sam's marriage to Donna brings her onto PQL and, through her father's military connections, assure government funding, thus replacing the Project's private funding oversight committee with a government oversight committee. * In the second-season premiere \\"Honeymoon Express\\", the government oversight committee tried to shut down PQL by rejecting its multibillion- dollar annual budget. In an attempt to prove that Sam had leaped, Al tried to get Sam to prevent the downing of the U-2 since he leaped in two days before the event. Sam was unable to prevent the U-2 mission, but by saving the life of a young woman and subsequently helping her pass her legal exams, he saved the PQL when the same woman becomes the Senator leading the government oversight committee that now approves the Project's budget. * In the second season closing episode \\"M.I.A.\\", Al tried to get Sam, who leaps into a San Diego police detective in 1969 to save his first marriage by stopping Beth, who Al sees crying while on duty, working undercover, from remarrying, when she thinks Al is dead in Vietnam. This nearly costs the life of the man Sam was really there to save, the partner of his leapee, since Al had missed running other scenarios through Ziggy to confirm Sam's true mission. In the end, Sam leaped, but was unable to save Al's marriage (until later—see final bullet below). * In the third-season premiere \\"The Leap Home (Part 1)\\", Sam leaped into himself as a teenager in his hometown Elk Ridge, Indiana in 1969 to win a basketball game his team originally lost (the victory will allow his coach to go on to become a professional coach while also giving two of his teammates the chance to go to college on the subsequent scholarships). While there, he tried unsuccessfully to save the lives of his father and brother (his father being destined to die of a heart attack by 1972 and his brother during a mission in Vietnam), but Al suggested that, in the end, he was only there to have an opportunity to say goodbye to them, which is not completely the case, as he persuades his dad to eat better and exercise, but still can't change the fate of his brother, who's headed to Vietnam. On Sam's very next leap (\\"The Leap Home (Part 2)\\"), he found himself in his brother Tom's SEAL unit in Vietnam. While there, Sam saved his brother's life. Sam missed a chance to free a young Al and two other POWs from their Viet-Cong captors, although Al assured him that he understood due to Sam ensuring that photo evidence proving Al was still alive would come back to the government. * In the fourth-season premiere \\"The Leap Back\\", Sam and Al exchanged places as Leaper and Observer, leaving Al in 1945, apparently on the very day of his birth, and finally returning Sam to PQL's laboratory. The leap back allows Sam to realize (leaping keeps some facts muddled for him) that he and Donna (see first bullet in this section) are married. When Al is incapacitated in the past, Sam once again enters his time machine to exchange places with Al. * In the fifth-season episode \\"Trilogy (Part 2),\\" Sam fathers a child who proves to be his true genetic child, not the child of his Leapee. Samantha Josephine 'Sammy Jo' Fuller, like Sam, is a child prodigy with an eidetic memory. She would grow up to join the staff of PQL, never knowing that Sam is her true father. * In the series finale \\"Mirror Image\\", Sam learned the truth that he was, and had always been, the one in control of his journey through time (albeit only via his subconscious mind up to this point). Sam then returned to a specific point in time, to reveal his true self to Al's first wife, Beth, while assuring her that Al was alive as a POW in Vietnam who would return to her.  Finale  As stated above, in the final episode of the show Sam learned from a bartender named Al (played by Bruce McGill, who also appeared in the first episode as a different character) that he was in control of his leaps and could have returned home whenever he wanted. The bartender reminded Sam that he created Project Quantum Leap to help the world, and that in each leap he changed people and events for the better. Although Sam wanted to go home, he instead chose to return and inform Beth that Al was still alive. The final caption of the show tells the audience that, in the end, Sam never returned home; with the title card at the end somewhat unceremoniously announcing it, and also with his last name misspelled: \\"Dr. Sam Becket never returned home.\\"  References  Quantum Leap characters Fictional characters from Indiana Fictional physicians Fictional linguists Fictional engineers Fictional scientists Fictional Nobel laureates Television characters introduced in 1989 ","title":"Sam Beckett"},{"id":"6286814","text":"Taiwan Sugar Museum in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Originally part of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces Brigade (ISOF BDE), this aggressive unit has a role comparable to that of the United States Army Rangers in the War on terror. The unit is now designated the 1st Commando Battalion, part of the 1st Special Operations Brigade.DJ Elliott, Iraqi Counter Terrorist Bureau (page 8, Iraqi Security Forces Order of Battle), Montrose Toast, information cut-off date 30 November 2009, via Iraqi Order of Battle Commonly confused with other units that called themselves Commandos after the creation of the 36th Commandos; this unit is one of the most combat experienced/proven units in the new Iraqi Army.  History of the 36th CDO BN  On 25 November 2003 a decision was made between the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), the Commander United States Central Command (CDRCENTCOM), the Commander Combined Joint Task Force 7 (CDR CJTF-7), and the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC). These elements agreed to form a Baghdad-based, 500-man battalion by integrating militiamen from five (5) Political Parties: Iraqi National Accord (INA), Iraqi National Congress (INC), Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). The men would be well-trained, physically fit, and would serve the new Iraqi nation and not just one party. Although the battalion was created from its inception to be a special forces commando battalion that would conduct offensive operations, the decision was made to initially mask its purpose. At the time, each U.S. Army division serving in Iraq was tasked to create Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (ICDC) units, and the composite commando unit creation was hidden in this effort. As part of the CJSOTF-AP J-3, MAJ Ace was tasked to coordinate the creation of this battalion. The members of this battalion would come from all over Iraq, although their base of operations would be in Baghdad. As part of negotiations with 1st Armored Division (1 AD) to allow initial training and basing in their area of operations, it was agreed that the battalion would count against the thirty-six Iraqi Civil Defense Corps battalions that 1AD was tasked to create (of which only 18 had been created at this time). To cement the agreement, the battalion was given a unit designation as the 36th CICDC (Composite-ICDC). The challenge was to have this unit operational in one month (26 December 2003). CDRCENTCOM tasked CJSOTF-AP to attach USSF advisors with this battalion and develop this new type of ICDC operations. FOB 51 1st Bn. 5th SFG (A) re-tasked AOB 520, ODB (-), three ODA's(-) and 1 full ODA from performing Unconventional Warfare(UW) and Direct Action (DA) missions to standing up the 36th ICDC Battalion. Split teams lined up with 4 Infantry Companies, plus a Scout and HQ Platoon; 521- A co., 523- B co., 524- C co., 533- D co., 533- Scouts and 520- HQ. AOB 520 CDR, MAJ John was the OIC with MSG Ron, 533 Team Sgt. as the NCOIC. 3 December 2003, the five Iraqi political parties sent their militiamen to Camp Dogwood, located approximately 20 km south of Baghdad, for 1 week of basic training. This phase consisted of unit assignment, medical screening, and basic soldier skills. After completion of this phase they moved to Camp Falcon, south Baghdad, where the unit received 2 weeks of Advanced Operations training. This phase focused on patrolling, CQB techniques, urban movement, and development of primary/subordinate leaders. Towards the end of this phase, ODA's 534 and 535 replaced the split teams from 521, 523 and 524; 535- A co., 535- B co., 533- C co., 533- D co., 534- Scouts and HQ. The Scout NCOIC was SFC Brett Walden, who paid the ultimate price for Iraq's Freedom in the summer of 2005 in the Nineveh Province on a separate engagement. CJSOTF-AP met the timeline with the graduation of the 36th CICDC Bn. and A co. conducting the new fielded units first combat reconnaissance patrol on the night of the 26 December 2003. The Companies were assigned AO’s in Baghdad, which they relocated to with their split teams. The teams lived in the same quarters, eating, training and developing rapport with their assigned companies. 36th commando BN on night mission near Amarah From 2004–2005, The 36th CICDC evolved into the 36th Commandos. Several ODAs served with them, to include; ODAs from 2nd Bn 5th Group, then 533/535/513 combined and some 10th Group teams. Over 1 year after graduation, they received the New Lithuanian uniforms (which they had been promised to receive at that graduation.) A 36th CICDC patch was made in the shape of Iraq using the colors of the Iraqi flag as a back drop and centered in green the number \\"36\\". In the summer of 2004, ODA 533's SFC Jade, SFC Steve and ODA 535's SSG Matt, developed Commando school located at FOB 51 Headquarters on the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) grounds. The school was located on property that was once used by Saddam Hussein as a private zoo/Palace. The Commando School focused on CQB, marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, objective infiltration (to include fast roping from helicopters) and the character development of leaders/subordinate leaders. 2005–2006 Special units within the 36th Commandos were formed and known as Special Recon Elements and Scouts. These were Stood up by members of the 10th Special Forces and ODA's from 2nd BN 5th Special Forces group. ODA 542 and 543 Assisted and Advised the Commandos from Camp Justice and then relocated to area 4 at Baghdad International Airport (Biap).  2006  Before the 36th Commandos, Iraq had no other unit named Commandos. As their AO opened and missions took them to all parts of Iraq, the media followed. The success of the unit became known throughout Iraq. Many units changed their name from Special Forces to Commandos, including police units and other militias. Left to right: MSG Ron, C co SGM and C co.

On the backside of the grounds was a 3-storey building, which had been a day care for the children of the workers at the MOO. It had several rooms, multiple entrances and could be approached from several directions by multiple vehicles because of its location in the MoO parking lot. This served as an excellent training platform for CQB because this one building could be set up to mirror and be approached exactly like any target house/objective. Because most of the objectives were Raids, C co. 36th quickly adopted the name “Serriat Al Icktiham-Charlie” or Assault Company “Charlie”.  36th CDO BN Insignia (incomplete)  Emblem of the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion.  36th Commando Battalion Unit Patch  The 36th Commando Bn. received a new unit patch badge, green and round in shape with an attacking eagle centered.

The Company patch was made into a sign with, \\"Serriah Al Icktaham Charlie\\" written in Arabic on top and Assault Company \\"Charlie\\" written in English on the bottom. When a new recruit showed up to the unit they were given the C co. patch, which was placed above the left chest pocket and an Iraqi flag, placed on his right shoulder. When a Commando went on his 1st Combat Operation with the unit, he received a \\"Kawat Al Hassa\\" or \\"Special Forces\\" tab on his left shoulder. This was a tab used during the Saddam Regime.

It serves the town of Benalla, and opened on 18 August 1873, as the temporary terminus of the line from Violet Town, before the line was extended to Wangaratta on 28 October 1873.Benalla Vicsig A goods shed and sidings are located to the west of the station, whilst a locomotive depot was formerly located to the north. A turntable remains, and, until the broad gauge was converted to standard gauge, was occasionally used by steam locomotives. To the north of the station, the Oaklands line, towards Yarrawonga, branches off. Benalla was also the junction for the now closed Tatong line. Former station Baddaginnie was located between Benalla and Violet Town, while former stations Winton and Glenrowan were located between Benalla and Wangaratta. History The site of the station was a controversial decision at the time, guided by the 1870 flood of the Broken River to the south that engulfed the town. The railway line opened on 18 August 1873, but only temporary facilities were provided. The first permanent building, of identical design to that at Seymour railway station, was provided in 1874. It was extended in 1888, with the addition of dining and refreshment room facilities and administrative offices, all topped by a large tower. The upper storeys were demolished in 1974, on the basis that the whole building was too expensive to maintain. The bridge over the Broken River, of iron plate-girder construction, was the longest metal girder bridge in Australia at the time of construction, totalling 241.7 metres. Listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, it was the second bridge of its type built in Victoria, and the first metal railway bridge both designed and fabricated within the colony. The Oaklands branch line to St James opened in 1883, and was extended to Yarrawonga in 1886. The goods yard was expanded for this extra traffic in 1885, with more sidings added in 1902. Around this time, the original goods shed was demolished and replaced. The Tatong branch line followed in 1913, and remained until closure in 1947. In 1913, Benalla gained a second and third platform, these being a wide island platform, with a cantilevered verandah, located to the west of the main station building. The platforms were linked by an iron footbridge, which was provided in 1888, and was located across the station yard. The island platform was removed in 1937, leaving the main platform only. Two signal boxes were built in 1888, both being extended in 1914. Only the signal box at the Up end remains today, but is unused. A locomotive shed was provided at Benalla early on, located at the down end of the station yard. Of corrugated iron construction, it could house six engines. In 1899, a roundhouse shed was erected, with the old shed used for wagon repairs. In 1908, a turntable was provided, replaced in 1953 by an electrically driven unit. It use declined after the demise of steam locomotives, and several stalls were removed in 1960 to allow the construction of the parallel standard gauge track. An underpass was provided at the Up end of the station in 1979, to replace a footbridge that had been located at the Down end of the station. In 1985, the former Way & Works area was replace with a new camp site. During that time, the former office and crew rooms of the locomotive depot were also demolished, and the passenger facilities in the main station building were also refurbished. On 27 April 1988, the former BP and Mobil oil sidings were abolished. Further alterations occurred in May 1991, including the removal of a number of sidings, crossovers, disc signals and signal posts, and the sleeving of a number of levers, with further alterations occurring in July of the same year. Also during 1991, the electric staff sections Benalla - Glenrowan - Wangaratta were abolished, and were replaced with electric staff section Benalla 'B' Box - Wangaratta. The locomotive depot was hit by a severe storm on 22 November 1994, leaving the shed damaged and destroying two Tait carriages stored inside. The shed was later demolished. Qube Logistics constructed an intermodal terminal in the former goods yard in late 2018 to receive containerised cement and fly ash from Sydney for use in pre-cast panels being manufactured by Boral for the West Gate Tunnel. The first cement was delivered to the facility on 19 December of that year.

Part of the Bligh Building, it was built in the 1920s for vaudeville. During its heyday, it housed a Wurlitzer pipe organ, which is now in private ownership in Washington. The theater was demolished in 2000, but the retail portion of the building, now known as the Pacific Building, still stands. Bligh Building and Capitol Theater Terra cotta facade detail is all that remains of the theater portion of the building The building, constructed in 1926 for owner Frank D. Bligh, covered a quarter of a block. At the time it was built, it had twelve storefronts and thirty-five rooms designed for offices, as well as what was known at the time as the New Bligh Capitol Theater, with 1,200 seats. Bligh owned several theaters in Salem, including the original Bligh Theater built in 1912 and closed in 1927. For a time Bligh owned the Klinger Grand Theater, which he also renamed Bligh Theater. The Capitol Theater's brightly lit marquee was constructed of stained glass in the shape of the dome of the second Oregon State Capitol building, which was destroyed in a 1935 fire.  Decline and demolition  The theater's stage house abutted the Elsinore Theatre's stage house and the bricked-in proscenium arch can still be seen The theater converted from vaudeville to movies. By 1952 the glass dome marquee had been replaced. By the 1980s, it was one of only two pre-World War II theaters left in downtown Salem, which had once hosted as many as eight. Like its neighbor, the Elsinore Theatre, the Capitol declined to a second-run movie house. It was closed in 1990. The Capitol Theater was demolished in May/June 2000 because of structural decay. The location is now a parking lot, however, the adjoining office and retail space remains. This retail building, known as the Bligh Building and currently as the Pacific Building, is a contributing property of the Salem Downtown State Street-Commercial Street Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Theater organ The theater's 3/8 (3-manual/8-rank) \\"Mighty Wurlitzer\\" theatre organ was installed in 1926. In 1941, the organ was moved to Seattle's Civic Ice Arena. In 1964-65, the organ was moved to the Seattle Center Food Circus. It was sold at auction in 1976, and is currently installed in a private home in Washington, combined with parts from Portland's Majestic/United Artists Theatre organ to make a 3/18 Wurlitzer.

It was first publicly mentioned in a 1986 episode of the American television drama L.A. Law, although a technique of the same name appears in the book The Sensuous Woman, which was first published in 1969. L.A. Law television episode In an episode of L.A. Law titled \\"The Venus Butterfly\\", which first aired on November 21, 1986, a man who is unimpressive in appearance and personality, but who nevertheless has tremendous success with women, claims to have a sexual technique that has caused this success, and reveals it to his lawyer, Stuart Markowitz (Michael Tucker). The technique itself is never described to the audience. In a hotel bedroom scene it is implied that Markowitz uses the technique on his girlfriend, Ann Kelsey (Jill Eikenberry), with great positive effect. According to authors Tim Brooks & Earle Marsh, the Venus Butterfly was pivotal in Kelsey and Markowitz becoming a long-term couple.Tim Brooks & Earle Marsh, \\"The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Show, 1946–present.\\" The writer of that section of the episode, Terry Louise Fisher, stated that she had just made it up. The show received many letters and phone calls from viewers asking what it was, as well as two requests to license the term.A Behind the Scenes Look at L.A. Law, Cosmopolitan, December 1987 (reprint on fansite, retrieved 23:45, August 12, 2006 (UTC)) Playboy magazine did a feature speculating on what the technique was and included suggestions from readers.

Sue Johanson variation As described by writer and sex educator Sue Johanson in 2005, the Venus Butterfly is a variant of cunnilingus. It involves using one's tongue on a woman's clitoris, using one's fingers on her vagina and using the other hand in the perineal area, \\"even penetrating the rectum [i.e. anus] if that is pleasurable for her.\\"Performing Oral Sex on a Female Talk Sex Productions Inc. & Sue Johanson 2005, URL accessed August 6, 2006.

Basic Cable Awash in Raunch: a content analysis of expanded basic cable's original prime-time series, Parents Television Council, November, 2004 The One Hour Orgasm variation The 1988 book The One Hour Orgasm: How to Learn the Amazing \\"Venus Butterfly\\" Technique, written by Leah and Bob Schwartz, is dedicated to educating readers on how to perform the technique. In this variation either the woman or man is lying down, and their partner, sitting next to them with their legs positioned around each other, very gently, with just the minimal amount of pressure (the \\"touch\\" of a butterfly's wing, at least on the clitoris) stimulates the clitoris or the hood, with the penis at the two-o'clock or ten-o'clock position. The book suggests keeping the clitoral shaft steady with one thumb laid gently along and beside it, with the other thumb lying lengthwise just within the vagina but not moving deep within it. (All of this is done using a lubricant.) The light pressure continues using the same speed throughout until a peak is reached close to orgasm but not quite (although it can be continued if multiple orgasms are the goal), then the speed is slowed down even further or stopped, but very soon continued again and the person is brought back near orgasm or given a second or third orgasm. This orgasm control on the part of the person providing the technique can be learned over time with a particular partner. The technique can be sustained, \\"surfing\\" near the orgasm but stopping occasionally, for a very long time, hence the term \\"One Hour Orgasm\\".The One Hour Orgasm: How to Learn the Amazing \\"Venus Butterfly\\" Technique, a book written by Leah and Bob Schwartz, 1988. The book is mentioned in the film Meet the Fockers. A set of video-tapes (for him, and for her) were later made by the Schwartzes, showing how the technique is performed.

Born in Witbank, Muller is considered one of the greatest South African rugby players, captaining the national side, the Springboks in nine tests, and is a member of the International Rugby Hall of Fame. His usual position was at number eight. Career history Muller made his international debut for the Springboks on 16 July 1949, in the starting line-up in the first a four matches against the touring All Blacks. The South Africans won the first test, 15–11, which was played at Newlands. The Springboks' winning ways continued at Ellis Park, when they won the second test 12–6. South Africa made it 3 games to nil with a 9–3 win in Durban. The series was tied up as a four to nil whitewash of the All Blacks, as the Springboks won the fourth encounter 11–8 in Port Elizabeth. In 1951 Muller skippered South Africa at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, which saw the Springboks run away 44–0 winners, with Muller scoring one try. After defeating Scotland, the Springboks had the tough task of playing the other three home nations, as well as France on the rest of the tour. The Springboks made it two from two at Lansdowne Road, defeating Ireland 17–5. Muller guided the team to a closer victory in the subsequent match against Wales in Cardiff, which saw the Springboks keep the clean winning record on tour 3–0, winning the game 6–3, a South African drop-goal proving the difference between the two sides. The tour had now entered early January, and the next assignment for the Springboks was to face the English at Twickenham. The Springboks came a step closer to getting a grand slam, defeating England 8–3, with Muller adding five of South Africa's nine points, with a conversion and penalty goal. Having defeated all four home nations, the final task to achieving a grand slam was to defeat the French in Paris. The Springboks ran in six tries to defeat France 25–3, Muller scoring one of the tries, as well as adding a conversion, and thus, South Africa completing a grand slam tour of Europe. Muller captained the side against the Wallabies for a four test series in South Africa in 1953. Muller scored a try in the opening exchange at Elils Park, which saw the home side win 25–3. The Wallabies hit back in Cape Town, taking the second test 18–14. However South Africa won the next test, 18–8 in Durban. In Muller's final match for the Springboks, played in Port Elizabeth, South Africa won 22–9. Muller would go on to coach the Springboks in 1965. In 2001, he was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. Muller has a fitness drill named after him which is said to be the bane of every front rower to ever play the game.

The platform was initially long, being extended to in 1900. A second long platform once existed at Euroa, located against the goods shed wall and was in use between 1880 and 1904, to permit the handling of two crossing passenger trains. An iron footbridge linked the two platforms between 1900 and 1904. The first lever frame for signals was provided in 1885, and was made part of the station building in 1929. The tracks layout was altered in 1931, remaining in this state until the 1970s, and followed by the rationalised layout seen today. Two pedestrian subways, and the overpass at Anderson Street to the south, were provided as part of the standard gauge works in 1960. As part of the North East Rail Revitalisation Project, a second platform was constructed on the 1960s built standard gauge line, in conjunction with the standard gauge conversion of the existing broad gauge track.

Preliminary movements General Count Fyodor Keller had assumed command of the Russian Eastern Force from General Zasulich after the Battle of Yalu River. His force of 25,000 men held Motien Pass, in the middle of Liaodong Peninsula, on the main road between Antung (modern Dandong, China) and Liaoyang. Keller, a loyal friend of General Aleksey Kuropatkin and a student of General Mikhail Skobelev, observed that the Japanese strategy was similar to that of the First Sino-Japanese War (i.e. that the three Japanese armies would converge on Haicheng, as they had 10 years previously). Kuropatkin agreed, and in an effort to fortify his position at Haicheng, he began a series of complex and confusing troop movements as he endeavored to plug real or imaginary gaps in his defensive line. Keller, already weakened by the loss of men at the Battle of Te-li-Ssu, was further forced to give up two more regiments to Kuropatkin's defenses at Haicheng. The Japanese 1st Army, under command of General Kuroki Tamemoto, paused at Fenghuangshan (modern Fengcheng, Liaoning Province, China) from 2–8 July to await supplies and reinforcements. Kuroki decided to attack on 9 July, which was, by coincidence, the same day that General Keller received orders from General Kuropatkin depriving him of yet another regiment to support the defenses of Haicheng. Guarding the strategic Motien Pass, the Russians had three infantry regiments, three artillery batteries and a Cossack regiment. To the west was the reserve infantry regiment supported by a Cossack brigade. During the night of 8–9 July, a Japanese force moved along an unguarded path to the rear of the Russian right flank. This force was supported by Maxim machine guns and mountain artillery. Another group, clad in Japanese straw sandals to mask their movements, moved around the Russian left flank undetected. Battle The battle began at 05:15 on 10 July with a direct Japanese frontal attack. This attack faltered by 07:00 due to strong artillery fire from the Russian positions; however, by 08:00, the Russians found themselves all but encircled by the Japanese flanking attack. By 10:00, the Russians were in full retreat towards Hsimucheng (modern Ximu, Liaodong Province, China). Aftermath The Japanese moved in to occupy Motien Pass on 13 July. Casualties on both sides were relatively light, and later commentators have speculated extensively on why General Keller (otherwise known to be competent) abandoned such a strategic and easily defendable location with so little resistance. Keller, who perished due to shrapnel wounds from Japanese artillery in an ill-fated counterattack to retake Motien Pass, left no notes. References *Kowner, Rotem (2006).

It was built sometime between 1597 and 1610 as a private mansion for Jean Curtius, industrialist and munitions supplier to the Spanish army. With its alternating layers of red brick and natural stone, and its cross-mullioned windows, the building typifies the regional style known as the Mosan (or Meuse) Renaissance. After a 50 million euro redevelopment, the museum reopened as the Grand Curtius (Le Grand Curtius) in March 2009, now housing the merged collections of four former museums: the museum of archeology, the museum of weaponry, the museum of decorative arts, and the museum of religious art and Mosan art.

Purple Line Express trains also stop at the station during weekday rush hours. It is an elevated station with two island platforms, serving four tracks, located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois. Brown and Purple Line trains share the outer tracks while Red Line trains run on the inner tracks. As well as being an important transfer station, the station serves the Lincoln Park Campus of DePaul University. History Fullerton Station opened in 1900 as an express/local stop on the Northwestern Elevated Railroad.Fullerton. Chicago-\\"L\\".org (URL accessed October 7, 2006). In the 1920s, the station's platforms were lengthened to serve eight-car trains, but due to surrounding buildings the platforms were lengthened in different directions; the northbound platform was extended northward, and the southbound platform was extended to the south. In 1949, an additional set of exit stairs was added at Fullerton as well as a tall supervisor's booth on the platform. Off-peak shuttle service on the Ravenswood Line ran from Kimball to Fullerton until 1961, when the shuttles were cut back to their present-day terminus at Belmont. In 1989, Evanston Express trains began stopping at Fullerton due to increased ridership. The original station house was damaged by a fire in December 1996; the police suspected that the fire was the result of arson. The station house was reopened in February 1997 with only one ticket agent's booth. However, the single booth could not handle the high passenger load at the station, and a new station house was opened next to the original in 1998. Demon Dogs The sign for Demon Dogs is visible on the left, under the EL track. Photo from 2003 In 1983, the CTA decided to lease the space beneath Fullerton to a business. The CTA, led by chairman Michael Cardilli, granted the lease to Peter Schivarelli, a friend and former coworker of Cardilli's. Schivarelli built the hot dog stand Demon Dogs in the space. While Schivarelli paid for the construction of the stand, he owed a low rent on the property, and the CTA paid the utility bills for the building. The CTA ended this arrangement in 1998 upon its being made public, and Schivarelli sued the CTA as a result. A trial court ruled in favor of Schivarelli, but the CTA appealed the decision, and it was overturned by an appellate court. Demon Dogs remained open until 2005,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-04-03/news/0304030250_1_cta-dogs- lease when it was removed during the station's reconstruction.

Services As part of the Red, Brown and Purple Lines, Fullerton is used by passengers travelling between Lincoln Park and the Loop, Ravenswood and neighborhoods on the North Side. Fullerton is served every seven to eight minutes by Brown Line trains, every five to eight minutes by Red Line trains on weekdays and every seven to ten minutes on weekends, and every 10 to 20 minutes by Purple Line trains during weekday rush hours. While the Brown Line ends service to Fullerton at 1:30 a.m. on weekdays, Red Line trains run 24 hours a day, so the station is open at all times. In 2007, 3,496,676 passengers boarded at Fullerton, a 1% increase from 2006. These figures made Fullerton the second-busiest station on the Brown Line, the fourth-busiest station on the Red Line, and the second-busiest station on the Purple Line. The fare controls at Fullerton are located in a new station house on the south side of Fullerton Avenue; the original station house was closed for renovation and was moved across the street and converted to an auxiliary farecard-only entrance. From the station house, staircases lead to the station's two island platforms. The east platform is used by northbound trains, and the west platform is used by southbound trains. Additional exit stairs lead from the platforms to the north side of Fullerton Avenue. The project's Full Funding Grant Agreement with the federal government required that the CTA complete the project by the end of 2009. The new station was completed on December 31, 2009.

It consists of approximately 300 Marines and Sailors. It is part of Headquarters Regiment within the 1st Marine Logistics Group (1st MLG), I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). When assigned under the operational control of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (15th MEU), it becomes the Logistics Combat Element (LCE) providing expeditionary combat logistics support to all supported elements of the Marine Expeditionary Unit. CLB-15 has two sister MEU CLBs also based out of Camp Pendleton: CLB-11 and CLB-13.

The battalion's intended purpose was to serve, when so assigned and on a scheduled rotational basis, as the Combat Service Support Element (CSSE) for the 15th Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU). The battalion was redesignated as Marine Expeditionary Unit Service Support Group (MSSG-15) on 5 February 1988 to reflect the renaming of the 15th MAU to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). During October 1989, elements of MSSG-15, under the operational control of the 15th MEU, participated in the Loma Prieta earthquake relief efforts in the San Francisco Bay Area of California by performing their assigned relief missions and also taking on several volunteer projects to help the victims of the disaster. During their routine amphibious deployment beginning in June 1991, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in Operation Fiery Vigil by assisting in the evacuation of designated personnel from the Republic of the Philippines after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Later in the summer of 1991 elements of MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in support of the Southwest Asia Cease Fire campaign following Operation Desert Storm after relieving the 11th MEU. Post Desert Storm Years (1992-2000) From December 1992 to January 1993, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in Operation Restore Hope to assist in the civil war torn and famine stricken country of Somalia. While in Somalia, MSSG-15 supported the securing of the capital city of Mogadishu and the American Embassy on the first day then quickly moved out to outlying areas of Berbera, Baido and Kismayo to assist with food distribution convoys and help restore order. From July through August 1994, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in Operation Support Hope in Rwanda and then later assisted in the relocation of the United States Liaison Office from Mogadishu, Somalia to Nairobi, Kenya. From September through October 1994, MSSG-15 participated in support of Operation Vigilant Warrior as part of the Southwest Asia Cease Fire Campaign following Operation Desert Storm. In February 1996 and again in July 1997, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in Operation Southern Watch once again in Southwest Asia. In February 2000, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in support of the Australian-led Operation Stabilize in East Timor. Post 9/11 Years (2001-2009) In September 2001, MSSG-15 again participated in support of Operation Stabilize in East Timor. From October 2001 through January 2002, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, participated in Operation Enduring Freedom by supporting an amphibious assault over 400 miles into the land-locked country of Afghanistan. Landing at a remote airbase 90 miles southwest of Kandahar, MSSG-15 supported the establishment of Camp Rhino, America's first Forward Operating Base in country while maintaining the first significant conventional ground presence in Afghanistan. MSSG-15 later moved north to Kandahar International Airport securing a new forward operating base. With the move, MSSG-15 was able to continue to support new missions and support the building of a prison camp that housed numerous Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters. In November 2001, concurrent with actions occurring in Afghanistan, elements of MSSG-15 participated in support of humanitarian efforts in Djibouti. In February 2003, MSSG-15, under the 15th MEU, deployed to Kuwait in support of what was then known as Operation Enduring Freedom. From March 2003 through July 2003, MSSG-15 participated in what began Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and the invasion of coalition forces into Iraq to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein. During February and March 2003, tactical control of the 15th MEU was assigned to the United Kingdom's 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines for OIF. On 21 March 2003, elements of MSSG-15 crossed the border into Southern Iraq and supporting the securing of the port of Umm Qasr and enabled follow-on humanitarian assistance to begin. By late March 2003, elements of MSSG-15 (with the 15th MEU now back under I Marine Expeditionary Force) moved to An Nasiriyah, Iraq to relieve the Marines of Task Force Tarawa. Elements of MSSG-15 provided humanitarian assistance to the local population that included purifying drinking water, immediate medical care, helping establish the local government, police, and other local services. From December 2004 through January 2005, MSSG-15 participated in support of Operation Unified Assistance in Southern Asia supporting the 2004 Indonesian tsunami relief efforts by providing disaster relief to survivors of a massive tsunami in Sumatra, Indonesia, and southern Sri Lanka. Following this period, the battalion was redesignated as Combat Logistics Battalion 15 (CLB-15) on 15 March 2006 and assigned to Combat Logistics Regiment 17, 1st Marine Logistics Group (1st MLG). The redesignation from MSSG-15 to CLB-15 was as a result of the larger logistics reorganization from the 1st FSSG to the 1st MLG. The battalion's intended purpose remained to serve, when so assigned and on a scheduled rotational basis, as the Logistics Combat Element (LCE) for the 15th MEU. CLB-15 assembled for a battalion photo at Del Mar Beach on Camp Pendleton, CA following their return from Iraq (April 2008).From November 2006 through May 2007, CLB-15 once again participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom. CLB-15, under the 15th MEU, was committed into Iraq to support area commanders in the Al Anbar Province. Spread throughout the region from Korean Village in Ar Rutba, to Ramadi, and the Haditha triad, CLB-15 supported security actions to the area which enabled the establishment of Iraqi law enforcement, economic progress, and the creation of local Iraqi government. Due in part to their successes, the needs of the area commanders, and being part of the Multi- National Force-Iraq \\"surge\\" to defeat insurgent forces across the country, the CLB-15, under the 15th MEU was extended twice, turning what was supposed to be a six-month deployment into almost nine months. Post Afghanistan and Iraq Years (2010-2013) From August through October 2010 and during a routine Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment, torrential rains ravaged Pakistan and caused major flooding throughout the country. As a result, CLB-15 participated in humanitarian relief supporting Pakistan flood relief efforts. In the final weeks of September 2010, CLB-15 assisted in the rescue and life support of 62 Ethiopian and Somali immigrants at sea from their disabled skiff. The rescued persons stayed aboard the USS Pearl Harbor (LSD-52) into early November 2010 where they were given medical care, food, water, and clothes by CLB-15 before being patriated to Kenya. CLB-15 completed her WESTPAC deployment in December 2010 and from February to September 2012 conducted its rigorous pre-deployment training program (PTP) under the operational control of the 15th MEU. CLB-15 25th Anniversary and Colors Rededication Ceremony on the flight deck of the USS RUSHMORE during WESTPAC 12-02 (Oct 2012).In September 2012, CLB-15 was deployed for WESTPAC 12-02 with all elements of the 15th MEU: CLB-15 (a.k.a. \\"Blackout\\"), 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (a.k.a. \\"Darkhorse\\"), and Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 364(rein) (a.k.a. \\"Purple Foxes\\"); as well as all elements of PHIBRON Three: USS Rushmore (LSD-47), USS Peleliu (LHA-5), and USS Green Bay (LPD-20). On 15 October 2012 CLB-15 celebrated her 25th Anniversary during a small but formal battalion colors re-dedication ceremony on the flight deck of the USS Rushmore (LSD-47) just prior to pulling into the liberty port of Darwin, Australia. During this deployment, CLB-15 participated in several major named exercises: Exercise Eager Mace at Camp Buehring near the Udairi Range Complex in Kuwait, Exercise Iron Magic in the United Arab Emirates, and Exercise Red Reef in Saudi Arabia as well as sustainment training ashore in Djibouti. Of additional note during this deployment, and to coincide with the beginning of Fiscal Year 2013, CLB-15 was redesignated as a monitored command code (MCC 1US). As such, the battalion is now manned and equipped from Headquarters, Marine Corps vice ad hoc personnel and equipment sourcing from internal to the 1st MLG.

The station is served by NSW TrainLink South Coast Line trains travelling south to Kiama and north to Wollongong and Sydney. Premier Illawarra operates a connecting bus service from the station to Shellharbour. History Historical photo of Shellharbour station The Shellharbour district was initially reliant on coastal shipping for its connection to Wollongong and Sydney, but this changed with the construction of the South Coast railway line to Wollongong in 1887, and its connection to Sydney the following year. Dunmore Station opened along with the Wollongong–North Kiama extension in 1887, with a single platform, weatherboard platform building and Victorian–Georgian brick stationmaster's residence. The station was used by passengers from nearby Shellharbour; the main freight users were local pastoralists and the neighbouring basalt quarry. The growth in quarry traffic necessitated the construction of a goods siding in 1923 and a signal box two years later. The station was refurbished around the same time. In 1940, a second side platform (\\"platform 1\\") was added. The flow of rail freight from the district waned in the late 20th century, however, and the goods siding was removed in 1970. The old station buildings, still extant today, are located near where Dunmore Road (formerly Shellharbour Road) intersects with the railway line, at the southern end of Dunmore. The book All aboard!: Tales of Australian railways, by Jim Haynes and Russell Hannah, recounts a story about former State Rail Authority Chief Executive David Hill, who is said to have visited Dunmore Station incognito in the mid-1980s, when the station appeared on maps as \\"Shellharbour\\": Dunmore (Shellharbour) station in the 2010s > When he reached Shellharbour Station he found himself surrounded by cow > paddocks with the straggle of houses on the other side of the road. Now > David Hill was no dill and he realised that this couldn’t possibly be the > resort town of Shellharbour even though the station signs were telling him > so – after all he couldn’t even see the sea. It was still the days when the > railways employed people and there, waiting to collect his ticket, was a > 16-year-old junior station assistant. \\"Well” says David to the kid; “This > clearly isn’t Shellharbour Township”. “No mate” says the kid (he didn’t know > who David Hill was, you see, or he would have called him sir). “This is > Dunmore.” “Well where’s Shellharbour?” asks David. The kid points up > Shellharbour Road and says “it's up the road there a bit, just over the hill > – it’s about four or five kilometres away.” “That’s a bit strange,” muses > David. “Wouldn’t you have thought that they would have built the station a > bit closer to the town than this?’’ Well, the kid looks at David Hill like > he’s a bit simple and says; “No mate, it’s much better down here near the > railway line.” According to the story, it was this visit that led to the nameboards and maps being amended to read \\"Dunmore (Shellharbour)\\".  New site  Given the rapid growth of new suburbs along the railway line, including Shell Cove and Flinders, in 2003 RailCorp began planning work to relocate Dunmore's railway station to the north. The project was announced as \\"Flinders Station\\" by the then member for Kiama, Matt Brown, in 2011. His successor, Gareth Ward, re- announced the project the following year, and construction began, with an announced budget of $39 million. In 2013, Ward announced that the name would be changed to Shell Cove, but it later emerged that the station could not be named Shell Cove (or Flinders) because it was physically located in Dunmore. Transport for NSW successfully applied to the Geographical Names Board to have the station named Shellharbour Junction instead. The project also saw the Dunmore passing loop extended north to the new station site, increasing its length to 1.8 kilometres. The new station opened to passengers on 22 November 2014. Services to the former Dunmore Station ceased the previous day, and the old station was fenced off pending a decision on its future use. Shellharbour Junction recorded 10,616 passenger journeys in the first three months of 2015, almost as many as the number of journeys recorded by Dunmore Station in its last full year of operation.

It serves the town of Wangaratta. It was opened in 1873. History The station opened on 28 October 1873, as the temporary terminus of the line from Benalla, before it was extended to Wodonga on 21 November 1873. A goods shed is located across from the main platform, but has no siding, with the goods shed office itself demolished in 1978. Dock platforms were also once located at both ends of the station. Wangaratta was once the junction for the Whitfield narrow gauge railway. Footbridges are located at both the south end of the platform and over the northern end of the yard. The main platform and station building is located to the east of the standard gauge \\"West\\" line. The original standard gauge line runs in a concrete walled cutting, located between the station and adjoining street, with a number of bridges crossing this cutting to provide station access. The platform on the standard gauge \\"East\\" line is located in the cutting at the Melbourne end of the station. Alumatta Loop is currently located to the south of the station on the standard gauge line. Initial facilities included a goods shed and a temporary station building, with a brick station building, identical to that at Benalla, erected in 1874, with a two storied brick tower added to the Melbourne end in 1897. The large signal box was provided in 1887, and then extended in 1908, when the goods yard was enlarged, and the current goods shed provided. A small locomotive depot was provided in 1882, with a dual gauge long turntable provided in 1898. The narrow gauge Whitfield line opened in 1899, branching off from the main line at the southern end of the station. The line closed in 1953. When the standard gauge line was constructed through the station in 1962, extensive works were required to thread it through the narrow railway reserve. The locomotive depot and turntable were relocated from the east side of the line to the west side of the line, and new grade separations were provided at Rowan Street, to the north, and Roy Street, to the south. During 1984, the passenger facilities in the main station building were refurbished. The upgraded facilities re-opened on 9 November of the same year. During June/July 1997, the signal box at Wangaratta was abolished. Signalling and interlocked points were also abolished during this time. During the 2011 conversion of the broad gauge line to standard gauge, all sidings were disconnected. The station now has no loop or non-platform tracks, and essentially is now only a \\"through\\" station. Former stations Winton and Glenrowan were located between Wangaratta and Benalla, while former station Bowser was located between Wangaratta and Springhurst. Platforms & services View of the eastern platform, built to serve Sydney to Melbourne passenger train services on the original standard gauge line. Which is currently not in use due to Inland rail to commence in late 2021 Wangaratta has two platforms.

The station was owned by Equity Media Holdings of Little Rock, Arkansas. KBTZ simulcast on translator station KBTZ-LP UHF channel 32 in Bozeman, Montana. According to Equity's website, KBTZ had a secondary affiliation with Fox's sister network, MyNetworkTV. At auction on April 16, 2009, Max Media purchased the intellectual property and programming rights to KBTZ's programming, including its Fox and MyNetworkTV affiliations to launch digital subchannels on their existing stations; they did not buy the transmitter facilities for either station.http://www.tvnewsday.com/articles/2009/04/17/daily.11/ Demise Because it was granted an original construction permit after the FCC finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997,http://www.transmitter.com/FCC97115/chanplan.html the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, at the end of the digital TV conversion period for full-service stations, KBTZ would be required to turn off its analog signal and turn on its digital signal (called a \\"flash-cut\\"). Equity Media refused to launch many of their station launched in the 2000s with either a digital companion channel or as digital- only operations, and as their financial state deteriorated during the Great Recession, it put their stations at risk of being forced to sign off at the time of the digital switchover. As with many Equity stations, all of its operations, outside of an engineer who repaired the tower and satellite link when requested, were run out of Equity's hub in Little Rock, Arkansas with no local presence of a staff; most cable providers thus took its signal directly from satellite to avoid the over-the-air reception issues embellic of Equity- operated stations.

It is an anatomical variant that, when present, supplies blood to the thyroid gland primarily, or the trachea, the parathyroid gland and the thymus gland (as thymica accessoria) in rare cases. It has also been reported to be a compensatory artery when one or both of the inferior thyroid arteries are absent and in a few cases the only source of blood to the thyroid gland. It varies in origin, size, blood supply, and termination, and occurs in only 3–10% of the population. Because of the variations and rarity, it may lead to surgical complications. Structure 250px The thyroid ima artery is an embryonic artery and it occurs because of the failure of the vessel to close, remaining patent (open). The artery has a variable origin. It mostly arises from the brachiocephalic trunk, but may also originate from the aortic arch, the right common carotid, the subclavian, the pericardiacophrenic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the transverse scapular or the internal thoracic artery. It ascends in front of the trachea in the superior mediastinum to the lower part of the thyroid gland. It differs in size and ranges from as small as accessory thyroid arteries to the size of primary thyroid vessels. The diameter of the lumen of the artery ranges from . The artery may be present as an accessory thyroid artery but sometimes appears to compensate for incompetence or absence of one or more main thyroid vessels. Since it begins from below the thyroid gland and ascends upwards, it is mostly associated with absence or reduced size of the inferior thyroid arteries. In such cases, it is known as the accessory inferior thyroid artery. In rare cases, the artery has been seen to be compensating for absence of one or both superior thyroid arteries. In cases where the length of the thyroid ima artery is shorter, the artery ends by supplying the thymus gland and is known as thymica accessoria. Function When present, the thyroid ima's chief supply is the thyroid gland, though it also supplies the trachea. The artery may extend and supply the parathyroid glands. An infrequently observed artery, it is more frequently reported in the context of enlarged parathyroid glands (parathyroid adenomas). The artery ends by supplying the thyroid gland, or the parathyroid glands, as a single unit or as multiple branches. The artery is also found to be the only supply of the parathyroid gland in rare cases. Clinical significance The artery is only present in approximately 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; due to its relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin from one of the bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity. History The thyroid ima artery was first defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer in the year 1772. Hence, it was named the thyroid artery of Neubauer. The artery originates lower than the inferior thyroid arteries, so it is also known as the lowest thyroid artery. Arteria thyroidea ima is the Latin name of the artery. Other animals The presence of thyroid ima artery is also observed in other higher primates. The artery has been reported in gorillas, gibbons, macaques and gray langurs. Variations in the origin were also seen; it was found to originate from the aorta in the thorax, or the carotid in the neck.

He was selected in the 4th round by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1987 MLB draft. Career=Philadelphia Phillies Trlicek signed with the Phillies on June 18, 1987, and was sent to the Utica Blue Sox of the New York–Penn League. Trlicek posted a 2-5 record with a 4.10 ERA in 10 games, 8 of them starts. The Phillies returned Trlicek to the New York–Penn League in the 1988 season, this time to the Batavia Clippers, where in 8 starts, Trlicek had a 2-3 record with a 7.36 ERA. After a poor spring training in 1989, the Phillies released Trlicek on March 23, 1989. Atlanta Braves Trlicek signed as a free agent on April 2, 1989 with the Atlanta Braves, spending most of the season with the Sumter Braves of the South Atlantic League, where in 16 starts, he had a 6-5 record and a 2.48 ERA. Trlicek also made a start with the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League, allowing just a run in 8 innings to earn the win. This would be his only season in the Braves organization, as on December 17, 1989, Atlanta sent Trlicek to the Toronto Blue Jays for Ernie Whitt and Kevin Batiste. Toronto Blue Jays The 1990 season for Trlicek would be spent with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League. Trlicek had a 5-8 record with a 3.73 ERA in 26 starts with Dunedin. In 1991, the Blue Jays moved Trlicek to the bullpen, and he was promoted to the Knoxville Blue Jays of the Southern League. Trlicek appeared in 41 games, going 2-5 with a 2.45 ERA. Trlicek had a very solid spring training in 1992, and started the season with the Toronto Blue Jays, working as a middle reliever. He made his major league debut on April 8, 1992 at Tiger Stadium. Trlicek pitched 2/3 of an inning, allowing 2 runs in the Blue Jays 10-9 victory over the Detroit Tigers.

Trlicek spent spring training in 1994 with the Dodgers, however he was placed on waivers and on April 1, 1994, the Boston Red Sox selected him. Boston Red Sox Trlicek opened the season with the Boston Red Sox, and earned his first win with the team in his first game, as he threw 1.2 scoreless innings in the Red Sox 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers at Fenway Park. Trlicek struggled after that game though, as he was sent to the Pawtucket Red Sox with a 17.18 ERA in 6 games. Trlicek returned to Boston in June, however, he was demoted to the minors once again in early July. Boston then had Trlicek start with the New Britain Red Sox. In New Britain, Trlicek had a 0-1 record with a 0.73 ERA in 6 starts, before being recalled to Boston. Trlicek made his first ever major league start on August 8, 1994, pitching 5.2 innings, allowing 2 earned runs in a 5-2 loss to the Minnesota Twins at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. As the 1994 Baseball Strike began, the Red Sox moved Trlicek to Pawtucket for the remainder of the year.

History A special formulation of dynamite was patented in 1874 by J.W. Willard, superintendent of the California Powder Works in Santa Cruz, California. He called his invention \\"Hercules powder\\",Industries of Cleveland: Trade, Commerce and Manufactures for the Year 1878, p.147 a competitive jab at rival Giant Powder Company which had acquired the exclusive U.S. rights to Alfred Nobel's original dynamite formula. The mythological Hercules was known as a giant slayer. The California Powder Works became the only manufacturer of Hercules powder. In 1877, J.W. Willard moved to Cleveland, Ohio to oversee the opening of a new California Powder Works plant there, dedicated to the manufacture of Hercules powder. Historical Collections of Ohio: An Encyclopedia of the State Henry Howe (1891), p.xix In 1881, the California Powder Works moved its Hercules powder manufacturing in California to a new site along the northeast shore of San Francisco Bay. The company town that grew up around the facility became known as \\"Hercules\\", later (1900) incorporated as Hercules, California. In 1882, thanks to their interlocking ownership interests with the California Powder Works by that time, the DuPont corporation and Laflin & Rand Powder Company acquired the rights to manufacture Hercules powder and incorporated the Hercules Powder Company for that purpose. In 1904, Du Pont dissolved the company as part of its ongoing effort to consolidate the many explosives manufacturers that it controlled under the Du Pont name. In 1911, the United States won a lawsuit that it had brought against the Du Pont corporation under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The U.S. Circuit Court in Delaware found that Du Pont had been operating an unlawful monopoly, and ordered a breakup of its explosives and gunpowder manufacturing business. The breakup resulted in the creation of two new companies in 1912, Atlas Powder Company and Hercules Powder Company. Atlas received the explosives manufacturing portion of Du Pont's business (including the facilities acquired from the Giant Powder Company), while Hercules received the gunpowder portion. The first management team of this new Hercules Powder Company included President H. Dunham, T.W. Bacchus, G.G. Rheuby, J.T Skelly, Norman Rood, Fred Stark, C.D. Prickett, and George Markell.

(see below) On 12 September 1940, the Kenvil, New Jersey plant suffered a major explosion. News reports at the time estimated at least fifteen buildings were destroyed along with twenty-five tons of explosives. Fifty-one people were killed outright with perhaps two hundred injured and many missing. Richard F. Heck, recipient of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, gained experience with transition metal chemistry while working at Hercules in 1957. By the 1960s, the community was experiencing the first signs of a suburban transition. The Hercules Powder Co., once a small dynamite manufacturing firm, had begun producing rocket motors at its Bacchus Works south of the Magna community. The growing availability of jobs was one factor encouraging subdivision development in the Magna, Kearns and West Valley areas. In 1966, the Hercules Powder Company changed its name to Hercules, Inc.\\"'A look back — and ahead — at the Hercules plant\\", Haskel Burns, Hattiesburg American, July 4, 2015 Display showing Hercules products in the 1950s In 1995, Hercules, Inc. sold its subsidiary Hercules Aerospace Co. to Alliant Techsystems Inc..Alliant Techysystems Complete Deal for Hercules New York Times, March 16, 1995 The sale included all of what remained of Hercules' gunpowder lines. By the end of the 1990s, Hercules Inc., had sold off a significant number of its divisions that had not been profitable for the company. This has caused the price of shares of common stock in Hercules to rise above . Several successful cost-savings programs were implemented in addition to corporate buying its own shares. Also at that time, Hercules had a significant amount of assets available for possible purchases of other corporations. Hercules, Inc., had a Paper Technology Division (PTD) whose products were slowly becoming commodities. In order to survive, this division needed to obtain new products. First, Hercules Inc., tried to purchase the Allied Colloids Company, but this was not successful. Next, Hercules bought the Betz-Dearborn Corporation. Betz-Dearborn produced mostly chemicals for paper processing, and the Hercules PTD produced mainly functional chemicals for paper. According to some business analysts, Hercules Inc. paid about three times as much for Betz-Dearborn as compared with its actual value. Soon after the purchase of Betz-Dearborn, the price per share of stock in Hercules Inc., had dropped from above $70 to below $10 (ten dollars). It has been speculated that Hercules Inc., was close to going bankrupt after this failed purchase operation. Afterwards, several senior managers were forced out of the company because of this failure; however, a significant amount of former PTD senior managers were able to keep their positions within Hercules. The price of stock shares in Hercules Inc. never recovered from this debacle. Finally, Hercules Inc. was sold off to the Ashland Corporation in 2008New York Times, July 11, 2008Delaware Today, December, 2008, and dissolved.

Production began in 1890, and was discontinued in 1931.Sharpe, Philip B. Complete Guide to Handloading (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp.146-151&160-178 * WA .30 caliber powder was named W for United States Army Lieutenant Whistler and A for American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall. This tubular powder was used for military loading of the .30 U.S. Army from 1894 until the military specification was changed to single-base nitrocellulose powder in 1908. Grains of 2 mm (0.08 inch) diameter were 1 mm long. Hercules continued producing the powder for other users until 1930. * Sharpshooter was a flake powder introduced by Laflin & Rand in 1897 to replace black powder for loading the .45-70. Black flakes containing 15 to 18 percent nitroglycerinLandis, Charles S. Twenty-Two Caliber Varmint Rifles (1947) Telegraph Press pp.440-444 were approximately 2 mm in diameter. Production was discontinued after World War II. * Bullseye was introduced by Laflin & Rand in 1898. Large surface area per unit weight enables rapid combustion in short-barreled handguns. Laflin & Rand began production using small, irregular particles removed by screening runs of larger grained powders. Improved manufacturing processes offered other reclamation options for reduced quantities of rejected material. Hercules manufactured Bullseye as thin, round flakes. It is believed to be the oldest smokeless powder formulation still being manufactured in the United States.Wooters, John Propellant Profiles (1982) Wolfe Publishing pp.51-71 It is designed for handguns and can also be used in 12-gauge shotgun target loadsHercules Reloaders' Guide for Hercules Smokeless Powders (1980) Hercules, Inc p.4 * Lightning was introduced by Laflin & Rand in 1899 for lever action sporting rifles like the .30-30 Winchester and .303 Savage. Production of 2 mm diameter flakes was discontinued after World War II. Tubular Lightning # 2 was manufactured from 1903 to 1929. * Infallible was a flake shotgun powder introduced by Laflin & Rand in 1900. Initial production had an orange color, but graphite coating gave later production a black color. Production was discontinued after World War II. * Unique is a gray flake powder introduced by Laflin & Rand in 1900. Individual flakes are approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) in diameter. It is designed for shotguns and can be used in handguns. * Bear was a tubular powder introduced by Laflin & Rand in 1908 for small capacity rifle cartridges like the .351 and .401 Winchester Self-Loading and the .32-20 and .25-20 Winchester. Production was discontinued after World War II. * Military Rifle (MR) # 19 was a tubular powder containing 20 percent nitroglycerin introduced by DuPont in 1908 and was renamed HiVel (# 1) when manufactured by Hercules. It was modified as HiVel # 2 in 1915. Production was discontinued in 1964. A smaller grained version was produced as HiVel # 3 from 1926 to 1941. =Powders developed by Hercules Powder Company= * Hercules # 308 was Hercules production of single-base tubular Pyro DG (Diphenylamine Graphited) powder for loading military .30-06 Springfield ammunition through World War I. Production began in 1915 and continued through the 1920s. * Hercules # 300 was a black, tubular single-base rifle powder produced from 1916 to 1932. * Pyro was produced from 1922 to 1928 as lightly graphited yellow flakes for loading the .45 ACP. * Hercules # 2400 is a coated flake powder containing 20 percent nitroglycerin introduced in 1932. Individual dark gray flakes are approximately 1 mm (0.04 inch) in diameter and 0.3 mm thick. It is designed for small capacity center-fire rifle cartridges and can be used in magnum handgun and .410 bore shotgun loads. * Red Dot is a flake powder introduced in 1932. Individual flakes are approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) in diameter and some are dyed red to aid identification. It is designed for light and standard loads for 12, 16, and 20 gauge shotguns and can be used in handguns. * HiVel # 6 was produced from 1933 to 1941 for loading the .30-06 Springfield. * Herco is a flake powder introduced in the 1930s. Individual flakes are approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) in diameter. It is designed for heavy loads for 10, 12, 16, 20 and 28 gauge shotguns and can be used for heavy handgun loads. * Green Dot is a flake powder introduced in 1965. Individual flakes are approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) in diameter and some are dyed green to aid identification. It is designed for medium and standard loads for 12, 16, and 20 gauge shotguns and can be used in handguns. * Reloder 7 was the most popular of three cylindrical rifle powders introduced in 1965 to replace HiVel # 2. Each powder was blended from four different formulations dyed different colors. Production of the other two longer-grained powders, Reloder 11 and Reloder 21, was discontinued in 1972. * Blue Dot is a flake powder introduced in 1972. Individual flakes are approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) in diameter and some are dyed blue to aid identification. It is designed for magnum loads for 10, 12, 16, 20 and 28 gauge shotguns and can be used for magnum handgun loads. Pine Resin Products In the 1920s, Hercules entered the pine resin products business, a development which followed upon the faster clearing of forests for lumber and farmland around the time of the First World War. The clearings had left many stumps which had to be removed, often with dynamite supplied by Hercules and others. Hercules itself was a consumer of wood pulp, a key ingredient in their dynamite. The increasing surplus of wood pulp led the company to the idea of producing other things from it, namely, the various chemicals that were present in pine resin. They set up production sites such as the one in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Brunswick, Georgia for this express purpose, and added to their raw supply by offering to take or buy tree stumps from farmers. Solid-fuel rocket motor production Beginning in 1959, Hercules, Inc., began to diversify into the production of large solid-fuel rocket motors, and it soon became a primary producer of these, especially for the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army - and to a lesser degree for the civilian National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In 1961, the company hired contractors C.H. Leavell & Company, Morrison-Knudsen, and Alaskan Plumbing and Heating Company to expand the existing Bacchus Works site. The contractors added \\"Air Force Plant 81\\" adding 97 buildings, including a 97,000 square foot administration building.Staff. “From New Utah Plant . . . Rocket Motors for the Minuteman.” The Em Kayan, April 1962. One of its major solid-fuel rocket products was the third-stage engine for the three -stage solid-fueled Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the U.S. Air Force, of which 1,000 were made and deployed at Air Force Bases in several northern states during the 1960s. In addition, all of the missiles of the Minuteman I series were removed from service and replaced with the Minuteman II and Minuteman III series of more-advanced ICBMs. Hence, the Minuteman ICBM program was a huge project and a major source of revenue for Hercules, Inc. Hercules, Inc., also produced the solid-fueled rocket motors for the two-stage Polaris missile system of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) for the U.S. Navy in its 41 for Freedom series of 41 George Washington class ballistic missile submarines. These nuclear submarines carried 16 Polaris missiles apiece for a grand total of 656 missiles. In addition, the Polaris series consisted of the successively-improved Polaris A-1, Polaris A-2, and Polaris A-3 missiles. The early Polaris submarines that had been armed with the Polaris A-1 were upgraded to the Polaris A-2; and then all that had been armed with the Polaris A-2 were upgraded to the Polaris A-3. For some of the early Polaris submarines, the Polaris A-3 was the end of their upgrades, but a large number of them (about 31) were further rearmed with the more-advanced and longer- ranged two-stage Poseidon C-3 missile. Hence, the Polaris missile submarine program was also a huge project and a major source of revenue for Hercules, Inc. During the 1960s, Hercules, Inc., also made solid-fuel rocket motors for hundreds of the U.S. Army's Honest John missile, a mobile tactical missile for carrying tactical nuclear weapons for U.S. Army divisions. The Honest John missile was mostly deployed with the U.S. Seventh Army in West Germany as part of the American commitment to NATO to defend Western Europe against aggression from the Warsaw Pact, using nuclear weapons on Eastern Europe, if necessary. None of the Honest John, Minuteman, Polaris, or Poseidon has ever been used in combat, and the threat of nuclear war has been sufficient to deter aggression and make it unnecessary to use nuclear weapons for defense. During the 1970s and 80s, the Honest John missile was removed from deployment, scrapped, and replaced by the more-advanced Lance missile by the U.S. Army in Europe. Of all of the missiles mentioned above, only a reduced number of the Minuteman missiles remain in service at Air Force Bases in the United States, with all of the others having been removed from deployment and scrapped, along with all of the Polaris and Poseidon submarines. For space exploration and satellite launches by the U.S. Air Force and NASA, Hercules, Inc., developed and manufactured the two large, strap-on solid-fueled booster rockets for the otherwise liquid-fueled, and huge, Titan III and Titan IV rockets. These strap-on rockets were used on the Titan IIIC, Titan IIID, and Titan IIIE rockets, and on all of the Titan IV rockets that were ever produced. After the end of production and firing of NASA's huge Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets, the Titan IV was the largest and heaviest unmanned rocket available anywhere in the world, and especially in the Titan IV-Centaur version. The Titan IV- Centaur was used for special launches of heavy space probes into the Solar System, such as the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn which was launched in 1997. The Titan IV is no longer manufactured, and the last one of these was fired during a launch in October 2005. In 1995 the aerospace division of Hercules, including its solid motor line, was acquired by the American defense contractor ATK. Business Segments In its later years, Hercules, Inc., manufactured and marketed worldwide specialist chemicals that were used in a wide variety of industrial, home, and office markets, and it and had over 4,500 employees. Hercules was composed of two major divisions: the Paper Technologies and Ventures (PTV) division and the Aqualon division. In 2005, the former accounted for 49% of its sales and 35% of its operating profits, with the latter producing 37% and 68% respectively. Aqualon Group Aqualon produces products for physical property modification of aqueous systems which are sold into a wide variety of industries including personal care, food additives, and construction. Paper Technologies and Ventures GroupPaper Technologies= Paper Technologies produces specialty chemicals to the pulp and paper industry. These products include functional, process, and water treatment chemicals for a wide variety of pulp and paper applications. Functional chemicals can be divided in three main groups. Wet strength resins, Rosin sizes and AKD -sizes. Significant persons developing functional chemicals in Hercules could be mentioned: Dr. Keim on his efforts developing PAE wet strength resin, Mr Kai Kiviö on his efforts on developing cationic rosin size. Basis of AKD -technology Hercules acquired more or less voluntary from German BASF after the Second World War. =Ventures= Ventures produces specialty chemicals for a variety of markets, including adhesives and sealants, paints, inks, coatings, lubricants, rubber, plastics, and building and construction. Hercules Incorporated, in collaboration with Professor Kaichang Li of Oregon State University and Columbia Forest Products, received a 2007 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award for the Greener Synthetic Pathways category in developing and commercializing a formaldehyde- free adhesive made from soy flour and Hercules' unique polymer chemistries.

Within a year, 21 more MADS formed consisting of 24 Marine Fighter Squadrons (VMF), and eight Ground Control Intercept Squadrons (MGCIS). One of these squadrons, VMF-451, was established at NAS Willow Grove in April 1946. On February 1, 1947, MGCIS-17 organized at NAS Willow Grove under the MAD. In August 1950, Reserve Marines from MGCIS-17 mobilized for the Korean War and remained on active duty until reorganization of the squadron in October 1951. VMF-451 was activated as a unit on January 3, 1951 for Korean service. On June 24, 1950, MGCIS-26 formed in New York City. On August 3, 1950 the unit mobilized until June 30, 1952, when members returned from active duty. In 1952, upon reorganization of the Marine Corps Reserve, 17 of the 21 MADS remained, all staffed by active duty Marines. On March 1, 1954 MGCIS-26, Brooklyn, New York was re-designated a Marine Air Control Squadron (MACS) to reflect the Marine Corps-wide re-designation of many such units. On April 15, 1958, Helicopter Transport Squadron-772 was established. In October 1951, MACS-17 began reorganization at NAS Willow Grove after reservists were released from active duty. In 1959, Marine Air Reserve Group 25 (MARG-25) was the senior Marine Reserve command at NAS Willow Grove, with VMF-511 attached. The 4th MAW experienced great change in 1962 when Marine Aircraft Group 43 was reactivated on July 1 along with Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron-43 (H&MS-43;). Helicopter Transport Squadron-772 was re- designated Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron-772 (HMM-772) on April 1, 1962. On February 1, 1963, MACS-26 was re-designated Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 73 (MATCU-73), and on March 1, Marine Air Base Squadron-43 (MABS-43) was reactivated at NAS Willow Grove. 1960 through present A major 4th MAW reorganization on February 1, 1965 saw H&MS-43;, MABS-43, VMF-511, and MACS-17 all reassigned to MAG-43. MATCU-73 was assigned to the 4th MAW and remained in New York until November 1, 1965 when it was reassigned to MAG-43 and transferred to NAS Willow Grove on May 1, 1967. In 1971, HMM-772 transitioned to the CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter, was re-designated HMH-772 and transferred to MAG-49 at NAS Willow Grove. In September 1972, MAG-43 was re- designated MAG-49, and MAG-49 Headquarters moved from NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey to NAS Willow Grove. In August 1991, MACS-48 Det B mobilized to conduct Air Traffic Control Operations at MCAS Yuma, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Camp Pendleton, at the onset of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Members of MWSS-473, Det A were mobilized to MCAS New River, to support station operations while active duty personnel were deployed to Southwest Asia. Individual members of MAG-49, reserve and active duty, mobilized to serve with various units in the Saudi Arabian desert. HMH-772 mobilized shortly after the start of Operation Desert Storm in support of the Marine Corps' Unit Deployment Program (UDP). Initially sent to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing to augment with its sister squadron from NAS Dallas, HMH-772 was reassigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at MCAS El Toro, CA to prepare for overseas deployment to the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing at MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, Japan. While deployed, HMH-772 participated in training deployments and helped evacuation efforts in the Republic of the Philippines (RP) following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. On October 18, 1997, Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron-773, Detachment A (HMLA-773, Det A) activated at MAG-49, NAS Willow Grove with 21 Marines and 9 aircraft. In 1998, HMH-772 transitioned from the Sikorsky CH53D Sea Stallion to the CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter. In 2000, the Detachment changed from HMLA-773, Detachment A to HMLA-775, Detachment A, in accordance with a 4th MAW unit realignment strategy.

Bull Mountain is located mostly on a hill for which the community is named. It is bordered on the east by Tigard, on the south by King City, and Beaverton lies to the north. The north-eastern part of the Bull Mountain hill is now within the Tigard city limits, as the city has steadily annexed portions of the unincorporated region on its boundary. In 2010, the community became a census-designated place with a population of 9,133. Fire protection and EMS services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue. Annexation and incorporation controversy Bull Mountain Road The Bull Mountain area has been considered candidate for annexation by the City of Tigard, which includes Bull Mountain in its ultimate planned boundary. The debate over Bull Mountain's future has been rather acrimonious. In 2004, Tigard proposed to annex the entire area under Oregon Revised Statutes Or. Rev. Stat. § 195.205 (2005) Oregon Revised Statutes, Chapter 195 — Local Government Planning Coordination (Urban Service Provider Annexation method) instead of Or. Rev. Stat. § 222.125 (2005) method.Oregon Revised Statutes, Chapter 222 — City Boundary Changes; Mergers; Consolidations; Withdrawal At the time, Or. Rev. Stat. § 195.205 was ambiguous regarding the method of counting votes, and Tigard had planned to use a single combined voting method where the unincorporated votes would be counted with the votes of the city voters, and thus the unincorporated voters would be heavily outnumbered. This variation of gerrymandering outraged many of the residents of the unincorporated area, and triggered a campaign against the annexation. A group called \\"Friends of Bull Mountain\\" (FOBM) was then formed. The group retained legal counsel Larry Derr and challenged the combined voting method under the provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. § 268 (2005) requiring separate double majority vote counting for annexations within the Portland Metro Urban Growth Boundary.OCVA Jan 2005 Newsletter In the face of this legal challenge Tigard relented and allowed the double majority vote counting method. As a result, the annexation measure [34-98] failed, a majority of city voters (64.71%) favored the annexation, but 88.62% of unincorporated voters rejected the annexation. As is common in such annexation disputes, a key issue was taxes; many Bull Mountain residents thought that annexation with Tigard would increase their property taxes without a significant increase in public services, and that Tigard was only interested in annexation to expand its tax base. They also felt the ORS-195 combined voting method was \\"taxation without representation\\". Some residents of Tigard have complained in response that Bull Mountain residents use Tigard city parks and other services without paying for them. However, Washington County has been actively encouraging suburban parts of the county to join cities, in order to limit the need for county-provided urban-level services. After the defeat of the referendum, Tigard has been examining small annexations on a case-by-case basis. Many residents advocated incorporation in order to allow Bull Mountain residents to control their own destiny (and avoid further annexation by Tigard), in spring of 2006 a petition for a ballot measure was filed. The Washington County Board of Commissioners voted in August 2006 to allow the incorporation ballot initiative to proceed. A feasibility study was conducted by ECONorthwest and it was determined that Bull Mountain has a sufficient tax base to fund city government and services for its residents. The City of Tigard protested the city boundaries, noting that Tigard-owned properties were included in the proposed City of Bull Mountain, and asked that Washington County adjust the boundaries. That request was denied. Tigard also filed a request to annex which are part of the proposed Bull Mountain boundaries. Many in Bull Mountain complained that Tigard's annexation attempt is little more than an 11th-hour attempt to acquire a large segment of land without due respect for the incorporation process and proposed incorporation boundary. The effort was challenged legally in the Washington County courts. This legal challenge was rejected by the state Land Use Board of Appeals: \\"the city had not unlawfully obtained consent to the annexation,\\" and the petition for appeal was dismissed by the Oregon Court of Appeals.Friends of Bull Mountain v. City of Tigard, 208 Or.App. 189, 144 P.3d 965 (2006) The referendum on the incorporation question was on the November 2006 ballot and failed by a vote of 1,734 to 1,887.http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/at/election/results/nov06.htm co.washington.or.us Friends of Bull Mountain The Friends of Bull Mountain (FOBM) is a grassroots community organization in the U.S. state of Oregon acting as local advocates for meaningful citizen involvement and responsible land use planning in keeping with the vision of the Bull Mountain Community Plan.Bull Mountain Community Plan The FOBM group played a key roleTestimony submitted for the Annexation Hearing of July 27, 2004Minutes of the Annexation Hearing of July 27, 2004 in defeating the attempt by city of Tigard to annex Bull Mountain.

Also, HB-2477 eliminated the three-mile (5 km) veto which allowed cities to prevent incorporation of a new city within three miles (5 km). The enactment of HB-2477 allowed the Bull Mountain community to attempt incorporation.

He is the nephew of fellow blues musician Big Jack Johnson. One commentator noted that Super Chikan, Big Jack Johnson, Booba Barnes, R. L. Burnside, and Paul \\"Wine\\" Jones were \\"present-day exponents of an edgier, electrified version of the raw, uncut Delta blues sound.\\"  Life and career =Early life Super Chikan was born James Johnson in Darling, Mississippi on February 16, 1951. He spent his childhood moving from town to town in the Mississippi Delta and working on his family's farms. He was fond of the chickens on the farm, and before he was old enough to work in the fields, he would walk around talking to them. This led his friends to give him the nickname \\"Chikan Boy\\". At an early age, Johnson got his first rudimentary musical instrument, a diddley bow. As he grew up, he came up with new ways to improve and vary the sounds he could make with it, and in 1964, at the age of thirteen, he bought his first guitar, an acoustic model that had only two strings, from a Salvation Army store in Clarksdale. Musical career As an adult, Super Chikan began driving a truck for a living. During the long stretches on the road, he began composing his own songs. When he showed some of the songs to his friends, they convinced him to go to a recording studio and record them. He then started playing with some renowned local musicians, but he decided he would rather perform on his own than try to conform his style to that of his bandmates. He did so, and in 1997 he released his debut album, Blues Come Home to Roost, influenced by such musicians as Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, and Chuck Berry. He went on to release What You See (2000), Shoot That Thang (2001), Chikan Supe (2005), and Sum Mo Chikan (2007). In the Clarksdale area, he is probably best known for performing regularly at Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero blues club and for being Freeman's favorite blues performer. He also played support to Steven Seagal's band, Thunderbox. Super Chikan's latest release was Chikadelic, which was distributed by BluesTown Records. It was recorded in Notodden, Norway's Juke Joint Studios, and was released at the 2009 Notodden Blues Festival. Super Chikan was backed by Norway's Spoonful of Blues. In 2011, he was honored with a plaque on the Clarksdale Walk of Fame.

Nicknamed \\"El Maestro\\" (\\"The Teacher\\"), He was widely considered to be one of the greatest world football players in the 1940s,https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2015/m=5/news=pedernera-the- twinkle-toed-engine-driver-2604360.htmlhttp://www.hitc.com/en- gb/2018/04/22/7-greatest-footballers-of-the-1940s/ as well as one of the greatest Argentine players of all-time. Pedernera was the natural conductor of both famous River Plate team known as La Máquina (spanish for \\"The Machine\\"), with whom he won several Argentine and South American titles, and Millonarios team called Ballet Azul (Blue Ballet), with which won the Small Club World Cup in 1953 among many others colombian titles. Playing for the Argentine Team he won three times the Copa América in 1941, 1945 and 1946, being awarded as the Best Player of the latter.http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/sachampfulltrivia.html#best-players He also was elected the 12th best South american footballer of the 20th century in a poll by the IFFHS in 2000,IFFHS' Century Elections - rsssf.com - by Karel Stokkermans, RSSSF, 2000. and his name appears in the list of the 100 greatest all-time footballers selected from the magazine FourFourTwo in 2017, in which he holds the 58th place. Adolfo Pedernera usually played as an inside forward and was renowned for his technique and ability to create chances for other players, whilst also being a prominent goalscorer. Early career A young Pedernera with River Plate in 1937 Pedernera (third from left) as part of La Máquina in 1941 As an adolescent, Pedernera displayed talent for football. The first club he joined was Cruceros de la Plata, but he soon joined the professional Club Atlético Huracán. In 1933, he joined the Club Atlético River Plate. In 1935, at the age of 16, he debuted with this club. During his time at River Plate he was part of five Primera División winning squads in 1936, 1937, 1941, 1942 and 1945. With the Argentina national team he won the Copa America 1941 and 1945. The Second World War kept Pedernera away from the game as he could not participate in a World Cup, but afterwards, his career continued to progress. Still with the Club Atlético River Plate, he played with the likes of Ángel Labruna, José Manuel Moreno, Félix Loustau, and Juan Carlos Muñoz. He also collaborated with Hugo Reyes, Antonio El Maestrico Báez, Néstor Rossi, and Alfredo Di Stéfano who he would later be teammates with them for CD Los Millonarios in Colombia, but first, in 1947, he was offered a million pesos to play for Atlanta of Buenos Aires. Pedernera's time with Atlanta was short. After the club was relegated for the first time, he returned in 1948 to Huracán where he started his career. However, Carlos Aldabe, the trainer of Millonarios, visited Pedernera in Buenos Aires and convinced him to come to Bogotá, Colombia. There, Pedernera joined the Millonarios on 8 June 1949. He arrived in Bogotá on 10 June and was greeted at the Aeropuerto de Techo by 5,000 fans transported by 200 cars and 25 buses. Joining Millonarios Pedernera settled in the north of Bogotá after being received into the club. On 11 June 1949, he attended his first game with the Millonarios, in which they defeated the Club Atlético Municipal (now the Atlético Nacional) with a score of 6-0. On 25 June, Pedernera played for the first time with the club, helping them defeat the Club Deportes Caldas with a score of 3-0. The press of Bogotá received Pedernera well and commented the next day that \\"El Maestro\\" (\\"The Teacher\\") was \\"a phenomenon, an artist, a master of passing, and a show of intelligence. After the debut of El Maestro, everything is possible.\\" Along with Alfredo Di Stéfano and Nestor Rossi, Pedernera helped the Millonarios to their Colombian championship title in 1949. According to Di Stéfano, the team played with the \\"5 and dance\\" strategy, in which they would try to not humiliate their opponents by scoring when they were leading by five goals. This strategy was employed in nine consecutive victories. In championship play, Pedernera scored the two decisive goals in the championship deciding play-off matches against Deportivo Cali in 1949. After Carlos Aldabe retired as coach from Millonarios Pedernera took over as player-manager and was in this position instrumental in winning the three consecutive championships from 1951 to 1953 and the Copa Colombia of 1953. In this era the Millonarios defeated such other strong teams at the time as Argentina's Huracán, Bolivia's Bolívar, Austria's Rapid Wien, and even his old team, Argentina's River Plate, which had won Primera División championships in 1952 and 1953. In March 1952, when Pedernera was 33 years old, he was part of the Millonarios tour of Europe. On this trip, they achieved an outstanding win over Real Madrid 4–2 at Chamartín Stadium. The Spanish club asked for a rematch, playing two games else that were also won by Millonarios. Pedernera also led his team to victory in the Small Club World Cup (\\"Pequeña Copa del Mundo\\", an international club tournament held in Venezuela) in 1953. He, along with Don Alfonso and Mauro Mórtola, were placed on a list of noted Millonarios players. The team credits him with establishing their mark on Colombia football. In 1954, the Lima Pact forced all \\"illegal\\" players to return to their clubs of origin, so Pedernera returned briefly to Huracán. Coaching career In later years Pedernera also coached Nacional in Uruguay, Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP), Huracán, Independiente, Boca Juniors, América de Cali and River Plate Pedernera also coached Colombia and Argentina national teams. He is remembered in Colombia for helping the national team qualify for its first FIFA World Cup, the 1962 edition in Chile, where Colombia had a good participation.

Gameplay The Dialogue System Another Mind is primarily shown through a series of still photographs with text overlays advancing the story. The characters are represented by photographs of real actors, which are displayed whenever that character is speaking. Rarely a cutscene is used, featuring a movie of the actors interacting; the game uses the actors' real voices during these scenes, a rarity for the time. The player represents \\"another mind\\" residing in the head of the main protagonist, and can only control the game through speaking to the girl. The player does this by constructing their own sentences out of context-sensitive parts of speech provided by the game, rather than selecting from pre-made options. The game is divided into ten chapters, each taking several hours to complete. There are multiple endings to the game, the majority of which are early, \\"bad\\" ends. There are two main endings to the game, as well as a third that can only be reached by playing through the game for a second time. During the game, the actions of the main character as guided by the player changes the course of the story and the relationships between her and the other characters. Plot A 16-year-old girl named Hitomi Hayama is involved in a car accident and admitted to a hospital. Upon waking, she realizes that another mind has taken residence in her head. The player takes on the role of this separate consciousness. The pair are then put into the middle of a mystery that begins at the hospital, which includes a murder, several suicide attempts, and a bombing attempt. Hitomi frequently communicates back with the player, and the player must convince her to perform actions rather than commanding. Characters The characters of the game include Hitomi Hayama (葉山 瞳), a 16-year-old highschool girl and the game's main character; her classmates Mariko Takagi (高木 真理子), Toshiki Kaneda (金田 俊樹), and Masato Kitagawa (北川 正人); and her teachers Ryouji Higuchi (樋口 良治) and Hitoshi Yamagata (山形 均). Other characters include Kaoru Murai (村井 薫), the nurse that took care of Hitomi while she was in the hospital; Teruo Myouen (明円 輝夫), a freelance reporter that is investigating an unsolved case at Wakaba High School; Natsuko Mukai (向井 夏子), Hitomi's psychotherapist; and Nanako Hiura (火浦 菜々子), a mysterious student from another school. Development During the late 1990s, Square launched an initiative to foster talent within the company; small teams of younger developers would work with a smaller budget to create experimental titles for the PlayStation; one of these titles was Another Mind. Keizo Kokubo was the games director, having previously been the main programmer for Chrono Trigger and Romancing SaGa. The original idea for the game centered around the question of how to create a relationship between the player and the games protagonist. Kokubo worried that the game would not be given the go ahead, as at any given time there are many projects being experiemented with. Executive Producer Hironobu Sakaguchi did not know whether to approve the proposal or not, and was reluctant to read it, but he was caught by the proposal for a \\"game drama\\" instead of a TV drama. The game features live actors, and the cast featured Kato Ito, Toshio Kakei, Tosei Kochi, and Shinji Yamashita. The amount of screen time in the game is relatively small as the acting is only shown for important plot points, but when it appears it takes the form of a full screen movie. Filming took three weeks to complete, with a schedule running from 7am to 10pm. Kokubo stated that the themes he wanted to explore in this “film“ were ego and death. Originally, there was to be an episode between Chapters five and six called “Flash Highway”, where the character Hitomi, who was driving with Mariko, predicts that an accident will occur on the highway. The player was then supposed to discover how to avoid or prevent the accident. However, there were many difficulties getting permission to film on the highway, so the episode was not included. Soundtrack The soundtrack to the game, composed by Junya Nakano, was released as a separate album by DigiCube on November 21, 1998. The album, titled Another Mind Original Soundtrack, contains 24 tracks and spans a duration of 1:14:38. The soundtrack was composed using only the PlayStation's on-board synthesizer, and the tracks vary greatly in mood and pace. Reception Chris Winkler of RPGFan, in his review of the game, termed the game as \\"bizarre\\". While praising the \\"stellar\\" music by Junya Nakano, he found that several of the game's idiosyncrasies made it difficult to get into. He called out the slow-moving text, the occasionally incomprehensible though \\"interesting\\" story, and the shallow attempts at humor as particular problems with the game, and recommended tracking down the game only for players \\"looking for a rather unique and very Japanese gaming experience.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Another Mind at Square Enix 1998 video games Adventure games Full motion video based games Interactive movie video games Japan-exclusive video games PlayStation (console)-only games Square (video game company) games Video games developed in Japan Video games featuring female protagonists PlayStation (console) games ","title":"Another Mind (video game)"},{"id":"6288153","text":"Willie Logan (born February 16, 1957) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Florida. A former member of the Florida House of Representatives, he campaigned for the United States Senate as an Independent in 2000. Biography Born in Northern Miami-Dade County, Logan graduated from high school in 1975, Logan attended Miami-Dade Community College, from which he earned an associate's degree, before graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Miami in 1977. After working for three years in the insurance industry, and volunteering for several political campaigns, Logan made his first run for public office in 1980, being elected mayor of Opa-locka, Florida at age 23, making him the youngest mayor of any American city at that time. That same year, he founded the Opa-locka Community Development Corporation, a non-profit that he eventually built into a multi- million dollar organization with five subsidiaries. In 1998, Logan touched off a firestorm of controversy when, after serving for 16 years and becoming one of the caucus' senior legislators, he was ousted as the first African American Speaker-designate in the Chamber's history by his fellow Democratic legislators and defeated for the post of minority leader. Logan's detractors claimed that this was because of Logan's apparent disinterest in caucus affairs, while his supporters charged that it was the result of racism, as Logan had been defeated by a white candidate. Whatever the reason, the results of the caucus election formed a rift between Logan and his party. That year, he endorsed Republican nominee Jeb Bush in his campaign for Governor. He also formed an exploratory committee and began to test the waters for an Independent campaign for the U.S. Senate. On September 29, 1999, Logan officially announced his candidacy as an Independent. Under the slogan \\"Think Independent,\\" he embarked on a motorcycle tour of the state, which ended with a rally at the state capitol in Tallahassee. Hiring Bill Hillsman, the adman credited with the upset victories of Senator Paul Wellstone and Governor Jesse Ventura in Minnesota, Logan aired one television ad, entitled \\"Shades,\\" in which, in an homage to the film Patton, the sunglasses-clad Logan stood onstage before a blown-up $1 million-bill and inveighed against \\"Big Money politics.\\" In addition to his position in favor of strict campaign finance reform, which was the central issue of his campaign, Logan also campaigned on promises to enact strong environmental protection and gun control laws, slash corporate welfare, reduce spending on military programs that he deemed unnecessary, enact the Patients' Bill of Rights, cut the income tax for couples making $70,000 a year or less, protect the Social Security Trust Fund, and open up trade with China. Although opinion polls generally showed Logan's support to be in the double digits, sufficient to gain him entry into a series of televised debates between the \\"major\\" candidates (which Logan was widely believed to have won), this support proved ephemeral on Election Day, as Logan placed a distant third with just 80,830 votes, or about 1.38%. In March 2001, Logan, who had retired from the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate, was arrested in a public restroom in Miami Beach on charges of indecent exposure, battery, and possession of marijuana. The affidavit filed by the arresting officer claimed that Logan was seen masturbating in one of the restroom's stalls and subsequently resisted arrest. A single marijuana \\"joint\\" was found in his pocket. Logan was released on bail and, in August of that year, all charges against him were dropped after a judge ruled all evidence against him inadmissible on the grounds that the arresting officer had violated his right to privacy by spying on him through a peephole in the bathroom stall. In 2004, Logan made an aborted attempt at a political comeback, entering the race for Miami-Dade County Commissioner, seeking to represent the first district. Running as a Democrat, he placed second in the August primary with 26% of the vote, but lost the November runoff to fellow Democrat Barbara Jordan, receiving just 39% of the vote.

Accessed June 8, 2018. his comix debut was in Zap Comix #2, in 1968.  Publication history  Checkered Demon stories — many of which were one-pagers — ran in many issues of Zap, and then occasional issues of Robert Crumb's Weirdo anthology. Stories also ran in Wilson's own comics, such as Pork (1974), and the Demon's own title (mostly collecting a strip which ran in an alternative weekly), of which three issues were published in the late 1970s. Checkered Demon stories were collected in the book The Collected Checkered Demon: Volume One, published by Last Gasp in 1998. He also frequently appears in The Art of S. Clay Wilson, published by Ten Speed Press. He appears as a signature on the cover of Wilson's Grimm (Cottage Classics, 1999). Characterization A portly, shirtless being generally seen wearing checkered pants, the Demon emerged from Wilson's experience of watching Federico Fellini's 1965 film Juliet of the Spirits while on LSD. The Checkered Demon's gap-toothed grin was inspired by Mad magazine's mascot Alfred E. Neuman.Knudde, Kjell. S. Clay Wilson profile, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Accessed June 8, 2018. It is also rumored that Wilson's inspiration for the Checkered Demon was artist and friend Alfredo Arreguin. The Checkered Demon is frequently called upon to kill the various demented bikers, pirates, and rapists who populate Wilson's universe. The Demon is unbeatable in combat, but prefers to copulate with rapacious women—such as Star-Eyed Stella, Ruby the Dyke, or Lady Coozette—or to sit around drinking Tree Frog beer. He has no concern for human life. Although the Demon is generally shown as having red skin and black and white checkered pants in color illustrations, Wilson has claimed that the character can actually make himself any color.

The line runs from Albury railway station in the border settlement of Albury–Wodonga to Southern Cross railway station on the western edge of the Melbourne central business district, serving the cities of Wangaratta and Seymour, and smaller towns in northeastern Victoria. The line, owned by VicTrack, but leased to, and maintained by, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, and forms part of the Sydney–Melbourne rail corridor. Unlike other heavy rail lines in Victoria, the line is completely standard gauge, after gauge-conversion works were carried out between 2008 and 2010. However, the broad gauge Tocumwal line runs parallel to the line between Seymour and Broadmeadows. History New A 398 leads a B class up Glenroy Bank on the Sydney Express, circa 1900 S class 4-6-2 leading the Sydney Limited between Seymour and Melbourne, circa 1928 A streamlined S class locomotive hauling the Spirit of Progress near Kilmore East in 1937 The Spirit of Progress in the 1970s Mangalore station Standard-gauge Pacific National container freight train near Seymour V/Line Albury line train Steamrail \\"Farewell Broad Gauge\\" special, Benalla, 2008 Former end of the broad gauge, the break-of-gauge platform at Albury The Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company opened the first section of the Albury line, from North Melbourne to Essendon, in 1860. Following its takeover by the Victorian Government in 1867, the line was extended by 1872The Centenary of the Opening of the Railway to Seymour, Turton, Keith W. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, April;May 1972 pp73-95;101-109 to School House Lane on the south side of the Goulburn River near Seymour, and later that year to Seymour and then to Longwood. Violet Town, Benalla, Wangaratta, Springhurst and Wodonga were reached in 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break of gauge in 1883. The design engineer was Robert Watson. Construction of a standard gauge track parallel with the broad gauge from Albury to Melbourne commenced in 1959, completing the Sydney- Melbourne railway. The first freight train operated on 3 January 1962,Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, March 1962 pp35-39 the first passenger train on 16 April. The line was used by prestige passenger services between the state capitals of Melbourne and Sydney, including the Sydney Limited, Spirit of Progress, Southern Aurora, and Intercapital Daylight; but due to declining patronage they were replaced by the XPT from the 1990s. Maintaining two parallel railways has drawn criticism, including inefficiencies in maintaining track, operating trains, and duplicated train control centres. By 2001 the State Government announced the conversion of the broad gauge line to standard, but action was stifled due largely to complex leasing arrangements. Speed restrictions had been applied to the broad gauge line due to track deterioration.V/Line: V/Line Voice Issue 32, February 2008 In May 2008 it was announced that the line would be upgraded, with the conversion of of broad gauge track to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury, a bypass around Wodonga, and upgrades between Melbourne and Seymour including new passing loops. Passenger platforms were to be built on the standard-gauge line, and V/Line locomotives and carriages converted to operate on the line. Costing A$501.3 million, the Victorian Government was to contribute A$171.3 million, the Australian Government A$45 million for the Wodonga Rail Bypass, and the Australian Rail Track Corporation A$285 million and take responsibility for the standard-gauge line under a 45-year lease from Victoria. The project was due for completion by 2010, with passenger services to be disrupted for up to 12 months. On 8 November 2008, broad gauge passenger trains ceased after the evening V/Line service from Melbourne to Albury and a special train operated by the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre, the final broad-gauge passenger train from Albury to Melbourne. In December 2008, standardisation works commenced, contracted by ARTC to the Southern Improvement Alliance. The first train on the Wodonga Rail Bypass was in March 2010. In early August 2010 CountryLink decided to terminate all Sydney- Melbourne XPTs at Albury for an indefinite length of time, due to defects in the newly resleepered track. \\"Mud holes\\" resulted in speed restrictions on more than 200 kilometres (about 66 per cent) of the line, adding an extra 1.5 hours to the travelling time. Train drivers have blamed the ARTC's $285 million concrete sleeper project for the track issues, stating that the incorrect insertion of 300,000 new concrete sleepers is to blame. They have repeatedly reported freight trains breaking couplings due to the rough track. CountryLink trains resumed in mid September 2010, V/Line trains the following year. Wallan train derailment On 20 February 2020, a NSW TrainLink XPT passenger train towards Sydney derailed at Wallan, resulting in suspension of freight, V/Line and NSW TrainLink services on the North East Line and the adjacent broad gauge Tocumwal railway line. V/Line services resumed on 1 and 2 March 2020. Branch Lines=Branch lines south of Seymour A branch line opened from Heathcote Junction (near Kilmore) to Kilmore in 1888 and to Tooborac in 1890, connecting with a line from Bendigo and Heathcote opened a little earlier. The Heathcote Junction – Heathcote line closed in 1968. A branch line from Kilmore to Lancefield opened in 1892, closed in 1904. The Mansfield line opened from Tallarook to Yea in 1883, Molesworth in 1889, Cathkin and Merton in 1890 and Mansfield in 1891. It is now closed. A branch line was built from Cathkin to Koriella in 1890 and Alexandra in 1909. This line closed in 1978. Branch lines north of Seymour The Shepparton line opened from Mangalore to Toolamba and Shepparton in 1880. A branch line opened from Benalla to St James in 1883, Yarrawonga in 1886 and Oaklands in 1938, with a break of gauge there until the State Rail Authority line closed south of Boree Creek. An branch line from Benalla to Tatong was opened in 1914 and closed in 1947. The narrow-gauge Whitfield branch line opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield in 1899, closing in 1953. A branch line opened from Bowser (north of Wangaratta) to Everton in 1875, which was extended to Beechworth in 1876 and Yackandandah in 1891. The line closed in 1954. The Bowser – Everton line was extended to Myrtleford in 1883 and Bright in 1890, now closed. A short line to Peechelba East, which opened in 1928 and closed in 1986, also branched from Bowser. A short branch line opened from Springhurst via Rutherglen to Wahgunyah in 1879. Services were suspended in 1995. A branch line opened from Wodonga to Tallangatta between 1889 and 1891, Shelley in 1916, Beetoomba in 1919 and Cudgewa in 1921.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June 1960 pp91-93 A connection from Albury was added near Wodonga, creating a turning triangle to enable the Sydney Limited and its successor Spirit of Progress with their observation cars to be turned as complete trains. The line closed beyond Bandiana in 1981, and the connection to Wodonga later removed, with only standard gauge traffic continuing to use the line via Albury. Passenger services The entire line is utilised by V/Line Albury trains, which stops at every station between Albury and Seymour, and NSW TrainLink Southern services to, and from, Sydney (Central), which makes limited stops on this section. Outside this section, all passenger trains heading to, and from, Melbourne only make scheduled stops at Seymour, Broadmeadows and Southern Cross, and no other station. Seymour and Shepparton V/Line services continue to use the adjacent broad gauge tracks on the Tocumwal line.

It is operated by West Virginia State Parks and is part of the American Discovery Trail.North Bend Rail Trail official website, from West Virginia State Parks Running parallel to U.S. Route 50, the rail trail extends from the community of Wolf Summit west of Clarksburg at its eastern end to I-77 near Parkersburg at its western end, passing through Harrison, Doddridge, Ritchie and Wood Counties and the towns of Salem, West Union, Pennsboro, Ellenboro and Cairo, as well as North Bend State Park and numerous unincorporated communities.DeLorme (1997). West Virginia Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. . History=Railroad The North Bend Rail Trail was built on one of the most distinguished railroad lines in U.S. history. Chartered in 1851, the Northwestern Virginia Railroad built 103 miles from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O;) mainline at Grafton, West Virginia, to the Ohio River at Parkersburg, West Virginia. The line was sold to the B&O; upon completion on May 1, 1857 and became known as the B&O; Parkersburg Branch. The Parkersburg Branch was built to high engineering standards with 23 tunnels and 52 bridges to minimize curvature and offer a maximum grade of 1.5%. During its prime years, the branch hosted the Metropolitan, the Cincinnatian and National Limited, the B&O;'s premiere passenger train between New York City and St. Louis, Missouri. However, with the rise of automobile ownership, ridership declined and the B&O; ceased passenger operations in 1971 with the formation of Amtrak. After the Parkersburg Branch became part of the newly formed Chessie System in 1973, the mountainous route lost favor among railroad management. Amtrak, however, resurrected passenger trains in September 1971, though bypassed many of the sparsely populated towns along the line. Amtrak established the little-used West Virginian, which linked Washington, D.C. to Parkersburg, in response to pressure from U.S. Congressman Harley Orrin Staggers, who used his political status to continually push for improved transportation service throughout West Virginia. Ridership remained low and Amtrak rechristened the train the Potomac Special (derisively called the \\"Harley's Hornet\\" or \\"Staggers Special\\") before eliminating it in 1973. Beginning in October 1976, another Amtrak train, the Shenandoah, began utilizing the route, only to be discontinued in the fall of 1981 due to low ridership. Amtrak also rerouted the Capitol Limited over a B&O; routing between Pittsburgh and Washington, a train originating in Chicago and continuing service to West Virginia communities east of Clarksburg, effectively bypassing the lightly used Parkersburg Branch. By the time of Amtrak's retrenchment in 1981, local freight service was minimal. The Chessie System had already diverted long-distance freight trains to other routes and eliminated local service entirely by 1985. Two years later, the dormant Parkersburg Branch came under the stewardship of CSX Transportation, who abandoned the line between Walker and Wilsonburg and dismantled the tracks in September 1988. Trail CSX Transportation initially demanded $1.5 million from prospective buyers for the railroad corridor but eventually sold it to the state of West Virginia for approximately $320,000. The state gradually developed plans to convert the line into a recreational trail and incorporate it into their state park system. Initial trail segments opened in 1991, with additional portions added over several years, encompassing some 60 miles of former railroad that included 50 bridges and 12 tunnels. In 1996, the state purchased the western portion of the abandoned corridor between Walker and Parkersburg, totaling 72 miles. Under the management of the state's Department of Natural Resources, the North Bend Rail Trail has become one of the most renowned recreational trails through the Appalachians. It is revered for its mountainous scenery and lengthy tunnels, including the 1,086-foot tunnel No. 2 a short distance east of Salem.

Filmed in Spain, the larger part of the movie takes place in Mexico in 1912. Directed by Paul Wendkos, it stars George Peppard, Pete Duel, Giovanna Ralli, and Raf Vallone, and features a musical score by Elmer Bernstein. Plot It is 1912 and groups of Mexican revolutionaries have been attacking towns on both sides of the Mexican–American border. The most powerful of these groups is led by a former Mexican army general, Héctor Cordoba. When a surprise attack results in six cannons falling into the hands of Cordoba and his men, the United States government puts General John J. \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing in charge of seeing that the cannons will never be used against the American people. Pershing turns to Captain Rod Douglas, instructing him to gather a group of men to take part in the dangerous mission into the heart of the Cordoba's territory. The first man to sign up for the job is Jackson Harkness, a soldier who has worked with Douglas before. At the beginning of the film, Harkness has to stand by and watch as his brother is tortured and killed by Cordoba. Douglas ordered him not to step in because they were undercover as sympathizers in the enemy camp and could not afford to make their true intentions known. As a result, Harkness vows vengeance on the captain and will not leave his side until the opportunity presents itself. The next two men that Douglas chooses for the operation are Andy Rice, and Peter, who have just broken out of the army jail when Douglas arrives with the orders for their release. The captain now has all of the men that he feels are necessary for getting the job done. However, a Mexican lieutenant, Antonio Gutierrez, who holds a personal grudge against Cordoba, approaches him and demands to be part of the operation. He tells Douglas that he knows a woman, Leonora Cristobal, who, for her own reasons, wishes to see Cordoba dead. If the captain includes him in the mission, she will help them by working her way into Cordoba's confidence and getting him alone so that he will be vulnerable when they make their move. Antonio and Leonora arrive at Cordoba's camp first. Leonora, who learns that the Mexican government wants to capture Cordoba alive, betrays Antonio and informs the bandit leader of his intentions, hoping that he will reward her for what she has done by allowing her to get closer to him, giving her the opportunity to kill him herself. When Douglas, Andy, Peter, and Harkness arrive at the camp, posing as sympathizers, they hear of what Leonora has done and decide that they have to act quickly. Douglas starts a fight with one of the Mexican men, so as to be put in jail, where he can help Antonio to escape. That night, Andy, disguised as a Mexican guard, breaks both of the men out of jail so that the operation can proceed. Douglas goes to Cordoba's room, where he finds him alone with Leonora. She betrayed Antonio but she still did the job she was supposed to do. Meanwhile, Jackson and Peter turn the cannons on the camp and begin to fire, while Andy and Antonio shoot flares into the buildings. Chaos ensues and the group of men, along with Leonora and their prisoner, Cordoba, attempt to ride out of the camp. Peter, Antonio, and Andy are killed in the process, and Cordoba is wounded. The next morning, miles away from the camp, the diminished group stops to rest. When Douglas goes off by himself, Harkness sees his opportunity to avenge his brother. He follows the captain, demands that he turn around, and draws his gun. As Douglas walks unflinchingly toward him, however, he is unable to shoot and, instead, punches him. All now forgiven, the two men walk back to where Leonora waits. Cordoba has died from the wound he received the previous night. They are not able to bring him back alive, as the government had wanted, but the cannons were destroyed and their mission is complete. Cast *George Peppard ... Captain Rod Douglas *Pete Duel ...

However, in the 16th century the word was respelled with an initial sch in order to conform to its Latin and Greek forms. From this spelling arose the pronunciation (skĭ′zəm). Long regarded as incorrect, it became so common in both British and American English that it gained acceptability as a standard variant. Evidence indicates, however, that it is now the preferred pronunciation, at least in American English. In a recent survey 61 percent of the Usage Panel indicated that they use (skĭ′zəm), while 31 percent said they use (sĭ′zəm). A smaller number, 8 percent, preferred a third pronunciation, (shĭ′zəm).) is a division between people, usually belonging to an organization, movement, or religious denomination. The word is most frequently applied to a split in what had previously been a single religious body, such as the East–West Schism or the Great Western Schism. It is also used of a split within a non-religious organization or movement or, more broadly, of a separation between two or more people, be it brothers, friends, lovers, etc. A schismatic is a person who creates or incites schism in an organization or who is a member of a splinter group. Schismatic as an adjective means pertaining to a schism or schisms, or to those ideas, policies, etc. that are thought to lead towards or promote schism. In religion, the charge of schism is distinguished from that of heresy, since the offence of schism concerns not differences of belief or doctrine but promotion of, or the state of, division. However, schisms frequently involve mutual accusations of heresy. In Roman Catholic teaching, every heresy is a schism, while there may be some schisms free of the added guilt of heresy. Liberal Protestantism, however, has often preferred heresy over schism. Presbyterian scholar James I. McCord (quoted with approval by the Episcopalian Bishop of Virginia, Peter Lee) drew a distinction between them, teaching: \\"If you must make a choice between heresy and schism, always choose heresy. As a schismatic, you have torn and divided the body of Christ. Choose heresy every time.\\" (\\"Choose heresy\\" is a pun; \\"heresy\\" is a Latinization of an ancient Greek word for \\"to choose\\".) Etymology The word schism comes from the Greek word σχίσμα which means \\"cleft, division\\". Buddhism In Buddhism, the first schism was set up by Devadatta, during Buddha's life. This schism lasted only a short time. Later (after Buddha's death), the early Buddhist schools came into being, but were not schismatic, only focusing on different interpretations for the same monastic community. In the old texts, 18 or 20 early schools are mentioned. Later, there were the Mahayana and Vajrayana movements, which can be regarded as being schismatic in origin. Each school has various subgroups, which often are schismatic in origin. For example, in Thai Theravadin Buddhism there are two groups (Mahanikaya and Dhammayut), of which the Dhammayut has its origin partly in the Mahanikaya, and is the new and schismatic group. Both Mahanikaya and Dhammayut have many subgroups, which usually do not have schismatic origins, but came into being in a natural way, through the popularity of a (leader) monk. Tibetan Buddhism has seen schisms in the past, of which most were healed, although the Drukpa school centred in Bhutan perhaps remains in a state of schism (since 1616) from the other Tibetan schools. Christianity The historical development of major church branches from their roots The words schism and schismatic have found their heaviest usage in the history of Christianity, to denote splits within a church, denomination or religious body. In this context, \\"schismatic\\", as a noun, denotes a person who creates or incites schism in a church or a person who is a member of a splinter Church; as an adjective, \\"schismatic\\" refers to ideas and activities that are thought to lead to or constitute schism, and ultimately to departure from what the user of the word considers to be the true Christian Church. These words have been used to denote both the phenomenon of Christian group-splintering in general, and certain significant historical splits in particular. One can make a distinctionCatechism of the Eastern Orthodox Church, p. 42; The Concordia Cyclopedia quoted in Unionism and Syncretism - and PLI; Orthodox Practice - Choosing God-parents; Code of Canon Law, canon 751 between heresy and schism. Heresy is rejection of a doctrine that a Church considered to be essential. Schism is a rejection of communion with the authorities of a Church, and not every break of communion is necessarily about doctrine, as is clear from examples such as the Western Schism and the breaking of the communion that existed between Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople and Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens in 2004. However, when for any reason people withdraw from communion, two distinct ecclesiastical entities may result, each of which, or at least some members thereof, may then accuse the other(s) of heresy. In Roman Catholic Church canon law, an act of schism, like an act of apostasy or heresy, automatically brings the penalty of excommunication on the individual who commits it.Code of Canon Law, canon 1364 As stated in canon 1312 §1 1° of the Code of Canon Law, this penalty is intended to be medicinal, so as to lead to restoration of unity. Roman Catholic theology considers formal schismatics to be outside the Church, understanding by \\"formal schismatics\\" \\"persons who, knowing the true nature of the Church, have personally and deliberately committed the sin of schism\\".Aidan Nichols, Rome and the Eastern Churches (Liturgical Press 1992), p. 41 The situation, for instance, of those who have been brought up from childhood within a group not in full communion with Rome, but who have orthodox faith, is different: these are considered to be imperfectly, though not fully, members of the Church. This nuanced view applies especially to the Churches of Eastern Christianity, more particularly still to the Eastern Orthodox Church. The First Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325) distinguished between schism and heresy. It declared Arian and non-Trinitarian teachings to be heretical and excluded their adherents from the Church. It also addressed the schism between Peter of Alexandria and Meletius of Lycopolis, considering their quarrel to be a matter of discipline, not of faith. The divisions that came to a head at the Councils of Ephesus (A.D. 431) and Chalcedon (A.D. 451) were seen as matters of heresy, not merely of schism. Thus the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy regard each other as heretical, not orthodox, because of the Oriental Orthodox Church's rejection and the Eastern Orthodox Church's acceptance of the Confession of Chalcedon about the two natures (human and divine) of Christ. However, this view has been challenged in the recent Ecumenical discussion between these two groups, classifying the matter of Chalcedon as a matter of schism, not of heresy. In its extended and final form (possibly derived from the First Council of Constantinople in 381 although only known from the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon seventy years later),Kelly, J.N.D. Early Christian Creeds Longmans 1960 pp. 296,7; 305-331 what is commonly called the Nicene Creed declares belief in the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Some who accept this creed believe they should be united in a single Church or group of Churches in communion with each other. Others who accept this creed believe it does not speak of a visible organization but of all those baptized who hold the Christian faith, referred to as \\"Christendom\\". Some churches consider themselves to be the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. For instance, the Roman Catholic Church claims that title and considers the Eastern Orthodox Church to be in schism, while the Eastern Orthodox Church also claims that title and holds the view that the Catholic Church is schismatic. Some Protestant Churches believe that they also represent the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church and consider the Catholic and Orthodox Churches to be in error, while others do not expect a union of all Christian churches on earth. See also One true church and Great Apostasy. Protestant groups, lacking the stronger traditional authority-structures of (say) Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy, and often riven by politico-national divides (sometimes resulting from cuius regio, eius religio), show a high degree of fissibility, which ecumenical efforts may only intensify. Schisms have occurred particularly frequently among Anabaptists, to the extent that divisions over even minute details of doctrine and theology are common and scholars have dubbed the phenomenon Täuferkrankheit or \\"The Anabaptist Disease\\". Emphasizing fully voluntary membership in the church, and without an established authority of hierarchical structure, Anabaptists, especially Mennonites have experienced dozens of schisms, resulting in the establishment of dozens of various unaffiliated Mennonite churches. A current dispute with an acknowledged risk of schism for the Anglican Communion involves responses to homosexuality. In 2018 Eastern Orthodoxy suffered a schism, the 2018 Moscow-Constantinople schism between the primatial See of Eastern Orthodoxy, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Russian Orthodox Church over the issue of Constantinople granting autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Islam After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammed, there have arisen many Muslim sects by means of schools of thought, traditions and related faiths.Why are Muslims divided into different Sects/Schools of Thought by Zakir Naik on IRF.net According to a Hadith report (collections of accounts of the life and teachings of Muhammed), Muhammed is said to have prophesied \\"My Ummah (Community or Nation) will be fragmented into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in the Hell fire except one.\\" The Sahaba (his companions) asked him which group that would be, whereupon he replied, \\"It is the one to which I and my companions belong\\" (reported in Sunan al-Tirmidhi Hadith No. 171). Sunni Muslims, often referred to as Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamā‘h or Ahl as- Sunnah, are the largest denomination of Islam. The word Sunni comes from the word Sunnah, which means the teachings and actions or examples of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad; therefore, the term Sunni refers to those who follow or maintain the Sunnah of Muhammad. The Sunni believe that Muhammad died without appointing a successor to lead the Muslim ummah (community). After an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent companions gathered and elected Abu Bakr, Muhammad's close friend and father-in-law, as the first Caliph. Sunnis regard the first four caliphs - Abu Bakr, Umar (\`Umar ibn al- Khattāb), Uthman Ibn Affan, and Ali (Ali ibn Abu Talib) - as the al- Khulafā’ur-Rāshidūn or \\"Rashidun\\" (The Rightly Guided Caliphs). Sunnis believe that the position of Caliph may be democratically chosen, but after the first four Rightly Guided Caliphs the position turned into a hereditary dynastic rule. There has not been another widely recognized Caliph since the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1923. Shia Islam is the second largest denomination of Islam. Shia Muslims believe that, similar to the appointment of prophets, Imams after Muhammad are also chosen by God. According to Shias, Ali was chosen by Allah and thus appointed by Muhammad to be the direct successor and leader of the Muslim community. They regard him as the first Shia Imam, which continued as a hereditary position through Fatimah and Ali's descendants. Sufism is a mystical-ascetic form of Islam practised by both Shia and Sunni Muslims. Some Sufi followers consider themselves Sunni or Shia, while others consider themselves as just Sufi or Sufi-influenced. Sufism is usually considered to be complementary to orthodox Islam, although Sufism has often been accused by the salafi of being an unjustified Bid‘ah or religious innovation. By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of \\"intuitive and emotional faculties\\" that one must be trained to use.Trimingham (1998), p.1 One starts with sharia (Islamic law), the exoteric or mundane practice of Islam, and then is initiated into the mystical (esoteric) path of a Tariqah (Sufi Order). Kharijite (lit. \\"those who seceded\\") is a general term embracing a variety of Islamic sects which, while originally supporting the Caliphate of Ali, eventually rejected his legitimacy after he negotiated with Mu'awiya during the 7th Century Islamic civil war (First Fitna). Their complaint was that the Imam must be spiritually pure, whereas Ali's compromise with Mu'awiya was a compromise of his spiritual purity and therefore of his legitimacy as Imam or Caliph. While there are few remaining Kharijite or Kharijite-related groups, the term is sometimes used to denote Muslims who refuse to compromise with those with whom they disagree. Jainism Picture showing a diagrammatic view of the schisms in Jainism along with the timeline The first schism in Jainism happened around the fourth century BCE, leading to rise of two major sects, Digambara and Svetambara, which were later subdivided in further sub- sects. Judaism Throughout Jewish history, Judaism survived many schisms, including the emergence of Christianity. Today, major Jewish denominations are Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox: Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist.

Though the PMS is headed by a Secretary, the Secretaries of the Cabinet, Chief of Staff, and Appointments, support the agency. The PMS, the Office of the Appointments Secretary and the newly created Events Management Cluster are under the supervision of the Office of the Special Assistant to the President. The current head of the Presidential Management Staff is Usec. Ferdinand B. Cui Jr.(as acting head), serving in this position since October 16, 2018. History The Presidential Management Staff can trace its lineage to the Program Implementation Agency (PIA), which was created by President Diosdado Macapagal to serve as his technical staff for the socio-economic projects, which his administration was implementing. It was created on August 24, 1962 under the leadership of Assistant Executive Secretary Sixto K. Roxas and Armand Fabella, who was appointed Director-General. The PIA reported directly to the President and conducted socio-economic planning, formulate policy recommendations, established priorities, and programmed the utilization of public funds, manpower resources, materials and equipment. It also ensured that the projects of the Office of the President were completed on-time as planned. On February 1, 1966, President Ferdinand E. Marcos dissolved the PIA and established the Presidential Economic Staff (PES) in its place through Executive Order No. 8. The PES retained all the functions of the PIA and in addition, it was tasked to establish ties with international financial institutions to help the government and the private sector to tap foreign credit and assistance. The PES was headed by Placido Mapa and Apolinario Orosa and translated the economic targets of the National Economic Council into actual projects. On July 29, 1970, President Marcos then issued Executive Order No. 250, which created the Development Management Staff (DMS) under the Office of the President. The DMS was located at the Arlegui Guest House. In 1972, Internal Reorganization Plan was implemented and the PES was absorbed by the National Economic and Development Authority and the DMS was retained as an attached agency of the Office of the President, serving as the principal information and staff resource of Malacañang on matters involving monitoring, coordinating, and controlling development programs at execution. Executive Secretary Alejandro Melchor was appointed to run the DMS; he then proceeded to hire 50 young men and women, including Colonel Luis M. Mirasol, whom he would appoint as Managing Director. The DMS held office at the New Executive Office Building (San Miguel Building) and produced regular status reports for 21 priority programs as well as provided staff to various government programs and agencies. The priority programs included projects related to land reform, housing, education, and rural electrification. These status reports would then be used for briefings as well as Cabinet meetings. On July 8, 1976, Presidential Decree No. 955 reorganized the Office of the President, renaming the DMS as the Presidential Management Staff. The PMS this millennium The Presidential Management Staff (PMS) has assisted the President and the Cabinet in setting up the necessary support mechanisms and has helped the Office of the President in the exercise of decision-making. Its experts have provided staff support to the President for policy and management matters. In supporting the Presidency, PMS' involvement necessarily cut across the broad spectrum of economic, social, and political concerns, e.g., social and economic reforms, poverty alleviation, people empowerment, labor, education, welfare and development, infrastructure, agriculture, trade, industry, tourism, environment, judicial reforms, energy, and energizing the bureaucracy, among others.  Functions  PMS' mandate as the primary technical arm of the Presidency dictates that it perform multifarious functions which can be categorized under five (5) specific areas of accountability # Timely, reliable, accurate and comprehensive information to the President and the Executive Secretary in the exercise of Presidential decision-making # Competent and responsive support to Presidential fora # Thorough and efficient coordination of Presidential activities # Effective implementation of special assignments as directed by the President # Efficient internal administration Structure The PMS head, with the rank of secretary, exercises direct control and supervision over the operations and resources of the organization. Assisting the PMS head is the deputy head with the rank of undersecretary. A management team (MANTEAM) composed of all PMS officials and unit heads serves as venue for increasing the level of involvement and degree of participation of key PMS officials in the management of the affairs of the organization. The PMS has eight functional units, which provide technical inputs to the president and the Office of the President. These units are structurally and functionally created by sector to address presidential concerns and to ensure efficient coordination among concerned departments/agencies/bodies. These units are as follows: * Macroeconomy and Political Affairs Office (MPO) * Agri-Industrial and Infrastructure Policy Office (APO) * Social Policy Office (SPO), Corporate Affairs Office (CAO) * Development Administration Office (DAO) * Office for Regional Concerns (ORC) * Office for Special Projects (OSP) * Regional Field Units (RFUs) They are tasked to monitor issues and developments focusing specifically on those that shall impact on the Presidency and national interest, translate Presidential insights/perspectives into operational terms, provide alternative opinions/recommendations on policy and program issues, and conduct policy reviews within their sectoral jurisdiction. A Speechwriting Group answers the speech requirement of the President. PMS also has support units which assist other PMS Units and PMS programs and projects in the performance of their tasksAdministrative and Management Office (ADMO), Conference Management Office (CMO), Editorial and Visual Design Office (EVIO), Legal Office (LO), and Information Technology Office (ITO). All the PMS units operate with the benefits of computer technology. PMS ensures that it keeps abreast with the fast-changing trends in IT to provide an even better, more responsive staff work for the Presidency. General Manpower Attributes PMS Has a multi- disciplinary staff that enables it to be more responsive to the various tasks it handles. About 60% of its staff performs managerial, supervising or technical functions. By academic discipline, the officials and employees of PMS are graduates of some of the finest schools and educational institutions here and abroad. About 65% are graduates of the following fields of specialization, either masteral or bachelor's degree level: public/business administration; economics; behavioral and social sciences; engineering; computer education; accounting; agriculture-related courses; law; education; and organizational/mass communication. The PMS is composed of relatively young employees. Close to 70% are between 20 and 40 years old. Development Performance Evaluation System The Development Performance Evaluation System is tasked by the President to conduct audits of the Executive Departments. It aims to pinpoint problems and subsequently recommending solutions to align the different departments towards development objectives.

It opened on 22 December 1886, as the terminus of a short line from Ballarat. On 4 December 1889, the line was extended to Bacchus Marsh, meaning that trains could then run from Melbourne to Ballarat via Ballan.Ballan Vicsig History Before the line via Ballan and Bacchus Marsh was constructed, Ballarat was only indirectly linked to Melbourne via the Melbourne-Geelong and Geelong-Ballarat lines. Being on a single track section of track, the station served as a crossing loop, with an interlocked signal box erected in 1890. In 1893, a turntable was added and by 1908, the station had a four road yard, a passenger platform, a goods shed and goods platform. In 1967, the turntable was removed. In early 1973, a dead-end siding at the Up (Southern Cross) end of the station was removed. More tracks in the yard were removed during 1987 and 1988, leaving only the platform road and a loop remaining. In 1996, the loop was abolished and the signal box closed, meaning that Ballan was no longer available for crossing trains. In 2004, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project, the track at the eastern end of the station was realigned in order to permit an increase in the maximum speeds of trains though the curve. The closed stations Ingliston and Rowsley were located between Ballan and Bacchus Marsh. Between Ballan and Ballarat, closed stations include Gordon, Millbrook, Wallace, Bungaree, Warrenheip and Ballarat East. Platforms & services Ballan has two platforms.

The film stars Suzy Amis, Bo Hopkins, Ian McKellen, David Chung, Heather Graham, Carrie Snodgress and Melissa Leo, and was written and directed by Maggie Greenwald. Roger Ebert described the film as depicting a culture in which \\"men of poor breeding lived and worked together in desperate poverty of mind and body, and were so enclosed inside their roles that they hardly knew each other at all.\\" The Ballad of Little Jo was nominated for the 1994 Independent Spirit Award for best female lead (Amis) and best supporting male (Chung).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106350/awards Plot Josephine Monaghan (Amis) is a young society woman who is seduced by her family's portrait photographer, and as a result, bears an illegitimate child. She is expelled from her family and home in disgrace, and with no other resources, she leaves her newborn son under the care of her sister and heads West. On the road, Josephine discovers that her options are very limited. As a single woman traveling alone, she is viewed with suspicion, or as sexual prey for any man. She assists a traveling salesman (René Auberjonois) who subsequently tries to sell her services as a whore to passing strangers. Seeing it as her only protection, Josephine scars her face, and begins to dress as a man - thus becoming \\"Jo.\\" At a mining camp in Ruby City, she meets Percy (McKellen) who takes her under his wing. Percy recommends Jo for a job at the stable, and teaches her about how to survive in the frontier. But Percy nurses a deep suspicion of women, which he later demonstrates by slashing the face of a prostitute who refuses to give him oral sex. Jo no longer feels safe with Percy or her secret, so she accepts a job herding sheep, and heads for the mountains. After returning in the spring, Percy gives Jo a letter for her that he had received months earlier. The letter is from Jo's sister, and Percy having opened it, now knows he is a she. He is furious at being made a fool of by a woman and \\"a whore at that,\\" referring to the mention of her son in the letter. He attacks and tries to rape Jo, but she draws her gun and subdues him. Largely ostracized by the town's people since the incident with the prostitute, Percy promises Jo he will not share her secret if she finances his journey out of the territory. She agrees, though swears to him she will find him and kill him if he breaks his silence. For five years she works as a shepherd, braving the deadly winters alone to the worry of her employer, Frank Badger (Hopkins), who has taken a liking to the \\"young man\\" he nicknames \\"Little Jo.\\" When Jo has enough money saved, she quits Badger, and buys her own homestead. While frequently viewed as \\"peculiar\\", Jo is clearly educated, and earns the respect of the people in Ruby City and the surrounding territory. A local girl, Mary, (Graham) has her eye on Jo. Blind to the truth, most hope the two will court. However, Mary ends up wedding her cousin, Lucas Brown, soon after Jo returns from her first winter as a sheep herder. One day in town, Jo comes across a mob about to lynch a Chinese laborer for trying to \\"take our jobs.\\" Jo intervenes, and Badger insists the \\"chinaman\\", Tinman Wong (David Chung), go to live with Jo to help with the homestead. Tinman accompanies Jo to the homestead, and takes on the duties of cook and housekeeper. Though he seems slow-witted, Jo is not happy at having company forced upon her, and is afraid he will discover she is not a man. She keeps as much distance as possible. But Tinman easily discovers the truth about Jo, and in doing so, reveals he is far more intelligent than he has pretended to be—he, too, has been masquerading for his own safety. Jo drops her guard and the two begin a love affair. A feud begins to brew between the sheep herders and cattlemen who are moving into the territory. The Western Cattle Company wants to buy up all the land in the area, and they kill anyone who does not comply. One by one, the sheep herders give in, or are murdered by masked gunmen. Jo has witnessed the brutal murders of too many of her friends, and the violence that will be necessary to win this kind of fight goes against her gentle nature. This is a masculine quality that goes beyond her ability to \\"pass,\\" so Jo dons a dress once again in a feeble effort to step back into a more traditionally feminine role. Tinman argues that it will be impossible for her to go back being the society woman, urging her to keep the homestead, and stand against the cattlemen in the upcoming election. Jo is not swayed, and meets with the representative from the cattle company, Henry Grey (Anthony Heald) to tell him she will sell. Tinman falls ill, and Jo summons Badger's wife (Snodgrass), who practices folk medicine, to tend him. Badger comes along, and is furious when Grey arrives with his wife so that Jo can sign the final papers for the sale of the homestead. Feeling betrayed by Jo for helping the cattle company to \\"squeeze me,\\" Badger hits Jo, proclaiming, \\"By God, boy! I thought you'd amount to something.\\" As Grey prepares the papers inside, Jo watches his wife who, through the warped glass, is visually reminiscent of Jo when she was a woman of society. In an instant, Jo changes her mind and refuses to sell to Grey, who leaves in disgust issuing less than veiled threats. Tinman recovers, and on election day, Badger and Jo ride to Ruby City but are met by several of Grey's masked gunmen. Badger shoots one of the gunmen, but is wounded, so it is up to Jo to finish the fight. She kills the two remaining men, but the pain of the act of killing is clearly indicated on her face. The plot jumps to many years later, after Tinman Wong has died. Jo collapses while fetching water, and Badger finds her in bed, near death. He takes her in his wagon to the Ruby City doctor, but she is dead before they arrive. As Badger buys rounds of drinks at the saloon in memory of Little Jo, the undertaker rushes in with his shocking discovery—Little Jo was a woman. The town elders rush back to the undertaker's to inspect. All stand around the preparation table in shock, all except Mrs. Addie (Cathy Haase), the saloon owner, who laughs and laughs. Badger is furious at the betrayal by his friend, and because Jo \\"made a fool out of me.\\" He goes back to her homestead, and as he tears the place apart in anger, comes across the letter from her sister, and a picture of her as she lived as a woman. In town, the people tie Jo's dead body to her horse for a photograph.

In this theory, our lives are as if on a stage, setting us individuals as actors on that stage as a way to understand human motives and relations.Blakesley, David. The Elements of Dramatism. New York: Longman. 2002. Burke discusses two important ideas – that life is drama, and the ultimate motive of rhetoric is the purging of guilt. Burke recognized guilt as the base of human emotions and motivations for action. As cited in \\"A Note on Burke on \\"Motive\\"\\", the author recognized the importance of \\"motive\\" in Burke's work. In \\"Kenneth Burke's concept of motives in rhetorical theory\\", the authors mentioned that Burke believes that guilt, \\"combined with other constructs, describes the totality of the compelling force within an event which explains why the event took place.\\" To understand people's movement and intentions, the theorist sets up the Dramatistic Pentad strategy for viewing life, not as life itself,Mangham, I. L., & Overington, M. A. (2005). Dramatism and the theatrical metaphor. Life as theater, A dramaturgical sourcebook (2nd ed.), Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, 333-346. by comparing each social unit involved in human activities as five elements of drama – act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose,Griffin, Em. (2009). A First Look at Communication Theory. (7th ed.) New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. to answer the empirical question of how persons explain their actions, and to find the ultimate motivations of human activities. Background and assumptions= Background  Kenneth Burke was an established literary critic originally influenced by Shakespeare and Aristotle's rhetoric at the time he developed his Dramatism theory. Some argue that he was slightly ahead of his time when it came to his intense interdisciplinary approach to his theory. Using his classical education of literature and rhetoric as a foundation, Dramatism was largely influenced by the philosophies of Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud. The joining of these ideologies pushed Burke's work from literary to cultural criticism.  Drama as a metaphor  Why use \\"drama\\" as the metaphor? According to West, there are three basic reasons that drama is a useful metaphor to the idea of Dramatism. # Drama indicates a wide range of human experience. # There are typical genres that drama follows, which is similar to communications in human lives. # Drama is closely related to audiences, which shows the struggles of audiences and also provides suggestions. It is possible because Burke believes that Drama has recognizable genres. Humans use language in patterned discourses, and texts move us with recurring patterns underlying those texts.Brummett, B. (1993). Landmark Essays on Kenneth Burke (Vol. 2). Lawrence Erlbaum. And drama has certain audiences, which means rhetoric plays a crucial role when humans deal with experiences. Language strategies are central to Burke's dramatistic approach.  Assumptions  Because of the complexity and extension of Burke's thinking, it is difficult to label the ontology behind his theory. However, some basic assumptions can still be extracted to support the understanding of dramatism. # Some of what we do is motivated by animality and some of it by symbolicity. A human's purpose for drinking water is to satisfy thirst, which is an animal need; while the action of reading papers is influenced by symbols. Burke's position is that both animal nature and symbols motivate us. For him, of all the symbols, language is the most important. Barry Brummett shares a similar idea in his book Landmark Essays on Kenneth Burke, that \\"teeters between the realizations that some of what we do is motivated by animality and some of it by symbolicity (p. xii).\\" # When we use language, we are used by it as well. Burke held a concept of linguistic relativity similar to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Words set our concepts and opinions, which means people cannot see beyond what their words lead them to believe.Burke, K. (1965). Permanence and Change. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill. This assumption suggests that language exerts a determining influence over people,Melia, T. (1989). Scientism and Dramatism: Some Quasi-Mathematical Motifs in the Work of Kenneth Burke. The Legacy of Kenneth Burke, 55-73. which means meanwhile people's propositions are often restricted to be polarized by language, because some language cannot express much nuance of opinion. # We humans are choice makers. Agency is another key point of dramatism; \\"The essence of agency is choice.\\" Social actors have the ability of acting out of choices. Key concepts= 1. Dramatistic Pentad  Pentad = The dramatistic pentad is an instrument used as a set of relational or functional principles that could help us understand what he calls the 'cycle cluster of terms' people use to attribute motive. This pentad is a dissolution to drama. It is parallel with Aristotle's four causes and has a similar correlation to journalists' catechism: who, what, when, where, why, and how. This is done through the five key elements of human drama – act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. The Pentad is a simple tool for seeing and understanding the complexity of a situation. It reveals the nuances and complications of language as symbolic action, which in turn, opens up our perspective. 238x238px * Act: \\"What\\", what has done. According to Burke, \\"the act\\" of the Pentad is which \\"names what took place, in thought or deed.\\" * Scene: \\"When\\" and \\"Where\\". According to Burke, \\"the scene\\" is defined as \\"the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.\\" * Agent: \\"by Whom\\", who did it. Burke defines the \\"agent\\" as \\"what person or kind of person performed the act.\\" * Agency: \\"How\\", which is associated with methods and technologies. Burke defines the \\"agency\\" as \\"what instrument or instruments he used.\\" * Purpose: \\"Why\\", why it happened. This is associate with the motive behind the behavior, which is the main focus of the analysis. * Attitude: How to prepare for an act In the 1969 edition of Grammar, Burke added a new element, Attitude, thereby making the Pentad a Hexad.Anderson, F. D., & Althouse, M. T. (2010). Five fingers or six? Pentad or hexad. KB Journal, 6(2). Attitude means \\"the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act.\\"Burke, K., 1897. (1955). A grammar of motives. New York: George Braziller.  Pentad in action  David Ling used the Pentad elements to evaluate Senator Edward (Ted) Kennedy's now- infamous speech in 1969 to persuade the audiences to see him as a victim of his family curse instead of the one who should be responsible for an accident which caused death of Mary Jo Kopechne. From Kennedy's statement, Ling recognized several elements from the Pentad: Kennedy's response to the Chappaquiddick Incident: * Act: The failure to immediately report a fatal accident and its causes * Scene: The events surrounding Mary Jo Kopechne and the event's time in history * Agent: Senator Ted Kennedy * Agency: The method by which Kennedy eventually reported his involvement in the incident * Purpose: To fulfill legal and moral responsibilities * Attitude: The circumstances were out of Kennedy's control and his family history negatively contributed Kennedy denied his relationship with the dead woman, described his survival as a fate, and described the difficulty of rescuing the woman at the scene. He pivoted the fact and described it as a circumstance that he couldn't control. Ultimately, Kennedy escaped the incident with very little damage to his social and political capital as demonstrated by the continuation of his 40-year career in the U.S. Senate. These events were eventually adapted into John Curran's film Chappaquiddick in 2018. =Dramatistic ratios= Dramatistic ratios are the \\"proportions of one element relative to another in the Dramatism Pentad\\", which can be used to find the dominant element in the interaction. Any complete statement about motives will offer some kind of answers to the five questions above. While it is important to understand each element of the pentad on its own, it is more important to understand how the elements work together. This is called a ratio, and there are ten possible ratios within the Pentad. Burke maintained that analyzing the ratios of a speaker's presentation would expose the resources of ambiguity people might exploit to interpret complex problems. The most common ratios used by Burke are Scene-Act and Scene-Agent. When engaged in a dramatistic study, he notes, \\"the basic unit of action would be defined as 'the human body in conscious or purposive motion'\\", which is an agent acting in a situation. 2. Identification Identification is the basic function of sociality, using both positive and negative associations. When there is overlap between two people in terms of their substance, they have identification.West, T., & Turner, L. (2003). Introducing communication theory: analysis and application with powerweb. On the other hand, division is the lack of overlap between two people in matters of essence. According to Burke, identification is an inevitable, thus both beneficial and detrimental characteristic of language in human relations. Identification has the following features: = The chief notion of a \\"new rhetoric\\" = Examining Aristotle's principles of rhetoric, Burke points out that the definition of the \\"old rhetoric\\" is, in essence, persuasion.Burke, K. (1950). A rhetoric of motives. New York, 43. Correspondingly, Burke proposes a new rhetoric, which discusses several issues, but mainly focuses on the notion of identification. In comparison with \\"old\\" rhetoric, which stresses on deliberate design, \\"new\\" rhetoric may include partially \\"unconscious\\" factors in its appeal. Burke's concept of new rhetoric has also been expanded in various academic disciplines. For example, in 2015 philosophers Rutten & Soetaert used the new rhetoric concept to study changing attitudes in regards to education as a way to better understand if Burke's ideas can be applied to this arena. Burke's new rhetoric has also been used to understand the women's equality movement, specifically in regards to the education of women and sharing of knowledge through print media. Academic Amlong deconstructed print medias of the 1800s addressing human rights as an aspect of educating women about the women's rights movement. = Generated when two people's substances overlap = Burke asserts that all things have substance, which he defines as the general nature of something. Identification is a recognized common ground between two people's substances, regarding physical characteristics, talents, occupation, experiences, personality, beliefs, and attitudes. The more substance two people share, the greater the identification. It is used to overcome human division. = Can be falsified to result in homophily = Sometimes the speaker tries to falsely identify with the audience, which results in homophily for the audience. Homophily is the perceived similarity between speaker and listener. The so-called \\"I\\" is merely a unique combination of potentially conflicting corporate \\"we's\\". For example, the use of the people rather than the worker would more clearly tap into the lower middle-class values of the audience the movement was trying to reach. = Reflects ambiguities of substance = Burke recognizes that identification rests on both unity and division, since no one's substance can completely overlap with others. Individuals are \\"both joined and separated\\". Humans can unite on certain aspects of substance but at the same time remain unique, which is labeled as \\"ambiguities\\". Identification can be increased by the process of consubstantiation, which refers to bridging divisions between two people. Rhetoric is needed in this process to build unity.  3. Guilt and redemption  According to Burke, guilt redemption is considered the plot of all human drama, or the root of all rhetoric. He defined the \\"guilt\\" as \\"the theological doctrine of Original Sin\\". As cited in Littlejohn, Burke sees guilt as \\"all-purpose word for any feeling of tension within a person—anxiety, embarrassment, self-hatred, disgust and the like.\\" In this perspective, Burke concluded that the ultimate motivation of man is to purge oneself of one's sense of guilt through public speaking. The term guilt covers tension, anxiety, shame, disgust, embarrassment, and other similar feelings. Guilt serves as a motivating factor that drives the human drama. Burke's cycle refers to the process of feeling guilt and attempting to reduce it, which follows a predictable pattern: order (or hierarchy), the negative, victimage (scapegoat or mortification), and redemption. = Order or hierarchy = Society is a dramatic process in which hierarchy forms structure through power relationships. The structure of social hierarchy considered in terms of the communication of superiority, inferiority and equality.Duncan, H. D. (1968). Communication and social order. Transaction Books. The hierarchy is created through language use, which enables people to create categories. Individuals feel guilt as a result of their place in the hierarchy.West, R., & Turner, L. Introducing communication theory. 2009. = The negative = The negative comes into play when people see their place in the social order and seek to reject it. Saying no to the existing order is both a function of our language abilities and evidence of humans as choice makers. Burke coined the phrase \\"rotten with perfection\\", which means that because our symbols allow us to imagine perfection, we always feel guilty about the difference between the reality and the perfection.Burke, K. (1966). Language as symbolic action: Essays on life, literature and method. University of California Press. = Victimage = Victimage is the way that we try to redeem the guilt. There are two ways of victimage. The way of turning the guilt into ourselves is called mortification. It is engaged when we apologize or blame ourselves when facing the wrongdoing; the way of turning the guilt to external parties is called scapegoating. According to Burke, there are two different types of scapegoating, universal and fractional. In universal scapegoating, the speaker blames everyone for the problem, so the audience associates and even feels sorry for the victim, because it includes themselves. In fractional scapegoating, the speaker blames a specific group or a specific person for their problems. This creates a division within the audience. The victim, whoever it may be, is vilified, or made up to violate the ideals of social order, like normalcy or decency. As a result, people who take action against the villains become heroized because they are confronting evil. = Redemption = This is a confession of guilt by the speaker and a request for forgiveness. Normally, these people are sentenced to a certain punishment so they can reflect and realize their sins. This punishment is specifically a kind of \\"death\\", literally or figuratively. Many speakers experience a combination of these two guilt-purging options. The ongoing cycle starts with order. The order is the status quo, where everything is right with the world. Then pollution disrupts the order. The pollution is the guilt or sin. Then casuistic stretching allows the guilt to be accepted into the world. Next, is the guilt, which is the effect of the pollution. After that, is victimage or mortification which purges the guilt. Finally comes transcendence which is new order, the now status quo.  Other application fields  Dramatism provides us a new way to understand people. Burke's goal is to explain the whole of human experience with symbolic interaction. Though Dramatism has some clear hindrances (addressed in Critiques), many still argue that Kenneth Burke and his theories are \\"still worth reading.\\" Oratory and how and what people say continue to drive daily life continuing the usefulness of dramatistic analysis in a variety of fields.  Communication and public relations  * Rempel Denise applies Dramatism to explore the social networking site MySpace.Rempel, D. (2008). An exploration of the social networking site MySpace using kenneth burke's theory of dramatism She analyzed the architecture of MySpace, the identity presentation of users and the audience reception and finds out that legitimate communication is impossible, and consequently, cannot lead the users to act consubstantially. * Another example of applying Dramatism guilt redemption cycle elements in communication field, is the communication crisis of Donald Sterling's scandal. Donald Sterling was the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers professional basketball franchise of the National Basketball Association. A leaking private conversation provoked his racist and disparaging statement on African Americans. As Billings, the author of The Dramatistic Implications of Burke's Guilt Redemption Cycle in the Donald Sterling Communication Crisis recognized and analyzed, that Sterlings act of trying to redeem his guilt was failed because of insufficient scapegoat. * The fundamentals of public relations, much to Burke's dismay, are very closely related to the key concept of Identification within Dramatism theory. The ability to recognize common ground between a speaker and his audience is vital in achieving effective persuasion and the ability to shift a particular narrative or \\"drama.\\"  Culture  * Gregory Clark addressed the Pentad to look into the sharing places in the United States.Clark,G., & Benson, T. W. (2004). Rhetorical Landscapes in America: Variations on a Theme from Kenneth Burke. Columbia, SC: U of South Carolina P. He concluded that tourism sites, which work as the scene in Pentad, have the tendency to differentiate American people from other culture and therefore established a sense of national identity in terms of a common culture.  English  * Burke's technical term for drama representative anecdote indicates that the compositionist's adage gives appropriate examples covers the case adequately. Winterowd suggests writers should present ideas dramatistically, not relying on argument and demonstration alone but grounding their abstractions in the concreteness of what being called as representative anecdotes. Representative anecdote means conceptual pivot and is equated with a family of terms: enthymeme, thesis, topic sentence, theme. The representative anecdote, can be either support or conceptual pivot, and in the case of drama is both support and conceptual pivot.  Healthcare, therapy, and social work  * In 2014, a methadone maintenance treatment center in Copenhagen applied Dramatism to staff member feedback in order to address their varying degrees of ethical concerns in regards to the center's practices and policies. This treatment center chose Dramatism as a guide because they understood that their staff are all driven by different motives and act and react differently based on their personal history and specific context within the treatment facility. The opportunity to discuss these differences helped staff members, who otherwise do not have any input, understand the driving forces behind the policies set by the center with hopes that understanding made them more effective and knowledgeable practitioners. * Educational researcher at Ghent University, Kris Rutten chose to apply a dramatistic lens to Ralph McLean's cult film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest because of its relevance to mental health and \\"disability treatment\\" to teach his social work students how to approach varying levels of ambiguity in their future practice. This application focused heavily on the dramatistic ratios of the Pentad elements to highlight various hierarchies and power structures showcased in the film's fictional mental health facility and the actions and reactions of the facility staff and patients. In essence, Rutten uses this example to offer \\"a perspective about perspectives\\" that ultimately prepare his students of social work for their future in other clinical settings.  Politics  * David Ling uses the pentad to analyze Senator Edward Ted Kennedy's address to the people of Massachusetts after the Chappaquiddick Incident. He regards the events surrounding the death of Miss Kopechne as the scene, Kennedy himself as the agent, Kennedy's failure to report the accident in time as act, methods to report as agency, and finds out that the purpose for Kennedy is to fulfill his legal and moral duty. * Another example of dramatism in politics is the use of Burke's rhetorical interpretations as a tool to understand presentations of terrorism in media. Researchers Gurrionero and Canel highlight the use of Burke's understanding of motives and identification within the context of the media's framing of terrorist attacks, saying that the words and symbols used are with specific motives to frame the pentad into the voice that benefits the media and viewers at the expense of the acclaimed terrorists.  Popular art  * Dwight Macdonald and Ernest Van Den Haag views that popular (or \\"mass\\"-) culture functions not as Scene, as one might ordinarily expect, but as Agency. \\"Masscult\\" itself is the force involved in the Act of brainwashing the public into accepting lower standards of art. This Act is accomplished with the \\"Sub- Agency\\" of modern electronic technology, the mass media.Kimberling, C. R. (1982). Kenneth Burke's dramatism and popular arts. Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Popular Press  Scientific research  * As ethical concerns continue to move to the forefront of research concerns, Warren Bowen dedicated his doctoral thesis exploring the widely held acceptance that Burke's Pentad applies only to humans. Bowen begs the question, 'what happens when animals are the scene of a particular issue?'. Much of the research using animal testing fails to hold animal interests at the same level as their human counterparts, therefore ignoring some of the non-verbal cues or other symbolic feedback that would otherwise indicate distress. The scene:agent ratio here is clearly skewed. Ultimately Bowen shines a light on the extremely subjective nature of the Pentad and the power that humans hold over other beings that do not communicate in the same way.  Sociology  * Some researchers, such as Robert Wade Kenny, addressed the use of the Pentad and Dramatism to look into the field of sociology. As Kenny states, that the pentad can be used to examine sociology because, \\"sociology is predicated on the notion that human action is neither random nor mystical, and this sets up the initial condition necessary for an inquiry into the motivating principles that give rise to social order and disorder.\\" He stated that sociology is a study of human action, human behavior and lifeworld \\"must be in play\\", and the behaviors are motivated, so the dramatism elements can be applied to sociology field.  Critiques  Burke's dramatism has been a great contribution to the communication field, which is praised by many researchers in this area. Chesebro commented on Burke's work that \\"few critics have revealed the scope, imagination, insights, and dazzling concern for symbol using which Kenneth Burke possesses (Chesebro, 1993, p. xii)\\". The New York Times described Burke as a leading critic in the US, stating that Burke is recognized \\"as a major influence on critics like Harold Bloom and writers like Ralph Ellison\\". Burke's work is widely praised and has influenced a significant number of researchers as well as students in the communication field. There have been, however, criticisms of his work. Some of the most obvious being in regard to Burke's overall negative approach to interpersonal relationships. Within the Modern Rhetorical Criticism text, authors Hart, Saughton, and Lavally argue that Burke \\" look[ed] to the inevitable divisions among people and between people and their personal goals\\" when in reality relationships operate in the gray. Charles Kneupper also comments that \\"I would concur that has been limitations in the application of dramatistic theory...\\" The theory can be examined by four criteria below. * Scope The theory of Dramatism is criticized for being too broad in scope because it aims to explain how humans interact with each other using symbols, which has been described as a general explanation that almost has no meaning as some critics believe. * Parsimony Relatedly, some critique Burke’s theory as lacking parsimony, meaning it is unclear and too large to be useful. * Utility Other theorists argue that Dramatism lacks utility because it leaves out topics of gender and culture. Notably, Burke included women in his theory (unlike much of scholarship at the time), but feminist scholars, like Condit, found Burke's concepts inadequate to their critical concerns,Japp, P. M. (1999). 'Can This Marriage Be Saved?': Reclaiming Burke for Feminist Scholarship. In B. i. Brock (Ed.) , Kenneth Burke and the 21st Century (pp. 113-130). Albany, NY: State U of New York P. by using the generic \\"man\\" to represent all people. Dennis Brissett and Charles Edgley examine the utility of dramatism on different levels, which can be categorized as the following dimensions:Brissett, D., & Edgley, C. (Eds.). (2005). Life as theater: A dramaturgical sourcebook. Transaction Books. 1. The dramaturgical self Dramaturgical perspective is vividly used to analyze human individuality. It views individuality as more a social rather than a psychological phenomenon. The concept of a dramaturgical self as formulated by sociologist Erving Goffman was inspired by the theatre, and also finds roots in relations to Burke's work. Specifically, the concept of dramaturgy ideates life as a metaphorical theater, differentiating from Burke's concept of life as a theater itself. Some examples of classic research questions on the topic involve how people maximize or minimize the expressiveness, how one stage ideal self, the process of impression-management, etc. For example, Larson and Zemke described the roots of the ideation and patterning of temporal socialization which is drawn from biological rhythms, values and beliefs, work and social commitments, cultural beliefs and engagement in activity. 2. Motivation and drama Motives play a crucial role in social interaction between an acting person and his or her validating audience. Within the dramaturgical frame, people are rationalizing. Scholars try to provide a way of understanding how the various identities which comprise the self are constructed. For example, Anderson and Swainson tried to find the answer of whether rape is motivated by sex or by power. Social relationships as drama Dramatists also concern the ways in which people both facilitate and interfere with the ongoing behavior of others. The emphasis is on the expressive nature of the social bond. Some topics as role taking, role distance are discussed. For example, by analyzing public address, scholars examine why a speaker selects a certain strategy to identify with audience. For example, Orville Gilbert Brim, Jr. analyzed data to interpret how group structure and role learning influence children's understanding of gender. 3. Organizational dramas In addition to focusing on the negotiated nature of social organization, dramaturgy emphasizes the manner in which the social order is expressed through social interaction, how social organization is enacted, featured and dramatized. Typical research topics include corporate realm, business influence on federal policy agenda, even funerals and religious themes. For example, by examining the decision making criteria of Business Angels, Baron and Marksman identified four social skills which contribute to entrepreneurial success: social perception; persuasion and social influence; social adaptability and impression management. They employ dramatism to show how these skills are critical in raising finance. 4. Political dramas It is acknowledged that the political process has become more and more a theatrical, image-mongering, dramatic spectacle worthy of a show-business metaphor on a grand scale. Scholars study how dramaturgical materials create essential images by analyzing political advertising and campaigns, stagecraft-like diplomacy, etc. For example, Philip.E.Tetlock tried to answer why presidents became more complex in their thinking after winning the campaign. He found the reason is not presidents' own cognitive adjustment, but a means of impression management.  5. Feminist critiques  Feminist scholars also talked about our ability as a society to begin to think in new ways about sex and gender, to extent our language beyond duality to a broad \\"humanity\\" and to \\"human beings\\". Since \\"being\\" is a state in which women simply experience life as freely, consciously, and fully as possible, realizing that this is not only the purpose of life but a genuine place from which change can occur.Foss, K. A., & White, C. L. (1999). 'Being' and the Promise of Trinity: A Feminist Addition to Burke's Theory of Dramatism. In B. i. Brock (Ed.) , Kenneth Burke and the 21st Century (pp. 99-111). Albany, NY: State U of New York P. Condit also went on to criticize Burke for assuming culture as a hegemony, specifically in relation to Burke's application of guilt purging within cultures as necessitating victims. Later scholars, such as Anne Caroline Crenshaw, went on to note that Burke did identify gender relations in one instance in relation to his arguments on social hierarchies through his analysis of socio-sexual relations present in Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis. However, this author notes that Burke's work wasn't a critique and examination of this relationship through dramatism, but the theory of dramatism does give space to make such analyses. Furthermore, scholar Brenda Robinson Hancock used Burke's dramatism to study women's movements, specifically with identification as actors. Another scholar, Janet Brown, made use of Burke's pentad in relation to understanding and identifications of feminist literature. Despite these works and incorporation of dramatism in feminist work, there remains the evidence that Burke did not use or intend his theory to account for gender.  6. Metaphorical or literal?  Another critique of the theory is to whether the theory exists as a metaphorical or literal theory. Burke staunchly argued that his theory of dramatism is a literal theory, understanding reality as a literal stage with actors and enactment. However, future theorists, specifically Bernard Brock and Herb Simons, went on to argue dramatism as metaphorical theory claiming that Burke's idea that all the world's a stage is mere a tool of symbolic interaction that signals life as a drama. Of note, the reasoning for Burke to emphasize his theory as literal relates to the reasons to why others claim it to be metaphorical: the issue lies in the understanding of language's power as a symbol itself.

It breeds from northwestern Mexico to western Ecuador, Bolivia and southeastern Brazil, and on Trinidad.  Description  Sacha Lodge - Ecuador The bright-rumped attila is a large tyrant flycatcher with a big head, hooked and slightly upturned bill and upright stance. It is 7 in (18 cm) long and weighs 1.4 oz (40 g). The head is olive-green streaked with black, the back is chestnut or olive, the rump bright yellow and the tail brown. The wings are dark brown with two pale wing bars and paler feather edging. The whitish or yellow throat and yellow breast are variably streaked darker. The belly is white becoming yellow near the tail. The iris is red. The sexes are similar, but young birds have a cinnamon-fringed crown and brown eyes. The plumage is very variable, but the streaking below and obvious wingbars help in distinguishing this species from others in the genus. The calls include a loud beat-it, beat-it and a plaintive ooo weery weery weery weery woo. It does not move when singing, so can be difficult to see. Chan Chich Lodge area -Belize Chan Chich Lodge area - Belize  Ecology  Central American birds have slightly different song structures and also tend towards lighter ochre plumage independent of Gloger's Rule; they are sometimes separated as flammulated attila (Attila flammulatus) . Their characteristic song given at dawn has been analyzed in detail: it has a very variable number of weerys which may become weery'os, and often ends in a woo- whit; a finite state machine has been developed to simulate this structure.Leger (2005) However, due to the highly variable songs more data is required before the technically plausible split can be accepted; the AOU has so far refrained from formally acknowledging it. The bright-rumped attila is a common bird from the lowlands to 7,000 ft (2,100 m) ASL. It occurs in forests, second growth, pasture and plantations with trees, and shady gardens, and apparently it can tolerate a considerable amount of habitat destruction.Salaman et al. (2002) It is an active, aggressive and noisy species, usually seen alone. It eats insects, spiders, frogs and lizards taken from vegetation or the ground. It will pursue prey on foot as well as attacking in short sallies, and will follow army ant columns. It also takes many fruits (such as from gumbo-limbo Bursera simaruba, and less frequently from Cymbopetalum mayanum)Foster (2007) and seeds. The nest is a deep cup of mosses, leaves and plant fibre; it may be built usually below 3m high amongst epiphyte, between buttress roots or in a bank, not necessarily in the forest. The typical clutch is two lilac- or rufous-marked dull white or pink eggs. Incubation by the female is 14–15 days to hatching, with another 17 days to fledging.

He also painted a number of single and family portraits. Life Abraham Willaerts was born in Utrecht, the son of the painter Adam Willaerts. He trained with his father, a marine painter. He later studied with the Utrecht Caravaggist Jan van Bijlert in Utrecht.Abraham Willaerts Biography at Richard Green He became a member of the Utrecht Guild of Saint Luke in 1624. He travelled to Paris in 1628 where he worked in the workshop of the prominent religious and history painter Simon Vouet. He returned to his home country in 1635. Portrait of a shipowner's family On 1637 or 1638 Willaerts sailed to Brazil serving in the entourage of Count John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil. In 1641 the Count sent him with the Dutch fleet from Brazil to Angola (where the Dutch had just taken São Paulo de Loanda and the island of Tomé) on a mission to observe the customs and manners of the indigenous people. He had returned to the Netherlands in 1644, where he stayed with the prominent architect and painter Jacob van Campen at his castle Randenbroeck near Amersfoort.About Abraham Willaerts at Jean Moust In 1659-60 he visited Rome.Margarita Russell. \\"Willaerts.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 2 May. 2016 Here he joined the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Abraham Willaerts was reportedly given the bent name 'Indian'. This nickname was likely given him because of his travels among the Brazilian tribes. He probably travelled further south to Naples, where he may have found inspiration for his imaginary views of Mediterranean ports. He died in Utrecht. His brother Isaac was also a marine painter.A Spanish Three-Decker at Anchor off Naples at the National Maritime Museum Work Although mainly a marine painter, Willaerts also painted portraits. A French galley and Dutch men-of-war off a port His marine paintings closely follow those of his father as is seen in his Ships near a rocky shore (1647, Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem). He preferred compositions with an atmospheric softness. In addition to Dutch harbour and coastal scenes, he also painted Mediterranean harbour views (real and imaginary), such as the Harbour of Naples (National Maritime Museum, London). Despite Willaerts' six- year stay in Brazil and in Angola his compositions never treated specifically Brazilian or African subjects. Willaerts painted a series of portraits, both of single figures (several were admirals) and family groups. He also added portraits in the foreground of some of his father's harbour scenes. Willaerts also collaborated with the still life painter Willem Ormea on a Fish still life with stormy sea which combines a seascape with a still life of fish in the foreground.Fish still life with stormy sea at Lempertz NotesExternal links * 1600s births 1669 deaths Artists from Utrecht Dutch Golden Age painters Dutch male painters Dutch marine artists Members of the Utrecht Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Abraham Willaerts"},{"id":"6289187","text":"Horacio Casarín Garcilazo (25 May 1918 – 10 April 2005) was a Mexican football player and coach who established himself as one of his country's most popular sports figures in the 1940s and 1950s. A symbol for Atlante, the team Casarín served for the majority of his career, the skilled forward also played for Necaxa, Leon, Asturias, Club América, Real España, CF Monterrey and Zacatepec in his country, as well as FC Barcelona in Spain and the Selección de fútbol de México (Mexico national team). Playing career=Club At age 17, Casarín debuted for Necaxa. Over the course of his career in Mexico, Casarín scored 236 goals at the amateur and professional levels (the Mexican League was founded in the early 1940s) and represented his country at the 1950 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil and scored a goal during the run of the tournament. A well-known anecdote involving Casarín takes place during a 1939 game between Casarin's Necaxa, and Asturias. After scoring a goal in the first few minutes of the game, defenders sought out Casarín and fouled him mercilessly, until the goalscorer was forced to abandon the pitch after only twenty minutes had gone by. The game ended in a 2–2 draw, but outraged Necaxa fans expressed their ire by burning Asturia's wooden stadium. With Atlante, Casarín scored 95 goals and helped the Potros win the 1946–47 season championship, while cementing his popularity by acting in the football-themed movie, \\"The sons of Don Venacio\\". Word of Casarín's role in the film spread, and the movie became a box-office success in Mexico. Casarín played his last game as a professional on 18 November 1956, scoring a goal for CF Monterrey. He scored 174 goals in the Primera División during his career. International He scored 15 goals for Mexico between 1937 and 1956.Appearances for Mexico National Team - RSSSF Managerial career As a coach, Casarín's biggest achievement was coaching the Mexican U-20 national football team to a second-place finish in the inaugural FIFA U-20 World Cup in Tunisia in 1977.

Fuller Jr. (born March 5, 1939) is an American playwright, best known for his play A Soldier's Play, for which he received the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Early years Fuller was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1939, the son of Charles H. Fuller, Sr. and Lillian Anderson. He attended Roman Catholic High School and then Villanova University (1956–1958), then joined the U.S. Army in 1959, serving in Japan and South Korea. He left the military in 1962, and later studied at La Salle University (1965–1967), earning a DFA. He co-founded the Afro-American Arts Theatre Philadelphia Career Fuller vowed to become a writer after noticing that his high school's library had no books by African American authors. He achieved critical notice in 1969 with The Village: A Party, a drama about racial tensions between a group of mixed-race couples. He later wrote plays for the Henry Street Settlement theatre and the Negro Ensemble Company in New York, who have performed several of his plays. His 1975 play The Brownsville Raid is based on the Brownsville Affair, an altercation between black soldiers and white civilians in Brownsville, Texas, in 1906, which led to an entire black regiment being dishonorably discharged though later pardoned in 1976. He won an Obie Award for Zooman and The Sign in 1980, about a black Philadelphia teen who kills a young girl on her own front porch, and whose neighbors eventually rise up against him after being goaded out of their apathy by the girl's father with a sign. Zooman presents himself as a helpless product of his society, but his victim's father convinces their neighbors that they need to stand together and achieve justice. His next work, A Soldier's Play, told the story of the racially charged search by a black captain for the murderer of a black sergeant on a Louisiana army base in 1944, as a means to discuss the position of blacks in white society. Although the play enjoyed a long run, Fuller has said it never played on Broadway because he refused to drop the last line, \\"You'll have to get used to Black people being in charge.\\" It nevertheless was a critical success, winning Fuller a Pulitzer in 1982, and being produced as the 1984 film A Soldier's Story, for which Fuller himself wrote the screen adaptation. His screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award, and it won an Edgar Award. After this play, Fuller switched his focus to movies for several years, saying \\"I always wanted to reach the most people with my work. Not enough people go to the theater.\\" He has since written other works for the stage, but they have not been critically acclaimed. Of his methods for advancing the African-American cause, Fuller said in a 1982 interview, \\"My argument is on the stage. I don't have to be angry. O.K.? I get it all out right up there. There's no reason to carry this down from the stage and into the seats. And it does not mean that I am not enraged at injustice or prejudice or bigotry. It simply means that I cannot be enraged all the time. To spend one's life being angry, and in the process doing nothing to change it, is to me ridiculous. I could be mad all day long, but if I'm not doing a damn thing, what difference does it make?\\" Fuller has received grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, Guggenheim Foundation, State of New York and the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also written short fiction and screenplays, and worked as a movie producer. In 2010 he published his first novel, Snatch: The Adventures of David and Me, a work of children's fiction written for his two sons. He is a member of the Writers Guild of America, East.

The campus is located in Santa Fe Springs approximately east of downtown Los Angeles. It was named after St. Paul the Apostle.  History  St. Paul began in the fall of 1956 during a decade in which Cardinal James Francis McIntyre opened an astonishing 24 Catholic high schools. It was known then as Santa Fe Catholic High School, located in two classrooms at St. Marianne School in Pico Rivera, with 100 freshmen from the surrounding Whittier area parishes. The staff consisted of: School Sister of Notre Dame Michael Marie (principal), Franciscan Brother Martin, and Dominican Sister Siena. It is said that a Disney came to the school and told a student to build his dreams up. In 1989 George Lopez also came to the school to give a speech to a class. In 1957, the school name was changed to St. Paul to avoid confusion with the recently opened local public high school named Santa Fe. In January 1958, St. Paul High School moved to its present location on Greenleaf Avenue with a student body of 325 freshmen and sophomores. The first class graduated in May 1960. Since its beginning, St. Paul has been staffed by members of the Order of St. Francis, clergy from the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and, at various times, members of eight different religious congregations. For the past 50 years, there have always been at least one Franciscan Brother on the faculty. The majority of the teaching faculty is made up of lay men and women. Today St. Paul High School has an enrollment of nearly 500 students. Football The longtime head football coach of the St. Paul Swordsmen was Marijon Ancich. In 1959, after college, Ancich started as an assistant coach. After being named head coach two years later, he went on to coach from 1961 to 1981 and again from 1993 to 2005, before returning for a third stint in 2009. He is the second winningest high school football coach in California history with a record of 344-123-4, as of the 2008 high school football season. In his long career, Ancich's teams won three CIF titles ('68,'72,'81), two California State titles and 19 league championships. Elijah Asante was hired in 2012 and was fired six games into the season with a record of 1-5. Athletic Director Casey Morales served as interim head coach to finish the season. Rick Zepeda was hired on December 20, 2012. Former Principal Lori Barr On 29 June 2012, former St. Paul Principal Lori Barr was sentenced to 180 days in Los Angeles County jail for charging more than $64,000 on her school-issued American Express charge card. Barr served as principal from July 2008 to May 2010. Barr was accused of using the school's card for her own personal expenses including hotel stays, meals, personal travel and salon visits. Barr pleaded no contest to the charges and has since repaid the debt.

History A comprehensive history of the College, The Year of the Jubilee, was compiled and written in 2000 by J.T. Mercer and Robert Duncan. Most of the information written here is taken from that history. The College opened in 1946. The first laboratories were housed in Hardman Hall, which had previously been used as a livestock judging pavilion and later as a Navy warehouse. The school graduated its first class of 44 students in 1950, the year it was accredited. In 1951, the vet school's first permanent building was opened to house the school and clinics. In 1970, the Board of Regents approved a name change from the School of Veterinary Medicine to the College of Veterinary Medicine, reflecting the expansion of the College's graduate, research and service programs. Construction on a new wing for The Institute of Comparative Medicine (ICM) began in 1971. The Athens Diagnostic Laboratory opened in two small rooms on the first floor of the College in July 1972, and later that year, the building that now houses the Community Practice Clinic also was built. The current Teaching Hospital building was completed for occupation in 1979. The state-of-the-art Animal Health Research Center was completed in 2006. $7.7 million in planning funds for a new Veterinary Medical Learning Center (which will include a new, expanded teaching hospital facility) were approved by the Georgia General Assembly in April 2010 (Athens Banner-Herald, May 2, 2010). The College's inaugural Veterinary Conference was held in May 1964, and the College's 51st consecutive Annual Conference and Alumni Reunion will be held on March 28-29, 2014.

Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films. McFarland and Co., Inc. is a 1968 black-and-white Japanese horror film, directed by Kaneto Shindo, and an adaptation of a supernatural folktale. Set during a civil war in Japan's Heian period, the spirits of a woman and her daughter-in-law seek revenge after losing their lives to a brutal incident. The film was made in black and white, Toho Scope format, and was not dubbed in English. It was shown subtitled only in the US in 1968.  Plot  Yone (Nobuko Otowa) and her daughter-in-law Shige (Kiwako Taichi), who live in a house in a bamboo grove, are raped and murdered by soldiers, and their house is burned down. A black cat appears, licking at the bodies. The women return as ghosts with the appearance of fine ladies, who wait at Rajōmon. They find a troop of samurai and bring them to an illusory mansion in the bamboo grove where the burnt-out house was. They seduce and then kill the samurai like cats, tearing their throats with their teeth. Meanwhile, in northern Japan a battle is taking place with the Emishi. A young man, Hachi (Nakamura Kichiemon II), fortuitously kills the enemy general, Kumasunehiko. He brings the severed head to show the governor, Minamoto no Raikō (Kei Satō). He lies that he fought the general under the name Gintoki. He is made a samurai in acknowledgement of his achievement. When he goes looking for his mother and wife, he finds their house burned down and the women missing. Raikō tells Gintoki to find and destroy the ghosts who are killing the samurai. Gintoki encounters the two women and realizes that they are Yone (his mother) and Shige (his wife). They have made a pact with the underworld to return and kill samurai in revenge for their deaths. Because Gintoki has become a samurai, by their pact they must kill him, but Shige breaks her pledge to spend seven nights of love with Gintoki. Then, because she has broken the pact, Shige is condemned to the underworld. Gintoki lies to Raikō that he has destroyed one of the ghosts. Gintoki encounters his spectral mother again at Rajōmon trying to seduce samurai. After seeing her reflection as a ghost in a pool of water, he attacks her with his sword, cutting off her arm, which takes on the appearance of a cat's leg. Gintoki brings the leg to Raikō, claiming it is evidence that he has killed the second ghost. Raikō is pleased and says Gintoki will be remembered as a hero, but first orders him to complete seven days of ritual purification. During the purification, Gintoki is visited by Yone, who gets inside the chamber by claiming to be a seer sent by the emperor to ward off evil spirits. She tricks Gintoki into giving her the leg, then she flies through the ceiling and disappears into the sky. Distraught and disheveled, Gintoki staggers through the woods to the cottage where he met the ghosts, where he then collapses. The walls disappear around him, revealing the charred remains of his family home where Shige and Yone were murdered. Snow falls and covers his body as a cat is heard meowing in the distance.  Themes  Yūsuke Suzumura of Hosei University has speculated that the film's title was deliberately intended to allude to the Ryūnosuke Akutagawa story In a Grove (Yabu no naka in Japanese), as well as Akira Kurosawa's film version of the story. Although the Japanese title literally means \\"a black cat in a bamboo grove\\", the phrase yabu no naka in Japanese is also used idiomatically to refer to a mystery that is difficult to unravel. Suzumura also identified the legends of Minamoto no Raikō as an influence on the film: since Raikō himself appears in the film, it is likely that the film's protagonist's name is a reference to the name of Raikō's legendary follower .  Cast  * Kichiemon Nakamura as Gintoki * Nobuko Otowa as the Mother * Kiwako Taichi as Shige * Kei Satō as Raiko * Hideo Kanze the Mikado * Taiji Tonoyama as the farmer * Yoshinobu Ogawa as Raiko follower * Rokko Toura as a warlord Release Kuroneko was released theatrically in Japan on February 24, 1968 where it was distributed by Toho. It was released in the United States by Toho International with English subtitles on July 1968. It was placed in competition at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the events of May 1968 in France. Critical reception In Japan the film won two awards from the Mainichi Film Concours. Nobuko Otowa won the award for Best Actress for her work in Kuroneko and Operation Negligee, and Kiyomi Kuroda won the award for Best Cinematography for this and Operation Negligee. Tom Milne of the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film \\"Much less extravgant than Shindo's earlier excusion into ghostly horrors with Onibaba\\" and that the film was \\"more of a mood piece.\\" The review concluded that the film \\"has a sufficiently ingenious story to remain enjoyable throughout, and it sporadically discovers moments of genuinely bizarre invention\\" From retrospective reviews, Manohla Dargis describes it as \\"a ghost story that’s more eerie than unnerving, and often hauntingly lovely\\". Maitland McDonagh writes that it is \\"darkly seductive\\" and \\"sleek, hair-raisingly graceful, and ready to take its place alongside the other landmarks of Japanese horror history\\".

The Fort Hoskins Site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The post was begun in 1856 on the Luckiamute River under the supervision of then Captain Christopher C. Augur.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. Fort Hoskins was finished in 1857 with then-lieutenant Philip Sheridan in charge, and was named after Lt. Charles Hoskins, who had died in the Mexican–American War. The fort was located about 19 miles northwest of Corvallis. The community of Hoskins took its name from the fort. Fort Hoskins was garrisoned by a number of companies of soldiers throughout its short existence, and future Union Civil War Generals Christopher Columbus Augur and Phil Sheridan were stationed there. Captain Augur was assigned to Fort Hoskins as its first post commander from 25 July 1856 to 2 July 1861 and added to the records of life at the fort where he and his growing family became the first occupants of their newly constructed residence on Fort Hoskin's \\"Officer's Row.\\" 2nd Lt. Phil Sheridan oversaw the construction of Fort Hoskins during this period. Two soldiers who were stationed at the fort during the American Civil War kept journals of their experiences: Royal A. Bensell and William M. Hilleary. Their accounts are of unmitigated boredom and dampness, but they provide a good picture of 19th-century life in the area. Fort Hoskins played an indirectly important role in local and state history because of the leadership of several out-of-state soldiers who decided to stay in the area after they were mustered out of the army. Several placenames in the area, such as Kings Valley, are connected with these soldiers. The fort never saw any action, though a bloodless insurrection by the natives at Yaquina Bay was put down by the soldiers. After the Civil War ended it was discovered that Fort Hoskins had been an outpost of interest to the former Confederate government. Fort Hoskins was abandoned in 1865. Archeological site The site of the fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 2002, Benton County has opened the site as Fort Hoskins Historical Park.Fort Hoskins Historical Park In 2012, the fort commander's house was moved back to its original site at Fort Hoskins from nearby Pedee, where it had been moved after the fort was closed. In 2015 Benton County approved funds for an exterior restoration of the house.

Archaeological site Excavations were led by archaeologists Thomas C. Patterson and Edward P. Lanning in 1963 and 1966, who noticed three cultural assemblages in the Chillón valley and uncovered large quantities of debris of lithic artifact production, initially interpreted as lithic instruments (hand axes, spearheads, scrapers, etc.). An area of coastal lomas (areas of fog vegetation), excavations revealed a lithic flake industry as early as the Late Pleistocene, dating between 9,000 and 11,000 years ago. Wood fragments helped define a Chivateros I period of 9500-8000 BC. There is also a red zone with some flint chips which, by comparison of artifacts of the nearby Oquendo workshop, dates to pre-10,500 BC. The whole industry is characterized by burins and bifaces with the upper-level (Chinateros II) containing long, keeled, leaf-shaped projectile points which resemble points from both Lauricocha II and El Jobo. Dating has been aided by the deposition of both loess and salt crust layers which suggest alternating dryness and humidity and which can be synchronized with glacial activity in the Northern Hemisphere. For a long time it was mistakenly regarded as the greatest lithic workshop in Peru, when in reality it is a large area of canteo, that is to say, a place or quarry where groups of hunter-gatherers paijanenses were supplied with raw materials of the place, in order to make pedunculated tips, known as tips paijanenses or tips Paiján. Popularly the old inhabitant of this area has been called as the Chivateros man. Exploration of the site's vicinity, the area near the mouth of the Chillon River and the desert around Ancon, revealed a large settlement complex of ancient hunter-gatherers near the quarries and quarry workshop. Among them are Cerro Chivateros, Cerro Oquendo and La Pampilla. The stratigraphic sequence: * Red Zone (12,000 - 10,500 BC) * Oquendo (10,500 - 9,500 BC) * Chivateros I (9,500 - 8,000 BC) * Chivateros II (8,000 - 6,000 BC) Chivateros was dated by samples of non-carbonized wood associated with the final phase of Chivateros I. Subsequent surveys of French archaeologist Claude Chauchat, in the 1970s, came up with the finding similar sites Chivateros in Cupisnique, managing associate with workshops stemmed points of Paijanense with a dating going back to the eighth millennium BC Later works have It is possible to know that sites on the north coast, of the Chivateros type, date back to the tenth millennium BC. It is a quarry Chivateros was initially defined as a gigantic lithic workshop of the Paleolithic. They identified these lithic pieces, made of quartzite, like knives, scrapers, arrowheads and hand axes. Moreover, they established a factual differentiation between what they called Chivateros I and Chivateros II, establishing equivalents in other points of America. Thanks to the works of Chauchat in Cupisnique and Chicama, this interpretation has already been overcome. This archaeologist has determined that Chivateros was actually a quarry, and that there was not only one site of this type, but many Chivateros sites, for much of the Peruvian coast and Yungas (which have been baptized as Chivateros quarries), where groups of hunter-gatherers were supplied raw materials, partially processed rock and took her to their workshops located close to their homes or near the quarries already mentioned. The most notorious material of these quarries are the Chivateros preforms (erroneously called by Lanning as \\"Axes of Hand\\" and \\"Spearheads\\"), which were the first outline of pedunculate tips. The rest of lithic materials are nothing more than wastes of the activity of carving and edging. People who provisioned the raw material Chivateros hill, lived in Pampa Piedras Gordas and in Carabayllo, where Lanning found his workshops and housing areas, baptizing as Lítico Light Complex . There preforms Chivateros type was processed to be converted into pedunculadas tips type Paijanense. This tradition spread along the Peruvian coast from Lambayeque to Ica and covers between 10,000 BC to 6000 BC. Current status Since its discovery in the 1960s, Chivateros was constantly plundered by collectors, school and general population to obtain some lithic artifact. In spite of its importance, the Peruvian government never took any plan of care of the site. Subsequently, the activity of private companies and the illegal occupation of land by traffickers has destroyed most of this important archaeological site. ReferencesBibliography * ^ Richard W.

Their most famous product was top-rated evening sex and sin soap opera Number 96 for the 0-10 Network, the forerunner of Network Ten, which ran from 1972 until 1977. Company history Cash Harmon Television was created by two former producers of Sydney-based TV production company NLT Productions after its dissolution. NLT had been founded by entertainer Bobby Limb with Jack Neary and Les Tinker. They were Englishman Don Cash (1910-1973), and American Bill Harmon (born in 1915 Poughkeepsie, New York-died 1981). Harmon had arrived in Australia in 1961 with his wife Del and children Mark and Paul. Cash began his career producing stage shows and training films for the Royal Air Force during World War II, and producing such films as The Lavender Hill Mob and Pandora and the Flying Dutchman, before emigrating to the United States and taking up citizenship, whilst working for both the NBC and American Broadcasting Corporation. Harmon had worked producing on Broadway and television in his native US, before coming to Australia and producing in Sydney such shows for entertainers Bobby Limb, Barry Crocker, Dave Allen and Don Lane. Having both had much experience in the television industry, Cash and Harmon had been brought to Australia by NLT. The Cash-Harmon company made popular situation comedy series The Group (1971) for ATN7. It was written by future Number 96 writer David Sale and featured several actors who would go on to appear in Number 96.Moran, Albert. Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, Allen & Unwin, 1993. p 209-10 In 1972 Cash Harmon responded to the Ten Network's request by Ian Holmes for an Australian equivalent to British soap opera Coronation Street. Enlisting the services of David Sale, who created the general outline and the original characters, Cash Harmon came up with Number 96.

The Unisexers debuted in February 1975 but proved to be a ratings disaster. It was quickly cancelled and was taken off the air after only three weeks and 15 half-hour episodes had been screened.Moran, Albert. Moran's Guide to Australian TV Series, Allen & Unwin, 1993. p 471 In 1976, several attempts to spin-off new situation comedy series from Number 96 failed, and Cash Harmon Television was dissolved in 1977 with the cancellation of Number 96. Several former employees later collaborated on another serial when the 0-10 Network was re-launched as Network Ten, and although well financed, Arcade in 1980 was a critical failure and abruptly cancelled after 30 episode, although 50 episodes had originally been produced.

Qaa (Arabic: القاع), El Qaa, Al Qaa or Masharih al-Qaa is a town in Baalbek-Hermel Governorate, Lebanon. It has a mainly Greek Catholic population. The village has been the target of attacks from Syrian government and anti-government forces. History In 1838, Eli Smith noted Qaa's population as being predominantly Catholic Christian.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 144 The Syrian army invaded Lebanon at 4 a.m. on 1 September 2012 and kidnapped a farmer from the town as part of escalating incursions during the Syrian civil war. The invasion lasted for forty minutes before the unit withdrew. A house in Qaa had previously been hit by a shell fired by the Syrian army. On the 27 June 2016, at least five people in Qaa were killed and thirteen others wounded in an attack by four suicide bombers. Archaeology Along with Maqne I, Qaa is a type site of the Shepherd Neolithic industry. The site is located north west of the town, north of a path leading from Qaa to Hermel. It was discovered by M. Billaux and the materials recovered were documented by Henri Fleisch in 1966.Fleisch, Henri., Notes de Préhistoire Libanaise : 1) Ard es Saoude. 2) La Bekaa Nord. 3) Un polissoir en plein air. BSPF, vol. 63, 1966. The area was lightly cultivated with a thin soil covering the conglomerates. The flints were divided into three groups of a reddish brown, light brown and one that was mostly chocolate and grey colored with a radiant \\"desert shine\\". The Shepherd Neolithic industry can be defined firstly by being small and thick in size, with flakes commonly ranging from to , the thickness distinguishing them from geometric microliths. Their second characteristic is the limited number of forms that the tools take, apart from cores being transverse racloirs on small flakes, strong-pointed borers, denticulated or notched thick, short blades and end- scrapers. It was thirdly characterized by a lack of known typology, with only occasional use of Levallois technique. It was determined to be definitely later than the Mesolithic but without any usual forms from the Upper Paleolithic or pottery Neolithic. Henri Fleisch tentatively suggested the industry to be Epipaleolithic and suggested it may have been used by nomadic shepherds. The Shepherd Neolithic has largely been ignored and understudied following the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war.

Early life and career Alexander Jobson was born on 2 April 1875 in Clunes, Victoria. He was educated in the public system and at the age of 14 he started working as a junior clerk with the Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP) in Melbourne. He studied accountancy and qualified as an Associate of the Institute of Actuaries and a Fellow of the Australian Corporation of Public Accountants. Jobson moved to Sydney in 1902 and became actuary for an American firm. He established his own business as an accountant and actuary in 1906. From 1910 to 1916, he also wrote a financial column in the Sydney Sun. Jobson enlisted in the Scottish Rifles in August 1898 and was commissioned as a full lieutenant on 2 December 1899. He was promoted to captain on 29 August 1902. After moving to Sydney he joined the New South Wales Scottish Rifles with the rank of lieutenant on 1 January 1903 and was promoted to captain again on 1 July. He was promoted major on 13 September 1909. He transferred to the 25th Infantry on 1 July 1912 and on 1 July 1913 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel; and appointed to command the 34th Infantry Regiment. First World War Jobson joined the Australian Imperial Force on 10 February 1916 with the rank of colonel and was given command of the 9th Infantry Brigade. He was promoted to temporary brigadier general on 1 May 1916, shortly before departing Sydney. He arrived in London via South Africa and Dakar on 11 July. The brigade trained on Salisbury Plain before moving to France in November. The brigade entered the area of the line known as \\"Nursery Sector\\" at Armentières on 26 November. Twice, during the absence of Major General John Monash in 1917, Jobson became acting commander of the 3rd Division. His brigade was involved in a number of raids and Jobson was mentioned in despatches for his part. At the Battle of Messines in June 1917, Jobson's planning and performance was excellent, but afterwards Jobson seemed badly affected by the stress of the situation. At a conference on 24 July, Jobson appeared to be in an agitated state and Monash felt that his friend was becoming unstable. Jobson relinquished command on 25 August 1917 and returned to Australia where his appointment with the AIF was terminated on 9 December. Monash arranged for him to be again mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours. Post war In October 1918, Jobson was appointed to command the 2nd Battalion, 53rd Infantry Regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel and honorary brigadier general. Failure in the field was apparently considered no bar to promotion and he was promoted to colonel in December 1919 and transferred to the Reserve of Officers in 1921. After the war, Jobson held a number of company directorates, most notably director of AMP in 1925 and Vice Chairman in 1932. Jobson collapsed and died from a coronary occlusion in King Street, Sydney on 7 November 1933 and was cremated.

Geography The river originates in the hills of Wayanad in the Western Ghats, and traverses a total length of 54 km (33.5 mi) before culminating in the Arabian Sea at Mahé. The river passes through the villages of Naripetta, Vanimel, Peruvankara, Iyyancode, Iringanoor, Tripangathur, Peringalam, Edachery, Kacheri, Eramala, PARAKKADAVU Kariyad, Kidanhi Olavilam, Kunnumakkara, Azhiyoor and Mahé, thus covering an area of 394 km². The northern boundary of Mahé Town is defined by the river. Economy The influence on the economy of the region traversed by the river is very little. The river has been used for inland navigation and transportation of articles from interior villages to Mahe and back, in olden days. The government of Puducherry has planned to build a fishing harbour at the estuary of the river. However owing to technical reasons the harbour, which is under construction, is on the beach adjacent to the estuary.

He wears uniform number 46. Umpiring career Kulpa's professional umpiring career began in 1992 and he advanced to the Pacific Coast League in 1998. Kulpa was one of the 22 umpires promoted in the wake of the Major League Umpires Association's mass-resignation strategy in July , and was named to the National League staff for the remainder of the 1999 season. When the umpiring staffs from the two leagues merged for the season, Kulpa began working in both leagues. He has worked several MLB Special Events, including the All-Star Game (2001, 2015), Wild Card (2020), Division Series (2001, 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2017! 2020), League Championship Series (2005, 2013, 2014), and World Series (2011). He also officiated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Controversies Kulpa was head-butted by Carl Everett of the Boston Red Sox in 2000 during an argument about the location of the inner boundary of the batter's box. Everett was suspended for 10 games and fined. Working first base in Game 3 of the 2011 World Series (his first World Series as an umpire), Kulpa controversially called St. Louis Cardinals hitter Matt Holliday safe after Holliday grounded into what would have been the second out of a routine double play in the game's fourth inning. Kulpa claimed that Holliday had arrived at first base prior to the tag from Texas Rangers first baseman Mike Napoli, although replays subsequently proved that Napoli had indeed tagged him out by a full stride, prior to Holliday's stumbling across the base and falling.Kriegel, Mark. MLB loses chance to change for better FoxSports.com. Kulpa later told a pool reporter after the game that he was aware Napoli had tagged Holliday, but he thought Holliday's foot was already on the base. He did not ask for a second opinion. When the game ended, Kulpa reviewed the play on tape and admitted he should have called Holliday out. The Cardinals went on to win the game 16-7, and eventually won the Series in seven games. On August 12, 2013, he ejected Rangers catcher A.J. Pierzynski for arguing a ball three call during pitcher Yu Darvish's bid for a perfect game against the Houston Astros. The perfect game was broken up moments later on an ensuing ball four pitch to Astros batter Jonathan Villar.\\"MLB Ejection 129: Ron Kulpa (1; AJ Pierzynski).\\" Close Call Sports and the Umpire Ejection Fantasy League. August 12, 2013. During the 2nd inning of a Astros-Rangers game on April 4, 2019, after a low pitch from Mike Minor outside the strikezone to Tyler White was called a strike, the Astros dugout expressed displeasure at the call, to which Kulpa responded back. After a short conversation with Astros manager A.J Hinch, Kulpa proceeded to stare into the Astros dugout while Minor was on the mound ready to pitch. After Hinch told Kulpa to \\"Look over there\\", Kulpa proceeded to eject Astros hitting coach Alex Cintron. On the following pitch, after no further provocation by the Astros dugout, Kulpa again stared at the Astros dugout, leading to Hinch telling Kulpa \\"You can't keep doing it\\". Kulpa responded with \\"I can do anything I want\\", before ejecting Hinch from the game. Kulpa would later interrupt Astro's pitcher Gerrit Cole's warm up pitches before the 4th inning after having instigated an argument with Cole and Astro's catcher Max Stassi, after Cole began walking to the dugout after a potential 3rd strike that was instead called a ball by Kulpa.

He was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2006 in the 'Best World Music' category for his album \\"Golden Strings of the Sarode\\". He is also a recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. Besides being a performer, composer, and conductor, he is also an adjunct professor of Indian classical music at the California Institute of the Arts, and the University of California at Santa Cruz, in the United States. Family and life=Ustad Alauddin Khan tradition Aashish Khan was born in 1939 at Maihar, a small princely state of British India, where his well-known grandfather Alauddin Khan, founder of the \\"Senia Maihar Gharana\\" or \\"Senia Maihar School\\" of Indian classical music, was a royal court musician at that time. His mother the late Zubeida Begum was Ali Akbar Khan's first wife. He was initiated into Hindustani classical music at the age of five by his grandfather. His training (or taalim) later continued under the guidance of his father Ali Akbar Khan, and his aunt, Annapurna Devi. The \\"Senia Maihar Gharana\\" follows the traditional \\"Beenkar\\" and \\"Rababiya\\" pattern of the \\"Dhrupad\\" style. He has two children Faraz and Nusrat Khan from a previous marriage. Career Aashish Khan grew up in Maihar and Calcutta performing Indian classical music among distinguished circles of connoisseurs. He gave his debut public performance at the age of 13, with his grandfather, on the All India Radio \\"National Program\\", New Delhi, and in the same year, performed with his father and his grandfather at the \\"Tansen Music Conference\\", Calcutta. Since then he has performed at major venues of classical music and world music both in the Indian subcontinent and abroad. Aashish Khan is also a founder of the Indo- American musical group Shanti with tabla player Ustad Zakir Hussain in 1969, and later, of the fusion group, \\"The Third Eye\\". In \\"Shanti\\", Aashish Khan is featured playing the acoustic Sarode sometimes through a fender guitar amplifier with vibrato effect. Under Ravi Shankar, he has worked as a background artist on musical products for both film and stage, including Oscar Winner Satyajit Ray's Apur Sansar, Parash Pathar, Jalsaghar, and Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi. He has also worked as a background artist with Maurice Jarre on John Huston's film The Man Who Would be King, David Lean's A Passage to India, and composed the music for Tapan Sinha's films, Joturgriha (for which he received Best Film Score Award) and Aadmi Aurat. During 1989–1990, Aashish Khan served as the Composer and Conductor for the National Orchestra of All India Radio, New Delhi, India, succeeding musical stalwarts like sitarist Ravi Shankar, and flautist Pannalal Ghosh. Collaborations Aashish Khan has collaborated with such diverse western musicians as John Barham, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, The Beatles, Eric Clapton, Charles Lloyd, John Handy, Alice Coltrane, Emil Richards, Dallas Smith, Don Pope, Jorge Strunz, Ardeshir Farah, and the Philadelphia String Quartet. Ustad Aashish Khan is currently leading \\"Shringar\\" with notable New Orleans musicians such as Tim Green and Jason Marsalis. Shringar is the first foray of any classical Indian musician into the music culture of New Orleans, widely considered the Mecca of Jazz. His recordings include Wonderwall Music, Young Master of the Sarode, California Concert, Sarode and Piano Jugalbandi, Shanti, Live at the Royal Festival Hall London, Homage, Inner Voyage, Monsoon Ragas, The Sound of Mughal Court, and the latest, Jugalbandi Sarode & Sarangi Duet, with Ustad Sultan Khan. Teaching Aashish Khan is a music teacher, currently serving as adjunct professor of Indian Classical Music at the California Institute of the Arts, Los Angeles, US, and as an adjunct professor of Music at the University of California at Santa Cruz, United States. He has formerly taught at the faculties of the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael, California, University of Alberta in Canada and the University of Washington, Seattle. While pursuing a busy career as a concert artist and composer, he teaches students throughout the US, Canada, Europe, and Africa, as well as India. Many of his students have established themselves as stage performers in India and abroad. He presently divides his time principally between Calcutta, and California, where most of his students and disciples are located. Recognition He has been awarded the Fellowship of the Illinois Arts Council, US, in 2002, and India's highest award for performing arts, i.e., the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2005. In 2006, he was nominated for a Grammy Award in the 'Best World Music' category. On 24 May 2007 Ustad Aashish Khan became the first ever Indian classical musician to become a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the UK's highest society in Asian arts and culture. Royal Asiatic Society News Religious conversion In September 2006, he announced at a press conference in Calcutta that since his forefathers were Hindu Brahmins of the East Bengal, and held the surname \\"Debsharma\\", he wished to use his forefathers' surname to help people understand the root of his musical lineage. He also stated that his family were never officially converted into Islam and the surname \\"Khan\\" did not necessarily imply he was a Muslim. He based this assertion on the fact that his grandfather the late Ustad Allauddin Khan wrote in his biography (Aamar Katha, (Bengali), published by Ananda Publishers, Calcutta) that his forefathers were indeed Hindus with the surname \\"Debsharma\\". He also said that his name (Aashish) and his brothers' names (Dhyanesh, Pranesh, Amaresh) were all given by their grandfather Allauddin; and these are essentially Hindi names. However, his father Ali Akbar Khan rejected Aashish's claims as fallacies. An anguished Ali Akbar Khan told the Times of India newspaper in an e-mail: \\"I do not support his (Aashish's) choice. Unfortunately, many statements made by my son in the newspaper regarding the history of my family are incorrect. My family has been Muslim for many generations, and we will remain Muslims. It's a shame that he is trying to reinvent the history of our family and in turn hurting past generations of our family.\\" We were always hindu.

Biography Gateson was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Augusta and Daniel Gateson. Her maternal grandfather and brother were clergymen; Some sources state her father was one too, but Axel Nissen in his book Mothers, Mammies and Old Maids: Twenty-Five Character Actresses of Golden Age Hollywood writes that he was a contractor. She attended the Packer Collegiate Institute and the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, the latter being where her mother taught elocution. She believed her mother had \\"an inner longing for the stage\\", which she passed on to Marjorie, along with diction and poise. Gateson's musical schooling helped her land a job in the chorus in a play called The Pink Lady. She made her Broadway debut at the age of 21 in the chorus of the musical The Dove of Peace on November 4, 1912; the show closed after 12 performances. During the much longer run of her next Broadway play, The Little Cafe (November 12, 1913 - March 14, 1914), she played several of the characters. In 1917's Broadway musical Have a Heart, she sang two songs. She performed in musical comedies for another decade, ending with Oh, Ernest! (1927), but also appeared in non-musical comedies and dramas. After the Broadway comedy As Good as New in 1930, she set out for Hollywood. Gateson made her film debut in 1931, after more than two decades on the stage, playing secondary character roles as women of wealth and breeding, who were often haughty and aloof. She is perhaps best known as the society matron who attempts to thwart Mae West's character's plans for social climbing in the 1935 film Goin' to Town, and as a rather kinder socialite whom Harold Lloyd teaches to box in 1936's The Milky Way. Other films in which she appeared include The King's Vacation (1933) (her largest role, the female lead opposite George Arliss), Bureau of Missing Persons (1933), Private Number (1936), You'll Never Get Rich (1941), International Lady (1941), and Meet The Stewarts (1942). Her film work petered out in the late 1940s and she jumped into television roles. She made her small screen debut in 1949. She was featured in the 1949 television soap opera One Man's Family and found success in 1954 at age 63 playing matriarch Grace Harris Tyrell on the daytime soap The Secret Storm, a role she would play until 1968. Gateson also made numerous other television appearances in the 1950s, including episodes of Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, and United States Steel Hour. Gateson never married and said: \\"I wanted nothing but to be an actress. I didn't even consider trying both.\\" Gateson suffered a stroke, which ended her acting career, and died several years later in 1977 of pneumonia, at the age of 86 in Manhattan.

The power station at the lower reservoir has four water turbines, which can generate 360 megawatts of electricity within 60 seconds of the need arising. The scheme has the capacity to power the whole of North Wales for several hours.http://www.electricmountain.co.uk/Ffestiniog-Power-Station The station, commissioned in 1963, was the first major pumped storage system in the UK.*First Hydro: Ffestiniog The upper reservoir is Llyn Stwlan which discharges of water to the turbine generators at the power station on the bank of Tan-y-Grisiau reservoir. The building of the lower reservoir flooded the route of the Ffestiniog Railway which had to build a deviation around the reservoir and power station. The plant is operated by First Hydro, a UK company owned by a joint venture of International Power and Mitsui & Co.,First Hydro website and has an average efficiency of 72–73% i.e. it uses 39% more electricity (when pumping the water back up to the Llyn Stwlan) than it actually produces.First Hydro Analysts Conference History The idea of using pumped storage as a way of coping with rapid, short-term changes in the demand for electricity in England and Wales was first considered in 1948, and having found a suitable site, the Ffestiniog station was authorised by Act of Parliament, specifically the North Wales Hydro Electric Power Act 1955. The first task facing engineers was to provide access roads to the sites, and work on constructing these started in 1957. This enabled work to commence on the two dams and the power station shortly afterwards. A pumped storage scheme requires two reservoirs at different levels, and the upper reservoir was created by enlarging Llyn Stwlan, high up on Moelwyn Mawr. Llyn Stwlan was located in a cirque basin, formed by glacial erosion. The lake had previously been enlarged in 1898 by the Yale Electricity Company, who built a dam and used the water to generate power at Dolwen, located near Tanygrisiau, below the lower reservoir. The company was formed by the Votty Quarry company, and direct current was transmitted by overhead line to Dolgarregddu, near the centre of Blaenau Ffestiniog, where there was a gas engine and two semi-diesel engines, which generated an additional 240 kW. This was used to supply power to the town when it was not required by the quarry. Because of the voltage drop in the system, a final 48 kW booster set was needed at the quarry. The Dolwen station continued to operate after the new scheme was finished, although it was subsequently decommissioned and the building was converted into two semi-detached houses, and then an 8-bedroom detached house. For the new scheme, the cirque basin was dammed at its eastern end by a concrete gravity buttress dam, long, and a maximum of high above its foundations. There is a spillway at the southern end of the dam, with an overflow level at above ordnance datum (AOD). The dam contains of water, and the water level rises and falls by as the station operates. The catchment area for Llyn Stwlan is , and the average yearly rainfall over this area is . The access roadway runs up to the northern side of the dam, and along the top to reach a bridge, which provides access to the intake towers. The lower reservoir was formed by building another concrete gravity dam across the natural basin of Afon Ystradau. The dam is around long, with a maximum height of above its foundations, although most of it is well concealed, as the spoil from the foundations was used to cover the downstream face of the structure. Because of the larger area of the lower reservoir, it rises and falls by during the daily operation of the station. Several streams flow off the surrounding land into the reservoir, and these flows are monitored, so that an equivalent amount of water can be discharged into the Afon Barlwyd through regulators in the dam. The levels of Tanygrisiau reservoir are carefully monitored, to ensure that there is always sufficient spare capacity to hold the balance of the water left in Llyn Stwlan. The catchment area for Tanygrisiau reservoir is and the average yearly rainfall is . The reservoir is designed for a maximum water level of AOD, and there is a spillway set at a height of above this. The main building and Tanygrisiau reservoir The main power station building is long and wide. In order to accommodate the vertical shafts of the machines, 140,000 tons on rock were excavated, and the building extends below the operating floor, which is at ground level. There are four lower floors, and working downwards, these are the alternator floor, the turbine floor, the pump floor and the pump basement. The height of the building above ground level is . The main building is flanked by two single storey blocks, the southern one used for the control room and the northern one for administration. The main building is steel framed with an inner brick wall and a cavity. The outer wall is faced with local stone, of a type which has been used for a number of significant buildings in the Vale of Ffestiniog, but it proved difficult to find a source. A disused quarry was tracked down with help from retired quarrymen, but there was insufficient stone to complete the project, and it was problematic to use modern extraction methods. Some of the stone was therefore sourced from a second quarry. Within Llyn Stwlan, there are two intake towers, which house equipment to control the shutoff gates. The gates are square, and can be dropped into position to prevent water entering the tunnels to the power station. Below them are two pressure shafts, which descend vertically for . They are in diameter, and are lined with concrete. Each of them feeds two pressure tunnels, which slope down towards the power station. The first are of concrete construction, and are in diameter. There is then a transition, and the final are steel lined, with a diameter of . The pipes terminate at a tunnel portal which is about from the main building. The final pipes into the station are in diameter, and are made of high-tensile steel, thick, which are encased in of pre-stressed concrete. Each pipe forks, with the upper branch supplying the turbine, when the station is generating, and the lower branch receiving water from the pump when it is returning water to Llyn Stwlan. Valves of and diameter are used to route the water appropriately. Equipment The equipment, supplied by the English Electric Company, installed in the main building consists of four vertically mounted motor/generator units, rated at 90 MW each, which are located on the alternator floor. Sitting above each, and directly coupled to the motor/generator, is a Francis turbine. When generating, water is supplied to these at . The pumps are located below the motor/generators, and are connected to them by a clawtype coupling. In pumping mode, these deliver against a head of , and consume 75 MW. The plant operates at 428 revolutions per minute in both modes, and when generating produces power at 16 kV. Each machine is connected to an oil circuit breaker, and sets of two machines are connected in parallel to twin 16/275 kV transformers. The 275 kV supply is carried by overhead power lines, and is fed into the National Grid nearby at the site of the former Trawsfynydd nuclear power station. Water is pumped from Tanygrisiau reservoir to Llyn Stwlan during the night, when there would normally be insufficient demand for the electricity produced by relatively efficient steam plant. During the day, the station is used to generate electricity at periods of peak demand. Typically, it pumps for six or seven hours in the night, and generates for around four hours during the day. It is also used to provide power at short notice if there is a breakdown in another part of the system, of an unexpected increase in demand. A particular problem is the huge rise in demand at the end of popular television programmes, and the station can be brought online very quickly to cover this, providing an additional 360 MW of power in under a minute. Amenity Beginning in 1953 and 1954, the CEGB had carried out extensions to some existing hydro-electric generating stations, located in North Wales, and although they were small in scale, they had learned valuable lessons which were carried forwards to the new project. Thus the enabling Act of Parliament included an amenity clause, which included provision of a landscape consultant, who would liaise with the National Parks Commission, to ensure that issues connected with the disposal of spoil, the planting and felling of trees and bushes, and the reinstatement of land affected by the construction, were adequately addressed. It was the first of the CEGB's power station projects to require the services of a landscape consultant from the outset. Local planning authorities were consulted, concerning the location and external appearance of all aspects of the project, and the Royal Fine Art Commission was also involved in the process. Perspective drawings showing the power station in its landscape were displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1958. One issue was the disposal of nearly a million tons of rock. This came from the excavation of the underground levels of the main station building, from the construction of the tunnels, and also from the foundations for the two dams. Rock from the upper dam was placed in the reservoir, where it is permanently covered by water. Around three-quarters of the lower dam has been hidden from view behind spoil tipped in front of the downstream face, and the rest of the spoil has been placed near the tunnel portals. The rock has been carefully profiled and covered with peat, before being sown with grasses which are native to the area. Some locations have been planted with trees and shrubs, including rhododendron, willow and Scots pine. When the station was first opened, it included a public reception centre, from where guided tours of the site were available to visitors. Railways and quarries Restoration of the Ffestiniog Railway as a tourist railway had begun in 1952, but the construction of the power station would sever the link between Porthmadog and Blaenau Ffestiniog by flooding the northern portal of the Moelwyn Tunnel and the trackbed to its north, and constructing access roads along the trackbed to the south of Tanygrisiau station. Railway restoration was in its infancy in Britain, and although the Ffestiniog Railway opposed the Bill during its final stages through Parliament, the scheme was written off as \\"old gentlemen and boys playing trains\\". The Act of Parliament to authorise the power station was granted on 16 May 1955. The Railway received a \\"Notice to Treat\\" on 5 February 1956, and a \\"Notice to Enter\\", which can normally be up to three years after the first notice, on the following day. Moelwyn Tunnel was requisitioned on 2 June 1958, with two days between the notices. The old route of the Ffestiniog Railway, showing the northern portal of Moelwyn Tunnel, often submerged below the waters of Tanygrisiau reservoir, but visible here because of low water levels. The replacement FR route is in the foreground. The Ffestiniog Railway began legal proceedings to obtain reasonable compensation for the loss of their line in 1956, and it had become the longest case in British legal history by the time it was finally settled in 1972, sixteen and a half years later. Relationships between the two parties were not good in the early days, as the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) were convinced that the Ffestiniog Railway board had bought a moribund railway in order to pocket the compensation themselves. Charles Goode produced plans for a new route along the western side of the lake, which it was agreed would be incorporated into the plans. However, the CEGB then moved the location of the switching station, rendering the route impractical, and the consulting engineers Livesay & Henderson produced an east side route, which was much more expensive to implement. The Ffestiniog Railway was aiming for \\"equivalent reinstatement\\", where the British Electricity Authority, subsequently the Central Electricity Generating Board, would pay the full cost of building a replacement route. Based on the cost of the east side route, the Lands Tribunal ruled that equivalent reinstatement would only be justified if passenger number were to rise from 76,000 to 196,000, which was not deemed to be \\"within the bounds of the possible\\", despite the fact that these figures were reached in 1967. Eventually, a scheme called \\"deferred maintenance\\" was devised, and formed the basis for the final payout. Pressure was applied to the CEGB during the final hearings at the Lands Tribunal, to allow a west side route, and the Ffestiniog Railway were awarded £65,000, an interest payment of £30,000, and legal costs. The full text of the decision is published in Brian Hollingworth's book, and fills fifteen pages. Whereas most of the reinstated route, which included a spiral at and a new Moelwyn Tunnel, was built by volunteers, the section immediately behind the power station was built by Sir Alfred McAlpine (Northern) Ltd, as it included four buried bridges to carry the trackbed over the inlet penstocks to the power station. Quarries Moelwyn Slate Quarry is located above the enlarged Llyn Stwlan. It was worked sporadically between the 1820s and 1897, but was connected to the Ffestiniog Railway by a spectacular series of seven inclines, descending some . Most are still visible in the landscape, but the enlargement of Llyn Stwlan destroyed the sixth incline, parts of the fifth and seventh, and much of the abandoned mill area, which was located between the fourth and fifth inclines, rather than at the quarry level, in order to benefit from the water supply provided by the lake. There are a number of inspection hatches and electric cabinets on the inclines, which are presumably connected with the power station infrastructure. To the north-west, on the other side of Moelwyn Mawr, lies the Croesor Quarry, where extraction of slate ceased in 1930. Following the end of the Second World War, the quarry was operated by Cookes Explosive, a local firm based at Penrhyndeudraeth, who used its underground chambers to store explosives, mainly propellants. In 1971, the Central Electricity Generating Board became aware of this use, and calculated that if there was an explosion underground, either of their two dams could be damaged. They therefore drained both reservoirs, and Cookes began removing about 250 tons of explosives per week, which were taken to Penrhyndeudraeth or by rail from Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station to various other ICI Nobel works in the United Kingdom.

The film was released on September 21, 1934. It had a domestic (U.S.) gross of $2,000,000. As usual with West's films, some scenes were removed for versions to be shown in different states. To be shown in New York, one of the biggest markets, they had to completely re-shoot the final scene. Mae West's character and the Tiger Kid were originally to complete their nuptials without a marriage ceremony; the ceremony had to be included. The male lead was supposed to be played by George Raft, but he refused. His part was taken by Roger Pryor, a stage actor.

The parrots were subsequently released in the jungles of South America, still repeating \\"it ain't no sin\\" over and over again. Sheet music of the song \\"My American Beauty\\" was also printed with the film's original title, and corrected with a rubber stamp. The film is noted in the jazz world for being the release of the song \\"My Old Flame\\", composed by Arthur Johnston with lyrics by Sam Coslow. It is sung by Mae West in the film, backed by the Duke Ellington Orchestra and went on to become a jazz standard. Johnston and Coslow also wrote the songs \\"My American Beauty\\", \\"When a St. Louis Woman Comes Down to New Orleans\\", and \\"Troubled Waters\\" for the film, which also features \\"The Memphis Blues\\" and \\"At Sundown\\". Reception The film was a box office disappointment for Paramount upon release in September 1934, but it received some positive reviews from critics, with Andre Sennwald of The New York Times describing the Johnston and Coslow songs as \\"quite perfect\\", and stating that the film was \\"bolstered by a smart and funny script, an excellent physical production and a generally buoyant comic spirit\\".

Two axiomatic systems are set out below, one grounded in mereology, the other in mereotopology and known as connection theory. A point can mark a space or objects. Motivation Point-free geometry was first formulated in Whitehead (1919, 1920), not as a theory of geometry or of spacetime, but of \\"events\\" and of an \\"extension relation\\" between events. Whitehead's purposes were as much philosophical as scientific and mathematical.See Kneebone (1963), chpt. 13.5, for a gentle introduction to Whitehead's theory. Also see Lucas (2000), chpt. 10. Whitehead did not set out his theories in a manner that would satisfy present-day canons of formality. The two formal first order theories described in this entry were devised by others in order to clarify and refine Whitehead's theories. The domain for both theories consists of \\"regions.\\" All unquantified variables in this entry should be taken as tacitly universally quantified; hence all axioms should be taken as universal closures. No axiom requires more than three quantified variables; hence a translation of first order theories into relation algebra is possible. Each set of axioms has but four existential quantifiers. Inclusion-based point-free geometry (mereology) The axioms G1-G7 are, but for numbering, those of Def. 2.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008) (see also Gerla (1995)). The identifiers of the form WPn, included in the verbal description of each axiom, refer to the corresponding axiom in Simons (1987: 83). The fundamental primitive binary relation is Inclusion, denoted by infix \\"≤\\". (Inclusion corresponds to the binary Parthood relation that is a standard feature of all mereological theories.) The intuitive meaning of x≤y is \\"x is part of y.\\" Assuming that identity, denoted by infix \\"=\\", is part of the background logic, the binary relation Proper Part, denoted by infix \\"<\\", is defined as: x The axioms are: *Inclusion partially orders the domain. :G1. x\\\\le x. (reflexive) :G2. (x\\\\le z \\\\land z\\\\le y) \\\\rightarrow x\\\\le y. (transitive) WP4. :G3. (x\\\\le y \\\\land y\\\\le x) \\\\rightarrow x = y. (anti- symmetric) *Given any two regions, there exists a region that includes both of them. WP6. :G4. \\\\exists z[x\\\\le z\\\\land y\\\\le z]. *Proper Part densely orders the domain. WP5. :G5. x *Both atomic regions and a universal region do not exist. Hence the domain has neither an upper nor a lower bound. WP2. :G6. \\\\exists yz[y * Proper Parts Principle. If all the proper parts of x are proper parts of y, then x is included in y. WP3. :G7. \\\\forall z[z A model of G1–G7 is an inclusion space. Definition (Gerla and Miranda 2008: Def. 4.1). Given some inclusion space S, an abstractive class is a class G of regions such that S\\\\G is totally ordered by Inclusion. Moreover, there does not exist a region included in all of the regions included in G. Intuitively, an abstractive class defines a geometrical entity whose dimensionality is less than that of the inclusion space. For example, if the inclusion space is the Euclidean plane, then the corresponding abstractive classes are points and lines. Inclusion-based point-free geometry (henceforth \\"point-free geometry\\") is essentially an axiomatization of Simons's (1987: 83) system W. In turn, W formalizes a theory in Whitehead (1919) whose axioms are not made explicit. Point-free geometry is W with this defect repaired. Simons (1987) did not repair this defect, instead proposing in a footnote that the reader do so as an exercise. The primitive relation of W is Proper Part, a strict partial order. The theoryKneebone (1963), p. 346. of Whitehead (1919) has a single primitive binary relation K defined as xKy ↔ y x \\\\le y \\\\lor y \\\\le x.Also see Stoll, R. R., 1963. Set Theory and Logic. Dover reprint, 1979. P. 423. Hence inclusion-based point-free geometry would be a proper extension of D (namely D∪{G4, G6, G7}), were it not that the D relation \\"≤\\" is a total order. Connection theory In his 1929 Process and Reality, A. N. Whitehead proposed a different approach, one inspired by De Laguna (1922). Whitehead took as primitive the topological notion of \\"contact\\" between two regions, resulting in a primitive \\"connection relation\\" between events. Connection theory C is a first order theory that distills the first 12 of the 31 assumptions in chpt. 2 of Process and Reality into 6 axioms, C1-C6. C is a proper fragment of the theories proposed in Clarke (1981), who noted their mereological character. Theories that, like C, feature both inclusion and topological primitives, are called mereotopologies. C has one primitive relation, binary \\"connection,\\" denoted by the prefixed predicate letter C. That x is included in y can now be defined as x≤y ↔ ∀z[Czx->Czy]. Unlike the case with inclusion spaces, connection theory enables defining \\"non- tangential\\" inclusion,Presumably this is Casati and Varzi's (1999) \\"Internal Part\\" predicate, IPxy ↔ (x≤y)∧(Czx->∃v[v≤z ∧ v≤y]. This definition combines their (4.8) and (3.1). a total order that enables the construction of abstractive classes. Gerla and Miranda (2008) argue that only thus can mereotopology unambiguously define a point. The axioms C1-C6 below are, but for numbering, those of Def. 3.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008). *C is reflexive. C.1. :C1. \\\\ Cxx. *C is symmetric. C.2. :C2. Cxy\\\\rightarrow Cyx. *C is extensional. C.11. :C3. \\\\forall z[Czx \\\\leftrightarrow Czy] \\\\rightarrow x = y. * All regions have proper parts, so that C is an atomless theory. P.9. :C4. \\\\exists y[y *Given any two regions, there is a region connected to both of them. :C5. \\\\exists z[Czx\\\\land Czy]. *All regions have at least two unconnected parts. C.14. :C6. \\\\exists yz[(y\\\\le x)\\\\land (z\\\\le x)\\\\land eg Cyz]. A model of C is a connection space. Following the verbal description of each axiom is the identifier of the corresponding axiom in Casati and Varzi (1999). Their system SMT (strong mereotopology) consists of C1-C3, and is essentially due to Clarke (1981).Grzegorczyk (1960) proposed a similar theory, whose motivation was primarily topological. Any mereotopology can be made atomless by invoking C4, without risking paradox or triviality. Hence C extends the atomless variant of SMT by means of the axioms C5 and C6, suggested by chpt. 2 of Process and Reality. For an advanced and detailed discussion of systems related to C, see Roeper (1997). Biacino and Gerla (1991) showed that every model of Clarke's theory is a Boolean algebra, and models of such algebras cannot distinguish connection from overlap. It is doubtful whether either fact is faithful to Whitehead's intent.

It first appeared on Tiësto's compilation album Nyana, released May 6, 2003, and was later published as a single via Black Hole, on October 27, 2003. Overview While \\"Beautiful Things\\" was promoted and released as a remix by Gabriel & Dresden, the song originally started out as an unreleased guitar track titled \\"Annie\\". In response to a request from Tiësto for a follow-up to the single \\"Summer Calling, \\"Annie\\" was rewritten to become a club track, also changing the lyrics from a narrative third person view to first person. According to Mavie, \\"Beautiful Things\\" is, \\"in a general sense, about feeling stuck; in a place, time, you just can’t get yourself out of\\". The Gabriel & Dresden remix per se is characterized by a sharp beat and thick bassline. It's also notable for fusing acoustic and electronic elements, including guitars and percussion instruments in conjunction with synthesizers and electronic drums. Vocal clouds and echoing elements in the background also exemplify the band's influence of dub music. In 2004, \\"Beautiful Things\\" earned a nomination for Best Progressive / Trance at the International Dance Music Awards. In tribute to the song, Andain has also received the Sunset Music Awards, given at the Polish Sunrise Festival 2010. Piano version On October 26, 2010, Andain published an acoustic live performance of the song on YouTube. The video features Mavie singing and playing an original piano arrangement of the song.

In January the following year, Wispelaere quit his job and travelled to Bangkok, where he approached the embassy of a foreign country, offering to sell classified material to that country. (The country is reported by some sources to be Singapore). The country notified the United States, and the FBI began to investigate. Posing as agents for a foreign country (allegedly Russia), the FBI met Wispelaere in Bangkok, where he gave them hundreds of sensitive documents in exchange for cash. Later, he mailed more documents to an address in Virginia, also run by the FBI. On 15 May, Wispelaere was lured to Washington, where he expected to meet the foreign agent. He was arrested by the FBI at Dulles International Airport, and was charged with attempted espionage. Under a plea bargain agreement, Wispelaere agreed to co-operate with investigators in exchange for a lighter penalty. He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. He is alleged to suffer from mental illness, and his trial was delayed to claims he was suffering from schizophrenia.

The park consists of a one-hour walking tour into the caverns, as well as a working pioneer village and grist mill. Park's history The cave was first discovered by Daniel Boone and his brother, Squire Boone, as they were hiding from Indians in the late 18th century. Squire would come back later to purchase the land and live near the caves in 1808 and start a grist mill at the site. The mill is on the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures and still operates today.http://www.in.gov/dnr/historic/bin/srlistnew.pdf Squire Boone died in 1815 and, having so loved the caverns, requested to be buried in them, and was buried near the entrance to the cave. His remains were moved in the 20th century because of construction near his burial site and its continual disturbance by relic hunters. The coffin, which contained only bones, was moved deep into the caverns. The cave tour passes by the coffin and there are benches to rest and contemplate the cave and the coffin. The park The caverns are open year-round, while the village and grist mill are open only during the summer months. The pioneer village includes an old fashion candy shop, a building where soap is made from lard, a chandlers house where candles are made by hand dipping, and a country store. The products made in the village are marketed nationally and can be purchased in many parts of the country including Disney World. Everything made in the village is done the \\"old fashioned way\\", by hand. The company which owns the caverns also run the Squire Boone Caverns' factory in New Albany, just off I-265, where many items are mass-produced. Cave tour The tour of the cave is conducted by experienced guides on lighted walkways with minimal stairs. The tour starts from the General Store. There is a door in the back that leads to a vertical shaft that was excavated in 1970, with a 73 step circular stairway that leads down to the cave. As of 2015, the man-made entrance shaft, only 45 years old, has begun to grow features like the rest of the cave. The cave's tour includes such sights as an underground stream whose outlet is the stream that runs the grist mill, and source is a stream that goes into a sinkhole in nearby Laconia, massive stalactite and stalagmite formations (which are not to be touched), a large open central cavern, several narrow areas, a large underground waterfall, several interesting rock formations, and near the end the coffin of Squire Boone. The stream also has an impressive rimstone formation, the largest in North America and the second or third largest in the world. Gallery Image:Squire_Boone_Caverns_village_1.jpgThe village.

St Joseph's Cathedral as Petre intended it. This design was never completed. St Joseph's Cathedral in Dunedin, New Zealand, is the Roman Catholic Cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin. It is located in City Rise, some to the west of the city centre.  History  The Gothic revival cathedral was designed by Francis Petre, who also later, in a complete change of style to palladian revival, designed St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru (1894), Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington (1901), the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch (1905), St. Mary's Basilica, Invercargill (1905), St Patrick's Basilica, Waimate (1909) and Sacred Heart Basilica, Timaru (1911). Construction of the Cathedral started in 1878, during the episcopacy of Bishop Patrick Moran. It was used for its first church service in February 1886, and was completed in its unfinished state in May 1886, at a cost of £22,500. The original design, however, was for a much larger building, with a tall spire with a height of 60 meters over the transept. St Joseph's Cathedral is located beside St Dominic's Priory, also designed by Petre, in 1876. The Priory is no longer used, except for one room utilised by the Cathedral choir. The Cathedral Chapel is situated behind the Priory, and the Traditional Latin Mass is still celebrated there every Sunday. Behind the Cathedral is the Catholic Pastoral Centre, containing the Bishop's office and also the Catholic library. The cathedral has undergone several modifications, the most notable being the removal of the High Altar after Vatican II; it was returned after a long sojourn in the Dunedin Public Art Gallery. The side altar was dismantled in early 1970, and has since been made into a large Tabernacle, kept in the Blessed Sacrament chapel beside the sanctuary. A new Reconciliation Room has been added to replace the old confessionals in the nave of the cathedral. The Cathedral also has a primary school in its parish. Not surprisingly named St Joseph's Cathedral School. The parish priest Monsignor John Harrison is on the Board of Trustees. It is a high decile school that performs exceptional well with outstanding teachers and a very involved school community. The school is one of many Catholic Primary schools that feed into Kavanagh College, located next to Cathedral. The chair of the Board of Trustees is Norman Wood, the Principal is Jo Stanley. A description of St Joseph's Cathedral from a letter of the reporter of the Auckland Evening Star in 1889 says, \\"The cable tram has carried you up barely two hundred feet when you see a double-towered church of dark grey stone standing on a site cut into the hill. This is the Catholic Cathedral, St Joseph — and it is a gem. The outside gives you no idea of the beauty within.\\"Auckland Evening Star, New Zealand, 1889. This is a poor description of what was built. While it falls short of the original conception the building as it stands gives a better idea of the outstanding structure which was never completed.

He is known for his role in the development of the Denver Sound, which is music that mixes elements of country, gothic, folk and gospel in Denver, Colorado. He is a member of Slim Cessna's Auto Club, Munly and the Lupercalians, and The Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was a founding member of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots, active from 2000 to 2007. He was also a member of The Road Home in 2015. Early life Munly was born in Quebec, Canada to Ohio natives Bruce A. Thompson and Geraldine Ann Manley, who were married on June 15, 1963. The name 'Munly' is actually derived from his mother's maiden name. Bruce, an exploration geologist, was the founder of Skull Creek Oil. He was a Freemason, amateur radio operator for 52 years, and a civil war historian. Together, they had four children: Heather, Bruce, Jayson (Munly), and Winston. He was raised in a \\"stereotypical Catholic\\" household. He describes his childhood and community as \\"privileged\\", \\"affluent\\", and \\"upper-middle class\\". As a child, he split his time living in both Canada and the United States. He played ice hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. His older brother took him to the Bob Johnson ice hockey school in Colorado to play. His family would also have summer retreats in Ellsworth, Ohio, outside of Youngstown. Munly's interest in music began in childhood, stemming from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a dulcimer for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. While recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era banjo, which was technically off-limits to handle, although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well. He played both instruments in the same fashion and only played his own songs. When he was older, presumably in his 20s, he moved to Boulder, Colorado before eventually moving to Denver. In a 2009 interview, he said that he identifies more with being an American from Denver than with being a Canadian from Quebec. Prior to becoming a musician, it has been rumored that Munly worked as a summer camp counselor and as a record store clerk. According to an interview with good friend Andrew Murphy of Smooch Records, he may have worked at \\"Albums on the Hill\\" in Boulder, Colorado, since it's where he and Munly first met and where Munly helped him get a job. In the late 1990s, he attended Columbia University in Manhattan, New York, where he earned a Master's degree in Modern English Literature.  Solo career  Munly started out his music career in the 1990s. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with Roger Manning, though the song featured on the record is unknown. He has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. Although Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitated to call himself a \\"singer- songwriter\\": '' He was signed to What Are Records? and released his debut solo album, Blurry, in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of W.A.R. Munly de Dar He and Galvanized Yankee were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, Jimmy Carter Syndrome, was released through Smooch Records in 2002. Blurry Blurry is Munly's debut studio album. It was released through Top Notch, an imprint of What Are Records?, on February 6, 1996. It is the only album of his which incorporates elements of pop music rather than the sounds and lyrics of alternative country that he is mainly known for. The album was originally titled \\"Blurry Polaroids\\", but Munly was forced to shorten the name by the Polaroid Corporation. John Ellison, Rob Dread, and Craig Winzelberg performed on this album. Munly provided vocals and guitar and Ellison performed on bass. The exact contributions of Dread and Winzelberg are unknown. The album was re- mastered by producer Bob Ferbrache at Absinthe Studios in Denver. It was given a limited-edition re-release, with new cover art and an updated track listing, through Smooch Records on June 27, 2006. Only 1,000 copies were printed due to \\"licensing restrictions.\\" Little is known about how the album was received by critics. However, there were apparently a few songs that reached popularity in Perth, Australia. The first track, \\"Virgin of Manhattan\\", was used during a sex scene on an episode of the television series Melrose Place. The second track, \\"Baptists & Barbiturates\\", was featured on a 1996 compilation album titled More Than Mountains: A Benefit For Colorado Conservation, released by W.A.R. Records. Munly de Dar He Munly de Dar He (or de Dar He) is his second studio album, released on November 15, 1997. It was distributed through Top Notch Records, an imprint of What Are Records?. Musically, this album features a more robust instrumental backing than his previous effort, Blurry. A variety of instruments are used: strings such as the banjo, cello, and violin, horns such as the tuba and trumpet, as well as others, such as the accordion and various forms of percussion. Munly collaborated with musicians Nick Urata (of later DeVotchKa fame), Matthew Brown, Michael Crow, Tom Echols, and Channing Lewis to form the 'de Dar He' band. However, the exact contributions of each member are unknown. The album was recorded \\"in an abandoned semi-trailer\\" in Denver, Colorado. Following a move from Denver, Colorado to Austin, Texas in 1997, the band appeared on the MTV sitcom \\"Austin Stories\\". Members Crow and Lewis quit shortly thereafter, leading the band to split up permanently. The album was re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache at Absinthe Studios in Denver. It was given a limited-edition re-release through Smooch Records on July 18, 2006. Only 1,000 copies were printed due to \\"licensing restrictions.\\" Little is known about how the album was received by critics. However, in 1998, Michael Roberts of Westword rated the album as one of the best to be released by Colorado locals in 1997: Galvanized Yankee Galvanized Yankee is Munly's third studio album, released on January 5, 1999. It was distributed by Top Notch Records, an imprint of What Are Records?. This is the first album that leans into the alternative country genre for which he is most well-known. Reviewer Jeremy Salmon of AllMusic looks at the album as a \\"compendium of tales\\" - a concept album loosely held together by the theme of war. In fact, the album title \\"Galvanized Yankee\\" is a historical term that dates to the American Civil War era. (Munly, with his father, shared an interest in this period of American history, which may have heavily influenced this album.) Many of the songs deal with life, death, and religion and are laden with images of \\"desolate farmlands, of Hollywood ghost towns, of deserted battlefields, filled with corpses and the detritus of war.\\" The album contains two covers of traditional Appalachian folk songs, \\"Pretty Saro\\" and \\"Cluck Old Hen\\". It also contains a live version of \\"Virgin of Manhattan\\" featuring actor Patrick Stewart, and a recorded radio advertisement for \\"Math Made Easy\\", a math tutoring program for children. The album was recorded in New York between 1998 and 1999, while Munly was attending Columbia University. Performance credits include: W.H. Auden, William Bowen, Monica Dreidemie, Dan Joeright, Joseph Lesage, M. Outland, Patrick Stewart, and Rob Wilson. The guitar, mandolin, and fiddle are the most prominent instruments on the album. The album was re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released by Smooch Records on February 13, 2007. Jimmy Carter Syndrome Jimmy Carter Syndrome is Munly's fourth and final solo studio album, released in 2002. This was the first album to be distributed through Smooch Records. He asserts that prizefighter Gerry Cooney was his babysitter as a child. The song \\"Cooney vs. Munly\\" on Jimmy Carter Syndrome (2002) was written as a tribute to him. In fact, the Jimmy Carter Syndrome album may have been named as such (in part) due to the way both he and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter were brought up: \\"We grew up similarly...he had a nanny who sort of raised him. I was in that situation, more than my parents raising me. So there are some similarities.\\" The song \\"Spill the Wine\\" was featured on Tyr: Myth-Culture-Tradition, Vol. 2 in 2004.  Bands = Slim Cessna's Auto Club  Munly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club in 1998, around the same time as Lord Dwight Pentecost, after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording Galvanized Yankee in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. Always Say Please and Thank You (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. The satirical song \\"SCAC 101\\" on Cipher (2008) alludes to how Munly came to join the band. Munly and Slim Cessna were featured in a segment of \\"Seven Signs: Music, Myth, and the American South\\" (2008), a film by JD Wilkes of Th' Legendary Shack Shakers. Munly recited the original story titled \\"Döder Made Me Do It\\" and joined Slim in performing \\"Children of the Lord\\" by Slim Cessna's Auto Club.  Munly and The Lee Lewis Harlots  'Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots' was a six-piece gothic country band with mostly stringed instruments. According to a Munly fansite, the band was active between 2000 and 2006. However, there are concert videos on YouTube that were recorded in February 2007. They also made an appearance at Westword's Denver Music Showcase in June 2007. Besides Munly (vocals, banjo, guitar), the original 'Lee Lewis Harlots' were: Elin Palmer (violin, nyckelharpa, string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), and Rebecca Vera (cello). Paul Bradley (upright bass), and Jeff Linsenmaier (drums) were later additions. Jay Shewman replaced Paul Bradley on bass some time in 2007. Some members have also contributed backing vocals. In July 2006, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots was voted the best band in Colorado by over 100 music experts in the Denver Post Underground Music Poll. Their only album, Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots, has received much critical acclaim. The original album was initially released in August 2004 through Alternative Tentacles. A combined CD/DVD double-album was released in October 2004 as a joint release between Alternative Tentacles and Smooch Records. It came with additional features such as: the original album in surround sound, three additional bonus tracks, lyrics read by Munly, and photos of the band. Of the three bonus tracks, only one is a previously unreleased Harlots track: \\"Rufus Wainwright, I'm Coming After You\\". The album was re-released on vinyl in August 2013 through the label Pesanta Urfolk. It contained a booklet of lyrics and updated cover art by Benjamin A. Vierling. They recorded a version of \\"Everyone Is Guilty #2\\" for the Smooch Records compilation album, Crossbreeding Begins At Home (2004). It would later become an 'Auto Club' song, released on Cipher in 2008. \\"Amen Corner\\", from their self-titled record, was featured on another Smooch Records compilation, Radio 1190: Local Shakedown, Vol. 2 (2004), and \\"Old Service Road\\" was featured on the Alternative Tentacles compilation album, Sonic Terror Surge 2007.  Munly and The Lupercalians  'Munly and the Lupercalians' is Munly's second side project, which was started around 2006–2007. The original lineup of the band included many, if not all, members of the Lee Lewis Harlots. The current lineup contains most of the current members of Slim Cessna's Auto Club: Munly, Slim Cessna, Lord Dwight Pentacost, Rebecca Vera, and Andrew Warner. On stage, each band member, except for Munly, wears a costume that identifies them as a potential member of the fictional town of 'Lupercalia.' The goal is to produce a multi-album set tentatively titled The Kinnery Of Lupercalia, which is all about the town and its colorful residents. Its residents have been described as \\"families who interact with each other\\" and Lupercalia as an \\"imagined community of Legions & clans where we are not sure who is a deity and who is not.\\" Although an unauthorized demo album was released in 2009, the first official album by the band, Petr & the Wulf, was released in October 2010 through Alternative Tentacles. It was re-released through their own independent record label, SCAC Unincorporated, around 2015. The work is loosely based on the Peter and the Wolf composition by Sergei Prokofiev, and is said to be a prequel to the stories of Lupercalia told over a span of four albums. The song \\"Grandfater\\" was featured on the Smooch Records compilation album Radio 1190: Local Shakedown, Vol. 3 (2009) and on Rodentagogue: The Best of Dark Roots Music Volume II, released by Devil's Ruin Music in 2010. In September 2019, BandWagon Magazine reported that the Lupercalians were recording a new album, although most of it was actually already written in 2012, perhaps earlier. According to an interview with the Denver Post, 36 songs were written as of 2006. In February 2020, it was announced by Westword that the new album would be titled Kinnery of Lupercalia: Undelivered Legion and would be released in the latter half of 2020, most likely through SCAC Unincorporated Records.  Denver Broncos UK  The Denver Broncos UK is an experimental folk quartet that first recorded together in 2006. The band originally formed with just Munly, Lord Dwight Pentecost, and Slim Cessna as members. The current members are: Munly (vocals, guitar), Dwight (vocals, autoharp, melodica, banjo, percussion), Slim (vocals, percussion, washtub drum), and Rebecca Vera (vocals, cello, keys, percussion). The band is now more commonly referred to as DBUK to dispel any notion that they are connected to the Denver Broncos football team or the Bronco's fanbase in the United Kingdom. They have released two albums: Songs One Through Eight (2015) and Songs Nine Through Sixteen (2019). A double-album titled Songs One Through Sixteen was released in November 2018 through European record label Glitterhouse Records. They also recorded a cover of \\"Top Yourself\\" by The Raconteurs for the album Rockin' Legends Pay Tribute to Jack White, released in November 2013.  The Road Home  Munly joined \\"Scott Kelly and The Road Home\\" in 2015, a side project formed by Scott Kelly and Noah Landis of Neurosis. The band was renamed \\"The Road Home\\" after Greg Dale's departure. He performed a small number of shows in the west and southwest parts of the United States in January and February 2015, which included California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. He contributed vocals and autoharp to live performances. He recorded only one song with The Road Home, which was the single \\"The Forgiven Ghost in Me.\\"  Other collaborations  He has also been included on a few compilation albums. One of his first songs, \\"tY\\" appeared on a compilation album of Colorado artists in 1995, titled Shmowballs, released through the record label Sh-mow. W.A.R. Records released the album More Than Mountains: A Benefit For Colorado Conservation in September 1996, on which Munly made two appearances - one of which was \\"Sasquatch\\", a collaboration with The Winebottles. In 2000, Smooch Records released Radio 1190: Local Shakedown, Vol. 1, which featured his live version of the poem/rhyme \\"The Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" by Edward Gorey, set to music. It was also on Crossbreeding Begins at Home, another Smooch Records compilation album, which received a limited release of 200 copies in January 2004.  Other ventures = Writing  Besides being the primary songwriter in all of his bands, he is also an accomplished author and playwright. Munly released the book \\"Ten Songs With No Music\\" around 2001-2002 through Maude O.K. Publishing. Running 213 pages in length, it is a collection of stories based on characters featured in some of his songs. Each chapter shares a title with a song from either Munly's solo efforts or from \\"Always Say Please and Thank You\\" by Slim Cessna's Auto Club. It is currently out of print. In a 1995 interview with Westword, Munly said that he also wrote some children's stories that had been published. In a 2005 interview with Kaffeine Buzz, Munly said that he was in the midst of writing a second book. In 2006, he was asked to contribute to the Copper Nickel literary magazine of the University of Colorado in Denver. His story was titled \\"A Re-Birth Certificate.\\" Munly has also written some plays for which he has won the Southern Heritage and Young North American Playwright awards. Two of them reportedly have been in production.  Filmmaking  In April 2020, Munly and Rebecca Vera directed and produced a black-and-white short film (approx. 36 minutes in length) titled \\"Cattle, I Will Hang,\\" the story of which the song on Jimmy Carter Syndrome is based. Munly narrates and voices all four characters in the story.  Acting  Munly went to college to pursue an acting degree for one semester before transferring to Columbia University. During that time, he had done some voice work and appeared in a commercial for a hot dog brand. In 2012, Munly was personally contacted by Shooter Jennings to participate in his short film, The Other Life, directed by Blake Judd in Kentucky. He appears as a mortician. Artistry=Songwriting Munly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation. He also says that he is \\"selfish\\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation. He expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication: Musical style His music has ties to alt-country and Gothic- Americana. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, Jimmy Carter Syndrome, strings. One topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \\"hates\\" music that veers into that kind of territory. However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.  Vocals  Technically, Munly is a baritone, but his vocal range extends from A1 to F5. Audio samples can be found on YouTube. Early on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what is typically heard on his later records. On the expanded DVDs of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots (2004) and The Commandments According to SCAC (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs. Personal life Munly has been in a long-term relationship with musician Rebecca Vera since 2004. Vera is active in Munly's solo and band projects as both a backup vocalist and musician. They live in Denver. Following in his father's footsteps, Munly revealed that he is a Freemason of the thirty-second degree when asked about the significance of '32°' signed after his name.

Life  Pavel Grošelj was born in Ljubljana, then a town of Carniola (Austria-Hungary). He showed a great interest in the natural sciences and a gift for poetry from an early age. He graduated in biology from the University of Vienna in 1906; the following year he also completed his doctorate there. From 1908, he was a teacher in Ljubljana at two boys' grammar schools and at the girls' lycée. In 1909, he was entrusted with the task of lecturing on mineralogy in technical courses. In 1910 he was named honorary lector, and in 1923 honorary docent for general biology at the medical faculty of the University of Ljubljana. He ran and headed the institute for biology until his death. He was elected to the position of extraordinary professor in 1931, but he did not accept the position. He died in 1940 in Zagreb. Work Grošelj was an editor of early scientific writings for the Ljubljanski zvon journal (1904-1905, 1910); his first texts were published in this journal between 1902 and 1904. He wrote the comparative literary study Prešeren in Petrarka in 1902 and his lecture France Prešeren from 1905 places him amongst the early academic authorities on Prešeren's life and works. Grošelj campaigned in favour of the establishment of a Slovene university (even as a freshman in lectures in Vienna). As a member of the commission tasked with this goal, he was later directly involved in the associated planning. Grošelj worked for a number of reviews in his life. In 1933, the natural sciences section of the Muzejsko društvo za Slovenijo (Museum Society for Slovenia) began on his initiative to publish a paper entitled Proteus, for which Grošelj was chosen as the editor. He was also the editor of the academic bulletin Prirodoslovne razprave from 1931 to 1939. Some of his scientific writings were published in the book Vesolje- Zemlja-Človek (Space-Earth-Man) in 1957. He also wrote articles for non- academics and took part in debates on astronomy. At the time of his death, Grošelj had almost finished a work on the nervous system of jellyfish. He also left a theoretical study on the promorphology of organisms, and his lifework Splošna biologija (General biology) unfinished. Recognitions Grošelj was depicted in ca. 1904 by the sculptor Svitoslav Peruzzi. He depicted him with a primate skull in his arms. The portrait was done in the Vienna Secession style. The Prirodoslovno društvo Slovenije (Naturalists’ Society of Slovenia) has awarded the Grošelj plaque in his honour since 1984.

Early life and career George Jameson Johnston was born on 24 October 1868 in East Melbourne, Victoria. He served as a member of the Fitzroy City Council from 1896 to 1899. In 1887, Johnston enlisted in the militia as a gunner in the Victorian Field Artillery. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1889 and promoted to captain in 1895. He and his wife married in the sistine chapel on 14 August 1897. Boer War In 1899, he volunteered for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where in November 1899 he was attached to the British 62nd Battery, Royal Field Artillery with the rank of captain. He was promoted to major in March 1900. As commander of a section of two guns, he saw service at Bloemfontein, Klip Drift, Osfontein and Paardeberg. In July 1900 he returned home with fever. In March 1902 he became a temporary lieutenant colonel commanding the 4th Battalion, Australian Commonwealth Horse but the war ended before he reached South Africa. Johnston was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 24 April 1909 and took command of the Victorian Field Artillery Brigade. First World War Johnston joined the Australian Imperial Force on 18 August 1914 as a lieutenant colonel commanding the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade. The brigade sailed for Egypt during October 1914. Guns of the 2nd Field Brigade's 4th Field Battery landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 and were the first to open fire on the enemy. The rest of the brigade, less the 6th Field Battery, which was diverted to Cape Helles, came ashore the next day, eventually settling on McCay's Hill and MacLagan's Ridge. Johnston was designated as commander of the 2nd Division Artillery but became acting commander of the 1st Division Artillery while Brigadier General Talbot Hobbs was acting 1st Division commander from August to October 1915. He then commanded the 3rd Infantry Brigade until late November. Johnston was again appointed commander of the 2nd Division Artillery in January 1916. He sailed for France in March and his artillery fired its first barrage on the Germans on 27 April 1916. He commanded the 2nd Division Artillery at Pozières, Lagnicourt, Bullecourt, and Third Ypres. In October 1917, Johnston became upset when he was superseded by Brigadier General Walter Adams Coxen for the post of Corps Artillery commander on 18 October 1917 and asked to be sent home. General William Birdwood accepted the request, he was replaced by Brigadier General Owen Phillips on 1 November 1917 and returned to Australia. For his services on the Western Front, Johnston was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG); he had been Mentioned in Despatches four times. Post-war On 21 April 1918, Johnston became Military Administrator of New Guinea. Johnston brought outlying districts of the territory under more effective control and established some new districts and posts for better control of the territory. Johnston's temperament was not an ideal one for the post of administrator, and he attracted public criticism. On 1 May 1920, he was replaced by Brigadier General Thomas Griffiths. After the war Johnston resumed his pre-war position as director of Johnston's Pty Ltd. He commanded the 3rd Division from 1922 to 1927 and was promoted to major general on 1 October 1923. He died on 23 May 1949 and was buried at Brighton Cemetery after a military funeral.

History A musical revue rather than a single group, Steampacket was formed in 1965 by Long John Baldry after the break-up of his previous group the Hoochie Coochie Men. It included Rod Stewart who had been with Baldry in the Hoochie Coochie Men, vocalist Julie Driscoll, organist Brian Auger and guitarist Vic Briggs. They were managed by Giorgio Gomelsky, who had previously been involved with the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. Steampacket played at various clubs, theatres and student unions around the country, including supporting the Rolling Stones on their 1965 British tour. Because of contractual difficulties, however, they never formally recorded a studio or live album. Tracks from some demo tapes they recorded at a rehearsal in the Marquee Club would later be released under the deceptive titles, First of the Supergroups: Early Days and The First Supergroup: Steampacket Featuring Rod Stewart, to cash in on Stewart's success. Aftermath Stewart left in early 1966, followed by Long John Baldry a few months later, and the group disbanded soon after. Long John Baldry then joined Bluesology which included a then unknown Elton John on keyboards, before pursuing a solo career, having a number 1 hit record in the UK Singles Chart in 1967 with \\"Let the Heartaches Begin\\". Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and Vic Briggs formed Trinity, with Briggs departing later in 1966 to join Eric Burdon and The Animals. Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and The Trinity had a UK hit in 1968 with This Wheel's on Fire. Rod Stewart later sang with the Jeff Beck Group, the Faces and as a solo artist. There is an urban legend that Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood, later of Fleetwood Mac, played with Steampacket. In fact Steampacket, with the exception of Rod Stewart's departure, had the same personnel from its inception to its disintegration.

History Indications of Bronze Age settlements in the territory of Salve have been revealed by several archaeological findings. The origin of the inner city can be traced back to the Roman centurion Salvius, who in 267 BC was granted the land as a reward. In the 9th century AD to defend against Saracen raids, walls were built. Other fortifications that still exist, were built in the 15th century as a defense against Ottoman raids. In 1563 the stone tower of Torre Pali was completed, erected by the Spaniards along with many others on the Salento coast. The tower, which rises from the sea, is about west of Santa Maria di Leuca. The towers were used to sight the Turkish ships and to raise the alarm quickly throughout the Salento by the lighting of beacons. A village in the comune is named after the tower. In 1930 great reclamation of Ionian coasts of Salento began, which ended after World War II. Through these works, it was possible to develop the beaches of the coast and beach tourism has developed, which today is one of the sources of the local economy. The village has traces of an old Castle (now transformed into houses) which resisted several times to Turk sieges, and a Church dedicated to the patron Saint Nicholas. In the church, decorated by Cesare Penna the Young of Lecce (a protagonist of the Baroque of Lecce), has an ancient organ built in 1628 by G. B. Olgiati of Como and T.

Petrolia was the site of the first oil well drilled in California. Description Petrolia has an estimated population of 300-500 people within a 15-mile radius. It is located in the Mattole Valley, part of the Lost Coast region, one of the largest wilderness areas and the longest stretch of undeveloped coastline in the continental United States. Petrolia's isolation is due to its position on the rocky, treacherous coastline adjacent to the King Range mountains that isolate this area from mainland California and continue to leave the area almost completely undeveloped. A travel magazine has called this area \\"too lovely to be believed, perhaps too beautiful to last.\\" It has been recognized as the top \\"still wild\\" place in California. The area is the only significant stretch of California without a shoreline highway, and so far has \\"thus escaped tourism's aggressive paws.\\" The of steep roadways beneath the King Range Mountains include towering Douglas-firs, a few coastal redwoods around the upper reaches of the Mattole River, rocky shorelines, and black sand beaches, as well as a menagerie of fauna, including black bears, black-tailed deer, river otter, California quail, bobcat and porcupine, reptiles such as rattlesnakes, western fence lizards and alligator lizards, various amphibians and bald eagles. Petrolia has been described as \\"a river valley town with Norman Rockwell flavor.\\" Petrolia is from the Pacific Ocean at the north end of the section of beach protected by the King Range National Conservation Area and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park; the Punta Gorda Light location is about 3 miles down the coast from Mattole Beach parking. The Mattole River is home to a variety of California wildlife, including river otters, steelhead trout, more than 250 bird species, and a threatened salmon that was the subject of a book about the community's attempts over two decades to preserve the Mattole salmon. It is one of the few remaining areas with virgin old-growth stands of Douglas-fir. Geography and climate Overlooking Petrolia Petrolia is located near the Mendocino Triple Junction, where three fault lines meet, and experiences frequent earthquake activity. The last large earthquake to affect the area was a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in 1992, which resulted in a fire that destroyed the Petrolia General Store. Note photos of cracks in the Mattole Road as well as damage to buildings and landslides. The store was rebuilt but lacks the charm of the 100-year-old landmark that it replaced. Two of the remaining landmarks in Petrolia are a small wooden church dating from 1912--St. Patrick's Catholic Church--and the Petrolia Pioneer Cemetery, which has the graves of original residents of Petrolia dating from November 1857. On the evening of March 9, 2014, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck approximately 50 miles to the west. It was widely felt, yet caused little to no damage, nor did it generate a tsunami. The lack of any significant damage or land deformation was attributed to the shallow strike-slip fault movement in deep (3000m) water. In 2010 two other large quakes had hit the area, a 6.5 on January 9 and a 5.9 on February 3; neither caused any deaths, but the January quake was reported to have caused damage throughout the area. The weather in Petrolia is temperate. The town is located in a banana belt that is sheltered from the fog that reaches Eureka and some of the northern towns, such as Arcata and McKinleyville. As a result, the summers are dry and sunny, typically around with temperatures occasionally reaching as high as . Winters are rainy from November through April, with temperatures typically around and occasionally falling to the high 30's or low 40s (F) at night. Honeydew, which is located only south of Petrolia, has a less temperate climate and its summers and winters are more extreme, with one of the highest amounts of winter rainfall in the contiguous 48 states. There are only two roads that lead into Petrolia, one from the north from Ferndale, California, and one from the south from Honeydew, California, leading through scenic redwood forests that were the site for the filming of Jurassic Park and After Earth. Both roads are winding, steep, and sometimes unpaved, passing large tracts of scenic overlooks and wilderness areas. They are popular routes for visitors, especially mountain bikers and motorcyclists, and have been described as leading to \\"an almost comically steep drop to the sea\\". The road from Petrolia to Ferndale follows the ocean and has unbroken vistas of rocky ocean coastline and beach. Petrolia is surrounded by large tracts of original homestead ranches and farms. The Mattole area, particularly the Lost Coast beaches, which feature tide pools, pristine beaches and relatively deserted hiking trails, is popular with visitors. At certain times of year, migrating gray whales can be seen from shore, as well as colonies of harbor seals and sea lions. Local residents use the Mattole River for swimming, rafting, canoeing, kayaking and catch and release fly fishing. The South Cape Mendocino State Marine Reserve and Sugarloaf Rock are immediately offshore and are closed to public access.California Department of Fish and Wildlife , California Protected Marine Areas, 14 March 2013California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sugarloaf Island Special Closure, 2015 History The area was originally settled by the Mattole, a Pacific Coast Athapaskan people, who arrived at the Pacific Coast late in the first millennium from what is now Canada. The Mattole Indians were slaughtered by the Western settlers, mainly oil prospectors and ranching homesteaders. The last remaining descendants of the Mattole live today in Bear River on the Rohnerville Rancheria, but there are no remaining native speakers of the Mattole language. There are estimated to be more than 80 archeological sites of significance in the Lost Coast area. California Historical Landmark #543, California's first drilled oil wells A pre-1903 fire photograph of Petrolia town square. Although it's often stated that Petrolia was first named \\"New Jerusalem,\\" that area is 4-5 miles upstream; however, many people like the holy connotations of being called something like paradise. Petrolia was the site of the first oil well drilled in California. The oil lay in small, fractured underground pools and ultimately, attempts to extract it dried up; the site is now registered as California Historical Landmark #543. The Mattole post office opened in 1863, and changed its name to Petrolia in 1865. A 1903 fire wiped out many buildings around the town square. On March 9, 2020, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake occurred 86 km West of the city. The official time of the earthquake was 02:59:06 (UTC). 2660 people reported effects from the earthquake.  Economy  Local businesses include a bed and breakfast, a gourmet coffee company that imports and roasts coffee in a converted barn on a hillside overlooking the ocean, an organic vineyard and winery, and an organic pick-it-yourself blueberry farm. It has abundance of marijuana growers. Marijuana has long since replaced the ranching and logging that sustained the original residents for generations.

Federally, Petrolia is in . Facilities It has a post office and a volunteer fire department. The original bell cast in 1871 for the Mattole School is still located at the school. There are two community centers, the Mattole Valley Community Center (originally the school house from 1907 and moved across the street) that hosts community cabaret and gatherings, and the Mattole Grange, an indoor and outdoor gathering area approximately five miles south of Petrolia that hosts a monthly pancake breakfast and farmers' market. There are community gardens, various community clubs, and a medical clinic.

The vault is one of several across the U.S. and is similar to Trementina Base. Prior to construction of this vault, on June 12, 1986, one of the oldest houses in the Petrolia area was deliberately burned by the Church of Spiritual Technology to clear the way for their construction, and symbols were cut in the ground above the vault to mark its location.

It comprised a church and a quadrangle formed by such buildings as the scriptorium (library), the dormitory with its renowned scissor-braced roof and the cloisters. It was established around 1239 under the patronage of Henry III and at its height was home to 30-40 friars. The friary went into private hands after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, having been purchased for £240 in 1539 by Thomas Bell (died 1566), who converted the church to his residence and transformed the buildings of the cloister, including the scriptorium, into a cap manufactory. The conversion of the church into a grand mansion was completed by 1545,A lease dated 1545 to Thomas Bell by Gloucester Corporation refers to \\"his mansion place new built...lately called the black friars and now Bell Place being of the yearly value of £9\\".

The nave and chancel were shortened approximately each by a half, either side of the central crossing, of which latter the southern member, extending into the cloister, was removed. Upper floors and stone mullioned windows were added above the outer aisles, a semi-circular bay window being also added to the north side of the nave. The great window at the north end of the northern transept was built in, and replaced with several smaller windows.Alterations as described by VCH Glos, vol.4 & from comparison with an illustration of a theoretical reconstruction by Terry Ball. In 1555 John Hooper, the Bishop of Gloucester, was burnt to death for his beliefs.Rachel Basch, ‘Hooper, Anne (d. 1555)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, April 2016 accessed 7 June 2017 His widow, Anne Hooper and other Blackfriars clergy were exiled abroad. Hooper and her daughter, Rachel, died in Frankfurt in 1555 of the plague. Anne left money to her son. A 1721 image of the complex by William Stukeley provides valuable information about the friary at that time. In the 1930s Bell Place was converted into 2 dwellings. Restoration work on this former church was completed in 1984, when it was opened to the public. The cloister buildings were converted from former cap factory into dwellings in the 18th century, and part of the west range was heightened and converted into three houses. Bell bequeathed Blackfriars to his niece Joan and her husband Thomas Denys, son of Sir Walter Denys of Dyrham Park, in which family it remained until c. 1700. Both the ancient gateways to the Blackfriars have been removed, one before 1724, the other having collapsed c. 1750. One had become known as Lady Bell's Gate, which is memorialised in the modern street name \\"Ladybellegate\\", onto which the western cloister faces. The site is today the most complete surviving Dominican priory in Britain, containing the oldest surviving purpose-built library in the country.VisitBritain website The friary includes a notable fine, scissor-braced, dormitory roof.

Reaching a length of , this brown to gray shark has a very thick body with a prominent \\"humpback\\" and extremely rough skin. It is further characterized by two enormous, sail-like dorsal fins placed relatively close together. Both dorsal fins have a spine embedded mostly within the fleshy leading portion of the fin; the first dorsal spine is tilted forward. Found near the sea floor over outer continental and insular shelves and upper slopes, the prickly dogfish is thought to be a slow-moving predator of small benthic organisms. It is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of around seven pups. This species is an uncommon bycatch of bottom trawls. Taxonomy Australian ichthyologist James Douglas Ogilby originally described the prickly dogfish from a desiccated specimen discovered on a beach on Bruny Island off southeastern Tasmania, Australia. He published his account in an 1893 issue of the scientific journal Records of the Australian Museum and, at the behest of Tasmanian Museum Curator Alex Morton, named it Centrina bruniensis after the type locality. Subsequent authors have synonymized the genus Centrina with Oxynotus. Distribution and habitat An uncommon resident of temperate waters, the prickly dogfish occurs off Australia from Crowdy Head in New South Wales, around the southern coast of Tasmania, to as far as Esperance in Western Australia. It also occurs off New Zealand and adjacent islands, and over the submarine Chatham Rise, Challenger Plateau, and Campbell Plateau. This species is found close to the bottom over outer continental and insular shelves and upper slopes. It has been reported from a depth range of , but is typically found between down. Description The humped back and high dorsal fins of the prickly dogfish give it a distinctive shape. With a very stout body and a highly arched back, the prickly dogfish has an unmistakable profile. Its head is slightly flattened, with a short rounded snout. The nostrils are large and closely spaced. The eyes are immediately followed by small round spiracles. The mouth is relatively small and transverse, and almost surrounded by deep furrows coming from the mouth corners. The lips are thick and bear papillae (nipple-like structures). There are 12-19 upper and 11-13 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are small with narrow upright cusps, while the lower teeth are large with broad knife-like triangular cusps. There are five pairs of gill slits. The body is roughly triangular in cross-section. The two dorsal fins are very tall with triangular, sail-like apexes; the anterior portion of each fin is fleshy, in which is embedded a spine with only the tip exposed. The first dorsal fin spine is tilted forward. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the gill slits, ahead of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is smaller than the first, and the distance between it and the first dorsal fin is less than the length of its base. There are a pair of thick ridges running along the abdomen between the pectoral and pelvic fins, which are smaller than the second dorsal fin. There is no anal fin. The caudal fin is broad and high, with a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is extremely rough due to a covering of large dermal denticles with narrow, knife-like crowns. The coloration is plain brown to gray, becoming translucent at the trailing margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins. This species grows to at least long, and may reach . Biology and ecology The unusual shape and sizable, oily liver of the prickly dogfish suggests it is a slow swimmer that can hover over the sea floor with minimal effort. It probably hunts for small, bottom- dwelling invertebrates and fishes, perhaps facilitated by its large nostrils and labial papillae. This species is aplacental viviparous; females have been recorded containing seven or eight mature eggs in their ovaries, and one was gestating seven embryos. Newborns measure about long. Males and females attain sexual maturity around and ≤ long, respectively. A known parasite of the prickly dogfish is the monogenean Asthenocotyle taranakiensis. Human interactions The prickly dogfish is occasionally caught incidentally by bottom trawlers, and probably discarded. Some sources indicate the numbers caught have declined from historical levels, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses this species as Near Threatened. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the prickly dogfish as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifiers \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.
