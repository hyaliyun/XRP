She also helped to establish and support several educational organisations for women. Early life and education Born on 19 February 1842 in Flensburg, Kruse was the daughter of Johan Hinrich Jes Kruse (1805‚Äì59) and his wife Anna Magdalene Christine Becker (1815‚Äì59). Her father had helped to establish the first Danish-language school in Flensburg. It was here that Kruse and her siblings were educated in both Danish and German. After her confirmation, she went on to learn French, English and Italian, receiving private tuition from the schoolteacher and politician Christian Flor (1792‚Äì1875). After her father's death in 1859, together with several friends, he paid for training up to the level of head teacher at N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen from 1860 to 1862. Career The formerMarie Kruse's School at Absalonsgade 3 in Copenhagen On receiving her qualification, Kruse joined Louise Thomsen at the school she ran for the sons and daughters of Danish officers who had served or lived in Schleswig and Holstein. After Thomsen died in 1869, she ran the school herself. In 1879, she moved the school into new premises on Absalonsgade in Copenhagen, where it became Marie Kruse's School with 146 pupils. In 1886, she moved it once more, this time to Frederiksberg Alle. When Kruse retired in 1902, there were 336 pupils. It was recognized as one of the country's best schools for girls. As a schoolteacher, Kruse was strongly influenced by Natalie Zahle who became a lifelong friend. Both aimed at giving girls an education which would allow them to be self-supporting. Increasingly, she received the support of affluent parents who believed their daughters should move with the times and be able to stand on their own two feet. Always keen to support the history of southern Jutland in her curriculum, in 1884 Kruse was a co-founder of the S√∏nderjysk Samfund (South Jutland Society), becoming a member of the board in 1898. With a view to providing pensions for retired teachers, she founded Foreningen til L√¶rerinders Underst√∏ttelse (Association in Support of Women Schoolteachers), and in 1872 was a co-founder of Kvindelig L√¶seforening (Women's Reading Association). She was also an active member of Dansk Kvindesamfund (Danish Women's Society) and Den danske Pigeskole (Danish Girls' School). Kruse retired in 1902 when she was only 60, apparently because she had difficulty in accepting the educational reforms of the times. Laura Jensen, a former pupil who became the school's principal, appreciated the discipline she had acquired under Kruse: \\"She was strict but many of us developed a strong liking for her discipline as with time we learnt that it was in our best interest.\\" In 1894, Kruse was awarded the Danish Medal of Merit. She died on 12 February 1923 in Frederiksberg.

It was built to highlight cotton-growing activities in the area. First Cotton Palace The choice to establish a cotton exhibition in Waco was likely a result of Waco's role as one of the largest cotton markets in the region, with over 120,000 bales of cotton traded in the city in 1883. Texas Cotton Palace Records Accession #792, The Texas Collection, Baylor University. The city's location near the Bosque and Brazos rivers gave it a fertile environment for cotton production. Following a campaign where Waco residents raised $40,000 to build the facility, plans were drawn up in 1894 for the Texas Cotton Palace in Padgitt Park. Construction was swift, and on November 8, 1894, the first Cotton Palace exhibition was opened by Texas governor James Hogg, which began a month of festivities. The building itself was short-lived and, on January 19, 1895, burned to the ground. Second Cotton Palace Despite the popularity of the first Cotton Palace exhibition, a movement to rebuild the Cotton Palace did not occur for 15 years. In 1910, the Young Man's Business League of Waco sold stock and raised over $100,000 to build a second, significantly expanded, Cotton Palace, with Albert C. Clifton, YMBL president, also serving as president of the board of the directors for the new Cotton Palace. The Cotton Palace's supporters purchased Padgitt Park from its namesake, Tom Padgitt, and expanded beyond the building itself to build a 10,000 seat arena, a racetrack, an auditorium, a zoo, carnival grounds, and a football field. This second Cotton Palace lasted for 21 consecutive years of autumn exhibitions, with no interruption for World War I. During this period, over eight million visitors attended the exhibitions. The exhibition over those 21 years included a wide variety of events, including parades, livestock shows, art exhibits, and, in 1918, mock battles and an air show involving 148 planes. Every year the exhibition held the Queen's Ball, Waco's largest social event of the year. The record daily attendance of 117,208 visitors was recorded on November 3, 1923. The exposition closed permanently on October 19, 1930, due to the decline of the cotton market as well as the Great Depression. After years in disrepair, the buildings were demolished. The City of Waco sold the material for $10,265 to Morrow Wrecking, who on Monday, February 8, 1943 razed the buildings, dug out the foundations, graded the ground and hauled the scrap away. The only remaining structure was the stage area from the coliseum, which served as the changing rooms for the Sun Pool. The structure was destroyed in the devastating tornado that struck downtown Waco on May 11, 1953, killing two lifeguards that were sheltering in the underground locker rooms. The cornerstone of the original Cotton Palace building is mounted at Lover's Leap in Waco's Cameron Park.

The war was waged between Dirk's brother William of Frisia, and Dirk's daughter Ada who had quickly married count Louis II of Loon.  Course   Succession crisis  Wedding of Ada and Louis in 1203. 15th-century painting. Count Dirk VII of Holland passed away on 4 November 1203, having fathered only daughters, with only Ada surviving him. On his deathbed, he declared he wanted to discuss his succession with his brother William of Frisia. However, his wife, countess Adelaide of Cleves, who had already fought a battle near Alkmaar against the rebellious William in 1195, wanted Ada to receive the inheritance instead. Because Holland and Zeeland were so-called \\"sword fiefs\\" and not \\"spindle fiefs\\", Ada, as a woman, had no right to inherit the counties, but Adelaide tried to accomplish this anyway by quickly finding a husband for Ada. Even before her father was buried, the 15-year-old Ada wed count Louis II of Loon, as arranged by her mother.Encarta- encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Ada\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. On the way to her father's funeral, she ran into her uncle William's henchmen, after which she entrenched herself in the Fortress of Leiden.  War  The war of succession took on an international scope: Ada and Louis allied themselves with France and the German house of Hohenstaufen, William joined up with England and the German house of Welf. In the background, a struggle for the throne of the Holy Roman Empire was taking place between the Welf Otto IV of Brunswick and the Stauf Philip of Swabia. This meant that the emperor or overlord was unable to determine the fate of the events in his Dutch provinces. Well-known noblemen from Holland who joined forces with the Loon camp were Gisbert II of Amstel, Floris Herbaren van der Lede, Folpert II van der Lede, Hugo of Voorne, Rogier van der Meere and Otto of Voorn; William was supported by Walter of Egmont, Albert II Banjaert,Kastelen in Beverwijk en Heemskerk: Kasteel Banjaert Philip of Wassenaar, James of Leiden, Simon of Haarlem, William of Teylingen, Jan of Rijswijk and Otto of Bentheim.Joan a Leydis, lib, XX, cap 1.2 Early on in the conflict, Wiliam's troops besieged the Fortress of Leiden, conquered it, took Ada prisoner and sent her via Texel to England. Diplomatically, Louis' position was stronger, with numerous foreign allies, but in Holland he was seen as a stranger, and the native William was more popular amongst the nobility and citizenry. Louis initially also rallied the support of the count of Flanders, the prince-bishops of Li√®ge and Utrecht, the dukes of Limburg and later Brabant as well. In 1204, he invaded Holland with a massive army, and managed to expel William to Zeeland., Op zoek naar Albert Banjaert en zijn huis te Beverwijk (Amsterdam/Beverwijk 1997) p. 282‚Äì3. In the winter of 1203‚Äì4, the Kennemers (North Hollanders) used the war tactic of opening up the dykes of the rivers Amstel and IJ and flooding the area between Muiden and Breukelen. From 1205 onwards, the tide of battle shifted in William's favour. He was now supported by the inhabitants of Zeeland, Kennemerland (coastal North Holland) and Rhineland (South Holland), and his army was stronger. Louis retreated from Holland in early 1206, but was chased by William and defeated in a battle on the banks of the river Zijl.  Aftermath  Louis opted for negotiations, and requested the duke of Brabant to mediate. On 14 October 1206, peace was signed with the Treaty of Bruges. Formally, Holland was partitioned between Louis and William: William received Zeeland and the region around the city of Geertruidenberg, Louis would keep the rest Holland. However, several sources show that William soon became the de facto ruler of Holland; for example, William called himself simply comes Hollandiae (\\"count of Holland\\") in a 1210 deed. Halfway 1207, Louis managed to liberate his wife Ada after corresponding with the English king, John Lackland, but he had to send his brother Arnold as a replacement hostage to England.

Background In March 1746, Captain Alexander Campbell with about 70 Campbells and 30 of the Duke of Kingston's Regiment of Light Horse: troops of the British-Hanoverian Government and Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, entered the town of Keith, Moray. At that time, men who supported the Jacobite Prince Charles Edward Stuart were at Spey and had heard a rumour that the Duke of Cumberland's army was on their way and wou‚Äôd cut them all to pices. Lord John Drummond who commanded these Jacobites ordered the bagpipes to play and drums to beat and they began their march to take up the ground for action. They were joined by about 500 men of Roy Stewart's and Lord Elcho's; which with Lord Drummond's men amounted to about 900 or 1000 men in all. At last light the detachment of Kingston's Light horse appeared within less than a mile of the hill of Fochabers but did not see any of the Jacobites. A detachment of Roy Stewart's men was ordered to take guard under Captain Ludowick Stewart. Captain Stewart ordered a party to march over the hill and to wait there for further orders from Major Glasgow who was to command the whole force. Captain Robert Stewart had not been there for longer than a quarter of an hour when a small body of French hussars came riding down the street and told him that the detachment from Kingston's Light Horse was in the Fir Park, near the town; that they had been firing at one another for some time; and that they wanted a party of his men to go into the park and attack them. Captain Stewart replied that he could only do this on the orders of Major Glasgow. Major Glasgow arrived about three quarters of an hour later with a detachment of Lord Ogilvie's men, about 16 of the French and about 20 or 30 horse. Together with the French hussars they entered the park but found none of the enemy. They then marched towards to the town of Keith, arriving there at about twelve o'clock at night. The skirmish at Keith The Jacobites were challenged by the Campbell sentry. They answered to him that they were friends of the Campbells and he welcomed them in. They then overpowered the Campbell sentry and entered the town, where the action began. The French began the action and a general \\"huza\\" was given up with the words \\"God save Prince Charles\\". The action continued on both sides for about half an hour with the fire from the Campbells coming very hard from the windows of the kirk. Captain Robert Stewart was severely wounded with a musket ball through both of his shoulders. Major Glasgow requested that Captain Robert Stewart send a party of men to the kirk as he thought it was likely that he was going to be over-powered in the streets. Captain Stewart immediately came down the street where there was a , but took all of the enemy prisoner. Aftermath There was word that the Duke of Cumberland had 700 horse lodged in the vicinity that the Jacobites might be attacked by and so Captain Stewart rode at the rear of the prisoners, to prevent them falling into enemy hands, as they were carried over the bridge to Spey. In the skirmish 9 of the Duke of Cumberland's men had been killed, a good number were wounded and about 80 were taken prisoner. On Prince Charlie's side there was one Frenchman killed, but a good many wounded, particularly among Lord Ogilvie's men who had been exposed to the fire from the kirk.

The original baby jumper consists of a hoop suspended by an elastic strap. More elaborate baby jumpers have a base made of hard plastic sitting in a frame and a suspended fabric seat with two leg holes, often with trays holding toys. The door jumpers lack the tray. There are also mobile play centers (baby walkers), which look very similar to baby jumpers, but which have wheels. History The Jolly Jumper brand refers to a Native American origin, where mothers used cradleboards to keep their infants in when travelling or working. When working outside, the mother could attach the cradleboard to a tree limb using its straps. By pulling the limb, thus causing a bouncing motion, the baby would be soothed. Jolly Jumper claims to have invented the baby jumper in 1910, using an axe handle for the spreader; however the baby jumper existed long before that. In the 1880s, various patents were granted for a ‚Äúnew and improved‚Äù baby jumpers, while in the 1830s, Goodyear foresaw the use of latex for baby jumpers. Risks Some professionals warn against potential safety issues when using a jumper for prolonged periods of time, claiming that it could cause muscle imbalance if the child is placed in a sitting position before they would be able to on their own. Choice, an Australian consumer organization, warns against the use of door jumpers because of the risk of the door clamps breaking.

At the outbreak of the war, Ilow enlisted into the Imperial army, rapidly advancing through the lower ranks. Through his close association with Imperial Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein, he attained the rank of Generalfeldmarschall. He was killed on 25 February 1634, in the Eger Bloodbath, the culmination of an internal purge of Wallenstein's supporters. Military career Ilow was born in 1585, to Neumark family of minor nobility. Ilow claimed that his lineage extended to Greece, his ancestors supposedly migrated to Germany during the reign of Henry the Fowler. After participating in his campaigns against the Hungarians, Wends, Moravians and Bohemians, Henry bestowed nobility upon him. Ilow entered Imperial service at the outbreak of the Bohemian Revolt, rapidly advancing through the lower ranks. On 11 December 1621, emperor Ferdinand II transferred the command of a regiment consisting of 1,000 cuirassiers to duke Adolf of Holstein-Gottorp. Ilow now at the rank of a colonel, assumed direct command of the regiment as the duke was too young of age to do so. The Holsteiners distinguished themselves at the Battle of Stadtlohn, where one of Ilow's officers captured William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Ilow paid the officer handsomely, securing the right to escort and personally present his prisoner at the Imperial court in Vienna. Ilow had acquired great riches through plundering enemy territories during the course of the campaign, lending the emperor 70,000 Goldgulden. He then bought a house in Prague as well as the Bohemian estates of Popovitz, Bukov, and Ladowetz. His marriage to widow Anna Albertine of Rziczan countess of Furstenberg, strengthened his ties with the Bohemian political elite represented by the Trczka and Kinsky families, while the estates of Olbramowitz and Drazkow were added to his possessions. In the spring of 1625, Ilow was recalled into active service campaigning in Hessen and Nassau, where his riders gained infamy for their plundering and violent demeanor. Following the Imperial victory at the Battle of Dessau Bridge, Imperial supreme commander Albrecht von Wallenstein departed for Silesia and later Hungary in order to pursue Gabriel Bethlen, leaving Ilow at Schmalkalden. In a letter towards Karl von Harrach, Wallestein states that the reason behind this decision was his resentment for Ilow whom he characterized as vain and gossipy. On 3 November 1627, Ilow was elevated to the status of Reichsfreiherr. On 27 November 1627, Ilow was present at Ferdinand III's crowning as king of Bohemia, he used the occasion in order to showcase his new coat of arms which bore an imperial laurel wreath. In May 1628, he received the command of a 600-man cavalry regiment from Philipp Cratz von Scharfenstein. He spent the following years, recruiting troops for other generals. In September 1631, he fought at the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631). In the early days of October 1631, he briefly occupied Zittau in Saxony before retreating to Bohemia which at the time faced a Saxon invasion. Despite the fact that Wallenstein was removed from command, Ilow continued to solicit his advice, significantly improving their relations. On 8 April 1632, Ilow was promoted into Feldmarschall-Lieutenant. On 13 April, the emperor formalized Wallenstein's return to the position of supreme commander. In April 1632, Ilow fought in Upper Lusatia, by October he had secured Zittau, L√∂bau, and G√∂rlitz. On 11 November, he helped relieve Broumov from a Saxon siege, spending the winter at Bohemia's northern frontier. In February 1633, he successfully stormed Reichenbach. On 4 June, he captured Nimptsch, which was completely destroyed by fire. Wallenstein employed Ilow as his personal envoy, delivering important messages to the emperor and his generals. On 19 October 1633, he was promoted to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall on Wallenstein's request, much to the dismay of more experienced commanders. He accompanied the Generalissimo in his pursuit of Hans Georg von Arnim-Boitzenburg in the vicinity of Forst, he was then sent back to Lusatia, recapturing G√∂rlitz on 30 October, following a costly engagement. Bautzen fell soon afterwards, Ilow extorted its citizens compelling them to pay a large sum of money. In December, Ilow returned to Bohemia. Ilow and the fall of Wallenstein Wallenstein was increasingly criticized for his passivity in face of a Swedish incursion into Bavaria and the collapse of Lorraine under French pressure. His dislike of courtly life and the influence exerted by the church upon the emperor created an axis of undercover opposition that launched a smear campaign against him. On 11 January 1634, Gundakar, Prince of Liechtenstein sent Ferdinand II an official request, recommending Wallenstein's liquidation. A day later, Wallenstein summoned his colonels to sign the First Pilsner Reverse, a declaration of personal loyalty, 49 of them signed immediately while Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch and Scherffenberg gathered signatures in Silesia and Upper Austria respectively. Numerous commanders signed the Reverse so as not to arouse suspicion, while at the same time a party centered around Ottavio Piccolomini began circulating an anonymous tract that summarized the army's grudges against Wallenstein. On 17 February, Scherffenberg was arrested in Vienna. On 18 February, a second patent was released accusing Wallenstein of conspiracy and condemning him to death, its publication was delayed so as not to split the army in two. Wallenstein's letters refuting the accusations against him remained unanswered, after realizing that the emperor was positioning troops in such a manner as to surround him he decided to flee to the Swedes. Wallenstein, Ilow and other loyal officers departed from their headquarters on 22 February along with 1,300 men. Irish colonel Walter Butler, the leader of a group of Irish and Scottish officers hired by Piccolomini to assassinate Wallenstein, was ordered by the unsuspecting general to follow them with his 900 dragoons. On 24 February, Wallenstein reached Eger, most of the trusted troops camped outside of the town as it was already garrisoned Butler's dragoons and other anti-Wallenstein elements.. The following day Ilow held a series of meetings with the would be assassins trying to persuade them to remain loyal to their commander. They made the decision to go on with Piccolomini's plan, fearing that they would be branded as rebels should they fail to do so. At 6.00 p.m., Wallenstein's inner circle consisting of Ilow, Adam Erdmann Trƒçka von L√≠pa, Vil√©m Kinsk√Ω and Captain Niemann were invited by the conspirators to the city's castle for a formal dinner. During the course of the dinner a servant nodded indicating that the conspirators were ready. Six dragoons burst into the dining hall shouting \\"Who is a good Imperialist?\\", Butler, John Gordon and Walter Leslie rose from the table yelling \\"Long live Ferdinand!\\". Kinsk√Ω was killed immediately, although he made a desperate attempt to fight back. Ilow grabbed his sword and charged at Gordon; before being able to strike he was knocked to the ground by the dragoons and killed, others met a similar fate. Wallenstein was killed in his residence at 10.00 p.m. An imperial decree equated the participants of the perpetrators of the Eger Bloodbath with executioners. The purge continued with the execution of Schaffgotsch; a number of generals were imprisoned and lost their commands, while the possessions of the accused were confiscated and redistributed. Ilow's daughter, who was born a few days before her father's death, secured the family a small portion of its former estates.

History The church dates from the early 15th century. The main body of the church was rebuilt in 1825, and there were further major alterations in 1907 by Charles Hodgson Fowler paid for by Mrs. Henry Stanton. The nave was lengthened westwards by when a new western doorway surmounted by a niche holding the figure of St Peter was inserted. A larger arch was built at the entrance to the chancel and a carved oak screen provided. The chancel was re-floored with black and white marble and a new reredos of oak and alabaster inserted. A new choir vestry was provided. The contractor was Messrs Bowman and Sons of Stamford. The decoration work was carried out by Mr. Ashforth of Lincoln, and Mr. Bridgeman of Lichfield. The opening service took place on 16 October 1907 attended by the Bishop of Southwell. The church was subjected to an unhappy dispute between the Squire and Parson which started in 1916. In 1915 the Revd. J.M. Trevor was inducted as incumbent. Mrs. Stanton from Snelston Hall, the servants and tenants were regular attenders at the services, and Mrs. Stanton conducted the choir. On the last Sunday in 1916, the Rector returning from 3 weeks of illness, was notified by the organist that Mrs. Stanton did not want the psalms to be sung at Sunday evening service. He said he would leave the matter to the congregation, but as there were a good number present when the service started, he decided that the psalms would be sung. Next morning he received a letter from Mrs Stanton who was annoyed by his decision. She cut off the subscription of ¬£10 towards the organist‚Äôs salary. This culminated in the Stantons and retinue no longer attending, and the families of the village stayed away too. In a further escalation, the male members of the choir, who were employees of the Squire, no longer attended, and the electric light, provided by the plant at Snelston Hall, was cut off. The Rector was denied access to keys kept at the Hall which gave access to the church clock and belfry, until a letter from the Bishop‚Äôs lawyer arrived. Things were still unresolved when the new wardens were appointed in April 1921.

These dedication cache materials relate more closely to household tasks, such as preparing food or working a field. The content and placement of these caches suggests a request for aid in acquiring daily necessities, such as food, as they dedicated their work places and homes to deities in exchange for a better harvest or other living needs. These contents also relate closely to the common mesoamerican idea that the people have an obligation to nourish the life-providing Earth as it does them. The location of a cache in relation to others can also play a significant role in dedication rituals. At the Classic Maya site in Tonina, three caches covered by a circular stone mark the north, south, and center of a ballcourt alley.Fox, John Gerard (1996) Playing with Power: Ballcourts and Political Ritual in Southern Mesoamerica. Current Anthropology 37(3): 483-509. The north and south caches contained eight obsidian blades, likely used in bloodletting, whereas the center cache contained nine. The number nine represents death and the underworld, dedicating the ballcourt to those concepts and deity, as well as emphasizing the directions of the Earth. Including this example, caches mark the center of nine ballcourts across Belize, Chiapas, and Central Mexico. Ballcourts were commissioned by the elite, and hosted ritual activities for the elite and commoners, associating them with power and wealth. These caches then dedicated the ballcourts, including their power and rituals, to Classic Maya deities.  Burials  Dedication rituals through burial were most common in the Maya highlands, in which they were used to commemorate dead ancestors, make an offering to their deities, and give life or nourishment to the community or structure the ritual serves. In Maya cultures, elites were buried as cremations in urns. Dedicated to their power, large ritual structures such as temples were built above these burials. The Maya Tikal Triple Ballcourt held two young female burials placed facing each other inside benches located under a central structure. Dedicatory burials are unique in that they utilize ancestors to worship ancestors, as well as provide an offering that had also once provided offerings to their deities, signifying both power and life- giving.  Sacrifice  Bodily sacrifice was commonplace in dedication rituals, whether in bloodletting or sacrificing a war victim, one of the many sacrificial rituals employed in Mesoamerica and perhaps during war the chief's daughter just for good luck . Sacrifice specifically represents a returning of life to the Earth and deities, who were seen as life-providers for the Mesoamerican people. The importance of sacrifice in Classic Maya culture can be seen in Structure O-13 at Piedras Negras where vessels of obsidian blades, stingray spines, and other bloodletting utensils lined the pathway along the structure.Joyce, Rosemary (1992) Ideology in Action: The Rhetoric of Classic Maya ritual in practice. Ancient Images, Ancient Thought: The Archaeology of Ideology, Papers from the 23rd Chac Mool Conference, ed. A. Sean Goldsmith, S. Garvie, D. Selin and J. Smith, pp. 497-506. These materials increased in count along the pathway, leading to a main room in which sacrifice rituals took place. These materials and their context clearly dedicate Structure O-13 to deity worship through sacrificial offerings.  Writing  Sacred writings were also used as dedicatory devices in ritual structures. The art of writing was controlled by the elite in Mesoamerica, and the skill passed down linearly. An example of this can be seen in Classic Maya Chichen Itza, in which elite women created architectural texts dedicating structures to their female ancestors and patron deities.McAnany, Patricia (2008) Shaping social difference: Political and ritual economy of Classic Maya royal courts. In Dimensions of Ritual Economy pp. 219-247. Research in Economic Anthropology. vol. 27. Emerald Group Publishing Limited. These gender-specific deities were given significant attention through the dedication of structures in their possession. Structure 23 in Yaxchilan embodies this concept with sacred writings, often including an initial glyph, verb, noun, prepositional phrase, and most importantly, the name of a possessor of the structure. This is so significant in dedication ritual because writing the name of a possessor to which the structure is dedicated gives permanence to that ownership. The quality of permanence held in writing dedication rituals gives power and importance to the relationship it creates.  Termination ritual  As the complement and counterpart of dedication ritual, termination ritual serves to destroy the link between a structure and the deity to which it was dedicated. In Temple XIV of Cerros, Belize, jade artifacts were found scattered and smashed on the floor of the temple, which had presumably once served in dedication caches for the same temple. Destroying these creations ceases their representation of the cosmos and religious ideas and ends the relationship between those ideas and the structure.

The journey itself holds a spiritual significance for the traveler because by participating in this ritual, they renew their faith and/or try to bring about a practical result. In the Maya faith, the believers may make a pilgrimage at any time of the year and to multiple places. Pilgrimages create networks that connect people and places over long distances, so as to transcend the limits of the local community as well as time. Maya pilgrimage displays many specific attributes unique to their culture even though they have been heavily influenced by the Catholic faith since the 15th century. In spite of that, they continue to make their pilgrimage to local shrine sites which are distinctly Maya. These ancient sites are used to communicate to deities or spirits and may be used to appeal to them for help. Though the images on these shrines may now represent Christian saints, aspects of the ancient Maya tradition still exists. The following will describe the fundamentals and purpose of Maya pilgrimage as well as the influence Christianity had on it. Ritual location To understand pilgrimage we must explore the locations where the Maya traveled. The natural places that attracted importance in Mesoamerican cultures were mountains, cliffs, boulders, caves, ruins, bodies of water, and islands. These places were usually isolated and remote so the Maya made journeys to visit them. Around 1500, Chichen Itza used to attract pilgrims from all the surrounding kingdoms to its large cenote; other pilgrims visited local shrines, such as those of Ix Chel and other goddesses on the islands off Yucat√°n's east coast. The Maya usually made shrines at these locations because they believed that the geographical significance created an easier place to communicate with spirits. Each location had one deity associated with it though the Maya could pray to any god they needed. For example, the \\"gremio\\" pilgrimage is held annually before each year's rainy season to appeal to the gods for a good season. Each day is dedicated to a different rain god and a different world direction. These ritual locales were identified archaeologically by finding the usual trappings associated with ritual. These included terraces, platforms, shrines, altars, incense, offerings, burials, and rock art. These items were created by the pilgrims to try to communicate with or to appease the gods or spirits in the area. Along with these certain geographical features, the site of the shrine often was a sacred place in which an apparition has appeared, inanimate objects were seen to have come to life, or a miracle has occurred. Nowadays, pilgrimages often involve reciprocal visits of the village saints (as represented by their statues), but also visits to farther-removed sanctuaries, as exemplified by the Q'eqchi' pilgrimages to their thirteen sacred mountains.Adams and Brady 2005: 301-327 Reasons for pilgrimage The purpose of these travels may be common place or they may have much spiritual meaning to the traveler. To the Maya, pilgrimage is a part of everyday life because they may make the journey to a sacred site for a commonplace reason. They can ask the deity to heal a sick family member, to have a good harvest that year, or they can ask for rain. Whatever the reason, the Maya can and will travel to these remote locations to appeal to the gods for assistance. And by making the right offering, the Maya may expect what they prayed for. How to make the pilgrimage To travel, one only needs the funds and a need to talk to the spirits. Usually, the strongest in the village make the journey, but all ages and different socioeconomic statuses are welcome to. Previously, the Maya would only walk to each site but nowadays, there is often transportation provided though some still opt for the traditional walk along ancient Maya roads. If one cannot make the trip, they can also donate money, food, or other goods to actual participants, thus making the pilgrimage in spirit. In this way, they can expect to have their name read in front of the shrine. Sometimes, if it is a movable object, the object of veneration may be taken on a journey to other shrine sites so more pilgrims have access to it. Outcome By making these pilgrimages, the participants gain several things. They gain the solidarity and bond among their village by going through this journey together. This creates solidarity between different villages because by making this expedition they gain an understanding among each other. The pilgrimage also creates lasting friendships through the generations because people of all ages are welcome to attend. Those who undertake the pilgrimage gain prestige and respect too. By participating in this ritual, they gain the acceptance and pride of their village. Another outcome from pilgrimages, though less expected, is the spread of ideas. Patel argues that pilgrimage was the reason for the spread of the Quetzalcoatl or feathered serpent cult all about Mesoamerica. And through the spread of this cult, the cult in turn also spread the Mixteca-Puebla art style. This art style, also known as International style, was used at a number of shrine sites and seemed to increase communication with foreign pilgrims more because there was less emphasis on text and more on common symbols which could be understood by all. By meeting at these pilgrimages or shrine sites, the travelers would meet and exchange ideas and sometimes even goods. By this exchange, the ideas and goods could travel long distances without the need for one person to facilitate the spread. Changing pilgrimage After the Spanish conquest, these pilgrimages changed somewhat to incorporate Catholic celebrations and saints. Of course, some of the pilgrimages stayed devoted to their traditional Maya gods so Catholic priests could not be present because it was deemed heretical by the Catholic Church. This combination of Christian and Maya beliefs left scholars divided over whether the Maya could truly be considered Christians. Though they adhere to the classic forms of Christianity, like prayers, mass, worship of saints, and celebration of events on the Christian calendar, the Maya celebrate much like their ancestors did through dance, pilgrimages, and other pre-conquest rituals. Although the Maya have not always been Christian, they have used the cross since before the Spanish conquest. One such pilgrimage to the village of Xok√©n in Yucat√°n is centered around a large carved stone cross. The local Maya have inhabited this area since before the arrival of the Spanish and several 16th century Maya documents have written accords about the pilgrimage to this site. This cross is found to be placed at the end of an ancient Maya road that linked several of the ancient Maya Postclassic cities. Also interesting is that these cities were all at or near major sites of rebellion against the Spanish. Another site of pre-conquest crosses lies at Chumpon, where there is a myth that crosses appeared on trees of mahogany and spoke to the Maya. It was said that these crosses protected the Maya and helped them struggle against their enemy. This tradition of the cross symbol, though developed separately in the Maya and Christian societies, continues to link the two traditions together.

History The present church is the third one on this site, the first being Anglo-Saxon and the second a Late Norman church. This second church was built c. 1179 by John Fitzherbert, 3rd Lord of Norbury and dedicated to St Barlacus. The saint appears in the centre light of the south window; he is portrayed holding a pastoral staff in his left hand and a book in his right. Underneath there are the words Sactus Burlok Abbas. The name also appears as Saint Barlok in a 1491 charter.Cox, J. Charles. 1877. Notes on the Churches of Derbyshire. Page 246. Chesterfield, Edmonds. Saint Barlock has been identified with Saint Finbarr, an Irish abbot and bishop of the 7th century and the patron saint of Cork. The dedication may arise from John Fitzherbert having been Governor of Waterford for 3 years c. 1174 Born in the second half of the 6th century, Finnbar was baptised Lochan, but was later called Fionn Barr or the Fair-Headed One. His life was recorded in the manuscript Lives of Finn Barr.Guest, Walter Ravely. 1937. Church of St Fimbarrus. Fowey, Cornwall. W.J. Jory. The parish church of Fowey in Cornwall is dedicated to him, as St Fimbarrus. This Cornish church was built c. 1170 by William Fitzturold, the name of the patron saint being given as Barrianus.Keast, John. 1987. Book of Fowey. Buckingham: Barracuda. The present church of St Mary and St Barlock was built piecemeal over a period of about 200 years. The chancel is the earliest part of the church, and is unusually large in relation to the rest of the fabric. It is long, and is both wider and higher than the nave (which at is slightly longer). The design of the chancel windows' tracery indicates a building date of c. 1300‚Äì1310, as does the contemporary armorial glass. Two of the arms depicted are those of Otton de Grandson who left England in 1307, and Robert the Bruce, at war with England from 1306. The roof of the chancel is a later 15th-century wooden construction; external buttresses and internal shafts running up to the roofline indicate that the original design may have intended a fan vault, never built. The south tower, nave and chapel east of the tower were built by Nicholas Fitzherbert (d. 1473), he or his son Ralph (d. 1483) built the north aisle, and his grandson John Fitzherbert (d. 1513) built the south-west chapel, which was finished in 1517. Much of the stained glass added by the Fitzherberts survives; these are for the most part figures painted in grisaille. In the south-east chapel there is a window showing the donor and his family. The church was restored in 1841. New open stalls were inserted, replacing the closed pews. It reopened on 7 July 1842. In was restored again in 1899‚Äì1900 at a cost of ¬£3,800 () by Naylor and Sale, architects of Derby. Some work was done by Edwin Haslam of Derby, but the main contractor was W. Gould of Tutbury. It was re-opened in February 1900 by the Bishop of Southwell. Fitzherbert memorials Ralph Fitzherbert in Alabaster Ralph's wife Nicholas Fitzherbert's tomb Benedicta Fitzherbert's tomb There are a number of memorials to the Fitzherbert family in the church, including Sir Henry (d. 1315) depicted as a cross-legged knight, Nicholas (d. 1473) carved in alabaster with attendant mourners, and Sir Ralph Fitzherbert (d. 1483) and his wife, again in alabaster. The crossed legs of Henry, 6th Lord of Norbury (c. 1275‚Äìc. 1315) indicate his profession of Christian faith and not participation in a Crusade; although his year of death is uncertain it is known that he was not a Crusader. Nicholas Fitzherbert, High Sheriff of Derbyshire and 11th Lord of Norbury, died in 1473. He is shown in full plate armour with a collar of alternating suns and roses with a pendant of the White Lion of the House of Marche, the badge of Edward IV. There is a small angel supporting his right foot. Ralph's feet rest on a lion; next to it and under Ralph's shoe crouches the small figure of a bedesman. The bearded bedesman is telling his rosary for the souls of the departed. Ralph bears the Yorkist livery collar of alternating suns and roses, with the White Boar of Richard III as a pendant. Since the destruction by fire of the wooden effigy of Ralph Neville (d. 1484) at Brancepeth, this is the only surviving representation of a boar pendant. The armour portrayed on the effigy of Ralph Fitzherbert has been reproduced as a fully functional suit of plate.Ralph Fitzherbert armour An incised effigy on an alabaster slab of a woman tied in a shroud has been identified as that of Benedicta (d. 1531), wife of John Fitzherbert, 13th Lord. The effigy is surrounded with four coats of arms, one of which is of the Bradbourne family of Benedicta. Above the figure is a worn inscription with the date 1531. John Fitzherbert separated from Benedicta early in their marriage. In his will he disinherited Benedicta and denied paternity of her children, stating \\"‚Ä¶Bennett my wyffe hath been of lewd and vile disposicion and cowde not be content with me but forsaken my houshoolde and company and lyffed in other places where yt pleased her.\\" The great east window of the chapel originally held 14th-century glass depicting a large scene with full- sized figures. By 1770 the glass was in very bad condition. At that time the rectors of parishes were personally responsible for the financing of repairs to their churches, so the rector of Norbury, the Rev. S. Mills, had the window bricked up with the glass remaining in situ. In 1830 the then rector, the Rev. Thomas Bingham,Noble, Thomas (Ed.). 1829. The History, Gazetteer and Directory of the County of Derby. p 587. Stephen Glover. was approached by a Roman Catholic family of Yorkshire with a view to purchasing the glass. Whether the glass was removed and sold, or stolen (as happened at Haddon Hall), or had disintegrated is not known, but it had disappeared by 1842 when the window was opened up again and filled with 15th-century glass taken from the rest of the church windows.Camm, Dom Bede. 1910.

The species which make up the genus Belzebub were formerly placed in the genus Lucifer but were separated to form Belzebub after a cladistic analysis. They are very small planktonic and benthic prawns with an extreme lateral compression of the carapace with elongated mandibles and anteriors of the pereiopods but lacking pereiopods 4 and 5 and any gills. The pereiopods either lack chelae or they are substantially reduced. The sixth abdominal segment of males has two ventral processes and the telson has a strong ventral process. Distinction from Lucifer Belzebub is distinguished from the related Lucifer by have medium length eyestalks and by both sexes having similar eyes, in the species in Lucifer there is sexual dimoprphism in the size of the eyes. In addition, the ventral process of the two on the male's sixth segment is straight and tapering rather than curved and obtuse. Etymology The generic name Belzebub is derived from an older English version of the biblical Beelzebub and the authors of the name used this version as it was shorter than others. They chose it because it is an alternative name for the devil who is also referred to as Lucifer, although in the case of the genus Lucifer the name literally means \\"light bearer\\" in Latin referring to the bioluminescence produced by the prawns in that genus. Species There are 5 species which make up the genus Belzebub: * Belzebub chacei (Bowman, 1967)  east coast of South Africa and Madagascar east to Hawaii. * Belzebub faxoni (Borradaile, 1915)  Western Atlantic from Long Island Sound south to Rio de Janeiro, also recorded off West Africa. * Belzebub hanseni (Nobili, 1905)  from Madagascar and the Red Sea, east to the South China Sea and the South Pacific including Tasmania. It has also now been reported in the Mediterranean, probably as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal. * Belzebub intermedius (Hansen, 1919)  from the Gulf of Oman east to Japan. * Belzebub penicillifer (Hansen, 1919)  Indian Ocean, east to the Philippines and northern Australia.

Description 150px L. inornatus commonly reaches a total length (including tail) of , with a recorded maximum of . Individuals may be dark olive to black, or uniformly light brown to olive grey-green, with a uniform or slightly lighter belly, especially the chin, throat and neck. Distribution and habitat The olive house snake occurs in South Africa and Swaziland, where it is found along the eastern coastal belt from the southwestern Cape through East London to the Transkei, and extending through low-veld regions of the KwaZulu-Natal, the Mpumalanga escarpment and the Limpopo Province. It inhabits coastal bushveld, fynbos and grassveld where sufficient moisture is present, and may occur close to human habitations. Reports of occurrence from Namibia remain unconfirmed. Ecology L. inornatus is nocturnal and generally terrestrial, hunting on the ground. It is generally slow moving and docile but may bite when molested. Females lay 5‚Äì15 eggs. The olive house snake feeds on lizards, small rodents and other snakes. It is preyed on by various types of raptors, including the snake eagle and the secretary bird, as well as by other snakes.

Gerhard Lang (1985)  Personal life and academic career  During his high school years in Ravensburg, Lang was one of the students of Karl Bertsch. He started his studies on botany and zoology with minors in chemistry and physics at the University of Freiburg in 1946 and changed to the University of G√∂ttingen where he received the PhD degree in 1952 for his study on the late-glacial history of the vegetation and flora of southwestern Germany, supervised by Franz Firbas. Between 1952 and 1975 Lang worked at the Landessammlungen f√ºr Naturkunde (today: Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde) in Karlsruhe as curator and as deputy director of the museum. In 1962 Lang became lecturer in Geobotany at the University of Karlsruhe and in 1966 he submitted his habilitation thesis on the macrophyte vegetation of Lake Constance. Karlsruhe University appointed him professor at the Botanical Institute in 1972. In 1975 he was appointed full professor and director of the Systematisch- Geobotanisches Institut and Bern Botanical Garden, University of Bern, Switzerland, succeeding Max Welten. In 1989, after Lang‚Äôs retirement and becoming professor emeritus he moved back to southern Germany, the region where he grew up.  Research trips and study visits  Lang travelled widely as part of his research and botanical activities, including visits to the French Massif Central in 1956; Botany School Cambridge, UK in 1959; the Australian Alps and Australian National University, Canberra in 1965; Siberia in 1971; Armenia in 1975; western Canada and western USA in 1978; tropical and central Australia in 1981; and Argentina in 1983.  Research  During his time in Karlsruhe, Lang‚Äôs research focus lay on vegetation mapping at the scale of 1:25,000 based on classical plant sociological relev√©s of the Upper Rhine Plain, the Black Forest, and the Lake Constance region as well as the study of lake and mire deposits with regard to the vegetation history of south-western Germany. During his time in Bern his research centred on the Alpine region with special reference to the study of dynamic vegetation processes and climate change in the past, as well as the development of multi- proxy approaches in palaeoecology. He introduced new equipment and methodologies, especially with regard to subaquatic coring from a raft that allowed sediment sampling from the centre of lakes, which provided new insights into local and regional reconstructions of past environmental conditions. Consequently, his research on vegetation ecology and history made the transition to modern multi-proxy palaeoecology. After his retirement, Lang published a major text on European Quaternary vegetation history.

Once a booming area of Irish Moss collection, Naufrage is known today for lobster and tuna fishing, and tourism.  Settlement  Little is known about the early days of settlement in the Naufrage area. Prior to any French settlement there is evidence of Mi'Kmaq burial grounds near the Shipwreck Point Lighthouse. After French settlement due to shipwrecks, Scottish settlers arrived in 1771 and 1772. Apart from a cemetery on the west side of Naufrage harbour, little evidence remain of these earliest French residents.  Shipwrecks  The name of the first French ship that brought settlers to the area is unknown today, and only its wreck date of 1719 remains. Both the Asia and the Georgina sank in the Northumberland Strait west of Naufrage in 1939. Between November 1 and November 8, 1906, four vessels wrecked near the Shipwreck Point lighthouse. The Sovinto and the Orpheus were wrecked at Priest Pond, while the Olga sank at Black Bush (present-day Hermanville). The Turret Bell sank at Cable Head.  Fishing and Industry  Up until the middle of the 20th century, small scale fishing was done up and down the northern coast of the Prince Edward Island, with several vessels departing from 15 small ports. There were three lobster canneries located at Naufrage Harbour. Fisherman also caught, processed and cured herring, cod, mackerel, hake, and haddock. The canneries have closed, but Naufrage remains a popular place for lobster fishing, with over 100 boats fishing out of the harbour.  Shipwreck Point Lighthouse  One notable feature of the Naufrage area is the Shipwreck Point Lighthouse. It was built in 1913 by the Anandale Lumber Company at a cost of $3,213.81 The original lighthouse was a square, two-storey structure that housed a fourth-order lens in its lantern room. The lower storeys provided living quarters for the lighthouse keeper and consisted of eight rooms. The lighthouse was painted white below, while the lens room was painted red. The first lighthouse keeper was Francis (Frank) MacKinnon. The lighthouse was 11.5m tall, and displayed a white flashing light. In 1967, a new Shipwreck Point lighthouse was built slightly west of its original location, and its operation was automated. It is an octagonal tower, at a height of 13.5m. It is one of only two concrete lighthouses on the Island. Tne new Shipwreck Point lighthouse went into service on 27 September 1967. Its beacon exhibits a three-second flash followed by a two-second eclipse, a cycle that repeats every five seconds. The original 1913 lighthouse is now privately owned.  Naufrage Today  Today Naufrage garners much attention as a tourist attraction during the summer months. It is home to the Shipwreck Point Cafe. Under a 2016 funding grant from the Government of Canada in partnership with ACOA, Naufrage received more than $76,000 to upgrade infrastructure at the harbour, including the addition of commercial kiosk (which currently is home to a small ice-cream shop), a shaded deck area which overlooks the beach, and public washrooms. In 2016 a renovation and expansion of the facilities at the Big Cape School was begun, providing similar amenities. As a part of this upgrade, the Red Rock Adventure Company was established to offer guided bike tours of the Naufrage area..

Their maximum elevation is about 350 metres above sea level (NN). The valley of the Emmer divides the uplands into the Ottenstein Plateau in the east and Pyrmont Heights (Pyrmonter H√∂hen) in the west. In these muschelkalk hills lies the Pyrmont Basin (Pyrmonter Talkessel) on the fault lines of which mineral and brine springs rise, and to which the town of Bad Pyrmont owes its status as a spa town. The Ottenstein Plateau is used for agriculture. On the hill of Pyrmonter Berg is the only large area of deciduous forest. In spite of its poor soils, agriculture dominates: grasslands follow the rivers in the valleys. Forestry is carried out on the Pyrmont Heights.

The film stars Devika Daftardar, Milind Soman, and Rajeshwari Sachdev along with Uttara Baokar and Jyoti Subhash in supporting roles. The film had its theatrical release on 18 October 2013 and won several awards including two National Film Awards at the 60th National Film Awards; the Best Female Playback Singer for Arati Ankalikar-Tikekar and the Best Music Direction (Songs) for Shailendra Barve. The director-producer Subhash Ghai, the founder of Mukta Arts, was not initially part of the film and was approached when the director duo faced financial problems.  Plot  Revati Sathe is a National Award winning documentary maker who is approached by producer Shirin Dastane to direct a film based on a short story Darpan ‚Äì The Mirror written by Tara Deuskar. It was Shirin's husband Dinkar's wish to direct a film on this story but being paralysed since a decade is unable to fulfill his dream. Shirin narrates the story in short to Revati stating that it is a story of a woman's surrender. The story is of king Satyasheel whose step-mother puts him in a wedlock with her niece Maalvika. The king however finds his love in a court singer whose reflection is formed in his soul's mirror and she surrenders to the king in love. Revati accepts the project as a challenge from her routine documentary making and sets to write the script with help of the original writer. Deuskar, the original writer contradicts with Shirin and calls it a story of oppression and begins narration. Darpan starts in 1946 at the palace of the princely state of Herwad where on the occasion of Satyasheel's son's thread ceremony singer Raina-bi from Banaras arrives and presents her singer daughter Bhairavi. Impressed by Bhairavi's soulful singing, Satyasheel falls in love with her. While Maalvika is a feminist and avid reader of English literature, she cares nothing about the increasing closeness of the two. On one occasion, Satyasheel takes Bhairavi on a hunting trip and they spend night together while Maalvika is on Europe trip. The following day Satyasheel also leaves for Europe and Bhairavi assuming it as desertion and leaves to Banaras. Upon return, Satyasheel is heart-broken and loses interest in administration. Years later, he attends a meeting in Bombay related to the privy purse privileges and accidentally meets Bhairavi and brings her to the palace along with her 7-years old daughter Nisha who has a birthmark on her face just like that of Satyasheel. In present day, Revati is struggling with a divorce from her husband as she wants to pursue her career, Hemangini is finding it hard to adjust with the daughter of her lover and Shirin lives with a sorrow of not having her own kids for keeping her promise to Dinkar's family after he took her as his wife in his second marriage. All the four ladies, Revati, Hemangini, Shirin, and Deuskar have different endings of the film in their mind. While Shirin's end involves separation of all three characters, Hemangini believes that they all would stay together. Revati brings in different end suggesting that Satyasheel stays with Bhairavi and queen Maalvika on the other hand takes the young Nisha to Europe and looks after her well being. It is hinted that author Deuskar is Nisha, the real life daughter of Satysheel and Bhairavi. The film ends with Hemangini settling her issues with her lover's daughter, Dinkar dying, and Revati deciding to not divorce Ranveer.

Founded in 2013, their activities include political campaigns‚Äîsuch as ballot initiatives for sustainable food, fundamental rights for primates or a ban on factory farming. The organization also conducts research on how to most effectively reduce the suffering of human and non-human sentient beings. Sentience Politics was established as a project of the Effective Altruism Foundation, whose other projects include Raising for Effective Giving and the Foundational Research Institute. Sentience Politics is now an independent Swiss association.  Campaigns   Fundamental rights for primates  In June 2016, Sentience Politics began collecting signatures for a ballot initiative on fundamental rights for primates in Basel, Switzerland. The proposed reforms would revise the cantonal constitution to include \\"right to life and respect for the physical and mental integrity\\" for non-human primates. According to Sentience Politics, Basel's existing animal welfare regulations are not sufficient to protect primates from death and suffering, for example in pharmaceutical experiments and in confinement at the Basel Zoo. If adopted, the reform would allow observational studies on primates but very few medical experiments, and would require the Basel Zoo to make significant changes in its primate breeding and enclosures. The campaign is supported by several Green Party members. According to project manager Meret Schneider, the campaign is a first step in extending rights to non-human animals.  Sustainable food  On October 10, 2016, Sentience Politics, along with animal advocacy organizations Vebu and the Albert Schweitzer Foundation for Our Contemporaries began collecting signatures for a citizen‚Äôs initiative in Berlin Kreuzberg that would require all schools and the town hall to offer a vegan option every day. This is the first vegan citizen‚Äôs initiative in Germany. They need to collect signatures from 3% of the electorate (about 6,000) by April 2017. There are about 95,000 vegans in Berlin, and the city is considered the vegan capitol of Europe with more than 50 vegan restaurants. Sentience Politics has launched similar initiatives in Zurich, Basel and Lucerne, Switzerland. Sentience Politics explained to House of Democracy and Human Rights that the vegan options will help mitigate climate change. The initiative will also help reduce the suffering of farmed animals. There has been resistance from cafeteria directors, who fear that the vegan options would cost more. The District Office estimates that a vegan meal would cost 1.25 Euro more than a conventional meal.  Initiative to ban factory farming in Switzerland  In 2018, Sentience Politics started gathering signatures for a people's initiative to ban factory farming in Switzerland. In September 2019, the initiative committee submitted more than 100,000 verified signatures in the Swiss capital of Bern. The Swiss Federal Council has announced that they will present a direct counter proposal to the initiative.

Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, students progress to project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.  History  freeCodeCamp was launched in October 2014 and incorporated as Free Code Camp, Inc. The founder, Quincy Larson, is a software developer who took up programming after graduate school and created freeCodeCamp as a way to streamline a student's progress from beginner to being job-ready. In a 2015 podcast interview, he summarized his motivation for creating freeCodeCamp as follows: > freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and > circuitous way I learned to code. I'm committing my career and the rest of > my life towards making this process as efficient and painless as possible. > [...] All those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are > things that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp. The original curriculum focused on MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js and was estimated to take 800 hours to complete. Many of the lessons were links to free material on other platforms, such as Codecademy, Stanford, or Code School. The course was broken up into ‚ÄúWaypoints‚Äù (quick, interactive tutorials), ‚ÄúBonfires‚Äù (algorithm challenges), ‚ÄúZiplines‚Äù (front-end projects), and ‚ÄúBasejumps‚Äù (full-stack projects). Completing the front-end and full-stack projects awarded the student with respective certificates. The curriculum was updated in January 2016 to rely less on outside material, remove the unconventional section names, and switch focus from AngularJS to React.js as the front-end library of choice. There were a number of additions to the coursework, including D3.js and Sass, which brought the total time estimate to 2,080 hours and two more certificates, data visualization, and back-end.  Quincy Larson  Quincy Larson was a school director for six years before he started to learn to code so that he could create tools for making schools more efficient. His own journey into learning to code was long and winding and he recognized the need for a single-track curriculum for newbie developers. Upon analyzing data on coding boot camps in the US and realizing how inaccessible coding education was to the masses, he set out to create a fully-online inclusive free platform for peer-driven learning of coding - the result of which is freeCodeCamp. He lives in Texas with his family and spends his time working on freeCodeCamp, writing and interviewing authors for the freeCodeCamp publication, co-ordinating open source projects such as Chapter (a free MeetUp alternative), advocating for a free and open internet and playing with his two young kids.  Curriculum  The self-paced curriculum involves 1,400 hours of interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800 hours of contributing to open-source projects for nonprofits and is constantly expanded by more challenges and projects. This translates into about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, APIs and Microservices, and Information Security and Quality Assurance. Participants receive a certificate after completing each section. The curriculum emphasizes pair programming, intended to foster a culture of collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome a student's doubts about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as ‚Äúimpostor syndrome‚Äù). The languages and technologies currently taught by freeCodeCamp include HTML5, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js,Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.  Nonprofit work  As students of freeCodeCamp finish all certificates of the curriculum, they get the opportunity, and are encouraged, to work with nonprofit organizations. Examples have been Indonesia-based nonprofit Kopernik and People Saving Animals. In 2016, freeCodeCamp announced their \\"Open Source for Good\\" initiative, which extends and open sources their nonprofit work to all nonprofits and organizations to use. Within ten months of launching, the initiative has created seven open-source tools. Mail for Good is one of the projects, which helps organizations send bulk email messages at a low cost, which serves as a cheaper alternative to services such as MailChimp.  Reception  freeCodeCamp's platform is used by about 350,000 unique visitors per month, with students from over 160 countries. According to Alexa, freeCodeCamp is ranked around 1,632 globally and around 1,746 in the United States in terms of monthly traffic. freeCodeCamp has international, community- run groups where students can interact in person. Some groups have been featured in local news, citing freeCodeCamp as an introduction to programming in order to fill the estimated vacancy in programming-related jobs in the next decade.

History The building was originally known as the Loxley Congregational Chapel and was constructed in 1787 at a cost of ¬£1,000 by some of the worshippers at the Church of St Nicholas, Bradfield. It was built for the curate at St Nicholas‚Äô Benjamin Greaves who was about to be dismissed and his parishioners wanted him to stay in the area. Upon completion the chapel, which was set back 100 metres from Loxley Road had the look of a large house constructed from squared gritstone with Venetian windows. The local Bishop was asked to consecrate the building upon its opening but refused because it did not have an east window. In its early years the church was utilised as an Anglican place of worship with Benjamin Greaves continuing to preach until he was appointed to a new post at Stoney Middleton.Around Bradfield, Loxley and Hillsborough, Malcolm Nunn, Chalford Publishing, 1996, , Historical Details. Mr Greaves was succeeded by a Church of England minister, the Reverend Flockton. By1798 the building was being rented by Protestant Dissenters or Independents and they changed its name to The Loxley Independent Church when they bought the building outright. In 1802 the Independents appointed their first minister Daniel Dunkerley, who was incumbent for 18 years until his death, he was buried in the churchyard.National Archives Gives some history. Retrieved 8 January 2017. David Dunkerley was the next minister, he was no relation to Daniel, remaining until he emigrated to Canada in 1830. Reverend Cullen (1830-1836) was succeeded by the Reverend John Hanson, known as the \\"Vicar of Loxley\\", who was minister for 18 years. Thomas France was minister for 35 years (1854-1889) eventually dying in November 1898, aged 83. Parishioners placed a remembrance tablet to him in the church. According to the Religious Census of 1851 an average congregation at an afternoon service was 200 people. A new school-room and minister's house was built in 1855, the first stone being laid on 30 April by Alderman Francis Hoole, Esq. former Lord Mayor of Sheffield.

Modern times and 2016 fire The church closed in 1993 with the building gradually deteriorating into a ruinous state over the years. The churchyard which surrounds the church on three sides became overgrown. Despite efforts to keep the interior secure, people broke into the church and caused substantial vandalism. In the early hours of 17 August 2016 the church caught fire and was severely damaged by the flames.

Though primarily active in the Golan Heights, the unit has been deployed in various warzones of western Syria, fighting against many different Syrian opposition forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Golan Regiment is notable insofar as it was the first government unit during the Syrian Civil War that was founded by Free Syrian Army (FSA) defectors.  History   Rebellion and return to the government side  The al-Mutasim Battalion announces its formation, declaring that it intends to defend the \\"great revolution\\" against the \\"corrupt\\" Assad government and its \\"thugs\\" and \\"mercenaries\\". The beginnings of the Golan Regiment trace back to 2011, when its later leader Majid Himoud volunteered for the Syrian Army. According to Himoud, the officers in his division abused him and other soldiers, whereupon they decided to defect. In December 2011, they formed a Free Syrian Army unit under Himoud's leadership, the al-Mutasim Battalion, and began to fight against the government near the border with Israel. Allied with other local rebel groups, Himoud's men fought at Jabata, Khan Arnabah, Madinat al-Baath, Beer Ajam, and Breika, and made good progress against the government. As time went on, however, Himoud became increasingly dissatisfied with his allies; he later claimed that some groups such as Alwiya al-Furqan \\"wouldn‚Äôt even fight, they would come to the battlefield after the clashes had ended, take pictures and videos next to destroyed buildings and tanks, and then send them back to their financiers in Jordan or the Gulf states in order to collect their paychecks\\". Others he accused of closely working with Israel, which he considered a \\"red line\\" Syrians should not cross. These factors led Himoud and many of his men to reconsider their role as rebels, and in late 2013 he eventually contacted the mayor of Khan Arnabah, who was his relative and the NDF commander whose troops he was primarily fighting. The two agreed to a local ceasefire, and after eight months of negotiations, Himoud and dozens of his fighters handed themselves over to the government. They received an amnesty by president Bashar al-Assad, and formed the \\"Golan Regiment\\" as National Defence Forces unit/Popular Committee, centered in Khan Arnabah. The al-Mutasim Battalion members who disagreed with Himoud's decision and refused to defect instead joined other rebel groups. Since its foundation, the Golan Regiment has grown by recruiting government loyalists into its ranks, for example from Hader, a mostly Druze town that is generally considered to be staunchly pro-Assad.  As NDF unit  = Fighting in northern Quneitra 2015‚Äì16 = In course of the Quneitra offensive in June 2015, the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade first held two strategic significant hills against numerous rebel assaults, and then aided the Syrian Army in retaking Tal Hamr and lifting the siege of Hader. They consequently helped to fend off further attacks against Hader by the Southern Front and allied mujahideen. Throughout July, the Golan Regiment helped to defend several towns and hills in the Golan Heights against various Southern Front-led attacks, and participated in a major government counter-offensive in the area. rebel T-72 shoots at the government positions on Tal Kroum, which were held by the Golan Regiment at the time. In September 2015, the regiment held reconciliation talks with Free Syrian Army (FSA) units that held Jabatha Al-Khasheb, Beit Jinn, and Taranjah, though in the end the talks failed and fighting was resumed. As result, FSA and al-Nusra Front fighters launched another offensive to capture Hader and the surrounding countryside, with the Golan Regiment once again attempting to hold its positions at the frontline. On 2 October, the Islamist Jaish al-Haramoun alliance and several FSA units launched another offensive in Quneitra, first attacking Tall Ahmar, which was defended by the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade. After a fierce, two-days long battle, the hill fell into rebel hands and the NDF defenders were forced to withdraw. The Golan Regiment, along with other NDF and army units, launched a counter-attack to recapture Tall Ahmar on 7 October, which was repelled. Opposition troops then also took control of the nearby \\"UN hill\\", though NDF forces, including the Golan Regiment, reversed this rebel gain a few hours later. In course of the next weeks, the Golan Regiment helped to recapture all positions taken by rebel forces during the offensive. In late December 2015, the Golan Regiment participated in a government attack on West Al-Samdaniyah, which was captured after hard fighting; soon after its capture, however, the army retreated from the town for unknown reasons, so that it was retaken by rebels. The regiment and other government units once again held reconciliation talks with local FSA rebels in the following January. Later that month, the 9th Armoured Division's 90th Brigade and the Golan Regiment successfully ambushed an al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham convoy near the Shebaa farms. On 29 January, the Golan Regiment helped to repel renewed rebel attacks against the contested hill of Tal Kroum. = Expanded operations 2016‚Äì17 = Beginning with February 2016, when the unit sent its fighters north to participate in the first government offensive to retake ISIL-held Al-Tabqa Military Airport, the Golan Regiment became far more active outside of Quneitra Governorate. Though the aforementioned offensive eventually stalled and was discontinued, the Golan Regiment also aided the recapture of Palmyra from ISIL in March. Later in June, its militiamen were once again involved in another attempt by the government to regain Al-Tabqa Military Airport; which ended in a complete defeat as the pro-government forces were routed by ISIL counter-attacks. Meanwhile, the Golan Regiment continued its defence of the Hader area. On 6 June the Criterion Brigades launched an offensive called \\"At Your Service Darayya\\" in order to draw government forces from the Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat to reinforce the front in Quneitra. The Brigades allegedly seized 2 villages, which was promptly denied by the Golan Regiment. On 28 July, the Israel Defense Forces attacked the Golan Regiment, launching missiles at the convoy of Majid Himoud and two mortar emplacements of the unit at Madinat al-Baath. While Himoud survived, the militia denounced Israel for its \\"Zionist\\" attacks. The following September saw a resurgence in the fighting for the Golan Heights, as Jihadist-led rebels launched a large-scale offensive in the area, with the Golan Regiment once again at the forefront in the defense of Hader. Throughout the battle, the Golan Regiment accused Israel of supporting the Islamist rebels, and on 17 September, the unit once again became the target of an Israeli Air Force (IAF) strike that killed one and wounded 5 of its militiamen. The strike was in retaliation for a stray mortar shell that had hit Israeli territory. On the other side, the pro-opposition Al-Etihad accused the Golan Regiment of having disguised Hezbollah fighters in its ranks. While the rebel offensive was eventually repelled, a later government counter-offensive supported by the Golan Regiment equally yielded no gains. Meanwhile, after the Syrian Revolutionaries Front (SRF)'s branch in Jubata al-Khashab collapsed amid internal discord, the local SRF commander defected to the Golan Regiment. The unit spearheaded a government attack in November 2016 that secured the northern part of a strategic highway in the Golan Heights. In December, the Golan Regiment sent reinforcements to the Tiyas Military Airbase in an attempt to halt a massive ISIL offensive in the region. On 17 and 26 January 2017, the regiment reportedly helped to repel two rebel attacks in the areas around Hader. On 19 March, the Israeli Air Force targeted the Golan Regiment commander Yasser Hussein al-Sayyed with a drone as he was travelling to Damascus by car. Both he and his driver were killed. The attack was seen as Israeli retaliation for the attempt of the Syrian Air Defense Force to shoot down an IAF jet that had bombarded Hezbollah positions near Palmyra. Meanwhile, the unit also helped countering rebel offensives in Jobar and northern Hama, and took part in the operations in the Syrian Desert in course of which the government again retook Palmyra and pushed back ISIL in eastern Homs Governorate. On 16 June, a suicide bomber struck Majid Himoud as he was meeting with other Golan Regiment fighters in Khan Arnabah; two members of the unit were killed instantly, while Himoud was wounded and brought to a hospital. There he succumbed to his wounds two days later. He was replaced by Khaled Abaza as chief commander of the militia, while Yassin Salibi became the new head of the Golan Regiment's First Battalion. Later that month, the Golan Regiment aided the Syrian Army and other pro-government militias in repelling a major rebel offensive against Madinat al-Baath; in course of the fighting, the unit was once again bombed by the Israeli Air Force. The Golan Regiment helped to repel a Tahrir al-Sham-led attack on Hader in September 2017. In late 2017, the Golan Regiment relocated much of its forces from other regions of Syria to the Golan Heights in response to rumors about another rebel offensive. Meanwhile, disputes erupted among the Golan Regiment's leadership. After becoming the new leader of the militia, Khaled Abaza had grown increasingly powerful, having been appointed as head of Ba'ath Party's branch in Quneitra Governorate and effectively taking control of Khan Arnabah. He eventually tried to oust Yassin Salibi as leader of the First Battalion, but Yassin found the support of the Quneitra Hawks Brigade and the al-Bustan Association of pro-government businessman Rami Makhlouf, both of which were wary of Kaled's power. In consequence, the Golan Regiment's Fist Battalion and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade forces in Khan Arnabah, supported by the al-Bustan Association, merged to form the \\"National Shield of the Patriotic Forces\\" in December 2017. This new formation was about 1,500 strong and to be led by Mohammed al-Hajj. This development reduced Khaled's control to the Golan Regiment's Second and Third Battalion. The \\"National Shield\\" then took part in the Beit Jinn offensive. In March 2018, the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade occupied Point 99, a hill west of Beit Jinn, as result of the agreement between the government and rebel forces following the Beit Jinn offensive's conclusion. Artillery fire again struck Israeli territory during renewed clashes in Quneitra Governorate in July 2018, whereupon the Israeli military responded by bombarding areas in Al-A'ayyaz near Khan Arnabah that were controlled by the Golan Regiment.  Organization  The Golan Regiment is split into three parts: The \\"First Battalion\\" of Khan Arnabah, the \\"Second Battalion\\" of Hader, and the \\"Third Battalion\\" of Jaba. The founder of the militia, Majid Himoud, served as both chief commander and leader of the First Battalion before his death in June 2017. Thereafter, the militia's overall leader was Khaled Abaza, a Circassian from Beer Ajam and the son of Brigadier Walid Abaza who served as head of the Political Security Directorate's branch in Hama during the Islamist uprising in Syria. By late 2017, the battalions were led by Yassin Salibi (First), Abu Mashhour (Second), and Abu Suhaib (Third). Another notable officer in the Golan Regiment was Yasser Hussein al- Sayyed.

It is situated in the stanitsa of Starocherkasskaya (the former city of Cherkassk), Rostov Oblast, Russia.  History  In 1650, during the siege of Azov, the defending Cossacks vowed to build a wooden cathedral on the square where the cossack leaders held assemblies. Because of frequent fires in Cherkassk (the former name of the town), the cathedral burned twice. The stone cathedral had been being built from 1706 to 1719. It was constructed in contrary with Peter I's decree banning the construction of stone buildings anywhere except for St. Petersburg. However, in view of political necessity, Peter himself contributed to construction works, helping with money and gifting utensils, and is said to have personally taken a symbolic part in the process of construction, putting a few bricks on the plaster (this fact is stated on the commemorative inscription made, however, already in the 19th century).–í. –ò. –ï–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤-–•–æ–ø—ë—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π ¬´–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –ß–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Å—Å–∫ ‚Äî —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –°—Ç–∞—Ä–æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞—è¬ª It is also believed that the main construction works were carried out by architects from Moscow, who were specially sent by the Tsar. Moreover, it is known (and this information is confirmed by present-day studies of foundation of the cathedral) that the temple was built on a swamp: \\"Quenched the quagmire with booth and oak forest.\\"  Description  Resurrection Cathedral has a height of 49 metres.

Near the temple there was also constructed a 48-meter high bell tower. The interior of the cathedral is striking in its decoration, which appears to be in contrast with the austere exterior. The unique five-tiered gilded iconostasis with the size of 19x23 meter contains 149 icons from the 18th century, which were painted by Moscow iconographer Egor Ivanov Grek. In front of medium-sized doors of the cathedral there is hanging a copper five-tiered chandelier, which weighs more than 550 kg. It is believed that it was brought in 1643 from the Azov Baptist Church by Ataman Iosif Petrov. In large semi-circular windows surrounding the Cathedral gallery (the south side of it) used to stand cannons aimed at steppe. When Cherkassk was the capital of Don Cossacks, the storerooms of the cathedral were used to keep the regalia of Cossacks. Near the entrance to the cathedral one can see walled massive chains, in which was allegedly chained Stepan Razin before he had been sent to be executed. Close to the chains, in the gallery, there is also kept ashes of Ataman Kirill Yakovlev, who treacherously betrayed his godson Stepan to government forces. Near the cathedral there is a two-tiered bell tower with the height of 45.8 meters. It is the only building of its kind in South Russia. Currently the bell tower is transferred to Starocherkassk Don monastery.

His second novel, it had first appeared in serial form in Chambers‚Äôs Journal earlier that year.  Introduction  The novel follows the adventures of John Burnet (a fictional relative of the 17th- century cleric and historian Gilbert Burnet), supposed to have been born at Barns in Tweeddale, Scotland in 1666. It is written as an autobiography, with the eponymous writer detailing the events of his life as a first-person narrative.  Plot  The novel opens in 1678, with the 12-year-old, bookish John Burnet escaping from the eye of his tutor at Barns for a day's fishing expedition. In the woods he meets Marjory Veitch, about 10 years old, the daughter of a neighbour. The two become playmates and, over the years, sweethearts. Following the recommendation of his illustrious uncle Gilbert Burnet of Edinburgh, John is at the age of 18 sent to study at the university in Glasgow. There he makes an exceptional scholar, but has only been there for about two years when he chances to see in the street his soldier cousin Gilbert Burnet riding arrogantly through the town at the head of a king‚Äôs troop of horse, dressed in the latest fashions. John resolves there and then to give up the life of a scholar, and to keep up the name of his house by himself becoming a Cavalier. He buys himself a blade and a new suit of clothes, and returns home. Back at Barns, he is welcomed with surprise by his father who is entertaining a guest ‚Äì his cousin. Gilbert insults John and offhandedly makes clear his intention to court Marjory. He challenges John to a long and dangerous race on horseback through the surrounding hills, a race that John ultimately wins, though at the cost of Gilbert's lifelong enmity. John asks Marjory to marry him, and shortly afterwards become the new laird of Barns following the sudden death of his father. He decides that he should spend some time travelling abroad before returning to marry Marjory and take up his new role at home. Becoming interested once more in scholarship, he travels to Netherlands to study at the university in Leyden, where he again encounters his cousin. During a supper party, Gilbert taunts John, and the latter hurls a wine glass at him. The cousins fight a duel, John emerging victorious. Gilbert departs for Scotland. Some months later, John receives a mysterious letter from Marjory summoning him back home urgently. On his arrival in Scotland, John finds that Gilbert has falsely denounced him as a traitor, his lands have been confiscated, and he is hunted around the Borders by Gilbert's soldiers. Fearing for Marjory's safety, he covertly escorts her to shelter with a kinsman, while he takes to the hills as an outlaw. However, Gilbert finds Marjory and tricks her into accompanying him to his estate in the west of Scotland. John follows, helps her escape, then confronts Gilbert. They are in the midst of a final fight when Gilbert is mortally wounded by a shot from one of his own disgruntled men. King James having been deposed by William of Orange while John was on the run, he is now free to travel to Edinburgh and to London to recover his lands. That complete, he returns to Barns and marries Marjory.

Critical reception Buchan was not entirely satisfied with the novel, and wrote to a friend, ‚ÄúTo tell the truth I am rather ashamed of it; it is so very immature and boyish. I had no half serious interest in fiction when I wrote it and the result is a sort of hotch- potch\\". Early reviews were mixed, but confirmed that Buchan was a writer to watch. The Labour Leader opined that it was \\"a most remarkable work for so young a man\\". David Daniell, in The Interpreter's House (1975), states that, in spite of faults of inexperience, this is a fine book for a first long novel. Although the book is indeed a ‚Äòhotch-potch‚Äô, it is a fascinating one in which Buchan, with evidence of a lot of thought, reworks big themes. Daniell concludes that the book is ‚Äúa clever, searching analysis of non‚Äìcommitment done with a good deal of novelistic skill, at the fringes of a more frightening darkness\\".

The cause for their canonization in the Catholic Church was opened in 2015.  Biography  Cyprien [Sipiriyani] Rugamba attended primary in Nyabagabe. In September 1948, he was admitted to Saint Leon Minor Seminary of Kabgayi where he finished in 1954 and moved to Major Seminary of Nyakibanda. He also studied history in Burundi and in Belgium. He had a talent for poetry, music, and choreography, with a particular interest for ancestral art forms in Rwanda. He served as director of the Rwandan National Institute for Scientific Studies in Butare. Daphrose [Daforoza] Mukasanga was a school teacher, born in the same village of Cyanika in the south of Rwanda as Cyprien. They married in 1965, but the relationship was not easy; Cyprien neglected Daphrose and was unfaithful to her, leading to a separation. In 1982 Cyprien, who had lost his Catholic faith, had a religious experience which restored their marriage. They moved to Kigali, where they established a feeding center for street children. They encountered the Emmanuel Community in 1989 through Fidesco and went on a pilgrimage to Paray- le-Monial. When they returned to Rwanda, they started a household (a weekly sharing group). The first Community Weekend took place on 22‚Äì23 September 1990, thereby establishing the Emmanuel Community in that nation. The independence of the Republic of Rwanda led to ethnic tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples. Cyprien and Daphrose advocated peace. Cyprien advised President Juv√©nal Habyarimana to stop the registration of ethnicity on identity cards. He was warned that this stance would place him on a hit list. The couple were killed, with six of their ten children, on - one day after the assassination of the president, which marked the start of the Rwandan genocide.  Legacy  In 1992 the Rugambas started a center in Kigali to feed and educate street children. Since 1995, after the genocide, this center has been managed by Fidesco. It is now called Centre Cyprien et Daphrose Rugamba (CECYDAR). In 2015 Cyprien and Daphrose Rugamba were declared \\"heroic in virtue\\", marking the start of the formal process towards their canonization as saints recognised by the Catholic Church.

It marked the defeat of forces loyal to the Majapahit usurper, Bhre Kertabhumi (Prince Kertabhumi), by Girindrawardhana, son of Singhavikramavardhana, and the independence of the Demak Sultanate under Raden Patah. 1478 is used to date the end of the Majapahit Empire.  Background  The Demak Sultanate was founded by Raden Patah in 1475. According to Babad Tanah Jawi, he was the son of Kertabhumi and a Chinese concubine. In 1468, Kertabhumi usurped Singhavikramavardhana, exiling him to Daha and reigned as Brawijaya V of Majapahit. However, Singhavikramavardhana's son Girindrawardhana consolidated a power base in Daha to retake the throne. He was supported by religious tensions. To keep Majapahit influence and economic interest, Kertabhumi had awarded Muslim merchant trading rights on the north coast of Java, an action which supported the prominence of Demak Sultanate in following decades. The policy increased Majapahit's economy and influence, but weakened Buddhism's position as the dominant religion, as Islam began to spread faster and more freely in Java.  Attack on Trowulan  The conflict came to a head in 1478. In the Pararaton, it states, \\".... bhre Kertabhumi ..... bhre prabhu sang mokta ring kadaton i saka sunyanora-yuganing-wong, 1400\\". In that year, Girindrawardhana's army under general Udara breached Trowulan's defences and killed Bhre Kertabhumi in his palace. Demak sent reinforcements under Sunan Ngudung, who later died in battle and was replaced by Sunan Kudus. Although they managed to repel the invading army, they came too late to save Kertabhumi. In the Trailokyapuri Jiwu and Petak inscriptions, Girindrawardhana claims the defeat of Kertabhumi, and that with it he reunited Majapahit as one kingdom. After the conflict, Girindrawardhana reigned as Brawijaya VI of Majapahit until he was killed and replaced by Prabu Udara in 1498, but Demak gained independence and was a sovereign state no longer subject to the Majapahit Empire. The conflict led to continued war between Demak and the Majapahit rump in Daha, since Demak rulers claimed descent from Kertabhumi. This only ended with the defeat of Prabu Udara and the fall of Daha in 1517.  Legacy  Today, 1478 is commemorated as among Javanese today with the candrasengkala ' (sirna = 0, ilang = 0, kerta = 4, bumi = 1) (lost and gone is the pride of the land).

In addition to her contributions to teaching, she provided funding for social support, including Sweden's first old peoples home which opened in 1915. Biography Born in Stockholm on 8 June 1842, Ribbing was the daughter of the language teacher Louis De Vylder and his wife Maria Christina Ahlborg. When she was 17, she embarked on a teacher training course, the L√§rokurs f√∂r fruntimmer in Stockholm. On graduating, she taught at the Normal School for girls until 1871 when she married the physician Seved Ribbing. After a year-long study trip around Europe, they settled in Simrishamn in southern Sweden but later moved to Lund. The couple welcomed people from all walks of life to their spacious home known as Spoletorp. Ribbing always made sure that there was more than enough food ready, even for children and the needy who came by. Ribbing devoted much of her time to creating charitable institutions in Lund for those in need. By raising money through lotteries and donations, she was able to establish a home for the terminally ill in 1915. After her husband's death in 1921, it was known as the Ribbingska Hospital. She was active in several pedagogical and philanthropic associations, particularly those concerned with assisting the poor. She was even behind the creation of a Swedish church in Copenhagen as a means of helping Swedes in Denmark. Maria Ribbing became an extremely popular figure in Lund and the surroundings. Following her death on 14 October 1910, hundreds attended her funeral. Three of her four children survived her.

He made his home at Pishiobury, which he bought in 1635. Hewett was baptized on 6 October 1605, the eldest son of Sir William Hewett and his wife Elizabeth Wiseman. His father had prospered in business in London and arranged a comprehensive education for Thomas, who attended the Merchant Taylors' School from 1611 to 1612, the Inner Temple in 1618, Eton College from 1619 to 1622, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in 1622. Thomas traveled abroad from 1625 to 1628, when his father's interest as keeper of Windsor Little Park secured him a seat at Windsor. He left no particular mark on that turbulent Parliament which produced the Petition of Right. On 14 May 1629, he married Frances Hobart (daughter of Sir Henry Hobart of Blickling Hall), who died three years later in May 1632 leaving one daughter. He married again, in about 1633, to Margaret (d. 1 August 1689), the daughter of Sir William Lytton and widow of Thomas Hilldersden. They had five sons and eight daughters, of whom one son, George, and six daughters survived him. These included Elizabeth, wife of Sir Richard Anderson, 2nd Baronet, Arabella, wife of Sir William Wiseman, 2nd Baronet, Margaret, wife of Sir Edward Farmer, Mary, wife of Sir Charles Crofts Read, Anne, wife of Sir John Rivers, 3rd Baronet, and Jane, wife of Charles Staples. In 1635, he purchased the manor of Sawbridgeworth (Sayesbury and Pishobury) from Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, Arthur Brett, and Nicholas Harman for ¬£16,500. He succeeded to his father's estate in 1637, and in the same year became a trustee for Lady Elizabeth, widow of Sir Robert Bevill (d. 1634). In November 1638, he was pricked as Sheriff of Hertfordshire the next year, experiencing difficulty in levying ship money. Hewett was knighted on 10 July 1641 and named a commissioner for the subsidy in Hertfordshire that year. In 1642, he was named to the commission of assessment for the county, and made a commissioner of array and justice of the peace, sitting on the Hertfordshire Bench until about 1650. Hewett took little part in the English Civil War. He was named a commissioner of militia in 1648, and held local offices under Parliament, as a commissioner of assessment for Westminster in 1652 and Hertfordshire from 1657 to 1661. He did not interfere with the persecution of Quakers around Sawbridgeworth under the Commonwealth. Upon the English Restoration, he was created a baronet on 19 July 1660, served as commissioner of militia for the county, and was chosen sheriff of Hertfordshire again in November. Hewett died on 4 August 1662 and was buried at Sawbridgeworth, leaving a portion of ¬£13,000 for his five unmarried daughters.

The name is derived from a large rock formation discovered during expansion. The interchange was originally constructed in 1977, then in the mid 2000s it was decided to expand the interchange to alleviate congestion. In 2011 an outcropping of Pennsylvanian Jackfork Formation sandstone and surrounding shale was discovered in the southeast quadrant of the project. The formation was estimated to weigh about 5 million pounds. Due to the size and hardness of the sandstone it was decided to leave the unique and distinctive formation in place as a landmark, rather than use explosives or some other method to try and remove it, and it was dubbed \\"The Big Rock.\\" When the original I-430 and I-630 interchange was constructed, about 14,000 vehicles a day traveled down each Interstate, and I-630 ended at Shakleford Road with a traffic signal. With expansion and growth in west Little Rock, and particularly in the Chenal Valley neighborhood, the interchange had become progressively more congested by the early 2000s. In 2004 the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department began a study to expand the interchange. The first of three phases began January 2009. First phase was construction of an additional I-630 west to I-430 north lane, modification to Financial Centre Parkway (Chenal Parkway) just west of Shackleford Road, and an additional traffic signal added to Hermitage Drive. Phase two involved preparing the interchange for future work and mainly involved the I-430 bridge over I-630 which was lengthened. Phase three completed the flyover lanes. The $150 million makeover took over six years to complete. In the end it eased congestion for over 200,000 vehicles that use the interchange daily.

It was first published in serial form in Today. The title comes from Browning‚Äôs poem Waring. Plot The novel is set in Scotland during the Jacobite rising of 1745 and follows the adventures of Francis Birkenshaw, an eighteen-year-old law apprentice. It is a study of the romantic temperament and of conflicts of loyalty.  Critical reception David Daniell, in The Interpreter's House (1975), called the novel \\"the story of romantic defeat, a gallant fanaticism that ended in dull retreat instead of ringing death. There is a nice decorum in the control of the material all through‚Ä¶\\". He considered that Buchan has been able to \\"get the darker shades moving in and out of his hero with some success\\". Andrew Lownie, in John Buchan: The Presbyterian Cavalier (2013) noted that this is a more ambitious and complex book than Buchan had previously attempted, and that perhaps as a result is less successful. He considered it to have been a victim of its long and spasmodic gestation, and of Buchan's busy lifestyle.

Life Family provenance and childhood Ulla Plener was born in Berlin, a month after the Nazi Party took power in Germany. The Communist Party, of which her parents Kurt and Marie-Luise Plener were both active members, was an early focus of the Nazi drive to create a one party dictatorship. With their new baby the Pleners had to escape to Copenhagen after (1905-1980) displeased the authorities with an article he contributed to a Communist Party newspaper in which he explained \\"how to use sports training as a defence against Nazis\\" (\\"... wie man sich sportlich ert√ºchtigen kann, um gegen Nazis wehrhaft zu sein\\"). The family was now split up. Kurt remained, for the time being, in Copenhagen where he worked for the communist \\"Red Sport International\\" organisation and campaigned unsuccessfully for the reversal of the 1931 decision to hold the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. Marie-Louise took her daughter to Moscow. In 1940 (1909-1996) joined the French resistance. Her six and a half year old daughter and Ulla's younger brother were consigned to a children's home in Ivanovo, a textiles town to the north-east of Moscow. Children at the nursery came from 34 different countries: the common feature was that their parents were all \\"politically active.\\" Plener later recalled that they were remarkably well informed about Nazi wartime atrocities, partly because some of the children had themselves, with their families, experienced them. Meals were regular if meagre: although starvation was widespread in the Soviet Union during the war, the children at the International Red Aid children's home in Ivanovo never starved. Academic career It was only some time after the war ended that the family were reunited in Berlin.Between 1951 and 1956 Ulla Pleiner studied History at a Moscow university. She received her doctorate (\\"Promotion A\\" under the reconfiguration of academic qualifications introduced in East Germany in 1968) in (East) Berlin in 1969 and her habilitation (\\"Promotion B\\") in 1975 for work on the history of the Social Democratic Party between 1945 and 1949. Her dissertation was later published in a shortened version under the title \\"SPD 1945‚Äì1949. Konzeption, Praxis, Ergebnisse\\". She became a lecturer and head of research at the \\"Institute for Researching Imperialism\\", part of the Party Central Committee's Academy for Social Sciences. The Soviet occupation zone which, in the region surrounding Berlin, replaced Nazi Germany in 1945, was itself relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Further political changes followed rapidly in 1989/90, leading to German reunification, formally in October 1990. Following reunification Ulla Plener continued with her studies of the Social Democratic movement in Germany during the later 1940s, publishing biographical studies of the trades union leader Theodor Leipart and the postwar SPD and of the party leader Kurt Schumacher. Closely linked with these was her more theoretical research on the theory and practice of \\"economic democracy\\". Another of her research themes following reunification was the wartime French resistance, producing biographical studies of various German women active in the French resistance and a full biography of one of these: her own mother, Marie-Luise Plener-Huber. Something that would have been impossible before 1989 was Plener's contribution on the Stalin years in Moscow. In 1997 she published \\"Frauenschicksale unter Stalin\\" (\\"The fate of women under Stalin\\") which was followed nine years later by a \\"Gedenkband √ºber deutsche Opfer des Gro√üen Terrors in der Sowjetunion\\" (\\"Memorial volume on German victims of the Great Terror inside the Soviet Union\\"). Some of the victims whose fates were set out in this volume were people whose disappearance had, hitherto, been unexplained. The theme of Stalin's purges was one in which Plener had a personal interest. When she was living in Moscow as a very small child with her mother, her paternal grandparents had also been living as political refugees in the city. Her law abiding paternal grandfather was arrested and shot in 1937. Three years later, in 1940, the Soviets returned her grandmother to Nazi Germany following conclusion of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop non-aggression Pact. Other relatives suffered, and Ulla's mother, Marie-Luise Plener herself came under suspicion. She followed this up in 2009 with a biography of Mirko Beer, supported with photographs and documentation covering his time as a military doctor with the republican fighters during the Spanish Civil War. Also of interest is her publication in a single volume of previously unknown diaries and letters covering the final years of his life, 1929-1933, written by the so-called \\"Communist bandit\\" or \\"Red Robin Hood\\", Max Hoelz.

It was co-founded by Arnab Goswami and Rajeev Chandrasekhar, before the latter relinquished his stake in May 2019, leaving Goswami the majority stakeholder. Chandrasekhar was an independent legislator from the National Democratic Alliance who later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party and Goswami was the former editor-in-chief of Times Now. The venture was funded primarily by Chandrashekhar through his company Asianet News. Critical reception has been negative. The channel has been accused of practising biased reporting in favour of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and of publishing fake news. It has also been convicted of breaching Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and News Broadcasting Standards Authority rules. This, in turn, has led to censure; it has also triggered a high-profile civil defamation case filed by Indian National Congress legislator Shashi Tharoor.https://www.ndtv.com/india- news/republic-tv-among-3-channels-being-probed-for-trp-manipulation-mumbai- police-2307106 History  Background  Arnab Goswami resigned as editor-in-chief of Times Now on 1 November 2016, citing editorial differences, lack of freedom and newsroom politics. He hosted the last edition of his show, The Newshour Debate, a fortnight later. Incidentally, the show had been subject to an investigation by Ofcom, the UK broadcasting regulatory authority, in August and September; the investigation had held Times Now guilty of violating the impartiality clause of its broadcast code. On 16 December, Goswami announced his next venture, a news channel called Republic; the name was later changed to Republic TV in the face of complaints. Republic TV was claimed to be India's first independent media outlet which would 'democratize' news and compete with global media giants whilst being unabashedly biased for India.  Funding  Republic TV was funded in part by Asianet (ARG Outlier Asianet News Private Limited), which was primarily funded by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a then-independent member of Rajya Sabha who had intricate links with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was vice-chairman of the National Democratic Alliance in Kerala. Among other major investors were Goswami, his wife, educationists Ramdas Pai and Ramakanta Panda‚Äîall of whom invested through SARG Media Holding Private Ltd. Chandrasekhar resigned from the board, after he officially joined the BJP in April 2018; Goswami purchased back Asianet's shares in May 2019.Arnab Goswami buys back Republic Media shares from Asianet, Live Mint (A Hindustan Times Media company), Lata Jha (May 6, 2019)Arnab Goswami buys back shares from Asianet; Republic TV now valued at this much, The Financial Express (May 6, 2019)  Recruitments  S. Sundaram, who had served as the CFO for Times Now between 2005 and 2012, was named the Group CFO. Chief Business Officer of Reliance Broadcast Network Vikas Khanchandani was made the CEO and co-founder of The News Minute, Chitra Subramaniam was roped in as the editorial adviser. Others who joined included senior anchor of Thanthi TV S. A. Hariharan, retired army officer and television personality Gaurav Arya, former chief correspondent from Jammu and Kashmir for Times Now Aditya Raj Kaul, writer and founder-editor of Gentleman and Business Barons, Minhaz Merchant and actor Anupam Kher. The Wire and Newslaundry had earlier chanced upon an internal memo floated by Chandrasekhar's group that asked for selective recruitment of right-of-center pro-military voices, who were conducive to his ideology.  Launch  The channel was launched on 6 May 2017 as a free-to-air channel through most DTH services and cable television operators, alongside over mobile platforms such as JioTV and Hotstar. Reporting on its launch, Business Standard wrote, \\"The company has already hired 300 people, of whom 215 are on board. A state-of- the-art-studio is being built in Mumbai's Lower Parel area.\\" On 2 February 2019, the channel launched its Hindi language outlet named Republic Bharat.  Reception   Public  The Financial Express noted Republic TV to be the most-watched English news channel in India for 100 weeks in a row since its founding. The top news channel spot was taken over by DD India, a public service broadcaster, in February 2019, according to the Indian newspaper Mint. In the first quarter of 2019, Republic TV and DD India alternated for the most-watched English news channel position in the weekly ratings as measured by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) India group. Goswami has been noted to be a critical factor behind the favorable public reception.  Critical commentary  The channel has been noted for its opinionated reporting in support of the BJP and Hindutva across a wide spectrum of situations, including by presenting political opponents in a negative light and avoiding criticism of figures from ruling parties. It has also been alleged that the channel popularized the neologisms of \\"Urban Naxal\\" and \\"anti-national\\" to denote those critical to right wing sentiments and evoke hyper-nationalism among the audience. Attempts to quell communal tensions through irresponsible reporting containing religious overtones have been alleged. The channel has been compared to North Korean media for its extreme pro-government affinity and muzzling of dissent. Noted political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot, journalist Dexter Filkins and others compare it to Fox News, an American TV channel that practices biased reporting in favor of the Republican Party. Vanita Kohli-Khandekar, on Business Standard, noted it to be a \\"noisy, chaotic place where coherent debate without shouting, screaming and name-calling is impossible\\"; others have noted of its shows to be a \\"battle of babble\\", judgmental, brash and hawkish. Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar, in a Foreign Policy article, noted its coverage of the 2019 India-Pakistan conflict, to put jingoism ahead of journalism. Historian Ramachandra Guha noted it to be a pro- government channel, which ignored issues of joblessness, agrarian distress et al. and instead took to demonizing Pakistan along with opposition parties, furthering religious bigotry in the process. Fact checkers have documented it to have propagated dubious or fake news, on multiple occasions.  Viewership ratings  Republic TV allegedly became the most-watched English news channel in India in its first week of airing in May 2017 with 21.1 lakh (2.11 million) impressions and accounted for 51.9 per cent viewership as per data released for the week by the BARC. The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) subsequently lodged a complaint with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) accusing the group of using unethical tactics for high viewership. It claimed that the channel ran multiple feeds over various multi-system operator (MSO) platforms and listed itself at multiple locations across various genres in the electronic program guide, in contravention of TRAI rules. TRAI cautioned the channel against such practices and determined the viewership numbers to have been inflated.  Controversies   Ban by Indian National Congress  Reporters from the channel have been banned from attending any press conference of the Indian National Congress, citing criticism of their political party.  Defamation  In May 2017, parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor filed a civil defamation case in the Delhi High Court against Goswami and Republic TV in connection with the channel's broadcast of news items from 8 to 13 May claiming his link in his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death in 2014. Seeking the channel's response, Justice Manmohan of the High Court said, \\"Bring down the rhetoric. You can put out your story, you can put out the facts. You cannot call him names. That is uncalled for.\\"  IP rights infringement  In May 2017, Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. (BCCL) lodged a complaint against Goswami and Prema Sridevi, a journalist with Republic TV, under the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act, 2000 accusing them of copyright infringement. BCCL alleged that the two, previously employed with Times Now, that it owns and operates, had used its intellectual property (IP) in telecasting certain audio tapes that were in their possession during their time at the former Channel. Alongside IP infringement, the complaint also alleged the commission of offences of theft, criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of property, on the two, on multiple occasions days after the channel's launch.  Regulatory censures  In 2018, the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) of India demanded Republic TV to tender a full- screen apology for use of multiple objectionable words to describe a bunch of people at a political rally, who were harassing one of his journalists.What the NBSA ignored in its Republic TV order, Newslaundry, Cherry Agarwal (8 September 2018) Republic TV \\"removed the video from its website and YouTube account\\" after receiving the complaint but refused to comply with the NBSA order, instead filing an appeal. The NBSA, the self-regulatory broadcasting regulator of India asked Republic TV to broadcast a public apology, after the channel declined to cooperate in a case accusing it of violating the standard prohibitions on racial and religious stereotyping and instead commented on NBSA having engaged in \\"intense pseudo-judicial oversight\\". Republic TV did not abide by the order; incidentally, Goswami was the convener of the committee that drafted the code, years back.  Alleged ratings manipulation  In October 2020, the Mumbai Police launched an investigation into Republic TV's viewership ratings and alleged that the channel inflated its ratings by bribing low-income individuals, including people who did not comprehend English, to keep their televisions turned on and tuned to Republic TV. Goswami denied the allegations and accused the Mumbai Police of retaliating against the channel's recent criticism.https://scroll.in/reel/975626/why-big- bollywood-has-launched-a-potentially-damaging-battle-against-times-now-and- republic-tvhttps://thewire.in/law/bollywood-republic-tv-times-now-delhi-hc  Regulation  Regulation of TV news channels in India is done by self regulation and the News Broadcaster Association is an independent body which has a code of ethics. Two weeks after the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), part of the NBA, asked Republic TV to apologise after a complaint, the National Broadcasting Federation (NBF), another regulatory body, was formed with Arnab Goswami as the head, which effectively nulled the regulation of NBSA over Republic TV.

Weizmann also served as a spy for Germany. Weizmann was born in present-day Motal, Belarus (then part of the Russian Empire) to a prominent family. Her parents were Oizer and Rachel Czermerinsky Weizmann. Weizmann's most famous sibling was Chaim Weizmann, the President of Zionist Organization and the first President of Israel. Weizmann attended medical school in Berlin. She was a socialist who hated the czarist government. In 1913, she immigrated to Palestine, where she became one of the few female physicians. In 1914, she met Curt Prufer, who recruited her to be a spy in British Egypt for Germany. Weizmann was caught during one of her missions in Italy and sent back to Egypt. If she had been convicted of spying for Germany, she would have been imprisoned or killed. Possibly due to the prominence of her family, or due to her good reputation in Egypt, she was allowed to return to Russia.

Important notices  * Beneish M-score is a probabilistic model, so it cannot detect companies that manipulate their earnings with 100% accuracy. * Financial institutions were excluded from the sample in Beneish paper when calculating M-score. It means that the M-score for fraud detection cannot be applied among financial firms (banks, insurance).  Example of successful application  Enron Corporation was correctly identified as an earnings manipulator by students from Cornell University using M-score. Noticeably, Wall Street financial analysts were still recommending to buy Enron shares at that point in time.

Legge is best known for her 1936 Trafalgar Square performance for the opening of London International Surrealist Exhibition, posing in a costume inspired by a Salvador Dal√≠ painting, with her head completely obscured by a flower arrangement. Early life and family Sheila Legge was born Sheila C. Chetwynd Inglis in 1911 at Penzance in Cornwall, the daughter of Lieutenant James Arthur Chetwynd Inglis of the Scottish Highland Light Infantry, 4th Battalion and Ida Evelyn Kerr, a Scot, from Melbourne, Australia. Her father was the only child of Major James Argyll Spalding Inglis, commissioner of Nicosia and the grandson of Dr. James Inglis, a Scottish physician and author. Through her father, Legge was a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean, a Perthshire family that included Legge's direct ancestors, Charles Spalding, improver of the diving bell, and James Small, factor of the forfeited Robertson estates after the Battle of Culloden. Prior to the start of World War I, Legge's family, which now included an additional daughter, was living in Tahiti where Legge's father was working as a mining engineer. At the outbreak of the war, he returned to Scotland and rejoined his battalion from the Boer War. In March 1915, while his wife was serving as a nurse in France, Legge's father joined the 1st Battalion Seaforth Highlanders. Within days of arriving at the regiment's headquarters, he was killed in a trench in Flanders on 9 May 1915. Little is known about Legge's life after her father died, except for the numerous passenger lists detailing the family's world travels. On 1 January 1919 Legge's mother, who at the time was listed as a YMCA worker, married John Sharpe Sutherland at the British Consulate in Cairo, Egypt. Early in 1934 at Kensington in London, Legge married her first husband, Rupert Maximilian Faris Legge and gave birth to a son in April of that year. The marriage ended within the year and the couple placed their child to be raised by family friends. Surrealism In 1935, Legge wrote to David Gascoyne expressing her fondness for his book A Short Survey of Surrealism and offering to help organize a Surrealist group in England. At the time Legge was living in a bedsit in Earl's Court in central London. Gascoyne made arrangements to meet Legge, and later described her as \\"a warm, good- natured, intelligent, frustrated young woman\\" with an \\"eagerness for experience\\" and \\"a genuinely keen curiosity\\" about contemporary culture\\", \\"especially surrealism.\\" Gascoyne also noted that she was fluent in French, \\"able to read Raymond Roussel in the original.\\" Art historians differ in their opinions as to when Gascoyne and Legge met. Some believe Gascoyne recruited Legge for his \\"Surrealist Phantom\\" exhibit for the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition only a few days before the exhibit was to open. While others believe Legge participated in the planning of the exhibit. The latter scenario is more likely, as Legge was already moving in Surrealist circles, having her portrait sketched by Man Ray in March 1936. and Legge is seated in the front row of the group photo of the organizers of the London exhibition. Gascoyne, whatever the level of collaboration with Legge, was instrumental in transforming her into a walking \\"Surrealist Phantom\\", the living embodiment of a Salvador Dal√≠ painting, that the Surrealist group would use to draw attention to the opening of the exhibit. The ensemble chosen for the exhibition was a white, drop tail hemmed wedding dress designed by the Motley Theatre Design Group and accessorized with sheer black evening gloves, coral- coloured shoes and a belt. Obscuring Legge's entire head was a mask of roses from a Mayfair florist. On the opening day of the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition, Gascoyne led Legge, dressed as the \\"Surrealist Phantom\\", to Trafalgar Square. Once there, Legge stood in front of the Trafalgar lions as Claude Cahun took photographs, as pigeons began to perch on her outstretched arms. From Trafalgar Square the group headed up the Haymarket and Piccadilly to the New Burlington Galleries. As Andr√© Breton gave remarks to officially open the exhibition, Legge wandered through the gallery crowds carrying a prosthetic leg with a silk stocking on it as a prop. Some accounts also have her carrying a raw pork chop, that she later abandoned when it began to smell. Legge's contribution to the Surrealist movement appears to be limited to a few years in the 1930s. Legge would appear in several promotional newspaper articles for the London International Surrealist Exhibition, and would grace the cover of the fourth issue of the International Surrealist Bulletin dressed as the \\"Phantom Surrealist\\" in September 1936. Legge's Surrealist poem, I Have Done My Best For You, appeared in the December 1936 edition of Contemporary Poetry and Prose. In 1937, Legge participated in the surrealist objects show at the London Gallery, and E. L. T. Mesens wanted to hire her as the secretary for his London Gallery in 1938. An attractive woman with long blonde hair, Legge has often been relegated to the role of a \\"surrealist groupie\\" by various art historians who have identified her as a possible lover of David Gascoyne, Dylan Thomas and Rene Magritte. Legge's more noteworthy contribution is undoubtedly her performance as the \\"Surrealist Phantom\\" at the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition, making Legge among the most photographed surrealist artists of all time. After the 1936 exhibition Legge met John Lodwick at Orange in Vichy France on 13 January 1942 while Lodwick was working on his first novel, Running to Paradise, which he dedicated to her when it was published in 1943. By 1945, Legge and Lodwick were living in Cornwall with their two children, with Legge working as a book collector. Legge died on 5 January 1949 while living at Villa Boramar in Banyuls-sur-Mer in the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales region of France and was buried in the Cimeti√®re Communal de Banyuls-sur-Mer there. The cause of death was pleurisy and pneumonia. The 1936 Man Ray sketch of Legge, entitled \\"Sheila\\", was included in an April 1970 exhibit at the Centre Georges Pompidou entitled The Ballad of The Ladies Out of Time. The exhibit included a series of fourteen etchings accompanied by text by Andr√© Breton from 1934. In 2015, author Silvano Levy published a book on Legge entitled Sheila Legge Phantom of Surrealism. In 2016, a theater group in New York City included Legge as a character in a play based on parts of Rene Magritte's life, entitled, A Journey Through The Mind Of The Surrealist Painter.

He is also FCA Group's Chief Marketing Officer and, as well as a member of the Group Executive Council at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, positions he has held since September 2011. For his attention to creativity, he has been referred to as \\"Chrysler's Don Draper\\".  Early life and education  Fran√ßois was born in Paris, and graduated in 1984 from Dauphine University with degrees in management and marketing from CELSA (Paris La Sorbonne, 1986) and in Economy and finance (Institut des Sciences Politiques de Paris, 1988). Prior to starting his career within the automotive industry, he pursued his passion for music and started his own music label in France, later going on to exploit his entrepreneurial nature by working in the export business. This passion for music, together with poetry and photography, accompanies Fran√ßois in his career even nowadays, as witnessed by commercials and special projects in which are involved Jennifer Lopez, Shaggy and Sting among others.  Career   Citro√´n  He entered the car business in 1990 when he was hired by Citro√´n, quickly climbing the ranks within the organization. In 1999, he was asked by the company to move to Denmark, where he was Managing Director of Citroen Denmark A/S. In 2001 he was appointed Managing Director of Citro√´n Italy.  Lancia  After 4 years as the Head of Citro√´n in Italy, willing for a new challenge, Fran√ßois was approached by the late Sergio Marchionne, then CEO of Fiat Group Automobiles, to become CEO of Lancia Automobiles SPA.  Chrysler  In October 2009, post Fiat Group receiving a 20% stake in Chrysler Group LLC, Fran√ßois was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of the Chrysler brand. He was also the lead marketing executive at Chrysler Group with responsibility for marketing strategies, brand development and advertising for the Chrysler Group (Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and RAM Trucks), as well as that of the Fiat Group Automobiles brands (Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Abarth, Lancia).  FCA  In 2011, he was named Chief Marketing Officer of the FCA Group and Head of the Fiat Brand, as well as becoming a member of the Group Executive Council (GEC). Since becoming Chief Marketing Officer, Fran√ßois splits his time between Auburn Hills and FCA's Italian headquarters in Turin. As well as Chief Marketing Officer for the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Group, he is also President of the Fiat Brand Global.  Car Models Unveiled  Under his guidance, FCA have achieved some important results: the iconic 500 enlarged its line up with 500L (in 2012) and 500X (in 2014), consolidating 500 as everlasting and iconic car. During the 2014 Geneve Motor Show an offroad version of Panda, named Cross, was launched: this contributed to keep the model as one of the Italian most sold cars. In 2015 the new Tipo, a compact car assembled at the Tofa≈ü plant in Bursa, Turkey, was launched. It won the Best Buy Car of Europe Award from Autobest, voted by a panel of 26 journalists from 26 European countries. Moreover, in 2016 the 124 spider made its first appearance: it was previously seen at 2015 LA Auto Show. The two passenger roadster recalls, for name and exterior styling, the Fiat 124 Sport Spider designed by Pininfarina and manufactured from 1966 to 1985. In 2019 the electric Fiat Concept Centoventi, translated as hundred and twenty in recognition of the company's 120th anniversary, was unveiled at the Geneve Motor Show. It ‚Äúreimagines the Fiat Panda supermini as an electric car for the 21st century‚Äù. The launch of the new Panda Trussardi in September 2019, has been accompanied by an innovative communication campaign that celebrates its unique style, changing the rules of automotive communications and positioning the new car as a fashion item. Panda Trussardi features in the video clip of Ava Max's new single \\"Torn\\", and the spot is ‚Äújust‚Äù a cut from the video clip. The new commercial was directed by Joseph Kahn who directed video clips for artists such as Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Sting and Shaggy.  Remarkable Commercials and Campaigns   Super-Bowl Commercials  Fran√ßois has often used the Super Bowl commercials renowned as one of the most expensive advertising slots in the world. In 2011 he conceived the Eminem- starring Chrysler Super Bowl commercial \\"Imported from Detroit\\", a 2 minutes homage to the rebirth of the automotive industry within Detroit. The ad won an Emmy¬Æ-Award as ‚ÄúOutstanding Commercial‚Äù. In 2012 he chose Clint Eastwood for a new Chrysler campaign named ‚ÄúHalftime in America‚Äù, which was described by the New York Post as ‚Äúone of the few touchdowns in last night‚Äôs advertising Super Bowl‚Äù and by CNN Money as ‚Äúking of the Super Bowl spots‚Äù. For the 2014 Super Bowl, Fran√ßois employed Bob Dylan as the testimonial for the launch of the new Chrysler 200. The campaign went further than promoting the car, the brand clearly tried to establish a broader message than the fact that it is associated with Detroit. For the 2015 Super Bowl, a new commercial for Fiat 500X was launched, named ‚Äúthe FIAT Blue Pill‚Äù campaign. In the spot, a blue pill transforms a classic 500 into the 500X crossover. This commercial was described as ‚Äúa clever and humorous way to introduce the 500X‚Äù.  Other Commercials  In 2008, Fran√ßois dedicated a TV commercial for Lancia to Nobel Prize winners. The campaign features some of the major Nobel Prize winners including Lech Walesa, Frederik Willem De Klerk, Mikhail Gorbachev, Tenzin Gyatso XIV Dalai Lama and Aung San Suu Kyi. For the 2014 launch campaign of the Dodge Durango, he cooperated with Paramount Pictures and Will Ferrell (as the fictionary anchor Ron Burgundy). The commercial was used as marketing campaign for the release of the film ‚ÄúAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues.‚Äù In 2016 he worked again with Paramount Pictures, this time cooperating with the star of the film Zoolander 2, Derek Zoolander (played by Ben Stiller) to promote the Fiat 500X. The new spot entitled \\"Selfie‚Äù directed by Jeff Mann was screened for the first time at the Golden Globes ceremony. The campaign went on to receive a gold award for entertainment by the Clio Awards 2017 was 60th birthday of Fiat 500: to mark such a special occasion for the brand Fran√ßois enrolled the Oscar winning American actor and producer, Adrien Brody. The film debuted the celebrative special series, the 500 Anniversario. In 2018, under Fran√ßois supervision, Fiat choose Christopher Lloyd for the new 500X commercial. He reprised his role of Back to The Future‚Äòs Doc Emmett Brown to transport a couple from the 60s to the present days, transforming their classic Fiat into the Fiat 500X modern-day incarnation In 2019 FCA involved Sting and Shaggy for the new 500X campaign, called ‚ÄúJust one lifetime‚Äù, as part of brand 120th anniversary. The campaign was initially conceived as a music video treatment, and it was then re-cut as a 90-second spot. The song was included in the album [‚Äò44/876‚Äô], winning the 2018 Grammy Award, as Best Reggae Album.

He is a very dedicated researcher but never cares about his promotion and credits even if taken by someone else.

There were gaps of several years when the orchestra's name disappeared from the public view (see ¬ß Historical overview). The orchestra was only active for about fifteen years between 1905 and 1939. Its first conductors from 1905 included William Sewell, Julian Clifford senior and Hamilton Harty. After WW1 Raymond Roze reformed the orchestra as a properly- constituted, full-time body of musicians. Roze died unexpectedly in 1920 and was succeeded as chief conductor by Adrian Boult, who gave numerous public concerts over several years. Other musicians conducting the orchestras at the time included Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Franco Leoni, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Edward Elgar. Members of the orchestra during this period included Albert Sammons and ¬ß Frederick Holding as leaders, and Eugene Cruft on bass. In the early 1930s the name 'British Symphony Orchestra' appeared on the label of many recordings by the Columbia Graphophone Company as a cover name or pseudonym for the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. Conductors during this period include Ethel Smyth, Oskar Fried, Bruno Walter, Felix Weingartner, and Henry Wood. A few public concerts were given in London with an orchestra of this name during the years leading up to the Second World War. More recently, the music for the 1989 film La R√©volution fran√ßaise, was composed and conducted by Georges Delerue, and played by the British Symphony Orchestra. Since 2016 an orchestra of the same name founded by Philip Mackenzie has made a number of concert appearances in Britain, and also toured in the People's Republic of China. Historical overview The history of the various British Symphony Orchestras seems to fall into five approximate periods. Without access to contemporary concert programmes and lists of orchestra members it is difficult to arrive at any sense of continuity of membership. # 1905‚Äì1910: Formed by the organist, conductor, and composer William Sewell in around 1905, and active in London concert halls for about five years until c1910. There seem to be no extant recordings. # 1919 - 1923: Formed in summer 1919 by Raymond Roze for professional musicians who served in the Army during WW1. He made their first recording in around 1919. Roze died aged about 45 in March 1920. The orchestra continued to give concerts in London mainly under Adrian Boult, who also made his first recordings with this ensemble. They seem to have given few public concerts after about 1923. # 1930‚Äì1932: Recording orchestra. From 1930 to 1932, the name in general only appears on record labels, albeit with a number of well-known conductors such as Felix Weingartner, Bruno Walter and soloists like Joseph Szigeti. The orchestral musicians involved may have had more permanent jobs with other orchestras, and the name 'British Symphony Orchestra' may have been used to avoid contractual obligations. # 1934‚Äì1939: A few public concerts in 1934‚Äì5 and 1939 were given with a British Symphony Orchestra. There seem to be no recordings from this period. # Recent formations: ## 1989: The music for the 1989 film La R√©volution fran√ßaise, composed and conducted by Georges Delerue, was played by the British Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble of freelance musicians assembled for just this task. ## 2004: A British Symphony Orchestra played at an extravagant wedding in India for two sons of Subrata Roy. ## 2016: Formed by Philip Mackenzie with freelance musicians. It has performed as a backing orchestra for Never The Bride, and with ABBA and Elton John tribute bands. The orchestra made a classical concert tour in China in 2017-18. For orchestras with a similar name or initials, see also ¬ß Disambiguation First formation: 1905 - c1910 The nave of the Birmingham Oratory (1907-1910), church of a community of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, founded in 1848 by Ernest Newman. In October 1905 William Sewell,He co-edited a hymn book, published in 1913: organist at the Birmingham Oratory, director of the Midland Gleemen and later sub-organist of Westminster Cathedral, placed an advertisement in The Musical Times: :\\"The British Symphony Orchestra (conductor, Mr. W. Sewell) is a new combination of orchestral players which seeks for public favour.\\" One of the newly-formed British Symphony Orchestra's first concerts took place at the √Üolian Hall, London, on 7 December 1905. The Irish violinist Rohan Clensy who had studied with Eugene Ysaye, played Max Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 2. The Standards critic thought that Clensy was \\"a clever and thoughtful artist, whose playing shows intelligence and taste. His performance [...] was, on the whole, artistic. The phrasing was clear, and the execution facile, but there was sometimes need of more life and passion, and the tone was somewhat cold. The orchestra gave him good support, and their playing of Schubert‚Äôs overture. Alfonso and Estrella, an attractive work, which is not often heard, was virile and effective.\\" The programme also included Bach‚Äôs Suite No. 3 in D and Grieg's Norwegian Dances. On 18 December 1905 Sewell conducted the BSO with Maria Sequel in Mendelssohn's G minor piano concerto. The music critic of The Standard noted that in the orchestra's playing \\"there were some rough places, however, which doubtless will become smooth with more practice and experience in their performance of the Figaro and Hebrides overtures.\\" Harty sketched by a member of the Hall√© Orchestra, c1920 Again at Aeolian Hall, on February 16, 1906, Lucia Fydell and Atherton Smith with the British Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sewell, gave a recital consisting chiefly of excerpts from Saint-Saens's Samson and Delilah. \\"Miss Fydell has a powerful voice and dramatic perception, but she would be heard to greater advantage on the stage than in the concert-room.\\" The agents for the British Symphony Orchestra in March 1906 were Concert-Direction Limited, originally founded in August 1905 with Louis and Laurence Cowen as directors. It changed its name in July 1906 to Vert and Sinkins Concert-Direction Limited in 1906. Fernando Vert was the brother of Narciso Vert, whose musical agency later became known as Ibbs and Tillett. Hamilton Harty who, like William Sewell, had been a church organist (in County Down) conducted what seems to be his first London orchestral concert on 5 April 1906, with the British Symphony Orchestra at the Queen‚Äôs Hall. Winifred Christie played C√©sar Franck's Symphonic Variations and Saint-Saens' Piano Concerto No. 2. Another concert followed at the Queen‚Äôs Hall on 21 April 1906, and one on 24 May 1906 at the Aeolian Hall. National Sunday League concerts The orchestra appeared at a number of concerts organised by the National Sunday League, which was opposed to sabbatarianism, and promoted rational recreation on Sundays.A previous chairman was Sir Joshua Walmsley. See also The light soprano Isobel Jay appeared with the BSO at the Alhambra Theatre on 7 April 1906. Mount Vesuvius erupted the same day. Harty conducted again on 21 October 1906 at the Queen's Hall, with Edith Kirkwood and Gertrude Lonsdale singing. On 30 November 1907 the British Symphony Orchestra appeared at The Crystal Palace in a concert including Harty's own Ode to a Nightingale sung by Agnes Nicholls (his wife), and ‚Äôs Concerto (actually March and Polonaise) for six timpani: the soloist was Gabriel Cleather, \\"who became a very busy man during the performance\\". Amalgamated Musicians' Union concerts Elektra. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor in 1905 According to John Lucas, the British Symphony Orchestra was \\"formed in 1908 by the Amalgamated Musicians' Union to provide work for its members on Sundays.\\" Albert Sammons, the leader, also played in the restaurant band at the Waldorf Hotel, where Thomas Beecham recruited the 23 year-old for his new Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The second concert on 4 October was reviewed in The Standard: :\\"The second of a series of concerts organised by Mr. Oswald Stoll and the Amalgamated Musicians‚Äô Union‚Äîthe profits of which are given to the benevolent funds of this society‚Äîwas given last evening at the London Coliseum. The programme was furnished by the British Symphony Orchestra, consisting of l00 instrumentalists, the vocalists being Miss and Mr. Lloyd Chandos, the conductors Messrs. J. M. Glover and J. Skuse. An exceptionally large audience was present.\\" On 18 October the vocalists were Kitty Gordon, William Green and Maria Yelland, 'The Cornish Contralto'. The conductors were Joseph Skuse and Leonard Chalk. Two more Musicians' Union Sunday evening concerts took place on 4 and 18 April 1909 at the Coliseum. The British Symphony Orchestra, led by Albert Sammons, was conducted by Alick Maclean and Joseph Skuse. Held at British Library, Collections. \\"The great success of the Sunday evening concerts initiated by the Amalgamated Musicians‚Äô Union at the Coliseum two years ago has induced the union to undertake a similar series of concerts at Queen‚Äôs Hall. Beginning on 4 September 1910, Mr. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor will conduct his Hiawatha‚Äôs Wedding Feast with the British Symphony Orchestra and Choir. During the season, which extends to June, 1911, many interesting and novel works are to be produced by the orchestra and choir, [...] and some of the best conductors will share the responsibility of directing the different works.\\" According to Lucas, Beecham conducted two Musicians' Union concerts with the British Symphony Orchestra in 1910. One took place on Sunday 3 April 1910, with the contralto Carmen Hill.The Referee, London, 3 April 1910. Page needed. On 18 September 1910 at Queens Hall, Franco Leoni's dramatic cantata, The Gate of Life conducted by the composer, was performed by Mme. Ada Davies,US soprano, performed in Leoni's opera Rip Van Winkle in 1907. Giuseppe Lenghi-Cellini, and Wilfrid Douthitt with the British Symphony Orchestra and Choir. Second formation: 1919 - 1923 Background Vanity Fair in December 1913. Caption reads \\"Opera in English\\". After the end of WW1 a second British Symphony Orchestra was formed in 1919 by the theatre composer and conductor Raymond Roze. The personnel were all de-mobbed soldiers, many of whom had served abroad in the Army, and who had all been professional musicians before the war, some of them established soloists. This was not his first experience with military affairs: just a few weeks before the war broke out in 1914, Roze had organised the London Arts Corps (later the 1st Battalion, County of London Volunteer Regiment (United Arts Rifles). This was a civilian volunteer Home Defence battalion consisting entirely of musicians, writers and artists who for various reasons did not wish to join the regular or Territorial Army. The roll-call of those involved reads like a Who's Who of the artistic, musical and literary world, headed up by Sir Arthur Pinero as chairman, Lord Desborough, Gerald du Maurier, Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and many others. There was a distinguished list of naval and military patrons, such as Major- General Sir Alfred Turner, and possibly including some of the later patrons of the British Symphony Orchestra. Roze also supplied the battalion with several hundred modern .303 Martini‚ÄìEnfield carbines and 10,000 rounds of ammunition purchased on his own responsibility, to replace the practice weapons (described as \\"neolithic flintlocks\\") normally issued by the War Department. The corps gradually became an official Army volunteer battalion, and Roze resigned as Hon. Secretary in January 1915. During the war, the promising young baritone Charles Mott (who had sung in Roze's opera Joan of Arc) was called up c1917, joined the Artists' Rifles (a different battalion) and was killed in 1918 at the Third Battle of the Aisne. 1919 At the time of its founding in summer 1919, it was the only permanent London orchestra apart from the LSO, which was founded in 1904 by disgruntled players from the Queen's Hall orchestra. The orchestra under Roze gave a Royal Command Performance at Buckingham Palace for George V and Queen Mary. The concert included Reels and Strathspeys for strings and wind by Josef Holbrooke and Roze's overture to his incidental music for Julius Caesar. The Albert Hall, Nottingham Albert Coates, who conducted a concert in 1919 Roze conducted the orchestra's first public concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 21 September. The London critic of The Musical Times remarked on the familiar faces on the platform: :\\"The words 'first appearance,' however, read oddly in connection with a band largely made up of players whose names are well known to London audiences, some of them soloists. The 'British Symphony Orchestra' begins by claiming attention on the ground that all its members have served in the Army, mostly abroad, but it should soon take a prominent position on its musical merits. Mr. Raymond Rose conducted, and Mr. Tom Burke sang. The orchestra, again conducted by Roze, gave a programme in the Albert Hall, Nottingham on 4 December 1919, \\"embracing Rossini's ever-green William Tell overture, Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite, and the third movement of Tchaikovsky's 'Path√©tique' symphony.\\" Katherine Goodson (piano), Watkin Mills (baritone), and Bronislaw Huberman (violin), were \\"cordially appreciated. M. Paul Frenkel acted as accompanist.\\" Another concert took place on 12 December 1919, with Tchaikovsky's sixth symphony, two Passacaglias by Cyril Scott who also conducted, plus Scott's Idyllic Phantasy for voice, oboe and 'cello, (performed by Astra Desmond, Arthur Foreman and Cedric Sharpe respectively). \\"[The orchestra] has been heard by the King and Queen; it has a very strong list of naval and military patrons; and is a first-class orchestra, the tone of the strings being particularly full and rich, and the wood-wind conspicuously mellow.\\" On 27 December 1919, the BSO appeared at the Royal Albert Hall with Albert Coates conducting a piano concerto with Leopold Godowsky, and the tenor Clarence Whitehill accompanied by Harold Craxton. 1920 Raymond Roze was too ill to conduct a BSO concert on 10 February 1920, and Frank Bridge stepped in. Albert Sammons played Roze's Poem of Victory for violin, and Josef Holbrooke conducted his own early work, The Viking. However, the series of concerts of the British Symphony Orchestra had to be abandoned owing to lack of support. Roze's final concert with the orchestra took place at the Queen's Hall on 23 February 1920. The players \\"gave an excellent performance of Hubert Bath's symphonic poem The Vision of Hannele [1913], perhaps the best of his more ambitious works.\\" The concert also included Two Dances by Dorothy Howell. Roze, the orchestra's founder, died suddenly on 30 March 1920 aged around 45, and Adrian Boult, as his \\"fortunate successor\\", became chief conductor.Adrian Boult's orchestral outreach in East London: 'a bit of genuine decentralisation'.

Source: The Times, 17 January 1921 \\"Kingsway Hall - eight programmes from the 1920-1921 season of Quinlan Subscription Concerts, the majority of which were given by the British Symphony Orchestra.\\" Held at RCM Library. According to Boult, this was possibly the first time orchestral music had been heard in the hall, originally built in 1912 as a Methodist place of worship. The first concert included Bach Brandenburg Concerto No. 3; Vladimir Rosing (\\"...'the blind Russian tenor', as somebody in the hall called him - a description which all who have seen him sing will understand\\") sang Tchaikovsky's 'Lensky's Farewell' and other things \\"in his usual intense manner\\", and Madame Ren√©e Clement played √âdouard Lalo's Violin Concerto no. 1 in F. The concert closed with Tchaikovsky's 5th Symphony. The second of the Quinlan Concerts in October/November included the tenor Joseph Hislop and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. The programme contained notes by Edwin Evans. Held at British Library. Arnold Bax's tone-poem The Garden of Fand received its British premi√®re on 11 December. Guilhermina Suggia also played Saint-Sa√´ns's Cello Concerto No. 1. The London music critic of The Musical Times, Alfred Kalisch, was disapproving of Suggia's somewhat demonstrative style of playing. 1921 Moriz Rosenthal played the Chopin Piano Concerto in E minor with the BSO at the Kingsway Hall on Saturday, 15 January 1921. The concert included Vaughan Williams‚Äôs 'London' symphony, and Miriam Licette sang. As part of the Oxford Subscription Concerts, the BSO conducted by Boult gave an orchestral concert on 20 January 1921. Held at the Music Library of the Bodleian Library. At a concert of the British Symphony Orchestra on 5 February, Boult revived John Ireland's Forgotten Rite. The Quinlan Concerts at the Kingsway Hall came to an end in March 1921 when their promoter was declared bankrupt. Bach's St. Matthew Passion was performed in Westminster Abbey by the Westminster Abbey Special Choir, with the British Symphony Orchestra, on Monday, March 14, 1921. The British Musical Society, founded in 1917, gave two concerts in June at the Queen's Hall with the British Symphony Orchestra. At the first, Sir Eugene Goossens and Boult conducted an all- British concert on 14 June 1921: Josef Holbrooke - Overture to The Children; Vaughan Williams - The Lark Ascending; Sir Eugene Goossens - symphonic poem, The Eternal Rhythm; Cyril Scott - Piano Concerto (the composer at the pianoforte); and Holst's The Planets. This concert included the first performance of the orchestral version of The Lark Ascending, played by Marie Hall who owned a Viotti Stradivarius. Rosing Opera Week at the Aeolian Hall, June 1921, with the BSO At the second \\"Orchestral Plebiscite Concert\\" on 16 June, Hamilton Harty conducted Elgar's Enigma Variations and Bantock's The Sea Reivers: and Walter Damrosch took the podium for performances of the 'Dirge' from Edward McDowell's Indian Pieces, Adventures in a Perambulator by John Alden Carpenter and three numbers from Damrosch's own Iphigenia in Aulis. The Russian tenor recitalist Vladimir Rosing presented a week of small-scale opera at the Aeolian Hall from 25 June to 2 July 1921, with stage director Theodore Komisarjevsky. This brief season of Op√©ra Intime included The Queen of Spades, The Barber of Seville, Bastien et Bastienne, and Pagliacci. The stage of the Aeolian Hall was very small, and looked \\"overcrowded with more than six people on it.\\" Apart from Rosing, other singers in the Tchaikovsky were Augustus Milner, Moses Mirsky, and Raymond Ellis. Winifred Lea, Tudor Davies and Mostyn Thomas appeared in Mozart's comedy, and Raymond Ellis sang Silvio in Pagliacci. The orchestra consisted of principals of the British Symphony Orchestra, with an organ and piano and \\"did its work very effectively under Mr. Adrian C. Boult.\\" The scores were reduced for the purpose by Leslie Heward. The Op√©ra Intime company then toured Glasgow and Edinburgh. =People's Palace concerts= The People's Palace (now part of Queen Mary College) on Mile End Road, London, was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. It included the Queen's Hall for concerts, a vaulted reading room and a Polytechnic college. It was destroyed by fire in 1931. The British Symphony Orchestra under Boult gave two seasons of orchestral concerts in 1921 and 1922. Description: A collection of programmes from performances which took place in the People's Palace, Mile End Road. The majority of programmes are from orchestral concerts, with some programmes from opera, other theatrical events and oratorios. There is a collection of programmes from the 1st and 2nd series of concerts by the British symphony orchestra, conducted by Adrian Boult. Held at RCM library. Use of the hall was given rent-free by William Ellison-Macartney, Governor of the People's Palace. Boult remembers meeting him at the pavilion at Lord's cricket ground, where he was also a governor. The swimming-pool at the People's Palace was much appreciated by Boult and members of the orchestra after concerts. The first concert took place on 16 October 1921. Boult conducted Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G for strings (Bach), A Shropshire Lad by George Butterworth, Brahms's Symphony No. 2, and Francesca da Rimini by Tchaikovsky. Boult preceded each piece with a short, non-technical spoken introduction from the podium. Although these were well- received, Boult realised that \\"many of the audience were from the West End, so knew as much as I did about the music. This cured me of the desire to talk to my audiences.\\" A second People's Palace concert followed on 30 October. Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture; Beethoven's 5th Symphony, Domenico Scarlatti arr. Tommasini - The Good-humoured Ladies, and Armstrong Gibbs's incidental music for Maeterlinck's The Betrothal. It was reviewed by The Times the following day: :\\"A storm of applause ... Mr Holding leads a body of efficient and ardent musicians. They must have felt they were playing to enthusiasts, and there is no performer in that case who does not surpass himself.An audience seldoms knows how much all that is worth having in music lies in its own hands.\\" On 13 November the overture was Beethoven's Egmont Overture, Frederick Holding gave Elgar's Violin Concerto, and the symphony was Mozart's No. 39 in E‚ô≠. Other works included in the programmes of the six concerts before Christmas: Schubert: C major symphony, and one by Haydn; Elgar: 2nd symphony (\\"with which Mr. Boult made such a stir at Queen‚Äôs Hall last year\\"), and the Violin Concerto; Holst: Beni Mora Suite; Strauss: Don Quixote; Bliss's M√™l√©e Fantastique; Frederick Laurence: Dance of the Witch Girl;Laurence, b. 25 May 1884, was a pupil of Holbrooke. overtures to Weber's Der Freischutz and Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg‚Äù overtures, and others. Eugene Cruft, the principal double-bass, was the orchestra's secretary in 1921. 1922 Vaughan Williams in 1922 The first People's Palace concert of the new year took place on 15 January 1922. Works played included Mozart's Don Giovanni overture; Beethoven's 4th Symphony; Butterworth's first published work, Two English Idylls (1910‚Äì11); and Wagner's Siegfried Idyll. On January 22 the Bach Choir, under its chief conductor Ralph Vaughan Williams, joined the British Symphony Orchestra and gave three of Bach's Church cantatas: Bide with Us, Jesus took unto Him the Twelve, and The Sages of Sheba. C√©sar Franck's Symphony in D minor and John Ireland's The Forgotten Rite were played by the orchestra under Boult on February 12. The concerts were now taking place weekly. The BSO conducted by Boult gave an orchestral concert on 2 February 1922 as part of the Oxford Subscription Concerts, including Butterworth's A Shropshire Lad and Elgar's Symphony No. 2. Nevertheless, attendance figures at the People's Palace concerts had fallen sharply, and after a concert on 5 March 1922 which included Vaughan Williams's London Symphony, they were disbanded. At the Queen‚Äôs Hall on 7 April 1922, Vaughan Williams again conducted the Bach Choir with The Northern Singers (Chrissie MacDiarmid, Florence Taylor, John Adams and George Parker) with the British Symphony Orchestra, led by Frederick Holding. Included in the programme were: William Byrd: Christ is Risen Again; Charles Burke: St Patrick‚Äôs Prayer, Fantasia for chorus and orchestra on two Irish Hymn Melodies; Holst's Choral Hymns from the Rig Veda; and the Stabat Mater by Dvo≈ô√°k. Held at British Library, Music Collections. 1923 Aberystwyth Old College Hall Elgar in the early 1900s Boult seems to have made his last records with the orchestra in February 1923. (See also British Symphony Orchestra discography). The BSO's last concert appearance seems to have been with Elgar in Aberystwyth in 1923. A poster for the 4th Aberystwyth Festival advertised the special visit of Sir Edward Elgar and the British Symphony Orchestra, London, 22, 23 and 25 June 1923. An advance notice in The Musical Times gives the details: :\\"The fourth Aberystwyth Festival will be held by the University College of Wales at the University Hall, Aberystwyth, on June 22 to 25. The conductors will be Sir Edward Elgar, Sir Walford Davies [Professor of Music at Aberystwyth], and Dr. Adrian C. Boult. The choir and orchestra will be formed of members of the College Choral and Orchestral Unions, with various other contingents, and the British Symphony Orchestra. The following is the programme: June 22, Mozart's Symphony in E flat and works by Elgar; June 23, Beethoven's seventh Symphony and Choral Fantasia; June 24, public rehearsal of the St. Matthew Passion; June 25, the St. Matthew Passion (afternoon) and miscellaneous programme (evening).\\" ;Elgar and Jerusalem According to Sir Jack Westrup in a letter to The Musical Times (October 1969), Elgar's orchestration of Parry's Jerusalem was originally made for the Leeds Festival in 1922 when the first half of one of the concerts was devoted entirely to Parry's music, conducted by Sir Hugh Allen. Allen used it again in Oxford in a performance by the Oxford Bach Choir. Westrup had not heard of any performance since then. When Allen died in 1946, Westrup found the autograph of Elgar's arrangement. On the cover is written, in his own hand: 'To Hugh P. Allen in dear memory of Hubert Parry, September 1922'. When Parry's copyright expired at the end of 1968, it occurred to Westrup that Elgar's orchestration, \\"which is clearly designed for mass singing\\", should be better known, and it was published by Curwen Ian Parrott replied two months later: \\"Professor Sir Jack Westrup in his letter [...] says that he knows of only one performance of Elgar's orchestration of Parry's Jerusalem after the Leeds Festival of 1922. My colleague, Charles Clements, reminded me that it was used on the occasion of Elgar's visit to the Aberystwyth Festival of 1923. On that occasion Walford Davies and Mr Clements played as a piano duet in the front of the orchestra and he felt that Elgar did not wholly approve, especially as Sir Walford insisted on having the lid open. However, since it is for 'mass singing', no doubt Elgar fell in with Sir Walford's typical ad hoc treatment.\\" Orchestra members * Albert Sammons - leader in 1909 * Frederick Holding - leader in 1921 * Eugene Cruft - Principal double bass from 1919. * James MacDonagh - Principal oboe / Cor anglais ;Frederick Holding A pupil of Carl Flesch, Holding owned a Stradivarius ('The Penny'). He was leader of the 'old' Philharmonic Quartet, formed in 1915 initially consisting of Arthur Beckwith (first violinist), (Sir) Eugene Aynsley Goossens (second violin), Raymond Jeremy (viola) and Cedric Sharpe (cellist). World War 1 interrupted their work as some of the members were eventually called up for service. In 1918 they reformed with Frederick Holding taking over from Goossens, becoming the first violin in 1919 with Thomas Peatfield the new second violinist. For a series of concerts in February 1921 at the Essex Hall the quartet consisted on 2 February of: Holding (1st violin), Samuel Kutcher (2nd violin), E. Tomlinson (viola) and Giovanni Barbirolli (cello). For the second concert on 13 February 1921 it consisted of Frederick Holding, Samuel Kutcher, Raymond Jeremy and Cedric Sharpe. ;Eugene Cruft During WW1, Eugene Cruft helped recruit musicians to entertain the troops, while serving with the Motor Transport division of the Army Service Corps. He fought with the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade at Passchendale and on the Somme. He helped to form the new British Symphony Orchestra. He was the orchestra's Honorary Secretary from its inception, and became a life-long friend of Boult. He was principal double-bass player in the BBC Symphony Orchestra 1929‚Äì1947 during Boult's conductorship. ;James MacDonagh James MacDonagh (1881‚Äì1931), an accomplished musician on several instruments, was principal oboist and cor anglais player with the British Symphony Orchestra. He was the third eldest brother of Thomas MacDonagh, who was shot in Kilmainham Gaol with Padraic Pearse and Tom Clarke after the 1916 Easter Rising. His son, Terence MacDonagh (1907/08‚Äì86), also played the oboe and cor anglais with both the BBC Symphony Orchestra (of which he was a founder member), and with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Thomas Beecham; he served on the board of the Royal College of Music. Third formation: recording orchestra, 1930‚Äì1932 Ethel Smyth's recording of her The Wreckers overture with the British Symphony Orchestra After the 4th Aberystwyth Festival in summer 1923, the orchestra's name seems to disappear entirely until the 1930s when it appears on around fifteen or so 78 rpm recordings made by the Columbia Graphophone Company in Central Hall, Westminster from 1930 to 1932. According to Michael Gray, at least three of these electrical recordings were very probably made by the Orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society, and it seems possible that this pickup orchestra is responsible for the remainder, as well as recordings of Sibelius's first two symphonies with Robert Kajanus. A certain amount of mystique surrounds these vintage recordings made around 90 years ago: partly because the identity of this ensemble is somewhat uncertain; partly because in only a handful of recordings do the details taken from Columbia's own contemporary session logs and matrix notes actually match up completely with the information on the record labels; and partly because of Columbia's habit of replacing old recordings with newer ones (often of different works and by other artists), but keeping the old catalogue number. Conductors of these recording sessions include Ethel Smyth, Oskar Fried, Bruno Walter, Felix Weingartner, and Henry Wood. Fourth formation: public concerts, 1934-1939 In October 1934 a somewhat subdued notice appeared in the organ advertisement section of The Musical Times: :The London Society of Organists, South-Western Branch [ie London SW]. \\"The British Symphony Orchestra (recruited from unemployed British Musicians) will supply small combinations for Oratorios, Cantatas, and any Church functions needing musicians.\\" Also includes an advertisement for a concert by the Royal Choral Society conducted by Malcolm Sargent, in memory of Delius, Elgar and Holst, who had all died in that same year. From January 1934 to January 1935 a British Symphony Orchestra appeared in three National Sunday League Concerts at the London Palladium, all conducted by Charles Hambourg. 7 January 1934: orchestral concert. 4 November 1934: the violin soloist was Marie Hall, who had given the first performance of The Lark Ascending with an earlier British Symphony Orchestra in June 1921. On 13 January 1935 the concert included the duo-piano team of Vronsky & Babin. Held at RCM. The English composer and conductor Charles Proctor (1906‚Äì96) gave two concerts on 12 November 1938 and 29 April 1939, conducting his own Alexandra Choral Society with a British Symphony Orchestra at the Northern Polytechnic Institute, Holloway Road. Held at RCM.Sole recording (acoustic) of Proctor conducting works by F. J. Nettlefold, plus Albert Coates with Tod und Verklarung. Recent formations 1989 The music for the 1989 film La R√©volution fran√ßaise, directed by Robert Enrico and Richard T. Heffron, was composed and conducted by Georges Delerue. It was performed by the British Symphony Orchestra with chorus. This seems to have been an ensemble of freelance musicians from the Greater London area, recorded at HMV Abbey Road Studios in August 1989. 2004  Subrata Roy At the sumptuous wedding of Sushanto and Seemanto Roy, the sons of the Indian businessman Subrata Roy, chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, a British Symphony Orchestra was specially flown to Lucknow to perform modern and traditional Indian melodies. 2016 Philip Mackenzie, as principal conductor, formed a British Symphony Orchestra in 2016. The orchestra is made up of freelance musicians and based in London. It has performed with, inter alia, the Revival ABBA Tribute Band, Never The Bride and Gordon Hendricks. George Morton was the guest conductor of the British Symphony Orchestra's tour in China (27 December 2017 ‚Äì 9 January 2018). They played nine concerts including works by contemporary Chinese composers, along with Western music including Sibelius: Finlandia; Tchaikovsky: Marche Slave; Bizet: Carmen Suite No. 1; and Elgar: Enigma Variations. Discography In popular culture *In Diana Wynne Jones's 1984 novel for young adults Fire and Hemlock, Thomas Lynn (Tam Lin) was a member of a 'British Symphony Orchestra' and there is reference to a poster or photo of other musicians in the band, with some of whom Tom wants to form a quartet. * A 'British Symphony Orchestra' appears in The Lady in the Van, a 2015 film directed by Nicholas Hytner, written by Alan Bennett, and starring Maggie Smith as 'Miss Shepherd' and Alex Jennings as Alan Bennet. It tells the (mostly) true story of 'Mary Shepherd', an elderly woman who lived in various dilapidated vans on Bennett's driveway in London for 15 years. Miss Shepherd was a musician. In one scene when the character of Alan Bennett is sifting through Mary Shepherd's paperwork, he finds a poster for a concert at the King's Hall in which she played Chopin's Piano concerto No. 1 with the British Symphony Orchestra. The BSO is played in the film by the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by George Fenton, who also composed the incidental music. Disambiguation For other orchestras with the same initials, see BSO ¬ß Music. * Not to be confused with the British Women's Symphony Orchestra or the British Youth Symphony Orchestra. * A general quiz website includes a reference to a certain \\"Karl Mack (german conductor of the British Symphony Orchestra), arrested for not playing the star spangled banner.\\"[sic] A web page including a biography of the composer Carlos Guastavino mentions 'the British Symphony Orchestra', probably meaning the BBC Symphony Orchestra. * Various films and 78rpm recordings featured ensembles with a similar-sounding title, with misleading results for those unable to read. For example, the band for Alfred Hitchcock's 1929 Blackmail‚Äîproduced by British International Pictures‚Äîwas the 'British International Symphony Orchestra' and not, according to at least one source, the 'British Symphony Orchestra'. * A number of catchy 78rpm recordings feature the studio ensemble of the Gaumont-British film production company, conducted by Louis Levy, general Music Director at Gaumont. Although the name is correctly hyphenated on e.g. record labels and in listings in the Radio Times (often on a line break), the dash has been frequently omitted in later transcriptions, perhaps leading to confusion. The names used by this ensemble include, chronologically, 'Gaumont-British Studio Orchestra', 'Gaumont-British Symphony' 'Gaumont British Symphony', and the 'Gaumont-British Symphony Orchestra'.

Discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 27, 1785, NGC 3862 is an outlying member of the Leo Cluster. The galaxy is classified as a FR I radio galaxy and as a Head-tail radio galaxy. It hosts a supermassive black hole that is blasting a jet of plasma that is moving at 98 percent of the speed of light and is one of the few jets that can be seen in visible light. Jet Observations made by Bridle et al. in 1981 using maps made with the VLA revealed a jet-like structure emerging from the nucleus of NGC 3862. In late January 1992, the HST observed NGC 3862 with the Faint Object Spectrograph confirmed the presence of an optical jet in nucleus of NGC 3862. A sequence of Hubble images taken between 1994 and 2014 showing the jet in NGC 3862. The optical jet which has a measured length of , appears to expand slowly and dims in peak and integrated brightness within the interior to the apparent ring of dust. Within distances of about , the jet appears narrow and well-collimated. At a distance of the jet starts to abruptly expand and becomes turbulent. At this distance, filaments and pronounced kinks can be observed which suggests that the jet is oscillating or evolving a helical structure. After crossing the ring at a distance of around , the jet widens dramatically, changes direction, and dims more rapidly both in peak and integrated brightness and becomes more diffuse in appearance. This suggests that the jet is interacting with the dust ring and becomes less collimated. However, Perlman et al. suggests that the disk and the jet occupy physically distinct regions of the galaxy and therefore not interacting. The total amount of energy produced by the jet is estimated to be around 3.71 √ó 1042 ergs. Knots The jet of NGC 3862 contains four faint knots of material designated in increasing order from the nucleus: Knot A, B, C and D. The knots exhibit a structure similar to that of a string of pearls. Radio Morphology NGC 3862 contains a Head-tail radio morphology with two tails that extend . This morphology appears to be the result of the galaxy interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Nucleus The central region of NGC 3862 appears host a nearly face-on disk of dust with a diameter of . However, as the jet of galaxy has been suggested to lie at angle of 50¬∞ to Earth's line of sight, the dust disk must be puffed up in order of the jet to have been disturbed by the disk. The emission of CO in the nucleus exhibits a double-horned line profile which suggests that the dust disk is rotating. The inferred distribution of the CO is consistent with the observed dust disk and the presence of the molecular gas suggests that the gas originated from ether a merger with two gas-rich galaxies a few billion years ago or from cannibalism of smaller gas-rich galaxies. Hutchings et al. proposed instead that the apparent disk represents an evacuated region cleared of dust by some nuclear related process or by the jet itself as indicated by the color of the region inside the ring being similar to the color of the galaxy spectrum. Lara et al. also suggested this as the jet appears to widen within the apparent ring which would be consistent with an explanation of a favored expansion of the jet due to the lower density medium within the evacuated region or bubble. Supermassive black hole NGC 3862 contains a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of M‚òâ. The black hole is responsible for producing the jet of plasma that is moving at nearly the speed of light. Companion galaxies NGC 3862 has an elliptical or a lenticular companion galaxy known as IC 2955. It lies about from NGC 3862.

He is referred in a Jiyu inscription as , which means ruler of Majapahit, Janggala and Kediri, and as Pa Bu Ta La in Chinese literature. Background Ranawijaya was born in Trowulan (also called Wilwatikta) to King Singhawikramawardhana during a time of upheaval and decline across the Empire. In 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against King Singhawikramawardhana and captured Trowulan. The king moved to Daha, the former capital of Kadiri, where he died. Thus when Ranawijaya ascended the throne in 1474, the empire was divided. Early Rule For the first four years, Ranawijaya ruled from Daha in a climate of increasing conflict between Daha and Trowulan. This culminated in Perang Sudarma Wisuta, meaning the war between father and son, in 1478. In 1478, Ranawijaya's army under Udara attacked the defences at Trowulan. Raden Patah of Demak sent reinforcements under Sunan Ngudung. According to Babad Tanah Jawi, Raden Patah was the son of Kertabhumi and a Chinese concubine. Sunan Ngudung died in the battle and was replaced by Sunan Kudus, but the army managed to turn back Ranawijaya's forces. However, they did not stop Udara's troops storming the palace and killing Kertabhumi. Later Rule With the death of Kertabhumi, Ranawijaya was now undisputed ruler of Majapahit. He styled himself Girindrawardhana, the latter to show continuity with his predecessors back to Kritavijaya in 1447. In the Trailokyapuri Jiwu and Petak inscriptions, Girindrawardhana claims that he reunited Majapahit as one kingdom. In the Jiyu inscription, he is referred to as , which means ruler of Majapahit, Janggala and Kediri in 1486. However, his power was substantially smaller than his predecessors. Raden Patah named himself the Sultan of Demak and ceased paying homage to the Brawijaya. From that time, the Demak Sultanate rose to become the dominant force in Java. Demak continued to fight Girindrawardhana. As they claimed descent from Kertabumi, Raden Patah and his successor Pati Unus fought Girindrawardhana in retribution for his death. This conflict undermined the thriving economy, In 1489, the vice-regent and successful general, Udara, deposed Girindrawardhana, naming himself Brawijaya VII.

The novel is a literary thriller, social satire, and dark comedy about America's obsession with sex, celebrity, and the internet, which explores a pornography addict‚Äôs unwilling relationship with a woman who thinks she can speak to God and their entanglement with sex traffickers that cater to the Hollywood elite. Grothaus has stated that his personal experiences at the Cannes Film Festival and his disillusionment with the Hollywood film industry were strong inspiration for the novel.  Plot  The novel‚Äôs protagonist is Jerry Dresden an employee at the Art Institute of Chicago who suffers from a porn addiction as well as psychotic depression. Both are the result of the tragic deaths of his little sister and high-flying Hollywood father years earlier. As a result of his psychotic depression, Jerry suffers from psychotic delusions which make him see people who don‚Äôt really exist‚Äîpeople Jerry calls \\"figments\\". His mundane but stable life is interrupted one day when his colleague at the museum is murdered and a famous painting by Vincent Van Gogh (Self-Portrait, Spring 1887) is stolen. Returning from work that night Jerry finds the stolen painting in his apartment and the next day he discovers that a woman who he thought was just one of his figments his entire life turns out to be a real person. This former figment tells Jerry her name is Epiphany Jones and admits she stole the painting and killed Jerry's colleague in order to frame him and blackmails him into helping her find someone she is looking for. Left with no choice, Jerry flees with her to Mexico, then Portugal, and finally to the Cannes Film Festival in France as Epiphany, which says the voice of God is speaking to her and telling her what to do, tracks down a sex trafficking ring that caters to the Hollywood elite. Along the way, Jerry discovers Epiphany is not all she seems to be as their journey grows increasingly fraught with danger and he discovers secrets about both their pasts that will change his life forever.  Themes  As a social satire, Epiphany Jones explores America's obsession with celebrity, especially sex and celebrity. The novel also deals with the isolating aspects of the internet. The main protagonist's porn addiction to fake celebrity pornography, a precursor to deepfakes, is used as a vehicle to explore both subject matters. The novel also examines the nature of belief in a Christian god versus the objective empirical world. This faith versus reason battle is explored in Jerry Dresden's and Epiphany Jones' relationship throughout the novel.  Reception  Epiphany Jones received positive reviews in the mainstream press and on book blogs. The Bookseller described the novel as \\"an energetic, inventive, gritty and deeply moving thriller cum dark comedy, Epiphany Jones addresses the challenging subject of sex trafficking in a powerful narrative driven by exceptionally well-drawn, unforgettable protagonists.\\" The Sunday Express named Epiphany Jones as one of the 'Best Reads for the Summer', calling it \\"gloriously funny but dark as hell.\\" The Guardian named it one of the best recent novels, saying Epiphany Jones is \\"complex, inventive and a genuine shocker, this is the very opposite of a 'comfort' read.\\" Literary critic Maxim Jakubowski called Epiphany Jones \\"a truly impressive debut\\" and \\"a twisting tale at the same time realistically gripping and sardonic\\" and praised Grothaus' writing for having \\"a delicate fluency which contrasts with the depravity of his subject matter.\\" The New York Daily News said Epiphany Jones \\"is a captivating story that manages to be funny, sinister and surprising\\" and praised Grothaus' main characters as \\"complex and well- rounded‚Äîequal parts sympathetic, mad and maddening.\\" In 2018 Entertainment Weekly named Epiphany Jones one of the 25 \\"Most Irresistible Hollywood Novels\\" of the last 100 years alongside novels by Joyce Carol Oates, Evelyn Waugh, Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, and F.

An artistic innovator in his field, his work integrates the time-based forms of video with practices of computer imagery and print, animation, virtual reality, installation, and writing. He addresses the electronic image as a technological metaphor for perception, memory and dream: signals oscillate between lighting up and blanking out, between sensory presence, mental apparition and oblivion. As art historian Dominique Radrizzani writes in the catalog Astral Memories of a Flying Man: \\"It is this luminous realm of dream that Hahn‚Äôs great art of light and shadow rediscovers, using video like those infinite eyes which night has opened in us (Novalis) ... The terrains explored by Hahn are not those of the terrestrial globe anymore, but rather those of the ocular globe, the inward looking hemisphere of the eye.\\"  Life  Hahn was born in Zurich and grew up in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland. Introduced to computers while at the gymnasium Kantonsschule Z√ºrcher Oberland in Wetzikon (1966‚Äì1973), he created a game of snakes and ladders in the APL (programming language). During his studies in Visual arts education at the Zurich University of the Arts (Bachelor in 1979), he made his first videos and Super8 films, e.g. Flight and Glass (1976) or the Mockumentary Demis (1977) about the singer Demis Roussos. In 1981, he moved to New York and participated in the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program (ISP). In 1990 he spent nine months in Rome as a fellow of the Istituto Svizzero. Between 1991 and 1994 he lived in Berlin, first as a fellow of the DAAD, the German Academic Exchange Service, then as Artist-in-residence at ART+COM. From 1995 to 1997, he lived in Warsaw. Today, Hahn lives and works in the Lower East Side of New York City and in Zurich.  Work  In her analysis \\"Miniature and Series: The Re- invention of the Epistolary Form in the Work of Alexander Hahn\\", Cathie Payne writes that his \\"method of engaging with the very small, the fleeting, and the momentary, is part of an intimate, deeply personal and reflexive practice that offers a way to reproach the world through this change of scale - a world in miniature - and to reflect on this strangeness, vastness and beauty of what is found within the context of accelerated urban density and a changing anthropogenic worldview.\\" Since his first exhibition at the Lucerne Gallery Apropos in 1978, Hahn showed his work worldwide in over 20 solo exhibitions and in over 100 group shows and video festivals.

He practiced medicine in Kansas City, Kansas, where he served in multiple county-level positions and on the staff of local hospitals. In 1953, he became president of the National Medical Association. He received a pilot's license in 1928, making him one of the first licensed African-American pilots in the nation, and played an important role in the development of African-American aviation nationally. Early life and medical career Davis was born on November 13, 1890 in Palestine, Texas to Louisa Craven and William W. Davis. He received his medical education at the historically black Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Upon graduating in 1913, he moved to Kansas City, Kansas to begin his practice; he also continued his education at Sumner Junior College and the University of Kansas. Davis' first medical practice was in the Argentine neighborhood of Kansas City; as Davis spoke Spanish, he was able to grow his practice through the area's large Mexican immigrant population. He later relocated his main office to a multi-story building at 422 Minnesota Avenue in downtown Kansas City. In 1920, Davis opened the Davis Maternity Sanitarium for Unwed Mothers, which provided maternity services in complete privacy for African-American mothers; while these services were commonly available for white women at the time, few other facilities provided them for black women. In 1926, Davis became the first black Assistant Health Director of Wyandotte County, a position he held until 1932. He served on the staff of two area hospitals, Wheatley-Provident Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri and Douglas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas. Davis served two two-year terms as Deputy Coroner of Wyandotte County, beginning in 1940 and 1950. The National Medical Association, a national organization of African-American physicians barred from the American Medical Association due to their race, elected him president in 1953. Aviation and other pursuits In addition to his work as a physician, Davis was a distinguished aviator. He earned his pilot's license on May 16, 1928, making him one of the first federally licensed African-American pilots. He purchased his first plane the same day, and he flew it to Chicago the next year for the first national meeting of African-American pilots; Davis was the only attendant who was not from Chicago. In 1939, Davis was awarded the Dwight H. Green Trophy for his contributions to aviation by the National Airmen's Association of America, an organization of African-American aviators. He was also named one of the association's seven vice presidents, and helped plan the following year's annual meeting in Kansas City. Davis also pursued business interests in addition to his primary career. He founded both the Red Top taxi company and the Service Finance Corporation savings and loan agency, the first black-owned businesses of their kind in the state of Kansas, in 1927. He later became involved with real estate, redeveloping and renting several homes in his neighborhood in the 1940s and buying a mobile home park in 1953. Personal life Davis married his wife Hazel on September 1, 1926. The couple had one daughter, A. Portia Davis. In his early life, Davis took an interest in jazz music and performance. He wrote a piece in 1920 which was composed by James Scott, another Kansas City resident and a prominent ragtime composer. The next year, he starred in Lure of a Woman, a black-and-white silent film which was one of the first produced by African-Americans in Kansas City. The Davis couple completed a home in Kansas City, known as Castle Rock, in 1938. The house featured a French Eclectic design and had an extensive list of modern amenities, which were documented in an article in the Kansas City Call. They opened the house to the public upon its completion, drawing 400 visitors. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It owns 39 patents worldwide with intellectual property for the isolation of stem cells from the umbilical-cord lining membrane of all mammals, which also includes the banking and cultivation of these cells, as well as the therapeutic applications of these cells. The firm was founded in 2002 by Phan Toan Thang, Ivor Lim and Gavin Tan and originally sold skin cell samples for research. In 2014, it was reported that the company was worth $640 million. Operations In 2004, Phan found two unique kinds of stem cells from the outer lining membrane of the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord lining can yield 6 billion epithelial and 6 billion mesenchymal stem cells from a primary explant in one generation. In comparison, bone marrow produces a few million mesenchymal stem cells per bone marrow aspiration. Initial studies focused on wound healing. In 2015, the firm began developing current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) grade cord lining mesenchymal stem cells, which could be used for human transplantation. The stem cell product, called CorLiCyte, was approved for a USFDA trial to heal diabetic wounds, to be completed around 2018-2019. The firm also developed the skin care product CALECIM, made from red deer umbilical cord lining extract, which comprises secreted cell proteins integrated into a cream and serum cosmetic product.

Having immigrated from the Netherlands to British Mandatory Palestine in 1926, she became the chief dietitian for Hadassah hospitals and head of Hadassah's school lunch program. Her 1939 book Tzunatenu (Our Nutrition) was a standard elementary-school textbook for nearly 30 years. She founded and directed the Institute of Nutrition Education in 1952 and was founder and dean of the College of Nutrition and Home Economics in Jerusalem from 1953 to 1965. After her retirement, she continued to engage in research and conducted periodic nutrition surveys for the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. Early life and education Sarah Bavly was born in Amsterdam to Nathan and Lina-Leah Bavly. She was the youngest of five children in a religious Jewish family. She and her siblings all belonged to the Zionist youth movement, and all made aliyah to Palestine between 1919 and 1926. Sarah received her M.S. in chemistry at the University of Amsterdam in 1925. On the recommendation of a friend who had already made aliyah, she spent the following year acquiring specialized training in nutrition and economics in order to bring useful work skills to Palestine. Career Her first position in Palestine was as a teacher of nutrition and chemistry at a WIZO school in Nahalal, where she taught young women in their twenties. In April 1927 she left the moshav for a position as dietitian at the Hadassah hospital in Tel Aviv. Shortly afterward, she was engaged as a teacher of nutrition and dietetics at the Hadassah Nursing School in Jerusalem, becoming the first educator in the country to teach these subjects. In 1928 she was offered the position of chief dietitian for all five Hadassah hospitals in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Safed, and Tiberias, including the set-up and managing of dietary departments at each location. Before assuming this post, she was sent abroad by the Hadassah directorship for a study year abroad. She interned briefly at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York and then enrolled at Columbia University Teachers College, where she completed her M.S. in one year. In addition, she gained practical experience in school lunch programs with a one-month stint at a diet clinic in Boston. Bavly returned to Palestine in August 1929. In addition to her new role as chief dietitian for Hadassah hospitals, she was asked to open a nutrition department at the recently constructed Nathan Straus Health Center in Jerusalem. However, the 1929 Palestine riots broke out at this time and she and other residents were forced to take shelter in the Straus Center for a week. In this and other emergency situations over the coming two decades, Bavly's department supervised and provided food for immigrants and for paramilitary and military forces. In 1930 she was named director of the Hadassah school lunch program, which furnished 1,000 children in eight schools and 12 kindergartens with a daily meal. She also supervised nutrition education programs for the public. She and other Hadassah educators called for the creation of a \\"national diet\\" by combining locally available food sources with nutrition science. She encouraged immigrants to leave behind the eating habits of their native countries and add locally-grown foodstuffs to their diets, saying, \\"The new immigrant must not only learn, he must also forget\\". In 1939 she published the book Tzunatenu (Our Nutrition), which became a standard elementary school textbook for nearly 30 years. Raviv notes that the book had outdated itself by the 1960s since it promoted the foodstuffs used primarily by European immigrants to pre-state Israel, without mentioning the foods and spices used by Jews from Arab lands who immigrated en masse after the founding of the state. Foreseeing the need to develop formal training programs and courses for dietitians and nutritionists in the Hadassah system after the establishment of the State of Israel, Bavly asked for and received a scholarship to return to Columbia University in 1946. She earned her PhD in nutrition in August 1947. Her doctoral thesis, \\"Family Food Consumption in Palestine\\", was reprinted in 1972 by AMS Press. In 1950 she founded and served as director of the Institute of Nutrition Education, a research institute underwritten by Hadassah. Hadassah transferred the Institute to the State of Israel in 1952. In the 1950s the Ministry of Education and Culture took over the management of the Hadassah school lunch program and home economics courses, with Bavly serving as head of the Ministry's Nutrition Department. In 1953, under the Ministry's auspices, Bavly helped found the College of Nutrition and Home Economics in Jerusalem, a teacher training college for nutritionists who would work in hospitals, clinics, schools, and retirement homes. She became the college's full-time dean in 1960. In 1959 the college was noted for conducting a national survey on nutrition among immigrant families in conjunction with UNICEF and the World Health Organization. Under Bavly's direction, senior students interviewed 800 immigrant families on the subject of dietary habits, illness, and infant mortality. The College operated independently until 1981. Bavly retired from the College of Nutrition and Home Economics in 1965. She continued to engage in research and conducted periodic nutrition surveys for the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. She made pottery as a hobby and was recognized for her artistic talent by the Jerusalem House of Design. In 1984 the Jerusalem Municipality named her an honorary Citizen of Jerusalem. Other activities Bavly served on several government commissions, including those concerning poverty and the teaching of home economics. She was a frequent speaker at international meetings and congresses. Personal life Bavly married Dr. Yehuda Meir Bromberg (1902‚Äì1943), accountant-general of Hadassah, in April 1930. Bromberg later became assistant director-general of the Hadassah Medical Organization in Palestine. The couple had one son and one daughter. She died in 1993. Her papers are stored in File A520 at the Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem.

The British had failed to organise an orderly withdrawal of Egyptian forces from Sudan, and the defeat at Khartoum left only Suakin and Equatoria under Egyptian control after 1885. The conquest of 1896‚Äì99 defeated and destroyed the Mahdist state and re-established Anglo-Egyptian rule, which remained until Sudan became independent in 1956. Preliminaries Herbert Kitchener, Sirdar of the Egyptian army There was a considerable body of opinion in Britain in favour of retaking Sudan after 1885, largely to \\"avenge Gordon\\". However, Lord Cromer, the British consul-general in Egypt, had been the architect of the British withdrawal after the Mahdist uprising. He remained sure that Egypt needed to recover its financial position before any invasion could be contemplated. \\"Sudan is worth a good deal to Egypt,\\" he said, \\"but it is not worth bankruptcy and extremely oppressive taxation.\\"Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 p.241 He felt it was necessary to avoid \\"being driven into premature action by the small but influential section of public opinion which persistently and strenuously advocated the cause of immediate reconquest.\\" As late as 15 November 1895 he had been assured by the British government that it had no plans to invade Sudan.Edward M. Spiers, Sudan: The Reconquest Reappraised, Routledge, 2013 p.2 By 1896, however, it was clear to Prime Minister Salisbury that the interests of other powers in the Sudan could not be contained by diplomacy alone ‚Äì France, Italy and Germany all had designs on the region that could only be contained by re-establishing Anglo-Egyptian rule.Robert Collins, The British in the Sudan, 1898‚Äì1956: The Sweetness and the Sorrow, Springer, 1984 p.8Harold E. Raugh Jr., British Military Operations in Egypt and the Sudan: A Selected Bibliography, Scarecrow Press, 2008 p.xiv The catastrophic defeat of the Italians by Menelik II of Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa in March 1896 also raised the possibility of an anti-European alliance between Menelik and the Khalifa of Sudan.Harold E. Raugh Jr., British Military Operations in Egypt and the Sudan: A Selected Bibliography, Scarecrow Press, 2008 p.xxviii After Adwa the Italian government appealed to Britain to create some kind of military diversion to prevent Mahdist forces from attacking their isolated garrison at Kassala, and on 12 March the British cabinet authorised an advance on Dongola for this purpose. Salisbury was also at pains to reassure the French government that Britain intended to proceed no further than Dongola, so as to forestall any move by the French to advance some claim of their own on part of Sudan.Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 p.240 The French government had in fact just dispatched Jean-Baptiste Marchand up the Congo River with the stated aim of reaching Fashoda on the White Nile and claiming it for France. This encouraged the British to attempt the full-scale defeat of the Mahdist state and the restoration of Anglo-Egyptian rule, rather than just providing a military diversion as Italy had requested.http://www.militarysunhelmets.com/2014/marchand-and-the-race-for- fashoda accessed 6/1/2017 Lord Salisbury then ordered the Sirdar, Brigadier Herbert Kitchener to make preparations for an advance up the Nile. As Governor-General of Suakin from 1886 to 1888, Kitchener had held off the Mahdist forces under Osman Digna from the Red Sea coast,Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 p.247 but he had never commanded a large army in battle.Edward M. Spiers, Sudan: The Reconquest Reappraised, Routledge, 2013 p.3 Kitchener took a methodical, unhurried approach to recovering Sudan. In the first year his objective was to recover Dongola; in the second, to construct a new railway from Wadi Halfa to Abu Hamad; in the third, to retake Khartoum. Kitchener's forces Sudanese soldiers in the Egyptian army, 1899The Egyptian army mobilised and by 4 June 1896 Kitchener had assembled a force of 9,000 men, consisting of ten infantry battalions, fifteen cavalry and camel corps squadrons, and three artillery batteries. All the soldiers were Sudanese or Egyptian, with the exception of a few hundred men from the North Staffordshire Regiment and some Maxim gunners.Harold E. Raugh Jr., British Military Operations in Egypt and the Sudan: A Selected Bibliography, Scarecrow Press, 2008 p.xxxviii The use of British troops was kept to a minimum and Sudanese troops were used wherever possible, partly because they were cheaper, and partly because they could survive the extreme conditions of campaigning in Sudan which Europeans often could not. To maximise the number of Sudanese troops deployed for the invasion, the Sudanese garrison was withdrawn from Suakin on the Red Sea and replaced with Indian soldiers. The Indians arrived in Suakin on 30 May, releasing the Xth Egyptian and Sudanese battalions for the Dongola expedition.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.202-204 The Egyptian army in the 1880s was consciously trying to distance itself from the times of Muhammad Ali, when Sudanese men had been captured, enslaved, shipped to Egypt and enlisted. Nevertheless, on the eve of the 1896 invasion the manumission status and precise recruitment conditions of many Sudanese soldiers in the Egyptian army was unclear. Egyptian conscripts were required to serve six years in the army, whereas Sudanese soldiers enlisted before 1903 were signed up for life, or until medically unfit to serve.Ronald M. Lamothe, Slaves of Fortune: Sudanese Soldiers and the River War, 1896-1898, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2011 p.32 While no official requirement existed for the practice, it is clear that it many instances at least, new Sudanese recruits into the Egyptian army were branded by their British officers, to help identify deserters and those discharged seeking to re-enlist.Ronald M. Lamothe, Slaves of Fortune: Sudanese Soldiers and the River War, 1896-1898, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2011 pp.33-4 Sudan Military Railroad Rail, river and caravan communications in Sudan during the campaignKitchener placed great importance on transport and communications. Reliance on river transport, and the vagaries of the Nile flooding, had reduced Garnet Wolseley's Nile Expedition to failure in 1885, and Kitchener was determined not to let that happen again. This required the building of new railways to support his invasion forces. The first phase of railway building followed the initial campaign up the Nile to the supply base at Akasha and then on southward towards Kerma. This bypassed the second cataract of the Nile and thereby ensured that supplies could reach Dongola all year round, whether the Nile was in flood or not. The railway extended as far as Akasha on 26 June and as far as Kosheh on 4 August 1896. A dockyard was constructed and three entirely new gunboats, larger than the Egyptian river boats already deployed, were brought in sections by rail, and then assembled on the river. Each carried one 12-pounder forward-firing gun, two 6-pounders midships and four Maxim guns.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.238-41 At the end of August 1896 storms washed away a 12-mile section of the railway as preparations were being made to advance on Dongola. Kitchener personally supervised 5,000 men who worked night and day to ensure it was rebuilt in a week. After Dongola was taken, this line was extended south to Kermah. Building the 225-mile-long railway from Wadi Halfa to Abu Hamad was a much more ambitious undertaking. General opinion held the construction of such a railway to be impossible, but Kitchener commissioned Percy Girouard, who had worked on the Canadian Pacific Railway to under take the project. Work began on the line on 1 January 1897, but little progress made until the line to Kermah was completed in May, when work began in earnest. By 23 July, 103 miles had been laid, but the project was continually under attack from Mahdists based in Abu Hamad. Kitchener ordered General Archibald Hunter to advance from Merawi and eliminate the threat. Hunter's forces travelled 146 miles in eight days and took Abu Hamad on 7 August 1897. Work could then proceed, and the railway eventually reached Abu Hamad on 31 October.Harold E. Raugh Jr., British Military Operations in Egypt and the Sudan: A Selected Bibliography, Scarecrow Press, 2008 pp.xxviii-xxix (see also Battle of Abu Hamed) There were major problems in undertaking a major construction project in a waterless desert, but Kitchener had the good fortune to locate two sources and had wells dug to provide the water needed. To keep within the tight budget limits set by Lord Cromer, Kitchener ordered that the first section of the railway should be built from reused materials scavenged from the Khedive Ismail's derelict railway from the 1870s. In another economy measure, Kitchener borrowed steam engines from South Africa to work on the line.Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 pp.248-59 Kitchener's workforce were soldiers and convicts, and he worked them very hard, sleeping just four hours each night, and doing physical labour himself. As the railway progressed in the extreme conditions of the desert, the number of deaths among his men increased, and Kitchener blamed his subordinates for them.Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 pp.248-50 The Sudan Military Railway was later described as the deadliest weapon ever used against Mahdism. The 230 miles of railway reduced the journey time between Wadi Halfa and Abu Hamad from 18 days by camel and steamer to 24 hours by train, all year round, regardless of the season and the flooding of the Nile. He also had 630 miles of telegraph cable laid, and 19 telegraph offices built along the railway, which were soon handling up to 277 messages per day.Edward M. Spiers, Sudan: The Reconquest Reappraised, Routledge, 2013 pp.2-3 Later, when the line was extended towards Atbara, Kitchener was able to transport three heavily armed gunboats in sections to be reassembled at Abadieh, enabling him to patrol and reconnoitre the river up to the sixth cataract. Campaign of 1896 General Kitchener and the Anglo-egyptian Nile Campaign, 1898 HU93828The Egyptian army moved swiftly to the border at Wadi Halfa and began moving south on 18 March to take Akasha, a village which was to be the base for the expedition. Akasha was deserted when they entered on 20 MarchWinston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.181-84 and Kitchener devoted the next two months to building up his forces and supplies ready for the next advance. Apart from occasional skirmishing, the first serious contact with Mahdist forces took place in early June at the village of Farka (main article:Battle of Ferkeh). The village was a Mahdist strongpoint some way upriver from Akasha; its commanders, Hammuda and Osman Azraq, led around 3,000 soldiers and had evidently decided to hold his ground rather than withdraw as the Egyptian army advanced. At dawn on 7 June, two Egyptian columns attacked the village from north and south, killing 800 Mahdist soldiers, with others plunging naked into the Nile to make their escape. This left the road to Dongola clear, but despite advice to move rapidly and take it, Kitchener adhered to his usual cautious and carefully prepared approach. Kitchener took time to build up supplies at Kosheh, and brought his gunboats south through the Second Cataract of the Nile ready for an assault on Dongola.Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 p.248 The Egyptian river navy consisted of the gunboats Tamai, El Teb, Metemma and Abu Klea as well as the steamers Kaibar, Dal and Akasha. They had been used to patrol the river between Wadi Halfa and Aswan, and were now pressed into service as part of the invasion force. They had to wait however for the Nile to flood before they could navigate over the second cataract, and in 1896 the flood was unusually late, meaning that the first boat could not pass until 14 August. Each of the seven boats had to be physically hauled up over the cataract by two thousand men, at the rate of one boat per day.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.238-247 To this force were added the three new gunboats brought round the cataract by rail and assembled on the river at Kosheh. Dongola was defended by a substantial Mahdist force under the command of Wad Bishara, consisting of 900 jihadiyya, 800 Baqqara Arabs, 2,800 spearmen, 450 camel and 650 horse cavalry. Kitchener was unable to advance on Dongola immediately after the battle of Farka because not long afterwards, cholera broke out in the Egyptian camp, and killed over 900 men in July and early August 1896.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.244-45 With the summer of 1896 marked by disease and severe weather, Kitchener's columns, supported by gunboats on the Nile, finally began to advance up the Nile towards Kerma, at the Third Cataract, where Wad Bishara had established a forward position. Instead of defending it however he moved his forces across the river so that as the Egyptian gunboats came upstream he was able to concentrate heavy fire on them. On 19 September the gunboats made several runs at the Mahdist positions, firing at their trenches, but the fire returned was too intense for them to maintain their position safely. Kitchener therefore ordered them to simply steam on, past the Mahdist position, towards Dongola. Seeing them proceed, Wad Bishara withdrew his forces to Dongola. On 20 September the gunboats exchanged fire with the town's defenders and on 23 Kitchener's main force reached the town.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.261-71 Wad Bishara, seeing the overwhelming size of the Egyptian force, and unnerved by several days of bombardment by the gunboats, withdrew. The town was occupied, as were Merowe and Korti. Total Egyptian losses for the taking of Dongola were one killed and 25 wounded. Kitchener was promoted to Major-General.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.1 pp.272 Campaign of 1897 Paddle steamer 'Bordein' of the Mahdist navyThe fall of Dongola was a shock to the Khalifa and his followers in Omdurman, as it immediately placed their capital under threat. They thought it was likely that Kitchener would attack by striking across the desert from Korti to Metemma, as the Nile Expedition had done in 1885. The Khalifa therefore directed Osman Azraq to hold Abu Klea and Wad Bishara to hold Metemma with a force of Ja'alin. He also ordered Osman Digna in eastern Sudan and his commanders in Kordofan and other regions to bring their forces in to Omdurman, strengthening its defences with some 150,000 additional fighters. This concentrated the Mahdist forces in the capital and the northern approaches, down the Nile to Berber. Aware that Kitchener had a substantial river force which had by now passed up the second cataract into the Dongola Reach, the Khalifa sought to prevent it steaming further upriver by blocking the sixth cataract at the Shabluka gorge, which was the last river obstacle before Omdurman. To this end forts were built at the northern end of the gorge, and the paddle-steamer Bordein carried guns and supplies upriver.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 p.312-14 Kitchener did not advance on Omdurman after taking Dongola, and by May 1897 the Khalifa's forces from Kordofan had increased the size of his forces to the point where he felt able to take a more offensive stance. He therefore decided to advance the Kordofan army down the river to Metemma, in Ja'alin country. The loyalty of the Ja'alin to the Mahdist state had weakened as the Egyptian army advanced, and they were particularly unwilling to have a large army quartered on them. Their chief, Abdallah wad Saad, therefore wrote to Kitchener on 24 June, pledging the loyalty of his people to Egypt and asking for men and weapons to assist them against the Khalifa. Kitchener sent 1,100 Remington rifles and ammunition, but they did not arrive in time to help the Ja'alin defend Metemma from the Khalifa's army, which arrived on 30 June and stormed the town, killing wad Saad and driving his surviving followers away.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 p.319-21 For Kitchener, much of 1897 was taken up extending the railway to Abu Hamed. The town was taken on 7 August and the railway reached it on 31 October. Even before this river strongpoint was secured, Kitchener ordered his gunboats to proceed upriver past the Fourth Cataract. With help from the local Shayqiyya, the attempt began on 4 August, but the current was so strong that the gunboat El Teb could not be hauled over the rapids, and capsized. However the Metemma made the passage safely on 13 August, the Tamai on 14, and on 19 and 20 August the new gunboats Zafir, Fateh and Nasir also passed the cataract.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 p.336-8 The sudden advance of the river force and uncertainty about whether he would be reinforced by the Kordofan Army prompted the Mahdist commander in Berber, Zeki Osman, to abandon the town on 24 August, and it was occupied by the Egyptians on 5 September. The overland route from Berber to Suakin was now reopened, meaning that the Egyptian army could be reinforced and resupplied by river, by rail and by sea. As the Red Sea area returned its loyalty to Egypt, an Egyptian force also marched from Suakin to retake Kassala, which had been temporarily occupied by the Italians since 1893. The Italians ceded control on Christmas Day.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 p.357 For the remainder of the year Kitchener extended the railway line forward from Abu Hamad, built up his forces in Berber, and fortified the north bank of the confluence with the Atbarah River. Meanwhile, the Khalifa strengthened the defences of Omdurman and Metemma and prepared an attack on the Egyptian positions while the river was low and the gunboats could neither retreat below the fifth cataract nor advance above the sixth.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 p.358-60 Campaign of 1898 To be sure of having the necessary strength to defeat the Mahdist forces in their heartland, Kitchener brought up reinforcements from the British army, and a brigade under Major General William F. Gatacre arrived in Sudan at the end of January 1898. The Warwicks, Lincolns and Cameron Highlanders had to march the last thirty miles as the railway had not yet caught up with the front line.Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 p.252 Skirmishes took place in the early Spring, as the Mahdist forces made an attempt in March to outflank Kitchener by crossing the Atbara, but they were outmaneuvered; the Egyptians steamed upstream and raided Shendi. Eventually, at dawn on 8 April, the Anglo-Egyptians mounted a full frontal assault on the forces of Osman Digna with three infantry brigades, holding one in reserve. Fighting lasted less than an hour and concluded with 81 Anglo-Egyptian soldiers killed and 478 wounded, to over 3,000 Mahdist troops dead (main article:Battle of Atbara). The Khalifa's forces then withdrew to Omdurman, abandoning Metemma and the Sixth Cataract so that the Egyptian army could pass unmolested. Preparations then continued for an advance on Omdurman. The railway was extended southwards and additional reinforcements arrived. By mid-August 1898 Kitchener had at his command 25,800 troops, composed of the British Division under Major-General Gatacre, with two British infantry brigades; and the Egyptian Division with four Egyptian brigades under Major General Hunter. The gunboat Zafir, proceeding upriver, foundered and sank opposite Metemma on 28 August. Meanwhile, the Khalifa attempted to lay a mine in the river to prevent the Egyptian boats from bombarding Omdurman, but this resulted in the mine-laying ship Ismailia being blown up with its own mine.Winston Churchill, The River War, vol.2 pp.66-7 The final advance on Omdurman began on 28 August 1898.Harold E. Raugh Jr., British Military Operations in Egypt and the Sudan: A Selected Bibliography, Scarecrow Press, 2008 p.xxix Battle of Omdurman Khartoum and Omdurman Bombardment of Mahdist positions by one of Kitchener's gunboats The defeat of the Khalifah's forces at Omdurman marked the effective end of the Mahdist state, though not the end of campaigning. Over 11,000 Mahdist fighters died at Omdurman, and another 16,000 were seriously wounded. On the British, Egyptian and Sudanese side there were fewer than fifty dead and several hundred wounded.Robert Collins, A History of Modern Sudan, Cambridge University Press, 2008 p.30-31 The Khalifa retreated into the city of Omdurman but could not rally his followers to defend it. Instead they scattered across the plains to the west and escaped. Kitchener entered the city, which formally surrendered without further fighting, and the Khalifa escaped before he could be captured.Winston Churchill, The River War, Longman 1899 vol.2 p.173 British gunboats bombarded Omdurman before and during the battle, damaging part of the city walls and the tomb of the Mahdi, although destruction was not very widespread.M.W.Daly, Empire on the Nile: The Anglo- Egyptian Sudan, 1898-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1986 p.2 There is some controversy about the conduct of Kitchener and his troops during and immediately following the battle. In February 1899, Kitchener responded to criticisms by categorically denying that he had ordered or permitted the Mahdist wounded in the battlefield to be massacred by his troops; that Omdurman had been looted; and that civilian fugitives in the city had been deliberately fired on. There is no evidence for the last accusation, but some foundation for the others.M.W.Daly, Empire on the Nile: The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1986 p.3 In The River War, Winston Churchill was critical of Kitchener's conduct, and in private correspondence he said that 'the victory at Omdurman was disgraced by the inhuman slaughter of the wounded and that Kitchener was responsible for this.' M.W.Daly, Empire on the Nile: The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1986 pp.2-3 The Mahdi's tomb, the largest building in Omdurman, had already been looted when Kitchener gave the order for it to be blown up.M.W.Daly, Empire on the Nile: The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1986 p.5 Kitchener ordered that the Mahdi's remains be dumped in the Nile. He considered and discussed keeping his skull, either as some kind of trophy or as a medical exhibit at the Royal College of Surgeons. Eventually however the head was buried, although anecdotes about its having been turned into an inkpot or a drinking vessel continue to circulate even today.Max Hastings, The Oxford Book of Military Anecdotes, Oxford University Press, 1986 pp.308-10Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899, Simon and Schuster, 2007 p.268 Final campaigns A force under Colonel Parsons was sent from Kassala to Al Qadarif which was retaken from Mahdist forces on 22 September. A flotilla of two boats under General Hunter was sent up the Blue Nile on 19 September to plant flags and establish garrisons wherever seemed expedient. They planted the Egyptian and British flags at Er Roseires on 30 September, and at Sennar on the return journey. Gallabat was reoccupied on 7 December, although the two Ethiopian flags that had been raised there after the Mahdist evacuation were left flying pending instructions from Cairo. Despite the easy recovery of these key towns there remained a great deal of fear and confusion in the countryside across the Jezirah, where bands of Mahdist supporters continued to roam, pillaging and killing for several months after the fall of Omdurman.M.W.Daly, Empire on the Nile: The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, 1898-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1986 p.9 Once control was established in the Jazirah and eastern Sudan, the recovery of Kordofan remained a major military challenge. On 12 July 1898 Marchand had reached Fashoda and raised the French flag. Kitchener hurried south from Khartoum with his five gunboats, and reached Fashoda on 18 September. Careful diplomacy on both men's part ensured that French claims were not pressed and Anglo-Egyptian control was reasserted.Robert Collins, A History of Modern Sudan, Cambridge University Press, 2008 p.32 (see also Fashoda Incident) On 24 November 1899 Colonel Sir Reginald Wingate cornered the Khalifah and 5,000 followers southwest of Kosti. In the ensuing battle the Khalifah was killed along with about 1,000 of his men. Osman Digna was captured, but escaped again.(see also Battle of Umm Diwaykarat) Al Ubayyid was not taken until December 1899, by which it had already been abandoned. In December 1899 Wingate succeeded Kitchener as Sirdar and Governor-General of Sudan when Kitchener departed for South Africa. The newly established Anglo- Egyptian government in Khartoum did not attempt to reconquer the far western territory of Darfur, which the Egyptians had held only briefly between 1875 and the surrender of Slatin Pasha in 1883. Instead, they recognised the rule of the last Keira Sultan, Ali Dinar, grandson of Muhammad al-Fadl, and did not establish control over Darfur until 1913. (see also Anglo-Egyptian Darfur Expedition) Osman Digna was not recaptured until 1900.

It has also been published as The Leap. It tells the story of the leader of a British right-wing populist party who has decided to have his internal rival assassinated. To provide an alibi for himself he stays on a small Channel Island, where he becomes fascinated by a very self-possessed young woman. It was Hopkins' first and only published novel. Plot Peter Plowart, the leader and co-founder of the right-wing populist New Britain Party has decided to have his party co-founder assassinated due to internal conflicts. He travels to Vachau, one of the Channel Islands, to hold a speech and thus give himself an alibi while the assassination is carried out. On the island he finds a young woman whose self-possession intrigues him and makes him want to conquer her. When the woman finds out about Peter's real reason for staying on the island, she decides that he has to die. A power struggle takes place between the two. Conception According to Bill Hopkins' friend Colin Wilson, the book had its background in the nightly conversations the two had in Paris in 1953. Both Hopkins and Wilson admired a set of authors active around year 1900‚ÄîGeorge Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton and Anatole France‚Äîand preferred these to the generations which had followed. Wilson attributed this to the atmosphere of defeat in the works of later generations; he exemplified this with the treatment of Friedrich Nietzsche in Bertrand Russell's influential A History of Western Philosophy, where Nietzsche's use of the word \\"will\\" is reduced to being associated with Nazi Germany. According to Wilson, both he and Hopkins found \\"will\\" to be \\"the only valid starting point for philosophy\\", and they both found Nietzsche's phrase about \\"how one becomes what one is\\" to be of central value. The fictional island of Vachau is based on Sark. Hopkins visited Sark in 1956 to do research for the novel. Publication The book was accepted by MacGibbon & Kee at the height of the angry young men movement, which Hopkins was associated with, and published in 1957. It was republished as The Leap by Deverell & Birdsey in 1984. Reception and legacy The book was heavily attacked by critics upon the publication. Graham Hough of Encounter called it \\"an adolescent power- fantasy, extremely shoddily written\\", and wrote: > What is surprising, after the history of the last thirty years, is that even > the naivest masturbations of the most unhappy young man should be able to > take this openly Fascist form. The fact that this performance has been > treated in some quarters with a moderate respect shows that there is a > dangerous vacuum in our present culture that could easily be filled with > highly unpleasant material; though not, I should have thought, with anything > as poisonously silly as this. According to Wilson, Hopkins remained self-confident on the surface despite the book's reception, but was shaken by what Wilson described as \\"character assassination\\", as opposed to normal literary controversy. When the typescript for Hopkins' second novel, Time and Totality, was accidentally destroyed by fire, Hopkins did not bother to rewrite it.

She married Yi Seong- gye‚Äôs fifth son, Yi Bang-won in 1382 at the age of 17 making her Princess Consort Jeongnyeong of Joseon. When her husband became Crown Prince in 1400, her royal title changed to Crown Princess Consort Jeongbin of Joseon, and was eventually given the royal title of Queen Consort Jeong of Joseon in that same year. She was Queen Consort of King Taejong of Joseon, the third king of Joseon and the mother of King Sejong the Great. Her mother was given the royal title of \\"Princess Consort Samhanguk of the Yeonsan Song clan\\" (Hangul: ÏÇºÌïúÍµ≠ÎåÄÎ∂ÄÏù∏, Hanja: ‰∏âÈüìÂúãÂ§ßÂ§´‰∫∫), and her father was given the royal title of \\"Internal Prince Yeoheung, Min Je\\" (Hangul: Ïó¨Ìù•Î∂ÄÏõêÍµ∞ ÎØºÏ†ú, Hanja: È©™ËààÂ∫úÈô¢Âêõ ÈñîÈúΩ). Queen Wongyeong is described as smart and ambitious and with an astute political ambition, who frequently intervened in state affairs. She assisted her spouse in his way to the throne and convinced him to appoint their eldest son Yangnyeong as crown prince. When he replaced their son as crown prince with the son of a concubine, Queen Wongyeong was enraged and her interference finally resulted in King Taejong executing her younger brothers in order to keep her and her family's ambition in check. Royal Noble Consort Hyobin of the Cheongpung Kim clan was originally one of Queen Wongyeong's servants at the Min household before she became a concubine for King Taejong, and Royal Noble Consort Shinbin of the Yeongwol Shin clan was also originally one of Queen Wongyeong's retinue of assistant court ladies.

She was among the first group of musical artists honored by the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame in 1995. Noted for her use of the Hawaiian vocal technique of \\"ha'i,\\" which emphasizes the transition between a singer's lower and falsetto vocal ranges, and her use of \\"kaona\\" (hidden meaning) when writing song lyrics, she entertained primarily in Hawaii and the mainland United States. She sold leis on the Honolulu piers as a child, and aspired to become a singer like the women she saw greeting incoming passengers. KGU radio manager Marion A. Mulroney discovered her as she sang in a mango tree next door to his home. She performed regularly on KGU, where Royal Hawaiian Band conductor Mekia Kealaka ªi heard her and hired her as a featured soloist in 1925. Her association with the Royal Hawaiian Band would last five decades. During World War II, she had her own radio show on KGU. Early life Lena Kaulumau Wai‚Äòale‚Äòale was born October 16, 1903 in the Pauoa Valley. The youngest of five children, her Native Hawaiian birth parents were Louise Makakoa Poepoe, a musician, and Robert Wai‚Äòale‚Äòale, a Hawaiian composer and vocalist. Lena was hƒÅnai (informally adopted) at birth by Mary Davis Pan and her husband Loon Pan. The practice of hƒÅnai-ing a birth child to an adoptive family was an accepted cultural practice among Hawaiians. As a result of hearing the Hawaiian language in her birth home, Chinese spoken in the Pan family, and English spoken throughout Hawaii, Lena grew up multilingual. The Loo Pan family were not musical, and discouraged her interest in singing. Nevertheless, Lena learned to play the ukulele and won first prize singing \\"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\\" in a contest her birth family entered her into. Many images of her over the decades would show her accompanying herself on the ukulele. Her hƒÅnai family put her to work selling leis on the Honolulu piers before she reached the age of 10. In later years, she reflected on Julia K. Chilton and Lizzie Alohikea being her role models when she watched them sing for incoming passengers at the piers. After attending Kauluwela Elementary School, she then attended Sacred Hearts Academy. Discovery and early career Her singing style has been described as a yodel, female falsetto, or \\"ha'i\\". The \\"ha'i\\" is the sound of the voice break as it moves to the upper range. She was part of the vanguard of Hawaiian women who sang in this style. Historian George Kanahele described how Lena sang with the \\"Hawaiian style reminiscent of Nani Alapai, Juliana Walanika, and Helen Desha Beamer.\\" The story of her discovery by KGU radio manager Marion A. Mulroney hearing her singing in a mango tree is often told as having happened at the YWCA in Honolulu, which had not been built at the time. In Machado's own recollections, she was indeed singing in the mango tree in that spot, but in that era the property was her aunt's home. Mulroney lived next door. Her initial booking on KGU was meant to be a 10-minute set. Listeners phoned in such large numbers that she ended up singing for an hour. At age 22, she married her first husband, police officer Luciano K. Machado, with whom she formed The Machado Troupe consisting of their combined family members. The troupe performed regularly on KGU, entertained at military installations in Hawaii, and by 1927 had already toured the mainland United States.; That same year, Lena took first prize at a singing contest in Honolulu. She was hired by George Paele Mossman as a Hawaiian dance and singing instructor at his newly opened Bell Tone Studio of Music. Lena was being referred to in the news media as \\"The Song ‚Äì Bird of Hawaii\\", and was working with the Johnny Noble orchestra. With variations on the nickname, Lena would become known in Hawaiian music history as \\"Hawaii's Songbird\\"; In March 1928, Brunswick Records sent a team to Honolulu to record local singers. Lena was featured on a number of the records, with a variety of different other singers. Royal Hawaiian Band From 1925 until 1971, she sang with the Royal Hawaiian Band, either as one of the featured vocalists, or as a guest vocalist for special concerts. Her tenure with the band and its conductors was tested over the decades. After hearing her sing, and hearing so much about her, conductor Mekia Kealaka ªi gave her a spot in 1925 as a featured vocalist with the band. When the 1927 maiden voyage of the SS Malolo reached Oahu's shores, the island greeted the ship with a welcoming pageant composed of 300 Hawaiian entertainers and royal descendants. Lena was chosen to be one of the band's soloists for the pageant, along with Nani Alapai and Lizzie Alohikea. All employees of the Royal Hawaiian Band were on the city's payroll, but not contracted exclusively. In 1930, Lena starred in a musical stage production of \\"White Shadows\\", possibly inspired by the 1928 film White Shadows in the South Seas. The show was directed by \\"Prince Leilani\\" (real name Edwin Kaumualiiokamokuokalani Rose), who booked the show for a month's tour of Australia. Lena was not part of the touring company. When Charles E. King took over as bandmaster, Lena resigned in 1931 over a salary dispute and devoted her energies to The Machado Troupe.; ; During her absence from the band, she continued her career, including a 1934 performance of her composition \\"Roosevelt Hula\\" for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at a reception hosted by Territorial Governor Joseph Poindexter. She returned to the band under the direction of Frank J. Vierra. In a series of events that stretched from February through March 1935, Lena was pulled into a political dispute between the city auditor Edwin P. Murray and Mayor George F. Wright. At issue were 121 city employee pay raises approved by the board of supervisors, which Murray rejected as being over the percentage allowed for raises. Without consulting her, Mayor Wright announced a lawsuit filed on her behalf as a test case over the issue. Band leader Vierra explained her absence as a walkout over creative content of her lyrics. While she was being treated at St. Francis Hospital for a nervous breakdown, Vierra dismissed her from the band, but re-hired her within three days.;;;; In 1937, Lena became the victim of forgery and attempted extortion by the assistant band manager B. H. Zablan and his wife. Vierra fired both Lena and the assistant band manager. World War II and post-war After being dismissed from the Royal Hawaiian Band, she began performing in San Francisco,; bringing her troupe to the Golden Gate International Exposition. First hired for only a two-week gig, they were so well received by the audiences that they were held over for the run of the exposition. Her return to Honolulu in February 1941 ended a four-year absence from the islands, with a concert at the Civic Auditorium sponsored by the Hawaiian Lei Sellers Association.; Under the direction of conductor Domenico Moro in 1941, she appeared as a guest soloist with the Royal Hawaiian Band. Reacting to public requests for her to become the band's regular featured soloist, the government's board of supervisors allocated $2,000 for her to accompany the band to Hawaii's outlying areas, including military installations. Beginning in 1943, Lena had her own radio show on KGU. A worldwide radio broadcast that continued through 1947, it featured regular musicians Sam Ka\`eo, Lani Sang, Roy Ah Mook Sang, George Pokini, Sonny Nicholas, \\"Little Joe\\" Kekauoha, and Edith Na\`auao. Several sources claim Lena was the first woman in the United States to host her own radio show; however, The Kate Smith Hour began on CBS Radio in 1931 and continued into the next decade. In late 1948 and early 1949, she toured the mainland United States. In September 1949, Lena and several Honolulu investors filed for incorporation of the Pago Pago Night Club. The club had previously existed with different owners. Under its new owners, it opened September 29, 1949, serving 300 customers through the night. Lena and band leader Ray Andrade were the featured entertainment. Later life and death She continued to perform in Hawaii, and in July 1952 took her troupe to Chicago, to perform at \\"Harry's Waikiki\\" nightclub owned by Hawaii residents Harry and Alice Nakamura. The troupe remained at the venue for several months, playing to a packed house each night, returning to Hawaii in May 1953.; While entertaining on the mainland in March 1956, a fall in a friend's home sidelined her in a wheelchair for months with a broken hip and ribs. Although predicted to be in rehabilitation for more than a year, she was performing again by October, \\"At first I crawled, then I held the walls, next I used a cane, and now I walk, drive and do a little dancing.\\"; Her husband Luciano Machado died in 1957. In her own later obituary, it stated her only pregnancies were stillbirths. However, a 1934 newspaper account mentions two daughters with Luciano, Rose Piilani age 16 and Catharine Ualani age 15, both born years before the marriage. It is possible these children were hƒÅnai. Two years after Luciano's death, she married widower Samuel Kaiwi, and went into semi-retirement in 1963. Driving to their new home on Kauai in 1965, she and her husband survived a car accident, but Lena was permanently blinded in one eye, and additional injuries left her physically challenged. She once again joined the Royal Hawaiian Band in 1971, under director Kenneth K. Kawashima, for a Veterans Day concert at Kapiolani Park. In 1973, she broke her hip, and her medical care and rehabilitation were so extensive and costly that vocalist Genoa Keawe hosted a benefit concert in Honolulu. She died January 23, 1974. During Hawaiian Music Week in November 1974, entertainment editor Wayne Harada at The Honolulu Advertiser produced a list of Hawaii's music memories, that included \\"Lena Machado, belting out a song, with trusty ukulele in place.\\" South Seas Records re-released an album of her songs that December, remastered for stereo. In 1995, Lena was in the first group of entertainers honored by the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame. Discography Compositions The Hawaiian dictionary definition of \\"kaona\\" is, \\"Hidden meaning, as in Hawaiian poetry; concealed reference, as to a person, thing, or place; words with double meanings that might bring good or bad fortune.\\" How to craft that into a song, or \\"hula ku‚Äòi\\", was a skill Lena learned as a child when she sold leis on the piers. That ability served her well as she became adept at composing and presenting \\"hula ku‚Äòi\\" to the audience. Partial listing.

The public library had its beginnings with the Young Men's Literary Association, established in 1859, and their book collection was the basis for the library's collection. with The books were housed in a variety of buildings over the years. The community applied for a grant from Andrew Carnegie who on January 12, 1901 contributed $71,500 to build the library building. Local businessman Frank D. Stout donated the property, which was worth $20,000, in honor of his father Henry L. Stout. The two-story Bedford stone and brick building was designed by Chicago architects W. G. Williamson and John Spencer. It is considered one of the finest examples of the Classical tradition of Beaux-Arts architecture in Iowa. The main facade is dominated by a Roman Corinthian portico that was modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. Its fluted columns are matched with pilasters on the wall behind. The building was dedicated on October 17, 1902, and it opened three days later.

History  On 30 October 1903, the 8th East Siberian Rifle Brigade was formed with the 29th, 30th, 31st, and 32nd East Siberian Rifle Regiments, under the command of Leonid Artamonov. The brigade became a division on 22 April 1904 and was based at Krasnoyarsk. Its 1st Brigade at Krasnoyarsk included the 29th (Achinsk) and 30th Regiments (Krasnoyarsk), and its 2nd Brigade at Krasnoyarsk and later Kansk included the 31st (Krasnoyarsk) and 32nd Regiments (Kansk). Vladimir May-Mayevsky was division chief of staff between 1904 and 1906. The division participated in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and 1905, part of the 2nd Siberian Rifle Corps. It fought in the Battle of Shakhe River and the Battle of Sandepu. The division was redesignated the 8th Siberian Rifle Division in 1910. In 1914, it was part of the 3rd Siberian Army Corps and also included the 8th Siberian Rifle Artillery Brigade. During World War I, the division and its corps were transferred to the Northwestern Front. The division fought in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes in late February 1915. The division was the first unit of its corps to reach the important Biebrza River crossing at Sztabin. This enabled the 3rd Siberian Corps and the 26th Army Corps to cross the river and escape a German encirclement.

It opened in 1954 and was anchored by Carson Pirie Scott and Co. The mall was closed and demolished in 2006 except for the Carson's store which remained open until 2018 and which was demolished in 2019. The site is now occupied by the Hammond Sportsplex & Community Center. History The Chicago-based developers Landau & Heyman purchased a 20-acre lot in the Woodmar neighborhood of Hammond, Indiana in 1953. They commissioned architect Victor Gruen, who designed the mall as a \\"v\\" with a Carson Pirie Scott and Co. store in the center. The shopping center was constructed at a cost of $3 million and opened in early 1954 with eight stores including J.J. Newberry and National Supermarkets. Fourteen additional stores opened on May 19 of that year. The Carson's store was the first one established by the Chicago-based merchant in the state of Indiana and opened on November 1, 1954. In 1964, the Carson's store was expanded from 65,000 sq. ft. to 115,000 with the addition of a third floor. The following year, the mall was enclosed. After J.J. Newberry left the mall, its former space was subdivided into a 15-store \\"mini mall\\" called the \\"Court of Lions\\" which opened in September 1975. This generated three times the rent the Newberry's had provided and a combined business volume \\"between three and four times that of the variety store.\\" The Court of Lions saw its revenues increase by 50% over the course of the next three years. It was modeled after the Court of the Lions in Granada, Spain. A similar mini-mall, the \\"Court of Turtles\\" opened in 1977 in the space originally occupied by National Supermarkets. Plans in the early 1980s to add two additional anchor stores were cancelled due to a recession and high interest rates. A renovation of the mall began in 1987 and was completed in 1990. Long-term competition from the River Oaks Center in Calumet City, Illinois and Southlake Mall in Hobart, Indiana drew business away from Woodmar and led to the mall's decline. By 2004, fewer than a dozen stores remained open. In February 2006, the decision was made to demolish the mall except for the Carson's store. The Hammond Redevelopment Commission announced plans in June 2016 for a $12 million sports complex to be built on the site of the former mall. The Carson's store closed in 2018 as part of its parent company's liquidation. The Hammond Sportsplex & Community Center opened on the site of the former Woodmar Mall in September 2018. Demolition of the former Carson's store began in August 2019.

He was born in Leeds, Yorkshire and educated at King James's School, Knaresborough and Watt Institution in Edinburgh. From 1871 he was an apprentice with Messrs Hopkins, Gilkes and Co., locomotive builders in Middlesbrough, then in Yorkshire. He then worked for the Teesside Bridge and Engineering Company (later part of Dorman Long) for several years. In 1880 he moved to be Chief Assistant to Sir Charles Fox of Sir Charles Fox & Sons (later Freeman Fox & Partners; today part of Hyder Consulting). There he was involved in a number of civil engineering projects such as the Mersey Tunnel, the Liverpool Overhead Railway and the extension of the Great Central Railway to London. For the overhead railway he designed and patented a new design of steel flooring capable of carrying heavy loads. Jointly with Edmund Wragge he was awarded a Telford Medal in 1900 for their paper entitled The Metropolitan Terminus of the Great Central Railway. He was made a partner in the company in 1901. His chief work thereafter was the construction of railways in Africa and South America, of which his most notable achievement was the design of the Victoria Falls Bridge. On this project he was assisted in the stress calculations by Ralph Freeman, who went on to design the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The location of the railway bridge was chosen by Cecil Rhodes to give rail passengers a clear view of the falls and presented a number of engineering challenges such as the need for a design and construction technique which avoided the use of scaffolding and the need for the structure to be spray resistant. The final solution was the 150 metre trussed steel arch which stands today. He was awarded the George Stephenson Gold Medal by the Institute of Civil Engineers for his account of the design and construction of the bridge. He died in Richmond, Surrey in 1917 and was buried in Richmond Cemetery. He had married Annie Jean, the daughter of Thomas Addyman of Harrogate and had an only daughter.

She was one of the first women to arrange for steelbands and was the recipient of the Trinity Cross, the highest of the National Awards of Trinidad and Tobago. Early life Patricia Alison \\"Pat\\" Bishop was born on 6 May 1940 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, to Ena and Sonny Bishop. Her father was a musician and her mother was a dressmaker and fashion designer. Bishop had one younger sibling, a sister, Gillian, who would become a jewellery designer. She attended Tranquility Girls' School and then studied at Bishop Anstey High School. In 1958, she won the Trinidad & Tobago National Government Scholarship and left for England to pursue a bachelor's degree in fine arts from King's College, Durham University. Upon completion of her degree, in which she studied both painting and music, Bishop returned to Trinidad. Career Bishop returned to her alma mater and began teaching at Bishop Anstey and remained there for several years. She exhibited her first collection of artwork in 1961 in a group show with Jackie Hinkson and Peter Minshall. Her early works were primarily realistic depictions of faces and scenery, but in her university studies with her tutor, Richard Hamilton, she was introduced to pop art. Carlisle Chang, who designed the Flag of Trinidad and Tobago and promoted indigenous art as an aesthetic, became her mentor when she returned to Trinidad. Among her works was the popular character \\"Charlie\\", created for the anti-litering campaign of the Solid Waste Management Company. Later in her career, she did a series of miniatures, called \\"All the way to Caliban‚Äôs Island\\", which featured artworks drawn from lines of The Tempest. In the late 1960s, Bishop returned to her education, pursuing a master's degree at the University of the West Indies (UWI). She completed her thesis, Runaway Slaves in Jamaica 1740-1807 in 1970, graduating with a master's in art history. Between 1970 and 1972, she taught art history and design as a lecturer at the Jamaica School of Art and Crafts. Bishop then became a lecturer at both the Mona and St. Augustine campuses of UWI for eight years, teaching both art and the history of the West Indies. While performing as a singer with the Tripoli Steel Orchestra, Bishop decided to arrange music. Beginning with hymns and classical works, she soon turned toward arranging music for steel orchestras. She was one of the first women to arrange music specifically for steelbands. Among those she collaborated with in music arrangement for pan drums were Ray Holman, Ken Philmore, Jit Samaroo, and Boogsie Sharpe, as well as for the bands Birdsong, Desperadoes Steel Orchestra, Pandemonium and Phase II. Bishop brought her classical music training into the arrangements she wrote, merging them with the Caribbean sounds of steel drums. One of her concerns was that the mastery of noted panmen would be lost, because as untrained musicians they lacked the literacy to score their works. She advocated for panning to be taught in schools, so that students could carry on the traditions by learning its history, techniques and the theory behind the performance. In addition to arranging music, Bishop composed two full-length folk operas and several choral pieces based on Trinidadian folk traditions. The operas, Dalinda and the Swamp and Voice and Steel combined drums and oboe as the foundation for the vocal productions. In 1981, she was one of the founders of the Schools Steelband Music Festival and served as both a resource and judge for the festival for many years. She had a long history of consultancy with art and cultural groups, and became known as \\"The First Lady of Pan\\" for her depth of knowledge and skill in bringing steelbands to prominence. During the 1980s, Bishop became the director of the Desperadoes Steel Orchestra. Arranging music for the Desperadoes, she also contracted with major venues gaining a respected reputation in the steelband world, eventually taking them on eight major tours in the United States. In 1987, the group played at Carnegie Hall with Liza Minnelli and The New York Pops Orchestra, at Harlem‚Ä≤s Apollo Theater, at Rockefeller Center and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Rockefeller Center performance was taped and aired on Channel 4, the NBC affiliate in New York City. Bishop directed and prepared some of Trinidad's most noted steelbands in festival competitions and critically reviewed pan music for Radio Trinidad. In 1986, she was awarded the Hummingbird Gold Medal by the government of Trinidad and Tobago. Bishop took over direction of the choir, The Lydians in 1987, when its director Joyce Spence became ill. Under her leadership, the singers developed a diverse repertoire of challenging music including Caribbean, Latin American and European Classical music songs. She developed a steelpan orchestra, known as the Lydian Steel, to accompany performances of The Lydians, which included both traditional instruments, 20 steel drums, Tassa drums and African drums. Combining the performances with folk and ballet dancers The Lydians' shows represented the cultural mix of indigenous and European culture that is uniquely Caribbean. In 1995, Bishop was awarded an honorary doctorate from UWI and the following year, received the highest national honor, when she was awarded the Trinity Cross. Also in 1996, Bishop directed The Lydians in its first opera Koanga by Frederick Delius. They performed the production at the Trinidad & Tobago Music Festival to critical acclaim. The review by Olive Lewill for the Jamaica Gleaner, called the production a triumph, and said that Bishop had extracted from the musicians, who were both \\"engrossing and engrossed\\", a full understanding of the music. In 1997, she was appointed by the Secretary General of CARICOM to serve on the inaugural board of directors for the CARICOM Foundation for Art and Culture. In 2004, Bishop became one of the founders of the Music Literacy Trust, an organization aimed at the conservation of tradition and development of new talent, musical skill and teaching music. To preserve the traditions of Trinidad and Tobago, digital and printed format arrangements of music collections were gathered and donated to tertiary institutions for conservation. Bishop taught at UWI until her death. Her last class, in 2011, exhibited their historical research projects at the Museum of the City of Port of Spain and the Tobago Historical Museum. Death and legacy Bishop died on 20 August 2011, after suffering a stroke during a meeting with officials to discuss national cultural presentations. Posthumously, the Music Literacy Trust developed the Pat Bishop Scholarship Programme to assist music students and arrangers in furthering their education. In January 2012, the Panorama Competition featured a presentation by the band Phase II Pan Groove, led by Boogsie Sharpe, featuring lyrics written by Gregory \\"GB\\" Ballantyne dedicated to Bishop. Initially, the song was titled \\"The Bishop of Pan\\", but the name changed upon the recommendation of other musicians to \\"The Archbishop of Pan\\". In 2013, she was designated as a National Icon of Trinidad and Tobago at an award ceremony held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the country's independence. Four years after her death, Bishop's sister, Gillian Bishop, hosted her final art exhibition. The showing was a private exhibit called She Sells Sea Shells by the Sea Shore and featured 20 artworks centred on the imagery of the sea. Utilizing blues, whites and golds, Bishop's pieces focused on the ocean, sun, sand and things that one might find on the beach. Bishop has artistic works that are part of the permanent collection of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. Their collection is one of the largest private art collections in Trinidad.

They started the season badly, losing the first five league games, conceding 17 goals, scoring just three. The team never recovered from the bad start and ended the qualifying stage of the championship with just 13 points. This meant that they had to play in one of the two Promotion/Relegation groups. Despite a good start in this phase, they won their first three matches, they soon lost contact to the two top positions, which would have kept them in the top flight.

Built in 1866 for the owner of a local lumber mill, it is a well-preserved example of Italianate architecture, including significant elements on the main house and the surviving outbuildings. The estate, now home to a private elementary day school, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Riverside estate is located south of downtown Lyndon, on the east side of Lily Pond Road at its junction with Red Village Road. The estate now covers about , most of which is on the east side of Lily Pond and Red Village Roads; a small portion is on the west side of Red Village Road. The property includes three buildings: the main house, a barn, and a granary. All were built between 1866 and about 1880, and exhibit Italianate styling. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a hip roof topped by an elaborate square belvidere. A porch wraps around two sides of the main block, supported by chamfered square posts with brackets at their tops, and with spindled balustrades. Its interior retains original period decorative elements. A 2-1/2 story gabled ell extends to the right side. East of the house stands a c. 1866 barn, whose Italianate features include a small square cupola, and a smaller c. 1880 granary, which has an octagonal cupola and bracketed eaves. with Riverside was built in 1866 for Dudley P. Hall, one of the principal owners of a lumber mill located just south of the property, on the banks of the Passumpsic River. It was designed by George Ropes Jr., an architect from Boston, Massachusetts, and stood next to the home of his business partner, B.F. Lincoln (now adapted for use as a nursing home). Members of the Hall family owned the property until 1977, and it has served since then as the private Riverside School, serving grades four through eight.

It is a shrub with the stems densely branched near their ends, linear leaves and one, two or three pink flowers near the ends of the branches but usually only at the top of the shrub. Description Kunzea pauciflora is a shrub that typically grows to a height of with stems that are densely branched near their ends. The leaves are linear, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers appear singly, in pairs or groups of three to five on the ends of long shoots or branches. There are egg-shaped bracts long and about wide and pairs of lance-shaped bracteoles at the base of the flowers. The sepals are triangular, long and glabrous and the petals are pink, egg- shaped to more or less round and long. There are between 39 and 46 stamens long arranged in several whorls. Flowering occurs between August and November and the fruit is an urn-shaped capsule with the erect sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming Kunzea pauciflora was first formally described in 1844 by Johannes Conrad Schauer and published in Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's book Plantae Preissianae from a specimen collected near Cape Riche. The specific epithet (pauciflora) is derived from the Latin words paucus meaning \\"few\\" or \\"little\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\" or \\"blossom\\".Allen J. Coombes D. Gledhill Distribution and habitat Mount Melville kunzea is found on hillside and slopes near the coast around Cape Riche in the Fitzgerald River National Park, where it grows in gravelly sandy or loamy soils over limestone or sandstone. Conservation status Kunzea pauciflora is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is rare or near threatened.

January 5, 2017) was an American politician who served in the Arkansas Senate from 1975 until 2001. Early life Russ was born in Conway, Arkansas in 1930 to Otis Stanley Russ and Gene Brown Russ. He attended Arkansas Polytechnic College from 1948 until 1950, transferred to Arkansas State Teachers College in 1950, and then transferred to the University of Arkansas where he graduated in 1952. In July 1952, Russ enlisted in the United States Army, and served until July 1954. He also served in the Arkansas National Guard until September 1961. Political career Russ ran for the Arkansas Senate from the 21st district in 1974, in order to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of Guy H. Jones due to tax evasion. He came in second in the primary in January 1975 to Bill Sanson, who was supported by several local officials, but won in the runoff, 9,201‚Äì8,799. He won in the general election later that month with 90% of the vote, defeating Republican candidate Chuck Fourth. Russ ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1978 and 1984, but was unsuccessful, losing in the Democratic primary both times. In 1995, Russ became President pro tempore of the Senate.

She is often grouped with the American Impressionists. Biography A native of Windham, New Hampshire, upon graduation from high school Titcomb studied at the Massachusetts Normal Art School before accepting a position as a drawing teacher in the public schools of Brockton, Massachusetts, where she remained for fourteen years before resigning, in 1889, to study painting at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Her instructors there included Edmund Charles Tarbell, Philip Leslie Hale, and Frank Weston Benson. In the 1890s she went to Paris to study with Jules Joseph Lefebvre and to travel. She then returned to Boston, taking studio space at the Harcourt Studios, where all three of her teachers kept space. In 1895 she became a member of the Copley Society and began exhibiting locally; from 1904 to 1927 she showed work in 29 exhibits at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She began signing her name as \\"M. Bradish Titcomb\\" in 1905 to avoid prejudice against her gender. The same year saw her making a sketching trip to the artists' colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut, a center for the American Impressionists; this trip seems to have cemented her interest in the style. In 1915, Titcomb's Portrait of Geraldine J. ‚Äì the mother of actress Jane Russell ‚Äì was shown at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and purchased by President Woodrow Wilson; another portrait, of Frank P. Sibley, was reproduced in the Boston Globe. During this period her work was shown in a traveling exhibition with that of Cecilia Beaux, Lydia Field Emmet, Jean MacLane, and Lillian Genth, winning plaudits; she was also a member of \\"The Group\\", a collective of Boston women painters organized in 1916 by Lucy S. Conant which exhibited at the Worcester Art Museum and the Detroit Institute of Art between 1917 and 1919. She continued keeping a studio in Boston, later at the Fenway Studios and the Grundmann Building, but expanded to spaces in Provincetown and Marblehead as well. She also traveled throughout New England, and once to Nogales, Arizona, to visit her brother, as well as to Mexico and California. She showed work at the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915 and the Third, Fifth, and Ninth Biennials at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and received honorable mention from the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts in 1917 in Hartford. Titcomb's painting Summer Girls, of c. 1912‚Äì13, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830‚Äì1930, in 1987.

Some white nationalists, and others who want to minimize the effects of hereditary chattel slavery on Africans and their descendants, have used this false equivalence to promote racism against African Americans or claim that African Americans are too vocal in seeking justice. The Irish slaves myth has also been invoked by some Irish activists, to highlight the British oppression of the Irish people; it also suppresses the history of Irish involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. The myth has been in circulation since at least the 1990s and has been disseminated in online memes and social media debates. In 2016, academics and Irish historians wrote to condemn the myth. Background According to historian Liam Kennedy, the idea of Irish slavery was popular among the nineteenth-century Young Ireland movement. John Mitchel was particularly vocal in his claim that the Irish were enslaved, although he supported the transatlantic slave trade of Africans. Some books have used the term \\"slaves\\" for captive Irish people forced from their homes in Ireland and shipped overseas, against their will, to the New World, particularly the British Colonies. The term \\"slaves\\" or \\"bond slaves\\" was used for a \\"time- bound\\" system of years that was not perpetual. The usual period of indenture for an Irish person was from four years to nine years, after which they were free ‚Äì able to travel freely, own property, make a living, and accumulate wealth. Additionally, the free Irish person could now marry whom they chose and their children were born into freedom. The British legal term used was \\"indentured servants\\" whether the servants had volunteered for transport or were kidnapped and forced aboard ships. However, for centuries, Irish folklore or various books had referred to the captive servants as Irish \\"slaves\\" even into the 20th century. During the 17th century, tens of thousands of British and Irish indentured servants immigrated to British America. The majority of these entered into indentured servitude in the Americas for a set number of years willingly in order to pay their way across the Atlantic, but at least 10,000 were transported as punishment for rebellion against English rule in Ireland or for other crimes, then subjected to forced labour for a given period.Bartlett, Thomas. \\"'This famous island set in a Virginian sea': Ireland in the British Empire, 1690‚Äì1801.\\" In The Oxford History of the British Empire. Volume II: The Eighteenth Century, by Marshall, P.J., Alaine Low, and Wm. Roger Louis, edited by P.J. Marshall and Alaine Low. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. p. 256. During this same period, the Atlantic slave trade was enslaving millions of Africans and bringing them to the Americas, including the British colonies, where they were put to work. In Ireland, Africa, and in the Caribbean, Irish people benefited from the African trade, as slave merchants, factors, investors, and owners. According to historian Nini Rodgers, \\"every group in Ireland produced merchants who benefited from the slave trade and the expanding slave colonies.\\" Unlike Irish indentured servants, enslaved Africans generally were made slaves for life and this perpetual slave status was imposed on their children at birth. Both systematically and legally, Africans were subjected to a lifelong, heritable slavery that the Irish never were. African slaves' future descendants became property.  Common elements  Common elements to memes that propagate the myth are: * The conspiracy theory that historians and the media are covering up Irish slavery. * That Irish people were enslaved after the Cromwellian invasion of Ireland in 1649. * Irish slaves were treated worse than African slaves. * Irish women were forced to reproduce with African men. * Intending to diminish the discrimination that African-Americans have historically experienced, with memes like \\"The Irish were slaves, too. We got over it, so why can't you?\\". * Using photographs of victims of the Holocaust or 20th century child laborers, claiming that they are Irish slaves. * A reference to an alleged 1625 declaration by King James II to send thousands of Irish prisoners to the West Indies as slaves. James II had not been even born yet; he was born in 1633 and started his rule in 1685. 1625 saw the end of James I's rule and the rise of Charles I to the throne. * The substitution of the victims of actual atrocities committed against African slaves with Irish victims.  Origins and propagation  An Irish Times article notes that: \\"[Irish] republicans are intent on drawing direct parallels between the experiences of black people under slavery and of Irish people under British rule.\\" which has in turn been repurposed \\"by white supremacist groups in the US to attack and denigrate the African-American experience of slavery.\\" In the Dublin Review of Books, professor Bryan Fanning states: \\"The popularity of the 'Irish slaves' meme cannot simply be blamed on the online propaganda of white supremacist groups. There are several elements at play beyond the deliberate falsification of the past. Widespread acceptance online of a false equivalence between chattel slavery and the treatment of Irish migrants appears to be rooted in Irish narratives of victimhood that continue to be articulated within Ireland‚Äôs cultural and political mainstreams.\\" Irish people's history has embraced both a legacy of identification with the oppressed, and elements of racism in the service of Irish nationalism, according to Fanning.  In print  A number of books have been written on the subject including White Cargo: The Forgotten History of Britain's White Slaves in America, The Irish Slaves: Slavery, indenture and Contract labor Among Irish Immigrants. According to research librarian and independent scholar Liam Hogan, the most influential book to assert the myth was They Were White And They Were Slaves: The Untold History of The Enslavement of Whites In Early America, self- published in the US in 1993 by conspiracy theorist and Holocaust denier Michael A. Hoffman II (who blamed Jews for the African slave trade). A 2000 book published in Dublin,To Hell Or Barbados: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ireland, by Irish Republican Sean O'Callaghan, is advertised as \\"a vivid account of the Irish slave trade: the previously untold story of over 50,000 Irish men, women and children who were transported to Barbados and Virginia.\\" The book continued the same themes as Hoffman, and introduced the concept of Irish women being forcibly bred with African men in order to produce mulattos, who are represented as being more valuable than slaves of purely Irish ancestry. It is not made clear why this is the case. Other authors repeated these lurid descriptions of Irish women being compelled to have sex with African men, which have no basis in the historical record. The book has been described as shoddily researched. According to The New York Times: \\"In America, [O'Callaghan's] book connected the white slave narrative to an influential ethnic group [Irish-Americans] of over 34 million people, many of whom had been raised on stories of Irish rebellion against Britain and tales of anti- Irish bias in America at the turn of the 20th century. From there, it took off.\\"  Online  O'Callaghan's claims were repeated on Irish genealogy websites, the Canadian conspiracy theory website Globalresearch.ca, Niall O'Dowd's IrishCentral, Scientific American and Daily Kos. The 2008 article on Globalresearch.ca has been a significant online source for the myth, having been shared almost a million times by March 2016. The myth has been spread on white nationalist message boards, neo-Nazi websites, the far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, and has been shared millions of times on Facebook. \\"Almost all of the popular ‚ÄúIrish slaves‚Äù articles are promoted by websites or Facebook groups based in the U.S. So it‚Äôs predominantly a social media phenomenon of white America.\\" The myth is especially popular with apologists for the Confederate States of America, the secessionist slave states of the South during the American Civil War. The myth has been a common trope on the white supremacist website Stormfront since 2003. It has circulated widely in the United States, and has recently begun to become common in Ireland after the \\"Irish slaves\\" meme went viral on social media in 2013. After the 2014 arrival of the Black Lives Matter movement, the myth was frequently referenced by right-wing white Americans attempting to undermine it and other African- American civil rights issues, according to Aidan McQuade, director of Anti- Slavery International. In August 2015, the meme was referred to in the context of debates about the continued flying of the Confederate flag, following the Charleston church shooting. In May 2016, it was referenced by prominent members of Sinn F√©in, after their leader Gerry Adams, \\"while seeking to compare the treatment of African Americans with Catholics in Northern Ireland\\", became involved in a controversy over his use of the word \\"nigger\\". Irish Times columnist Donald Clarke describes the meme as racist, saying \\"More commonly we see racists using the myth to belittle the suffering visited on black slaves and to siphon some sympathy towards their own clan.\\" According to The New York Times, the myth is \\"often politically motivated\\" and has been used to create \\"racist barbs\\" against African-Americans. Several online articles about \\"Irish slaves\\" substituted the 132 African victims of the 1781 Zong massacre with Irish victims. Globalresearch.ca and InfoWars, both far- right conspiracy websites, inflated the number 132 to 1,302. In 2015, independent scholar Liam Hogan theorized that the juxtaposing of the Zong massacre with Irish suffering originated with a 2002 article, by James Mullin, then chair of the New Jersey-based Irish Famine Curriculum Committee and Education Fund, titled, \\"Out Of Africa.\\" Though Mullin did not misidentify the victims of the Zong Massacre, \\"Out Of Africa\\" blurs the lines between the history of African enslavement in the British Americas with the history of Irish colonial indentured servitude.  Academic criticism and responses The Irish Examiner removed an article that cited John Martin's Globalresearch.ca piece from its website in early 2016 after 82 writers, historians and academics wrote an open letter condemning the myth. Scientific American published a blog post, which was also debunked in the open letter, and later heavily revised the blog to remove the incorrect historical material. Writing in The New York Times, Liam Stack noted that inaccurate \\"Irish slavery\\" claims \\"also appeared on IrishCentral, a leading Irish-American news website.\\" IrishCentral's publisher Niall O'Dowd then wrote an op-ed in which he states that \\"there is no way the Irish slave experience mirrored the extent or level of centuries-long degradation that African slaves went through.\\" The op-ed then goes on to draw comparisons between indentured servitude and slavery. Liam Hogan, among others, criticized IrishCentral for being slow to remove the articles from its website, and for the ahistoric comparison in the editorial. In 2020, Irish Central noted that propagation of false social media about Irish slaves are \\"attempts to trivialize and deny centuries institutionalized, race-based slavery.\\" Sean O'Callaghan's book To Hell or Barbados in particular has been criticised by, among others, Dr Nini Rodgers, who stated that his narrative appeared to arise from his horror at seeing white people being on a level with blacks. Bryan Fanning notes the book ignored scholarly research. Historian Mark Auslander, an anthropologist and director of the Museum of Culture and Environment at Central Washington University, states that the current racial climate is leaning toward denial of certain events in history, saying \\"There is a strange war on memory that's going on right now, denying the facts of chattel slavery, or claiming to have learned on Facebook or social media that, say, Irish slavery was worse, that white people were enslaved as well. Not true.\\" Matthew Reilly, a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University with an academic background in Barbadian slavery, asserts that \\"The Irish slave myth is not supported by the historical evidence.\\" Historians note that unlike slaves, most indentured servants willingly entered into contracts with another person, only served for a finite period, did not pass their unfree status on to their children, and were still considered human. Historian Donald Akenson, writing in If the Irish Ran the World: Montserrat, 1630-1730, states that on the island of Montserrat, \\"White indentured servitude was so very different from black slavery as to be from another galaxy of human experience.\\" According to Hogan, the debate over the exact definition of slavery, as well as a tendency of some Irish nationalists to gloss over the ways in which Irish people benefitted from the African slave trade, allowed for a grey area in historical discourse that was then seized upon as a political weapon by white supremacists. Fanning writes: \\". . .narratives which represent the Irish as having been slaves are hardly harmless. From the 1840s onwards racism was pressed into the service of Irish nationalism. . . versions of Irish history which obfuscate past Irish racisms have proven to be a toxic export . . .\\".

Inspired by watching the moon landings, Bruno was determined to build his own model rockets. When he found a case of 80 year old dynamite in the back of the barn, he used a pen knife to cut open the sticks and extract the explosives which became propellant for his homemade solid rocket motors.  Education  Bruno graduated from Amador County High School.http://amadorhighschool.org/alumni/8217361/tory-bruno.html He also briefly attended Queen Anne High School in Seattle.http://www.qagrizzlies.org/ClassPages/webDirectory.aspx?y=79  Career   Lockheed Martin  Bruno started with Lockheed as a summer intern while still attending Cal Poly. He worked as a mechanical engineer in the quality assurance organization of the Missile Systems Division. He spent that summer working on various generations of the Fleet Ballistic Missile. Upon graduation from Cal Poly, he returned to Lockheed as a structures designer working primarily on the Trident I and II missiles. After a few years, he transferred to the mechanical controls group. There, he developed experience in reaction and thrust vector control systems. These were applied to a wide variety of systems including the UGM-27 Polaris, UGM-73 Poseidon, Trident, LGM-30 Minuteman, and LGM-118 Peacekeeper as well as the Lockheed Launch Vehicle. Bruno also briefly supported the Space Shuttle. Eventually, Bruno joined the advanced programs team where he worked on new rocket technologies, filing patents, trade secrets, and invention disclosures. After several years as a control systems designer and analyst, he transferred to the propulsion department where he became a ballistician and ordnance engineer.  United Launch Alliance  In August 2014, Bruno left Lockheed Martin to become the president and chief executive officer of United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Bruno's appointment came as ULA was facing increased competition from newer entrants into the space launch industry, especially from SpaceX with their partially-reusable Falcon 9 rocket, in addition to political pressure from the United States Congress to stop purchasing the Russian-made RD-180 rocket engines for use on the Atlas V. Under Bruno's leadership, ULA responded to these issues by announcing Vulcan, a new rocket building on the technology of Atlas V and Delta IV, using the BE-4 engine developed by Blue Origin.

Not much is known about this particular weapon, other than what Al- Kindi wrote in his treatise On Swords in the 9th century. Description In the article, \\"Introduction to the Study of Islamic Arms and Armour\\" by Dr. A. Rahman Zaky, he writes about the Saif as \\"An Arab sword, [with] a rather broad-blade and sometimes with a peculiarly hooked pommel. The size varies greatly. It is found in most countries in which the Arabs have lived, and each has its own variety. Early Arab chroniclers used to mention two kinds of swords: Saif Anith, which was made of iron, and Saif Fulath or Muzakka, which was made of steel.\\"Zaky 1961, pp. 21 Etymology The term Xiphos, which is Greek for double-edged straight sword, can have a certain connection to the term saif. Mostly the word \\"Saif\\" is an Arab common word for a sword, and it does not refer to a certain type. Anatomy The handle is referred to as maqbid. The pommel is called the halq and the quillon is the haris. The blade is composed of the false edge and the true edge, which are known as the zafiya or hafat zafiya and the haqiqia, respectively. The sword's point is referred to as the nuqtat. Some Arab swords may contain a fuller, which is called an 'akmal, but others do not. Therefore the area where the fuller would be is completely flat. History The production of the Arab sword has four distinct periods: Pre-Islamic (Ancient swords before the 7th century), Early Islamic (Old swords 7th to 8th centuries), Islamic Golden Age (Swords of the 9th to early-13th centuries) and the Abandonment (Late swords of the late-13th to 16th centuries). Most information on Arab swords come from literature. Pre-Islamic Prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s, the settled communities in the Arabian peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations, and are limited to archaeological evidence. Accounts written outside of Arabia and Arab oral traditions were later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations were the Dilmun which arose around the end of the fourth millennium BCE and lasted to about 600CE and the Thamud which arose around 3000BCE and lasted to about 300CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, Southern Arabia was the home to a number of kingdoms such as the Sabaeans and the coastal areas of Eastern Arabia were controlled by the Iranian Parthians and Sassanians from 300BCE. The Arabs of the peninsula, thus, had their own local system of warfare, that was not of big armies, but of small battles and skirmishes among tribes.Zaky 1965, pp. 107 Early Islamic Swords in Mu'tah, called Mashrafiya swords, were so highly regarded, that Muhammad ordered in 629 a raid on the city to capture it. In the case of other captured weapons we can be less sure about where they were produced. This is true of the weapons taken from the Jewish tribe known as the Banu Qaynuqa. In his sira the Prophet's biographer Ibn Ishaq, recounts that during the Prophet's life-time this tribe was noted as arms manufacturers, or as possessing large stocks of arms in Medina; it is possible that some of their arms were produced there.Alexander 2001, pp. 200 Islamic Golden Age By the years of the Islamic golden age, the sabers and double-edged swords of the Middle East co-existed. Abandonment In the later years of the Arab sword, of the seven listed places by Al-Kindi where it was manufactured, four remained by the later half of the 13th century. With Khorasan and Damascus razed by the Mongols and Byzantium conquered by the Crusaders in the Fourth Crusade, the Arab sword took a strong decline. Its final end came in the 16th century, when the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and Yemen in 1552‚Äì60, thus marking the end of the Arab sword. Neither the Mongols, Crusaders nor Ottomans had shown an interest in the Arab sword. These groups had their own traditions, and thus displaced it. The last two places, Sri Lanka and Kedah, had slowly grown influenced by neighboring traditions and thus ceased to make it altogether. In c. 1350, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya wrote a treatise on Arab arms called \\"Al-Furusiyya\\".ed. Nizam al-Din al-Fatih, Madinah al Munawara: Maktaba Dar al-Turath, 1990. In this text, he proclaims that aside from horsemanship, lance and archery, swordsmanship was a fourth discipline of Furusiyya. Manufacturing Al-Kindi lists seven places from which Arab swords were forged. Starting with the best; Yemen, Khorasan, Damascus, Egypt, Rum (meaning Byzantium), Sri Lanka and Qalah (possibly Kedah). Use During the early Islamic years, the Arabs sheathed their weapons in baldrics. The use of sword and baldric was consciously abandoned by the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil (847-861) in favor of the saber and belt. But the use of sword and baldric seems to have retained a ceremonial and religious significance. For example, the Zangid ruler Nur ad-Din (1146‚Äì74) was anxious to demonstrate that he was a pious traditionalist, searching out the old methods preferred by the Prophet. Consequently, among his reforms he re- adopted the custom of wearing a sword suspended from a baldric. His successor Salah ad-Din (1138-1193), known in the west as Saladin, did the same and it is noteworthy that he was buried with his sword, ¬´he took it with him to Paradise.¬ªAlexander 2001, pp. 204-205 According to David Nicolle, the Arab sword was used mainly for cutting.Nicolle 1994, pp. 13-14 He cites Usama ibn Munqidh's memoir as evidence, that when Usama was being attacked by a Hashshashin, Usama struck the assassin down.Cobb 2008, pp. 129 Other stories by Usama add credence to David Nicolle's theory. During the Mamluk period the saber seems to have been the preferred weapon of the warrior elite but the most finely decorated edged weapons were swords. Swords were used in the most important ceremonial events in the Mamluk period, that is, in the investiture of Mamluk sultans and caliphs of the restored Abbasid dynasty where the ruler was ¬´girded¬ª with the ¬´Bedouin sword¬ª saif badawi. There are no surviving descriptions of such swords but it can be suggested as a hypothesis that the exquisitely decorated Mamluk sword blades now preserved in Istanbul are in fact saif badawi.Alexander 2001, pp. 204-205 References Bibliography * http://gladius.revistas.csic.es/index.php/gladius/article/viewFile/86/86  http://gladius.revistas.csic.es/index.php/gladius/article/viewFile/191/193 * http://gladius.revistas.csic.es/index.php/gladius/article/viewFile/211/213 Middle Eastern swords Arab inventions ","title":"Arab sword"},{"id":"52812494","text":"Leendert Bosch (13 November 1924 ‚Äì 20 January 2017)Family notices in NRC Handelsblad, 25 January 2017 was a Dutch biochemist.

His father was the literary agent Sanford Greenburger who founded the Sanford J. Greenburger Literary Agency His father was a first-generation American and the son of Hungarian immigrants whose literary agency was like a salon which attracted an eclectic expatriate clientele, a milieu in which the young Francis found himself ensconced.

Summarily attending Washington Irving High School at night, he went on to get his GED and then an undergraduate degree from Baruch College in public administration. Greenburger went on to earn the moniker \\"the co-op king of New York\\" for his specialty of converting prewar apartment buildings into occupant-owned residences, which offered tenants the ability to become owners and create new wealth. His literary agency, which still carries his father's name, has at different times represented, among other authors, Dan Brown, James Patterson, Nicholas Sparks, Nelson DeMille and George Bach. In 1992 Greenburger founded the art center and residency program, Art Omi in Ghent, New York.

Among the entertainments offered at the Rex was dining (the Rex Grille, which also offered floorshows), bars, a dancing ballroom, duckpin bowling (65 lanes), roller skating, pool (30 tables), and Turkish baths. There were five banquet halls and banquets, wedding receptions, and other events were held there. The Rex Center constituted an important part of Lowell social life in the mid 20th century; the Lowell Sun described it as \\"one of Lowell's landmark spots\\" and \\"the sports and dining showplace of Lowell\\". The Rex Arena in the center seated 1,000 or 2,000 and hosted boxing matches, and also wrestling matches (featuring appearances by Jim Londos, Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis, The French Angel, Man Mountain Dean, Dropkick Murphy, Bull Curry and many others), particularly after the older Crescent Rink on Hurd Street burned down.

In 1217 he fought on the side of Henry III of England in the Battle of Sandwich. He was a member of Henry's Royal Council.  Rebellion  In 1220 he supported William de Forz's rebellion against King Henry III. An account of his activities during this period cited how he led campaigns against the lands of the king's counselors. Aside from the detailed descriptions of the destruction and booty taken, it was also written that his soldiers \\"observed one good rule amongst them generally: they did not do any injury or attack any one, except these unjust advisers of the king.\\" The rebellion failed in 1221 though Siward was pardoned later that year. Two years later, Siward was again embroiled in another rebellion. His role was established from the very beginning after he and his band of soldiers attacked and looted the bishop of Winchester's manors and followed this action with raids on Devizes and the freeing of Hubert de Burgh, the justiciar. Events, thereafter, following a truce indicated that the rebels won as Siward and other participants such as Gilbert Marshall were reconciled to the king.

It is also the fifth book in the Gray Man series. In this novel, Court Gentry's search for the reasons behind the shoot-on-sight sanction imposed on him by the Central Intelligence Agency continues as he investigates his last CIA mission, Operation Back Blast.  Plot summary  After five years of being on the run overseas from the Central Intelligence Agency, Court Gentry comes to Washington, D.C., to seek answers about him being burned by the CIA. With Court surfacing in the nation's capital, CIA National Clandestine Service (NCS) head Denny Carmichael, who has been hunting him for five years through the Violator Working Group, organizes a citywide manhunt, fearing that he has come to exact revenge on him for the sanction. Among the new players in the hunt is Suzanne Brewer, a CIA senior officer whose expertise is the security of the agency. Carmichael also enlists the help of Saudi intelligence through its Washington station chief, Murquin \\"Kaz\\" al-Kazaz, as well as Court's former team leader from the CIA Golf Sierra paramilitary force, Zack Hightower. Meanwhile, private contractor Townsend Government Services head Leland Babbitt has been attempting to make amends with Carmichael after the botched Gentry operation in Europe months ago. When Carmichael still refuses, Babbitt storms into the nearby United States Capitol building, threatening to leak classified CIA material to the United States Congress, but he was later stopped by Carmichael's foot soldiers and was brought to Langley. In order to prevent him from further whistleblowing top- secret intelligence operations, Carmichael brings Babbitt and his company back into the hunt for Gentry. However, still viewing him as a danger to their operation, Carmichael and his deputy head Jordan Mayes secretly arrange Babbitt's assassination, to be orchestrated by Hightower and later to be blamed on Gentry. That night, Gentry was surveilling Babbitt's residence when Babbitt was killed by Hightower with a sniper rifle. Gentry then finds himself pursued by Babbitt's security force and later by some Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) operatives, who were sent by the CIA upon news of Babbitt's assassination to hunt down Gentry, as he escapes from the compound and later from a shootout at a McDonald's restaurant. As he is fleeing the scene, he was shot by D.C. police officers, who were in fact Saudi-based assassins sent by Kaz, along the Washington Beltway. Even though wounded, he manages to carjack a cab and flee the scene. The next night, CIA Special Activities Division (SAD) head Matthew Hanley, who was the control officer of the Golf Sierra paramilitary force and Carmichael's rival, was visited in his house by Gentry, who wanted information about the sanction. Hanley reveals that Carmichael, the unnamed CIA director and then-CIA chief counsel Max Ohlhauser ordered the shoot-on-sight directive on Gentry five years ago because he killed the wrong guy in his last CIA operation, Operation Back Blast, which was in Trieste, Italy just a year ago. As a result, Gentry has procured new information, but is still unsure of the Hanley's reason; his theory was that Carmichael wanted him dead because he was the last member of the now-disbanded Autonomous Asset Program (AAP), a top secret assassination program Gentry entered years ago before joining the CIA, and which Carmichael apparently wanted to be kept under wraps. Hanley warns Gentry that he will not accomplish anything in a one-man war against the CIA for the sanction, and that Carmichael has more power in the agency than anyone else, but Gentry vows to continue on his mission and leaves Hanley's residence. Gentry later thwarts an armed robbery on a convenience store that he has been frequenting for his supplies, which attracts the attention of the CIA as well as Catherine King and Andy Shoal, investigative reporters for The Washington Post. Therefore, they deduce that the man who stopped the robbery and the man who raided the drug den nights before are the same person and that he is not possibly the triggerman in Babbitt's assassination. Later in the afternoon, Court tracks down Ohlhauser, who is now a private lawyer and CNN commentator, and forces him to give him more information about the shoot-on-sight directive, while boarding a train into the Dupont Circle subway station. Aside from the revelation that the AAP had been reorganized and is still operational, Gentry is still frustrated with lack of new information and lets him go. Unfortunately, JSOC operatives learn of Gentry's presence in the subway station through facial recognition, and as a result the Saudi Arabian assassins arrive there first. Ohlhauser, oblivious to their true identities, leads them to Gentry, and they arrest him. Gentry, suspicious of his captors, later gets into a firefight with them, killing one and injuring five of the hitmen. Ohlhauser is later accidentally killed by the Middle Eastern assassins. Gentry escapes the subway station. Meanwhile, in Israel, Mossad operative Yanis Alvey has been placed under house arrest for aiding in the escape of Gentry from Europe. On the fifth day of his confinement, his boss Menachem Aurbach visits and frees him. He reveals Alvey the reason why helping the Gray Man enter the United States is a dishonor to their country. Years ago, Mossad had been successfully running a deep- penetration agent in Al Qaeda, codenamed Hawthorn. It was later hinted that Gentry shot Hawthorn in Trieste, which was likely the reason for the shoot-on- sight order for him. Later that night in his home, Gentry tries to remember Operation Back Blast from six years ago. He alone was assigned by the CIA to rescue an Israeli deep-penetration agent in Al Qaeda, whose real identity was compromised, in the course of a meeting in Trieste between the AQ and Serbian arms dealers in order to secure weapons for the former. He remembers an Al Qaeda assassin who attempted to kill the Israeli agent in their safehouse on the night of his rescue, but he killed the gunman and together, they escaped. Gentry was further convinced that Carmichael used the rescue operation as justification for the shoot-on-sight order. A Crime Stoppers tip leads the D.C. Emergency Response Team to Gentry's house, forcing him to abandon his shelter and evade capture. After finding a home in an abandoned Civil War-era grain mill outside D.C. the next day, he stumbles upon an online Washington Post article by King about an ex-military assassin terrorizing Washington, D.C., that he read was sourced by certain CIA personnel. He decides to meet King, but later deduces correctly that Carmichael helped King in her article to use her as bait in order to kill him. He decides to pursue whoever is tailing King. Later, he discovers that Hightower, his old team leader from CIA, was the one tailing King, and abducts him. Back in Gentry's new shelter, Hightower tells Gentry about his current work with the CIA, as well as revealing that he killed Babbitt, and then tries to convince him that he is on his side. The next day, Gentry lets him go with the assurance that he will not tell Carmichael but Hanley about what happened as well as informing him about the Middle Eastern actors who have been assisting in the manhunt operation for him. Meanwhile, in the midst of the fallout from her doctored Washington Post article which was intended by Carmichael to be the CIA's official version of the events, King receives a mysterious e-mail message, arranging a clandestine meeting for more information about her article. This turns out to be Gentry, who tells her everything he knew about his predicament. He later asks her for information about their meeting with Carmichael; the D/NCS had told her that Gentry was born Jacksonville, Florida, which Gentry interprets as a threat. They later part ways, as King promises to go to Israel for more information from Alvey. Gentry decides to go to Florida to find his estranged father before Carmichael and the Middle Eastern assassins kidnap him. Arriving in his hometown, Glen St. Mary, Florida, where he spent his childhood with his father James and now-dead older brother Chance, Court watches as his father is being interrogated by FBI-type agents, whom he deduced to be Carmichael's foot soldiers, about his whereabouts. James senses his son is watching and rhetorically tells him to \\"turn his ass around and get the hell out of here\\". Court interprets this as a warning, and later finds out that he was also being hunted by the now-reorganized Autonomous Asset Program. He decides to go to Harvey Point in North Carolina, the training ground of the AAP, to find out more answers about the sanction. Meanwhile, Shoal, who is now part of King's investigative team on Gentry, has procured evidence that a Middle Eastern proxy force has been assisting in the hunt for the Gray Man, which was illegal by law. Jordan Mayes intercepts the incriminating video from Shoal's e-mail and presents it to Carmichael, after which the latter reveals everything about his secret pact with Kaz. Distraught, Mayes leaves the room. Later, Shoal is killed by the Saudi assassins under Carmichael's orders. Mayes later arranges a clandestine meeting with Brewer, who was also confused about the new players in the hunt for Gentry, and tells her about what Carmichael told him, as well as revealing the truth behind Operation Back Blast. Mayes wants to take this matter to the Department of Justice, but the Saudi Arabian assassins later arrive and attack them. Now having the leverage in order for her to run the CIA and force Carmichael out for his excessive power, Brewer intentionally crashes her car into a nearby hill, killing Mayes and wounding herself. She calls Carmichael and persuades him to call off the advancing Saudi assassins and that she is still an asset to his operation. Arriving at Harvey Point, Gentry finds his old AAP training ground to be empty and abandoned. Later, he receives a call from King, who tells him that she had fulfilled her promise of going to Tel Aviv and meeting with Alvey, and later reveals that he really killed the wrong guy in Trieste six years ago. Hawthorn had been compromised and was given time to escape by a fellow Pakistani colleague in Al Qaeda in the Serbian safehouse in Trieste. It was revealed that Gentry killed Hawthorn as he is entering the Pakistani's room, mistaking him as the Al Qaeda gunman. He ends up rescuing the Pakistani, who is revealed to be another deep- penetration agent who according to the Mossad is the one who discovered his rival's identity and who lured Hawthorn into his ruse to kill him. Having discovered the core reason for the shoot-on-sight sanction, Gentry becomes suicidal for his failure. This was interrupted when Hightower arrives at the old AAP training facility and tells Gentry to call Hanley, who has become their de facto boss. Hanley assigns a mission to him and Hightower: to hunt down the Saudi Arabian proxy force of assassins controlled by Carmichael, in order to force him to step down from the CIA. They accept the mission and later head back to D.C. Using Gentry as bait, he and Hightower lure the Saudi assassins to the hotel where they are staying and kill them all. When Kaz finds out about the murders, he panics; Carmichael urges him to go to his fortress-like safehouse which doubles as the headquarters for the Gentry hunt in order to clean up their mess. This was discovered by Hanley, who relays this information to Gentry and Hightower; he assigns them on a new mission to bring Carmichael in. Gentry decides to siege the heavily guarded safehouse on his own. He takes Carmichael, Kaz and the surviving members of the Violator Working Group hostage in the conference room. Later, he releases the VWG members and leaves himself alone with Carmichael and Kaz, trying but failing to glean any more information. Meanwhile, the JSOC operatives had been preparing for an assault at the safehouse in order to rescue Carmichael and Kaz and kill Gentry, bypassing the authorities of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team. On the other hand, King, having obtained more information about Back Blast and using it to prevent Gentry from killing Carmichael and Kaz for revenge, persuades him to let him in the safehouse and to reveal the disturbing truth about the operation. It was revealed that Carmichael personally sent Gentry to rescue the Pakistani deep-penetration agent, who turned out to be Kaz, in Trieste, instead of the Israeli one, Hawthorn. He did not know that Hawthorn, who has more operational power in Al Qaeda than Kaz, was there, and as a result, Gentry accidentally killed him. A full year after the operation, a photo of Gentry with Hawthorn's dead body in the safehouse was clandestinely sent by Kaz through back channels to the Mossad, prompting Carmichael to sacrifice Gentry by issuing the shoot-on-sight directive in order to prevent Israeli intelligence from interviewing him about Hawthorn's death. Since then, Kaz has been running Carmichael in CIA, influencing every decision which in turn would benefit his home country. This revelation infuriates Carmichael, but by then the JSOC operatives had breached the safehouse. Gentry takes King with him and leaves Carmichael and Kaz to kill each other, giving them a submachine gun. The two enemies now wrestle for control of the weapon. Carmichael later gains the upper hand and shoots Kaz dead just as the JSOC forces storm the conference room and shoot Carmichael dead as well. Gentry and King then proceed to the attic of the safehouse, where he leaves King and escapes from the JSOC operatives by an experimental ground-to-air retrieval device that keeps him suspended in the night sky, until he was rescued by Hightower and Chris Travers, one of Hanley's SAD men, in a CIA aircraft. Once aboard, they make themselves disappear by parachuting out of the plane and crashing it to the Allegheny Mountains. Two weeks later, Hanley is now Acting Director of the National Clandestine Service. A few days later, he offers Gentry a contractual job back in the agency similar to his work as the Gray Man, which he accepts; he then gives him his first assignment back in the CIA: in Hong Kong.

This discovery demonstrated that opiate drugs exert their effects on the human brain by mimicking endogenous neurotransmitters, the opioid peptides. Career Hughes was born and grew up in South London. He received BSc and PhD degrees from King's College London, and did postdoctoral studies at Yale Medical School, where he studied the effects of angiotensin on the heart. He took a position as lecturer in Pharmacology at Aberdeen University, where he had a laboratory in Marischal College, and also collaborated in research with Hans Kosterlitz. He went on to become Reader in Pharmacological Biochemistry, and subsequently Professor, at Imperial College London. Later, he became Director of the Parke-Davis Neuroscience Centre at the University of Cambridge, where he is now an Emeritus Fellow of Wolfson College. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Society. Discovery of enkephalins While working with Kosterlitz at Aberdeen, Hughes helped discover the enkephalin peptides. Kosterlitz had developed assays for responses to opiate drugs, using pieces of guinea pig intestine and mouse vas deferens. Hughes sought to determine whether molecules present in brains could mimic the effects of the drugs. Reflecting in 1995 about that time, Hughes said: \\"From my personal point of view, I think that the reason I got interested in searching for an endogenous opioid-like substance is that I had been previously involved during my PhD student work in looking at non- adrenergic, noncholinergic innervation of various blood vessels and that's what my PhD thesis was eventually written on.\\" He would bicycle daily to a slaughterhouse, where he would trade bottles of whiskey to the butchers in exchange for pig heads, and he subsequently prepared brain extracts using acetone. After testing many samples in Kosterlitz's assays, the two scientists were able to isolate and identify two peptides, met- and leu-enkephalin, as naturally occurring molecules from the brain, that have activity resembling opioids. Hughes and Kosterlitz first announced their findings at a scientific conference in May 1974, and published the structures of the two enkephalins in 1975. In 1978, they shared the Lasker award with Solomon H. Snyder, and Hughes in particular was credited with predicting the existence of endogenous opioids.

It aired in the United States on Fox on January 8, 2017. Plot Several monks are handcrafting the book The Japanese Warrior Monks Guide to Tidying Up, a book to teach people to reach \\"the state of enticement\\", carefully when they are told that America has ordered a shipment of one million books. All the monks are fired and robots make the books in a factory instead. When one of the robots is told it has put two front covers on the book, it commits seppuku. The Simpsons go to the Springfield Car Wash, and Marge buys the book. Homer buys some sushi and ends up in the hospital. The family reunites at home and she makes the family follow the book's teaching, giving up everything that doesn't give them joy any more. Lisa gives up some of her Malibu Stacy dolls, Bart tells Marge all his stuff gives him joy, while Homer gives up his Mr. Plow jacket. Marge however tells him he has to give up Plopper, and find him a new place to live, so he puts an announcement on Greg's list. The first one to offer it is Snake, but Homer refuses, getting in a panel van to navigate back home. Bart, Lisa and Homer with Plopper go to Luigi's and see Joyce Carol Oates at a table, but when trying to enter with the pig, Luigi forbids them, unless Plopper becomes a therapy animal. Homer prepares to make Plopper one, but Lisa gets worried of him getting in trouble and gets an anxiety attack, and Homer gets the idea to get a prescription for anxiety at Dr. Bud's Medicinal Marijuana Clinic, but he turns out to be a charlatan, so he turns to Dr. Nick, who gives him some pills. Lisa gets rid of every object in her room, and finds out the sax doesn't give her joy anymore. Meanwhile, Homer brings Plopper at the Power Plant, placing him on his seat, and says to Marge that he'll bring him everywhere he goes so she won't see him for long anymore. At the Springfield nuclear family day picnic, Lisa gives up her sax, while Plopper gets greased up by kids, and Mr. Burns' hounds attack him, biting his back's ribs. Dr. Budgie visits him, and to avoid a lawsuit, Burns and Smithers agree to take care of him. Back at home, Lisa is empty of any joy since she gave away all of her stuff, so Bart helps her at school, playing the music she likes over the intercom. She gets her joy back, but is missing her stuff, so Marge takes her to Springfield Lock 'N' Leave Storage Facility and reveals she kept all the stuff there, and go and retrieve them, disturbing Gil. At Burns Manor, Dr. Budgie gives Plopper a makeover, and Burns has some great moments with the pig, becoming reluctant to give him up once he recovers. Homer comes to check on him and sees Burns dancing with him. He then returns to the manor that evening and gets back his animal friend with Bart's and later Smithers' help, and to keep him he says to Marge he will give up beer. That night, Homer has a dream of a Hellman's mayonnaise cartoon, similar to one he had early, and wakes up from the nightmare after seeing they prepared hamburgers with fruit in the sides. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- stating, \\"But why graft three full stories (and possibly a fourth) together into one resultingly cluttered episode? It‚Äôs a common complaint, but a lot of recent Simpsons episodes waste promising storylines this way. You‚Äôve got Homer and his pig buddy, coming back together before a barbeque sauce-and-hounds mishaps leads to Mr. Burns taking a shine to the injured Plopper. But that‚Äôs only set up by Marge‚Äôs enthusiasm for a Japanese anti-cluttering book/philosophy that sees her urging the family to toss out anything that 'no longer brings them joy' (that‚Äôs an episode), which leads to Lisa discovering that, once she‚Äôs given away everything but her sax (and her Bleeding Gums Murphy poster), she‚Äôs lost all joy in playing. 'I finally feel about my sax the way you all do!,' she wails in horror. And that‚Äôs another episode. Throw in some promising emotional beats to that story‚ÄîHomer comforts the confused Lisa during an anxiety attack, Bart hijacks the school‚Äôs PA system to restore her love for jazz‚Äîand there‚Äôs an abundance of good ideas not given enough time to come to fruition.\\" \\"Pork and Burns\\" scored a 3.5 rating with an 11 share and was watched by 8.19 million viewers, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

Background  It is not known when Ma Xiguang was born.

Ma Xifan succeeded their older brother Ma Xisheng in 932 upon Ma Xisheng's death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. During Ma Xifan's reign, Ma Xiguang, who was said to be careful and obedient in his disposition, was particularly beloved by Ma Xifan. As of 947, Ma Xiguang carried the titles of deputy military governor of Chu's capital circuit Wu'an (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered at Chu's capital Changsha) (with Ma Xifan himself being the military governor (Jiedushi), army commander of the Tiance Headquarters (as Ma Xifan was the Tiance Grand General ()), and military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi ‚Äî an honorary title as Zhennan was then the possession of Chu's northeastern neighbor Southern Tang). Ma Xifan had him oversee the headquarters matters. When Ma Xifan died suddenly in 947 without designating an heir, his staff members discussed who should be invited to succeed him. The officers Zhang Shaodi () and Yuan Yougong () argued that Ma Yin's 30th son Ma Xi'e, who was then serving as the military governor of Wuping Circuit (Ê≠¶Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan) and acting prefect of Yong Prefecture (Ê∞∏Â∑û, in modern Yongzhou, Hunan), and who was the oldest surviving son of Ma Yin's, should be invited to succeed. The officers Liu Yantao () and Yang Di () and the officials Li Honggao () and Deng Yiwen () wanted to support Ma Xiguang. Zhang stated, \\"Yong Prefecture is older and is strong-willed, and will surely not willingly serve under the Commander. If we are to support the Commander, we must think of a careful strategy to control Yong Prefecture such that he will not move against the Commander. Otherwise, the state will be endangered.\\" The senior official Tuoba Heng () also stated, \\"Even though Master 35 governs the matters of the headquarters, Master 30 is older. Master 35 should send an emissary to offer to yield. Otherwise, a dispute will surely result.\\" However, Liu and his partisans stated, \\"Today, the governance is in your hands. If you refuse what Heaven gives to you and let someone else take it, where will we be in the future?\\" Ma Xiguang, who was weak-willed and not sure what to do, allowed Liu and the others to announce that it was Ma Xifan's will that he succeed to the throne. Zhang, knowing that disaster was coming, claimed illness and withdrew from headquarters, as did Tuoba.  Reign   Initial stage  In fall 947, Liu Zhiyuan the emperor of Later Han, who had just recently taken over the Central Plains, bestowed on Ma Xiguang (whose Chu state was traditionally a vassal of the Central Plains states) the titles of Tiance Grand General, military governor of Wu'an, overall commander of the circuits south of the Yangtze River, Zhongshu Ling (), and Prince of Chu. Meanwhile, Ma Xiguang's younger half-brother Ma Xichong, who was a full brother to Ma Xi'e, had been writing secret letters to Ma Xi'e, inciting him by arguing that Liu Yantao and the others had gone against Ma Yin's instructions. When Ma Xi'e was approaching Changsha from Yong in order to mourn Ma Xifan, Ma Xiguang, at Liu's suggestion, sent the guard commander Zhou Tinghui () with a fleet to intercept him at Dieshi (), where he ordered the Yong soldiers to be disarmed before they would be allowed to approach Changsha further. He housed Ma Xi'e at Bixiang Palace () and had Ma Xi'e mourn there, not allowing him to go to Ma Xiguang's palace to meet with Ma Xiguang. After mourning, Ma Xi'e requested permission to return to Wuping's capital Lang Prefecture (). Zhou suggested to Ma Xiguang that he kill Ma Xi'e, but Ma Xiguang responded, \\"How would I have the heart to kill my older brother? I would rather divide Tan (ÊΩ≠Â∑û, i.e., Changsha) and Lang and govern them separately.\\" He gave Ma Xi'e many gifts and allowed him to return to Lang. However, Ma Xichong continued to spy on Ma Xiguang and enticed Ma Xi'e to rebel, offering to assist him if he did. In fall 948, Liu Sheng, the emperor of Chu's southern neighbor Southern Han, sent his official Zhong Yunzhang () as an emissary to Chu, asking that the states enter a marriage.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. (The states had previously entered such a marriage, as Liu Sheng's father Liu Yan had married Ma Xiguang's Empress Ma as his empress.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. Ma Xiguang refused. This angered Liu Sheng, who then asked Zhong for his impressions about Chu, \\"Is Lord Ma capable of managing a campaign to the south?\\" Zhong responded, \\"The Ma brothers are busy with their infighting. How would they be able to damage us?\\" Liu Sheng, pleased, stated, \\"True. Ma Xiguang is cowardly and miserly, and his soldiers have long forgotten about war. This is the time for me to advance.\\" Late in the year, Liu Sheng sent the eunuch general Wu Huai'en () to attack Chu, and captured He (Ë≥ÄÂ∑û, in modern Hezhou, Guangxi) and Zhao (Êò≠Â∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi) Prefectures. Meanwhile, Ma Xi'e submitted a petition to then-Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou (Liu Zhiyuan's son and successor) that he be allowed to separately submit tributes to the emperor and requested a commission separate from Ma Xiguang (in essence, asking that the Chu state be divided formally). Ma Xiguang, under advice by his guard officer Ou Honglian () and liaison to the Later Han court Zhang Zhongxun (), sent many gifts to the high-level officials that Liu Zhiyuan left in charge of Liu Chengyou's administration, asking them to reject Ma Xi'e's proposal. As a result, Liu Chengyou issued an edict to both Ma Xi'e and Ma Xiguang, stating, \\"Brothers should have harmony. Whatever Ma Xi'e wants to submit should be submitted under Ma Xiguang's.\\" Ma Xi'e was displeased.  War with Ma Xi'e  In 949, Ma Xi'e openly rose against Ma Xiguang. He mobilized the men of Lang and built 700 ships, intending to attack Tan, despite his wife Lady Yuan's urging against such action. When Ma Xiguang heard of this, he initially wanted to capitulate, stating, \\"Lang Prefecture is my older brother. I should not fight with him, and I shall yield the kingdom to him.\\" Liu Yantao and Li Honggao urged him against doing so. He thereafter sent Wang Yun () the prefect of Yue Prefecture (Â≤≥Â∑û, in modern Yueyang, Hunan) to command an army against Ma Xi'e, with Liu serving as Wang's army monitor. Wang was able to defeat Ma Xi'e and capture 300 of Ma Xi'e's ships. Wang chased Ma Xi'e and came close to capturing him, but Ma Xiguang recalled his army, stating to him, \\"Do not harm my brother.\\" When Ma Xi'e fled back to Lang, Lady Yuan, stating, \\"Disaster is coming, and I do not wish to see it,\\" committed suicide by jumping into a well, but that did not stop Ma Xi'e's subsequent machinations. Shortly after, when the Later Han general Guo Wei suppressed the rebellion of the general Li Shouzhen, the Later Han government decided to reward many vassals with honorary titles, and Ma Xiguang received the title of Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies). Meanwhile, Ma Xiguang's younger brother Ma Xizhan () the military governor of Jingjiang Circuit (ÈùúÊ±ü, headquartered in modern Guilin), had been sending emissaries to both Ma Xi'e and Ma Xiguang, hoping to stop their wars, but neither listened to him. In fear that this would lead to the Ma clan's destruction, Ma Xizhan developed ulcers on his back and died. Ma Xi'e, after his initial defeat, decided to write the leaders of the non-Han tribes of Chen () and Xu () (both in modern Huaihua, Hunan), as well as the Meishan Tribes (Ê¢ÖÂ±±Ë†ª, centered on the region of modern Yiyang, Hunan), inviting them to attack Tan with him. The tribal leaders had long heard of Changsha's wealth, and were enticed, and so they jointly attacked Yiyang (ÁõäÈôΩ, in modern Yiyang) with him. When Ma Xiguang sent the officer Chen Fan () to resist them, Chen was defeated and killed. Subsequently, the officers Zhang Yansi () and Huang Chuchao () were also killed by the joint army. This caused great shock among the people at Tan, and Ma Xiguang then sent the officer Cui Honglian () to take up defense position at Yutan (ÁéâÊΩ≠, in modern Changsha), preparing for Ma Xi'e's assault. Meanwhile, Ma Xi'e had not given up on persuading the Later Han government to side with him, and he sent an emissary to the Later Han court, asking to be allowed to establish an independent liaison office at Daliang. Liu Chengyou denied the request on the basis that the Chu state already had a liaison office. Ma Xi'e, believing that Later Han's government intended to protect Ma Xiguang, decided to submit as a vassal to Southern Tang instead and requested Southern Tang aid against Ma Xiguang. Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing accepted his submission, bestowed an honorary chancellorship on him, and rewarded him with one year of tax revenues from E Prefecture (ÈÑÇÂ∑û, in modern Wuhan, Hubei). Southern Tang also sent the general He Jingzhu () with an army to aid Ma Xi'e. Ma Xiguang submitted a petition to the Northern Han court, asking for aid, specifically asking for Later Han to launch an army to be stationed at Li Prefecture (ÊæßÂ∑û, in modern Changde) to cut off potential aid by Southern Tang or Jingnan to Ma Xi'e. In winter 950, Liu proposed that Ma Xiguang allow him to command an army to directly attack Lang, claiming that he could defeat and capture Ma Xi'e. Ma Xiguang agreed. When Liu led the army to Lang, he initially encountered no resistance, but soon fell into a trap set by Ma Xi'e's and the non-Han tribes' troops, such that his army was crushed. Ma Xiguang, in fear, opened up his treasury and rewarded much of the wealth to his soldiers, to try to keep his faith. Meanwhile, when reports were made to him that Ma Xichong was in communications with Ma Xi'e, suggestions were made to him that Ma Xichong be executed, but Ma Xiguang refused, stating, \\"If I myself kill my younger brother, how will I see the deceased king [(i.e., Ma Yin)] in the underworld?\\" Shortly after, Ma Xi'e sent his general Zhu Jinzhong () to attack Yiyang. Ma Xiguang's officer Zhang Hui () abandoned Yiyang and fled back to Tan, causing the town to fall. Zhu then persuaded Ma Xi'e to lead another assault on Tan. Ma Xi'e agreed and headed toward Tan, leaving his son Ma Guangzan () in charge at Lang, and also claiming for himself the title of Prince of Shuntian. With Ma Xi'e approaching, Ma Xiguang put his main army in the command of the general Xu Keqiong to try to defend against Ma Xi'e's attack, on the account that Xu was the son of Ma Yin's trusted general Xu Dexun. He made Ma Xichong the monitor of Xu Keqiong's army. The cavalry commander Li Yanwen () and the infantry commander Han Li () were also stationed to block off other potential paths for Ma Xi'e army. Soon, Zhu arrived with Ma Xi'e's forward troops and camped with a mix of 7,000 Han and non-Han troops west of the Xiang River across from Changsha. The non-Han officer Peng Shigao (), who had long been thankful for Ma Xiguang's trust and had sworn to be willing to die for Ma Xiguang, advocated that he be allowed to take some men to circle around Zhu's troops and attack it from the rear while Xu did so from the front, believing that once Zhu's forward troops were defeated, Ma Xi'e would give up his campaign. Ma Xiguang was ready to follow Peng's advice, but Xu, whom Ma Xi'e had already secretly contacted and enticed with an offer that they would divide the kingdom among themselves, opposed (as he was ready to accept Ma Xi'e's offer), stating to Ma Xiguang, \\"Peng Shigao is of the same kind as the Meishan barbarians, so how can you trust him? I, Xu Keqiong, and my family have been serving as Chu generals for generations, and will surely not disappoint you. There is nothing Ma Xi'e can do.\\" Soon, when Ma Xi'e arrived with his fleet, his and Xu's fleet set up opposing lines across the Xiang. Xu, without letting his soldiers know, met with Ma Xi'e and continued negotiating with him, finally agreeing to his terms. Peng realized this, and went to Ma Xiguang, stating to him, \\"Xu Keqiong is about to commit treason. Everyone knows this. Please immediately execute him to stop this.\\" Ma Xiguang, not believing Peng, responded, \\"He is Chancellor Xu's son. How would this happen?\\" Peng left his presence and lamented, but could do nothing else further. Meanwhile, due to a serious snow storm, neither army could engage the other. Ma Xiguang, who believed in the advice of sorcerers and Buddhist monks, make statutes of monsters with raised hands, believing that this would stop the Wuping army. He also had many monks chant Buddhist sutras, and wore the robes of a monk himself, in hope of gaining blessings. Early in the morning on 21 January 951, Ma Xi'e's officer He Jingzhen (), seeing that Han's flags were in disarray, believed that that was a sign that Han's army was in disarray, and therefore launched an attack against Han. Han's army was defeated, and Han died from injuries. The Wuping army then used the opportunity to make a fierce assault on Changsha. Ma Xiguang's other infantry commander, Wu Hong (), and Yang Di, fought hard to try to resist the Wuping army's assault from the early morning to noon, but eventually, Yang's army was worn out, without any aid coming from either Xu or Liu Yantao. Ma Xi'e's non-Han soldiers set fire to Changsha's east wall, and when the defenders requested that Xu come to their aid, Xu instead surrendered to Ma Xi'e, and Changsha thereafter fell. Li Yanwen tried to return to the city to save it, but could not, and he and Liu thereafter escorted the sons of Ma Xifan and Ma Xiguang to flee to Southern Tang. Ma Xi'e captured Wu and Peng, but, admiring them for their bravery and faithfulness to Ma Xiguang, spared both of them. Meanwhile, as the city fell, Ma Xiguang and his wife, as well as one or more sons (the one(s) who did not flee with Li and Liu) secreted themselves at Ci Hall (), as Ma Xi'e's soldiers pillaged Changsha. Ma Xichong led the Chu officials in welcoming Ma Xi'e into the city and requested that he take the throne.  Death  On 22 January 951, Ma Xi'e entered Changsha and took over. He closed the gates and subsequently was able to capture Ma Xiguang, Li Honggao, Li Honggao's brother Li Hongjie (), Deng Yiwen, Yang Di, and the official Tang Zhaoyin (). Ma Xi'e said to Ma Xiguang, \\"Is there not an order between elder and younger when it comes to inheriting the achievements of father and brother?\\" Ma Xiguang responded, \\"It was because of the support of the generals and officials, and commission by the Emperor.\\" Ma Xi'e put him under arrest. On 24 January 951, Ma Xi'e claimed the title of Prince of Chu. He had Li Honggao, Li Hongjie, Tang, and Yang put to death and had their bodies eaten by the soldiers. Deng was also executed. On 25 January 951, Ma Xi'e publicly asked the generals and officials, \\"Ma Xiguang is just a coward who was controlled by his associates. May I spare his life?\\" No one dared to respond, but Zhu Jinzhong, whom had once been caned by Ma Xiguang, spoke up and stated, \\"Your Royal Highness spent three years in battle to gain Changsha. A state cannot have two lords. If you allow him to live, you will regret it.\\" Later that day, Ma Xi'e ordered Ma Xiguang to commit suicide. Ma Xiguang, as he neared death, recited sutras. Peng Shigao buried him outside Changsha's Liuyang Gate ().

The complex includes a fine Romanesque courthouse built in 1886, a wood-frame jailer's quarters built in 1886 (now housing the sheriff's office), and a 1903 brick jail. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Orleans County Courthouse stands prominently in the center of downtown Newport, on the south side of Main Street between 3rd and 2nd Streets. Just to its east stands the federal U.S. Courthouse, Post Office and Customs House. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a hip roof. A gabled entrance section projects from the center of the main facade, rising through a bellcast stage at the roof level to an elaborate two-stage clock tower topped by a pyramidal roof. The eaves and gable edges are adorned with dentil moulding, and windows in the upper level of the projecting section are set in recessed round-arch openings, a detail echoed by blind arches in the first stage of the tower. Entrances are also set in large round-arch openings on the ground floor. Bands of brick corbelling set off the floors from each other, with another below the eave. with The 1886 jailer's house is a two-story wood frame structure with a gabled roof, and is three bays wide and two deep. It is simply trimmed, and is connected via a wooden ell to the 1903 jail. That building is a basically cubical masonry structure, two stories in height, finished in brick with granite trim. It has a hip roof with an elaborate corbelled eave. The county complex was built in 1886, following a decision by the state legislature to move the seat of Orleans County from Irasburg, centrally located but isolated and agrarian, to the bustling lakefront and railroad-supported town of Newport. The city of Newport would be incorporated in 1918 out of part of the towns of Newport and Derby, and retain the shire town status. The courthouse was designed by Lambert Packard, a prominent local architect. He also designed the original 1886 jail, which was deemed inadequate for the county's needs and replaced in 1903 by a \\"mail order\\" structure designed by the Pauly Jail Company of St. Louis, Missouri.

In August 1953, El Siglo and El Colombiano were closed down, and in August 1955, the government ordered the closure of El Tiempo. HACE 50 A√ëOS, EL TIEMPO FUE CLAUSURADO POR ROJAS. El Tiempo, August 4, 2005  Closing of El Espectador  Unlike the above-mentioned newspapers, El Espectador was not closed down by the dictatorship, but it was permanent target of a strong harassment by the government. On May 11, 1954, Primo Guerrero, a correspondent to the newspaper in Quibd√≥, was put in jail for having written a report in which he complained on the precarious conditions of the capital of Choc√≥ in comparison with the luxury of the cars that had been assigned to official employees in that city. On December 20, 1955, the ODIPE (Acronym for Office of Information and Press), lead by Jorge Luis Arango, fined El Espectador and El Correo (from Medellin) with 10,000 Colombian pesos, accusing both newspapers of having given news on violence, which was strictly prohibited. Gabriel Cano paid the fine without any appeal, but the next day he published an editorial column entitled \\"The Treasure of the Pirate\\", without showing it first to the government censors to be approved. He criticized the regime directly, comparing it with a group of pirates, and ironically hinting that Rojas was the leader of that gang of thieves: [Autobiograf√≠a de un Peri√≥dico. 1887-1967, Gabriel Cano. 1967-1977, Guillermo Cano. 1977-1987, Juan Guillermo Cano. Special edition of 100 years of El Espectador, March 22, 1987] On January 6, 1956, the government, by Resolution 7130 of the Direcci√≥n Nacional de Impuestos (the Colombian National Tax Office), fined El Espectador with 600,000 Colombian pesos for an alleged inaccuracy in the tax return made by the company in 1953. Gabriel Cano wanted to make public his position on the situation in a new editorial column titled \\"Treasure Island\\", but this time he was forced to show it first to the official censors and they rejected it. In that prohibited text there was a detailed summary of the persecutions suffered by the newspaper in previous governments and the economic difficulties that they were having after being set on fire in September 1952. The last paragraph pointed out that: As not being allowed to publish the column with which he tried to defend his newspaper in front of national opinion, Gabriel Cano decided to close El Espectador for an indefinite time.  Creation of El Independiente  As well as Eduardo Santos did when he founded Intermedio to replace El Tiempo, Gabriel Cano thought that he could not leave his employees without a job, whereas the newspaper's machinery just caused losses by being out of business. Through some acquaintances and friends, he tried several times to get required authorizations to print a new publication under another title. The names of La Idea, La Consigna and La Correspondencia were rejected, among other reasons, because they were the same titles that Fidel Cano Guti√©rrez had chosen to keep printing newspapers in the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century whenever the governments of the so-called \\"Regeneration\\" and the Colombian Conservative Party hegemony frequently closed down El Espectador.

However, since Lleras was simultaneously the leader of Liberal Party, many of the actions against the regime were planned from the offices of El Independiente, and some handbill regarded as subversive by the government was linked to the activity of the newspaper. Lleras was accused of being an accomplice of such clandestine maneuvers. He was not allowed to defend himself, and the new daily was closed on April 15, 1956, less than two months after being founded. El Independiente: el peri√≥dico que reemplaz√≥ a El Espectador en 1956. El Espectador, December 17, 2016 In October 1956, during the General Assembly of the Inter American Press Association held in Havana, Cuba, several journalists and continental political celebrities suggested Gabriel Cano to restart the publication of El Espectador. Back in Colombia, Alberto Lleras Camargo and Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen also asked Cano to do it. But he refused to accept these suggestions, saying that his daily would not reappear until when his defense editorial column could be published \\"without the most minimum cut, although it was within a month, within a year, or within a century\\". Anyway, he gave the chance of printing El Independiente or any other newspaper that was in accordance with the ideals of El Espectador. El Independiente resumed its issuing on February 2, 1957, directed by Guillermo Cano Isaza (son of Gabriel Cano). One month later, on March 4, the Administrative Court of Cundinamarca derogated the fine imposed on El Espectador and ordered the refund of the paid money. The lawsuit that succeeded was set up by Carlos Lleras Restrepo, lawyer of the company. The censorship kept merciless. According to Guillermo Cano, there were two completely different newspapers every day: \\"The one that was read the three or four censors, and another which was printed and that was in the hands of thousands of people. The first one was good, complete and informative. The second one was elaborated in a hurry, very varied and amusing, with many curiosities and little information, with many beauty queens in swimsuit, but no current opinions\\".

Biblioteca Virtual Luis √Ångel Arango  Return of democracy and reopening of El Espectador  Since May 5, 1957, the country was in a national strike. The opposition newspapers, banks, factories, stores, schools, clubs, cinemas and theaters ceased their activities. Rojas Pinilla resigned on May 10 and left the government in charge of a Military Junta. In the extra edition that El Independiente issued that day, the editorial column announced its full support to the agreement signed between Alberto Lleras Camargo and Laureano G√≥mez that helped to end the dictatorship, and that resulted in the return of democracy through a mechanism of alternation in Presidency and equal distribution of the public offices between liberals and conservatives. This agreement was known as the National Front. However, in the same extra edition, it was made clear that El Espectador would only return when democratic institutions were fully and definitively restored. And this lasted a long time to be fulfilled. The plebiscite that ratified the validity of the pact between Liberals and Conservatives took place on December 1, 1957.

In 1823, at the time of its founding, it was the first and only church in Columbia. The Church and its members have played a prominent role in civic and religious affairs in Missouri. The church's Georgian Revival style sanctuary sits conspicuously on Broadway in Downtown Columbia; it is the fourth church building and second at that location. Stephens College, formerly a baptist institution founded by church members, is across the street. First Baptist has both a traditional and contemporary Sunday services, and formerly hosted a Swahili-language congregation. The church is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA. In 2001, the congregation joined the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and its longtime affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention was ended. In 2004, the Odyssey Chamber Music Series was founded as part of a community outreach effort. In addition, the Plowman Chamber Music Competition, Columbia Handbell Ensemble, Esterhazy Quartet, and the University of Missouri School of Music utilize the sanctuary as a performance venue. William Jewell, namesake of William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri, has been described as the leading force behind the creation of the church. The first meeting took place in the home of Charles Hardin, father of Charles Henry Hardin governor of Missouri. History Columbia was founded in 1818 as the county seat of Boone County. A hallmark of frontier life in the Boonslick was lack of organized religion. As Columbia was growing into a proper town, it was natural that like-minded thinkers would join together in Christian fellowship. First Baptist Church was organized on 22 November 1823 in the home of Charles Hardin on Locust street between 4th and 5th streets, now Flat Branch Park. This was the first brick residence Columbia. The founders were formerly members of Little Bonne Femme Baptist Church south of Columbia who granted letters of dismiss after a dispute involving William Jewell. The church continued to meet in homes or outside in fair weather until September 1826 when the church met regularly in the Boone County Courthouse. In 1824 the first dedicated church building was constructed as a union church between the Methodist and the Baptist. Two wealthy men‚ÄîWilliam Jewell, a Baptist, and Moses Payne, a Methodist‚Äîfunded the construction. This building was used for twenty years. A new church building was erected in the 1850s on the Boone County Courthouse square. The congregation continued to worship here for four decades. In 1891 the church moved to its current location, purchasing a lot on Broadway next to Stephens College, at the time a Baptist Women's College. On this lot was erected a beautiful Victorian Neo-Gothic structure, complete with pipe organ and stained glass. In 1927 the addition of the extant educational building was added. Limited seating capacity and poor upkeep lead to the destruction of the sanctuary and its replacement In 1957 with the current sanctuary. This new sanctuary was connected to the educational building in the 1960s. The founders of Columbia were from the Upland South, largely Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. As such, many were enslaved African-Americans. Charles Hardin and William Jewell were both slave owners. Until the civil war it was common for slaves to join their masters church. Not until after the Civil War did the congregations segregate, in Columbia newly emancipated slaves formed Second Baptist Church‚Äîstill a predominantly black church today. The Stephens family, leaders in business, religion, and civic affairs, were lifetime members. This includes both Edwin William Stephens and his father James Stephens, namesake of Stephens College. The college's historical quad sits across Waugh Street.

The series has been licensed by JManga in America, Tong Li (Êù±Á´ã) in China, and by Egmont Manga + Anime GmbH in Germany. The series follows Shiro Yoshiwara, an eccentric umbrella craftsman, and Kojiro Yamada, a young police officer. The two form an unlikely bond and end up assisting one another with solving mysteries and stopping crime. Shiro's past catches up with him though and threatens to harm his new-found friend and way of life. A stage play was performed in Theater Sun Mall in Shinjuku from March 30 to April 3, 2016. Another stage adaptation ran from December 13 to 17 at the Haiyuza Theater. A series of Drama CDs were released by Shinkansha from 2011-2013. Plot Shiro Yoshiwara owns a shop in the slum area of Gento where he lives and sells umbrellas of his creation. His umbrellas are more art pieces then anything practical, though so he is often impoverished and starving. One day, police officer Kojiro Yamada comes to his shop looking for information about sightings of a phantom woman. Kojiro is shocked to find Shiro barely dressed and in the arms of a woman in the middle of the day (who is his neighbor and insists she too was only trying to \\"help\\" him dress). After questioning him and lecturing him about decency, Kojiro leaves to continue the investigation. It turns out Shiro was also investigating this same thing though and ends up being taken hostage by a local gang. Kojiro follows the sound of gunfire and attempts to \\"rescue\\" Shiro. Shiro suppresses the entire gang and ends up rescuing Kojiro, in the process revealing that he is an Anki (small hidden knives) user. Shiro is then surprised to find out that Kojiro doesn't intend to question or arrest him for this and the two go their separate ways, with the mystery now solved and the perpetrators dead or arrested. Kojiro decides to return to the shop to teach Shiro about cooking and dressing properly. As the story progresses Shiro continues to assist Kojiro and the police force with solving various cases. He slowly opens up to Kojiro who continues to show up at his shop, introduce people to him, and invite him to different activities. People from Shiro's past start showing up in the town and being the subjects of police cases. It is revealed that Shiro is from a country of super humans known only as The Group, which is unknown to the general public, and is a Superhuman, like most of The Group‚Äôs inhabitants. He is also the \\"elixir of life\\" for The Group and his absence has resulted in people dying younger than normal. Shiro attempts to continue protecting his new friends and way of life but after a few close calls decides to leave town, believing his friends will be safe if he's gone, and settle the unfinished business from his past. He journeys to The Group which is far away, hidden, and heavily guarded. Just as he enters, he realizes that Kojiro followed him. Unable to send Kojiro back, Shiro finds himself having to quickly teach Kojiro the rules and ways of The Group. The two of them are almost killed numerous times, but eventually find their way to Shiro's intended destination which is the home of his former fianc√©, Touko. In the meantime, members of Gento's police force have teamed up with the military to attempt to locate and destroy The Group as they believe it is responsible for crimes and the kidnappings of a number of people.

The dispute centres on the planned introduction of driver-only operation (DOO) by several train operating companies, transferring the operation of passenger train doors from the guard to the driver. Later strikes have also included disputes over pay rates, planned redundancies and working hours. Supporters claim that DOO will save costs and shorten journey times, although opponents claim that the scheme is unsafe to passengers as drivers may not have as good visibility of the train doors as guards, who are able to step out onto the platform. Opponents also claim that the scheme could lead to hundreds of job losses to train guards, although several train operating companies have denied this, stating that guards will be redeployed to an otherwise equivalent role on board. The strikes started on 26 April 2016, initially on Govia Thameslink Railway's Southern trains, and have since spread to eight more rail franchises across the country. The strikes were led initially by Mick Cash, General Secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT); the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) joined the strikes in November 2016, followed by the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) in January 2018. Opposition to the strikes was led by then Prime Minister Theresa May and Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, who labelled the strikes as \\"appalling\\" and \\"palpable nonsense\\".  Background  In April 2016, Southern introduced a new method of door operation, with control of the doors moving from the conductor to the driver. Southern also proposed that, following the changes to the door operation, conductors would take on an \\"on-board supervisor role\\", which would let them concentrate on passengers more than doors, but the RMT and ASLEF described this as an attempt to make conductors unnecessary, and would also be unsafe. However, the rail safety regulator, the Rail Safety and Standards Board, said that \\"We have 30 years of data which we have analysed. We have found that the driver performing the task does not increase the risk to passengers at all.\\" The BBC suggested that the RMT is particularly worried about the new method of operation because if trains could run without conductors any strike action they took would be ineffectual. As a result of this, the RMT and ASLEF unions went on strike over the changes, causing severe disruption to Southern services.  Industrial action  The strikes began on 26 April, as Southern conductors who were members of the RMT walked out on strike for 24 hours. Industrial action spread nationally across eight further franchises, peaking in the second half of 2017. On 17 January 2017, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) announced that ASLEF had called off a three-day strike on the Southern network that was due to occur at the end of January. The overtime ban by ASLEF-affiliated Southern drivers was also suspended as talks were being held at the TUC between Govia Thameslink Railway and the union. On 2 February, the TUC announced that talks between Southern and ASLEF had in principle reached an agreement, meaning that the dispute with ASLEF had been resolved. The Assistant General Secretary of the RMT, Steve Hedley, said of ASLEF that it was \\"scandalous other people think they can do a deal that affects our members\\" and that \\"we are not bound by that deal. The dispute is still on\\". The RMT met with Govia Thameslink Railway for further talks, but were unable to come to a final deal. The TUC-brokered agreement between ASLEF and Southern broke down the following month. When the proposed deal was put to a ballot of ASLEF's driver members on 16 February, it was overwhelmingly rejected, and industrial action resumed nationally.  CrossCountry  Gloucester; during five 24-hour and two 48-hour strikes in November and December 2017, all CrossCountry local services were cancelled, while long- distance services were severely disrupted. Industrial action by RMT- affiliated on-board train managers and senior conductors employed by Arriva CrossCountry began in late 2017, due to an industrial dispute over working hours, particularly in relation to staff rostering and Sunday working. At present, CrossCountry has no plans to introduce driver-only operation on its services. CrossCountry staff went on strike for 24 hours on four Sundays at the end of 2017: 19 November, 26 November, 24 December and 31 December. Additionally, a 48-hour strike took place across the weekend of 9‚Äì10 December. Further strikes were called for 24 hours on 23 December and 27 December, due to what the RMT called the \\"shocking attitude of the company management\\" towards the dispute. During the strikes, CrossCountry operated a reduced hourly service on most long-distance routes between 9am and 7pm, with most services cancelled outside of these times. Local services across the Midlands did not operate. Further strikes were called in early January 2018, scheduled for 48 hours on 20‚Äì21 January and 24 hours on 28 January. Following negotiations between the RMT and CrossCountry, the planned January strikes were called off on 11 January. In late January, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) threatened CrossCountry with industrial action after staff were offered only a 1% pay rise, compared to a 3.3% pay rise offered at other Arriva-owned train operating companies. Industrial action was planned for 26 January, but it was later called off as CrossCountry matched demands for an equal pay rise for CrossCountry employees.  Eurostar  Both the RMT and TSSA planned to go on strike at Eurostar during August 2016, the former for seven days and the latter for four days. Ultimately, following a series of negotiations, only one day of the RMT strike went ahead, while all TSSA strikes were cancelled. On 29 February 2016, the RMT opened a formal dispute with Eurostar over concerns regarding staff rostering, particularly allegations of train managers being made to work alone on some sections of route, following an incident involving a female train manager being charged with gross misconduct after refusing to operate a service which would have resulted in her running a section of the route with no other Eurostar staff members on board. Eurostar train managers based at St Pancras International station in London were balloted for potential industrial action several months later, which passed in favour of full strike action. Seven days of strikes were announced for two weekends in August 2016: for 96 hours on 12‚Äì15 August, coinciding with the Assumption Day public holiday in Belgium and France; and for 72 hours on 27‚Äì29 August, coinciding with the late August bank holiday weekend in the United Kingdom. The TSSA announced that it would be joining both RMT strikes for 48-hour periods, covering 14‚Äì15 August and 28‚Äì29 August. During the strikes, Eurostar planned to operate a mostly normal level of service, with eight services expected to be cancelled across the four-day first strike. The first joint RMT/TSSA strike, scheduled to last for four days amongst RMT-affiliated staff over the Assumption Day weekend, began at midnight on Friday 12 August. Following progress made in negotiations on 12 August, the RMT strike was cut short, ending after only 24 hours at midnight on 13 August. The TSSA strike, which had not yet started, was cancelled. Following further successful negotiations, the second joint RMT/TSSA strike planned for the late August bank holiday weekend was cancelled; the dispute between the RMT, the TSSA and Eurostar has now been resolved. In October 2016, the RMT released a statement expressing concern at the prospect of 80 redundancies by Eurostar, but no further action was taken in this dispute.  Govia Thameslink Railway  Southern conductors went on strike on 26 April 2016. Afterwards, on 29 April, talks were held at the dispute resolution service Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service), but this did not stop the strikes, and more were called. As a result of the strikes and a high period of staff sickness, Southern introduced an \\"amended timetable [that] would be a temporary measure until staffing returned to normal\\", with slightly reduced service levels, from 5 July. The RMT trade union said that 350 services would be cancelled every day in the new timetable; the company previously ran 2,242 daily weekday services under the standard timetable. The RMT denied that high levels of sickness were the cause of cancellations, while agreeing that there were an insufficient number of guards and drivers. In November 2016, ASLEF held a ballot for drivers working for Southern on whether they wanted to go on strike. The strike ballot was initially suspended due to \\"technical difficulties\\", but when the ballot was re-run, drivers voted overwhelmingly to strike. As a result, on 6 December, ASLEF drivers started an indefinite overtime ban. ASLEF drivers at Southern went on strike on 13‚Äì14 and 16 December. As the strikes would result in no trains being able to run on the Southern network, Southern's parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, launched a High Court case in a bid to stop them, citing that they \\"breach customer rights under EU law\\". However, the court ruled that ASLEF could strike. On 13 December, the first day of ASLEF strike action, Southern took its case to the Court of Appeal, but judges upheld the decision. The strikes by ASLEF were branded as \\"causing the worst rail disruption in 20 years\\" by The Guardian as all 2,242 daily weekday services operated by Southern were cancelled throughout the strikes. Thameslink services became much busier as a result of the strike, and other operators were accepting Southern's tickets. GTR and ASLEF held further talks at Acas, but no deal was reached, despite reports that \\"progress has been made\\" within the talks. In December 2016, ASLEF announced that its drivers would be holding a week-long strike on the Southern network alongside RMT drivers from 9 to 16 January. On 4 January, three days of the planned one-week strike were called off, with the remaining strike dates being pushed back to the end of the month. The RMT's leader, Mick Whelan, threatened that \\"more strikes were to come\\", while Southern described ASLEF as \\"showing pure contempt for the travelling public\\". On 5 January 2017, the Office of Rail and Road published a report into Southern's plans for driver only operation. The report declared that driver only operation on Southern services were \\"safe if conditions are met\\". As a result of the report, the government called on the unions to \\"end the strikes immediately\\", but Whelan argued that \\"the report does not give driver-only operation a clean bill of health\\". On 11 January 2018, Govia Thameslink Railway announced that it had launched a legal challenge at the Supreme Court against ASLEF. The next day, the RMT announced that Southern conductors would walk out on strike on 23 January for 24 hours.

In May 2017 the RMT raised concerns over plans by Abellio Greater Anglia to close 57 of its 64 station ticket offices. On 17 July, the RMT announced that it would ballot Greater Anglia staff for potential strike action over the planned ticket office closures and the introduction of driver-only operation on Greater Anglia services. The ballot was later suspended indefinitely due to progress in negotiations. The next day, the RMT started an online petition to halt the closures. On 20 July, Clive Lewis, Member of Parliament for the Norwich South constituency, tabled a motion in the House of Commons raising concerns and seeking clarification over Greater Anglia's closure plans. On 14 August, the RMT announced that due to a breakdown in negotiations it would resume balloting Greater Anglia staff over industrial action. The ballot resulted in a vote in favour of full strike action, with the first two 24-hour strikes taking place on 3 October and 5 October. Disruption during the Greater Anglia guard strikes was limited by the company training office staff and placing them into contingency roles on trains during the strike days; the RMT criticised this move, accusing Greater Anglia of raising a 'scab army' to quash the industrial action, threatening passenger safety. In response, the RMT launched a full overtime and rest day working ban between 10 October and 6 November. Several incidents occurred involving substitute guards, referred to as \\"Persons Utilised as Guards\\" or PUGs, during the two October strikes. The most serious occurred on 3 October, involving the 13:50 service from to . Upon arrival at Ipswich, the PUG unlocked the doors on the wrong side of the train, resulting in many passengers disembarking onto the tracks. Nobody was injured, although the RMT claimed that passenger safety was \\"jeopardised\\". Further minor incidents involving improperly-trained PUGs occurred on trains at and on 3 October, resulting in the RMT alerting the Office of Rail and Road (ORR, the rail safety regulator), over Greater Anglia's actions. The ORR issued an interim report on 20 October, identifying \\"numerous deficiencies\\" in the use of PUGs during the strikes.https://www.rmt.org.uk/news/publications/letter- from-safety-regulator/letter-from-safety-regulator-to-rmt.pdf In the aftermath, the RMT called for Abellio to be stripped of the East Anglia rail franchise. Further strike action was held for 48 hours on 8‚Äì9 November. Despite the controversy over the use of PUGs in the October, the ORR approved Greater Anglia's proposed strike day timetable, which again used PUGs to maintain a similar level of service to the usual timetable. Another 24-hour strike was held on 27 December, followed by three further 24-hour strikes on 8, 10 and 12 January 2018. A full service was again operated during these strikes, using PUGs. The dispute between the RMT and Greater Anglia was resolved on 19th July 2018, where it was agreed that drivers would operate the door providing a second member of staff was onboard.  Merseyrail  In the Merserail dispute, guards on Merseyrail have taken part in fifteen days of strikes as of March 2018. In January 2016, the RMT published the results of a survey in which it claimed that 78% of regular Merseyrail passengers opposed proposals for the operator to introduce driver-only operation and remove guards from its services. The RMT launched a public campaign lobbying for Merseyrail to keep the guard on the train. Relations between the RMT and Merseyrail broke down in May 2016 following a lack of progress in negotiations and concerns over planned staff rostering by Merseyrail on the day of the Rock 'n' Roll Liverpool Marathon & 1/2 Marathon, scheduled for 29 May. As a result, the RMT announced that members would be balloted over potential strike action. The ballot was eventually cancelled without any industrial action following an improvement in negotiations. On 16 December 2016, Merseytravel announced that it would be taking delivery of 52 new four-car Stadler METRO electric multiple units, designated as the Class 777, from 2020 onwards to replace the existing Merseyrail fleet. The trains were ordered in a driver-only configuration, with Merseyrail announcing that guards would be removed from its services following the introduction of the Class 777 trains. As a result, in early January, the RMT issued a statement requesting clarification from Merseyrail on the issue of driver-only operation on its services, setting a deadline of 26 January to resolve the dispute. When the deadline passed without progress in talks, the RMT moved officially into dispute with Merseyrail on 2 February, launching a ballot of its members. On 28 February, the RMT issued a statement confirming that 81.8% of union members at Merseyrail had voted in favour of industrial action, setting the first strike for 24 hours on 13 March; in addition, members were instructed to take part in an indefinite overtime ban, commencing from 7 March. Merseyrail launched legal action at the High Court to prevent the strikes going ahead. However, its case for an injunction against industrial action was unsuccessful. On the day of the strike, services were suspended entirely on the , and lines, while 23 stations on other lines were closed due to lack of staff. Most services began to wind down from around 17:30. On 17 March, four days after the first strike and with the overtime ban still in effect, the RMT confirmed that it would meet Merseyrail representatives for \\"exploratory talks\\" to resolve the conflict. On 20 March the negotiations collapsed after three days of talks. The next day, the RMT announced details of further strike action, scheduled for 24 hours on 8 April, the date of the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse. Merseytravel criticised the choice of date for the industrial action, stating that it would \\"do immeasurable damage\\" to Liverpool's reputation; the RMT responded by stating that it \\"wanted to make the loudest voice possible\\". Services were largely reduced across the Merseyrail network during the strike, although trains continued to operate every seven to eight minutes between central Liverpool and Aintree at key times to serve the Grand National. Although ASLEF was not officially a part of the industrial action, reports suggested that Merseyrail staff affiliated with ASLEF also refused to cross picket lines set up by the RMT, adding to the disruption. Negotiations between the RMT and Merseyrail collapsed again on 24 April. A third 24-hour strike was announced, due to place on 30 May. Following the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 May, the RMT announced that it would be suspending all industrial action nationwide indefinitely, scrapping plans for the 30 May strike on Merseyrail. In June 2017, a lack of progress in negotiations led to the RMT calling three new 24-hour strikes, scheduled for 8, 10 and 23 July. During the strikes, 33 Merseyrail stations were closed and a reduced level of service was in operation. The strike on 23 July caused disruption to passengers travelling to the final day of the 2017 Open Championship at the Royal Birkdale Golf Club. The day after the most recent strike action, on 24 July, representatives from the RMT met with Steve Rotheram, the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. Further talks between Rotheram, the RMT and Merseyrail failed to avert further strike action being announced by mid-August, which took place for 24 hours on 1 September and for 48 hours on 3‚Äì4 September. Further 24-hour strikes took place on 3 and 5 October another happened on 8 November. adding to disruption from the planned three-week closure of Liverpool Lime Street station for refurbishment over that period. Another 24-hour strike took place on 22 December, followed by three more on 8, 10 and 12 January 2018. On 15 February 2018, the RMT announced that a further 24-hour strike would take place, scheduled for 3 March. It was the sixteenth day of strike action on Merseyrail since the dispute began. On 31 August 2018, it was announced that Merseyrail had abandoned driver-only trains, thus bringing an end to the dispute.  ScotRail  RMT-affiliated ScotRail train drivers staged six 24-hour and three 48-hour strikes in June and July 2016. On 15 April 2016, the RMT threatened to launch a ballot of its members over possible industrial action on the Abellio ScotRail network as a result of ScotRail's proposals to introduce driver-only operation. Following a breakdown in negotiations, a ballot was launched, with union members voting 75% in favour of industrial action, from a 75% turnout, on 7 June. 24-hour strikes were called for 21 June, 23 June, 3 July, 14 July, 24 July and 31 July, as well as 48-hour strikes for 25‚Äì26 June, 10‚Äì11 July and 16‚Äì17 July; overtime bans were also announced for the whole of June and July 2016. On 20 June, the day before the first planned strike, RMT members held a protest outside the head office of Abellio ScotRail. In late July, further strike action was announced for 24-hour periods on 7 August and 11 August, and for 48 hours on 13‚Äì14 August. On 1 August, Abellio ScotRail threatened the RMT with legal action over further strikes. On 3 August, it was announced that the RMT's planned industrial action on ScotRail during August had been suspended, as negotiations with Abellio continued. On 20 September, the RMT announced that it had reached a deal with Abellio ScotRail protecting the role of guards on its trains. The RMT called the deal \\"a major breakthrough in the battle against Driver Only Operation\\" which would be used as a \\"benchmark\\" for further negotiations with other operators. The deal was accepted by RMT members after a referendum on 5 October, formally closing the dispute. From November 2016, the RMT called for Abellio to be stripped of the ScotRail franchise, with it being returned to public ownership, due to a slump in performance and an alleged increase in \\"profiteering\\". On 14 September 2017, the RMT voted in favour of further industrial action on the ScotRail network over plans to cut CCTV operator jobs at two locations, although no date was set for industrial action.  First Great Western / Great Western Railway  The introduction of the Class 800 on the Great Western Main Line saw a series of strikes on First Great Western about plans to introduce DOO and other changes to working practices, including changes to the customer experience such as the removal of buffet cars. Despite multiple strikes, the company removed them. But some of the other issues were resolved. In 2016 another series of strikes took place over its outsourced cleaners contract.  Virgin Trains East Coast  A number of strikes were planned by the RMT at Virgin Trains East Coast, but only one went ahead, in October 2016. The RMT opened its first ballot of Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC) staff in July 2016, regarding concerns over the planned introduction of driver-only operation, the possibility of around 200 compulsory redundancies within the operation and concerns over staff pay. On 9 August, the RMT issued a statement confirming that the ballot had passed 84% in favour of full strike action. Three 24-hour strikes, involving all VTEC staff members except depot maintenance workers, were announced for August 2016, starting at 03:00 BST on 19, 26 and 29 August. Additionally, a 48-hour overtime ban was to be enforced from 03:00 on 27 August. On 16 August, it was announced that all industrial action at VTEC had been suspended indefinitely by the RMT to allow for further negotiations, with all three strikes and the overtime ban being cancelled as a result. Following a breakdown in negotiations in September, further industrial action was announced, with the first 24-hour strike scheduled for 3 October. The RMT said that the strike was \\"well-supported\\" and \\"solid\\", although VTEC ran a near- normal level of service throughout the strike, following what the RMT described as \\"the biggest scabbing operation in recent rail history\\"; the RMT later claimed that this \\"cavalier management\\" resulted in an incident in which the 08:30 VTEC service from to was allowed to operate with the doors of a defective carriage locked out of use, but still carrying passengers, against railway guidelines. The service was eventually terminated short at after the RMT and Office of Rail and Road alerted VTEC to the incident. Further industrial action was announced in early 2017 as negotiations once again stalled. A 48-hour strike was scheduled for 28‚Äì29 April. In a statement on 24 April, the RMT announced that all industrial action on VTEC had once again been indefinitely suspended following \\"progress\\" in talks between the union and VTEC, resulting in the planned April strike being cancelled. As of February 2018, there has been no further industrial action at VTEC. In June 2017, the RMT called for the InterCity East Coast franchise to be returned to public ownership, as it claimed the franchise was on the brink of \\"financial collapse\\" following the announcement by Stagecoach that the franchise had made a loss of ¬£84 million since its takeover in March 2015. In February 2018, the government confirmed that Stagecoach/Virgin would be stripped of the franchise \\"within a small number of months\\" due to its failure to meet financial obligations, marking the third collapse of the franchise in eleven years.  Other operators  ;Cleaners' strikes at GWR and Southeastern Industrial action has been threatened by the RMT amongst staff of various other operators. In December 2016, cleaners working for employment agency Servest UK, outsourced by Great Western Railway, voted 98% in favour of strike action over concerns about inequality in pay and working conditions compared to cleaners employed directly by GWR. These concerns were raised following a difficult period transferring the outsourcing contract from Mitie to Servest UK earlier in 2016, resulting in the creation of what the RMT called a \\"two- tier workforce\\". Two 24-hour cleaners' strikes took place from 06:00 on 16 December and 23 December. A further 48-hour strike was held between 06:00 on 19 January and 06:00 on 21 January 2017, before further industrial action was suspended by the RMT as negotiations improved. In July 2017, a new pay deal was accepted at a ballot of RMT members, formally ending the dispute. A similar situation arose at Southeastern, whose cleaners' jobs are outsourced to Wettons. In September 2017, the RMT announced that Southeastern cleaners employed by Wettons would be balloted for potential industrial action over pay and working conditions. The ballot passed in favour of industrial action. The first strike by Wettons cleaners at Southeastern took place for 24 hours from 20:30 on 19 October. There has been no further industrial action since the mid-October strike, although negotiations remain ongoing between the RMT, Southeastern and Wettons. ;East Midlands Trains In September 2017, the RMT warned that staff at East Midlands Trains would be balloted for potential strike action due to negotiations breaking down in an ongoing pay dispute; the dispute was later resolved without industrial action. East Midlands Trains at present has no plans to introduce driver-only operation. ;London Midland In January 2017, the RMT announced that it would ballot guards at London Midland for potential industrial action over concerns regarding the introduction of externally-contracted security staff on its trains at the end of December 2016, which the RMT alleged would replace the role of \\"safety-critical\\" guards on some services, paving the way for DOO operation. London Midland denied having plans in place to implement DOO operation on its network. Following negotiations with the RMT, London Midland ceased using externally-contracted security staff on its trains on 30 January; as a result, the RMT suspended its ballot on 2 February, averting potential industrial action, before formally declaring the dispute closed.

Early life Born in Verona, Fainello graduated in Mechanical Engineering at Polytechnic University of Milan with a thesis on tyre dynamics. Career After graduating, from 1990 to 1994 he was at the Fiat Research Centre. During this time he was involved in projects that concerned vehicle dynamics: his first job was to take care of a model of Ferrari 348. Furthermore, he started a collaboration with Professor Hans B. Pacejka, expert on dynamics of vehicles and tyres. Together they reached important goals in the study of tyre dynamics and after this collaboration Fainello was also known by the nickname \\"the rubber man\\".Fainello, l'uomo di gomma He also carried on some external projects: he was guest docent for the Vehicle Dynamics course at Dallara Automobili and consultant for the Alfa DTM team. In 1994 the Alfa DTM team with an Alfa Romeo 155 V6 TI and the driver Nicola Larini on board made history at the N√ºrburgring by winning both races and bringing the Alfa Romeo to win again on the circuit for the first time since Tazio Nuvolari victory in 1935. Formula One and Ferrari In 1995 he joined the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team. At first, Fainello had the role of \\"veicolista\\", the engineer in charge of the set-up on track. But after the first few years as veicolista of the drivers Jean Alesi and Michael Schumacher, in 1997 he became the responsible in chief of the vehicle dynamics and maintained this role until 2004. When he was in charge, Ferrari collected 6 Formula One World Constructor's Championships and Schumacher won the Formula One Drivers' Championship five times, from 2000 to 2004.

In 2004 Fainello was assigned to the development of the Ferrari simulator, a virtual system that can emulate all the car's functions for carrying out analysis without necessarily having to drive a real car. Despite other teams like McLaren and Red Bull Racing having initiated the use of simulators well in advance of Ferrari, Fainello was able to recover the time lost creating the first Ferrari simulator inside the Fiat Research Centre. In the same year, as well as other members of the Ferrari Dream Team, he was appointed Cavaliere al merito della Repubblica Italiana by the President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In the year 2007 and 2008, even though many members of the Dream Team had already left the team, Ferrari won two Formula One World Constructors' Championships and one Formula One Drivers' Championship.

Retrieved April 21, 2017. Page 1, Page 2. The school was set up as a relief school to relieve overcrowding for nearby West Orange High School. Classes began for the 2017‚Äì2018 school year. The district established a vote for naming the school and 39% of the area's families voted for the name \\"Windermere High School\\" (with 22% each voted for \\"Horizon High School\\" and \\"Lake Butler High School\\"). The Windermere town council opposed the naming on the grounds that area residents might confuse the school with Windermere Preparatory School. Some OCPS board members also argued the school should not be named for a community in which it would not be located; they stated that not very many students from Windermere would go there. History A number of new schools have been built in nearby areas to serve as relief schools. Dr. Phillips High School was built in 1987 to handle student capacity in the Universal, Sand Lake and Bay Hill communities. Olympia High School was built in 2001 to handle growth in Windermere, MetroWest, Pine Hills and some of the Dr. Phillips area. In 2005, Ocoee High School was reinstated to handle tremendous growth in the Ocoee and West Oaks Mall area. The next school in this succession is scheduled for the Horizon West area. Lakeview Middle School, Ocoee High School and Apopka High School are already or are expected to be at capacity within 2 to 4 years. Wekiva High School Apopka High Relief opened in August 2007 to handle overflow from Apopka High School and Ocoee High School. West Orange Comprehensive Replacement itself will be at or beyond program capacity within two years. In late 2007, the Orange County School Board was considering postponement of West Orange Relief past the anticipated 2012 opening. Given revenue shortfalls, this was a virtual certainty. In November 2013, Orange County Commissioners rejected the proposal for a West Orange Relief School on C.R. 535 and Ficquette Road in Windermere. In August 2014, the West Orange Relief High School had a tentative opening date of August 2017. The site is located on the intersection of Winter Garden Vineland Road and Summerport Village Parkway near County Road 535 and Ficquette Road. By September 2015, ground had been broken and construction of the school had begun. In October 2016, the OCPS School Board approved the name \\"Windermere High School\\" after much controversy due to the new school not being in close proximity to the town of Windermere and the Windermere council expressing its disagreement with the name. The school mascot chosen was The Wolverines, the school colors chosen were navy, bright green and silver (similar to the Seattle Seahawks American football team). On August 14, 2017, Windermere High School opened to students. Sports * On August 18, 2017, Windermere High School lost its first football game against West Orange High School with a score of 70‚Äì0. * At the end of the first year, the lacrosse team went 6‚Äì6 at the end of the year. * Wrestling successfully completed its second season with a 18‚Äì4 Dual Meet record. * Windermere varsity soccer team was district champion, and the junior varsity team finished the season undefeated (20-0-0).

Incidents On September 20, 2017, the school was put on lockdown after a threat was sent by text message from two students. The school was checked and secured by local law enforcement, who forced the school into a late dismissal. No weapon or threat was found and charges against the two students were dropped. On November 15, 2017, the school was put on lockdown again after a parent received a text message saying, \\"There are guys in the bathrooms and hallways with guns in Windermere High School. We are afraid, please call 911 now.\\"  The school was checked by local law enforcement and no threat was found, letting the students out in a late dismissal. On February 16, 2018, the school was put on a brief lockdown after a threat was called in. The lockdown ended before noon. On August 23, 2018, a student posted a threat on social media. The school did not go into lockdown and the student was arrested. Campus With a budget of $93.5 million, Windermere High School had 2,800 students in its first year. It now has 4,000 students.

Retrieved Apr. 1, 2020. A science-fiction love story about time travel, it describes the misadventures of a man, Jack, after he finds his pregnant wife, Patience, murdered in their apartment. Many years later, when grief has destroyed his life, chance leads him to discover a time machine, which he plans to use to save Patience. The book's tagline, in a surreal and tongue-in-cheek style typical of Clowes, is, \\"a cosmic timewarp deathtrip to the primordial infinite of everlasting love\\". The book uses bright, contrasting colours to evoke atmosphere, as well as surrealistic sci-fi imagery, when Jack free-falls between dimensions and has nightmarish visions of himself outside time and space. (Clowes' visual approach in his graphic novels tends to vary between full, even gaudy colour, and muted blues and greens that create a black-and-white effect, as in Ghost World and David Boring.) Background and creation Patience is Clowes' longest book, at around 180 pages, and is the second by him, after Wilson, to not have been serialized first, either in Eightball ‚Äî his own comic book series ‚Äî or elsewhere. Clowes credits in the book Alvin Buenaventura with technical and production assistance. Buenaventura committed suicide in February 2016, the month before Patience's release. Film adaptation On December 13, 2016, Clowes announced that he would write the film adaptation for Patience for Focus Features. While promoting Wilson, Clowes spoke about how, unlike his previous adaptations, Patience is about the right length to fit in a film screenplay, saying, \\"It‚Äôs interesting ‚Äì I thought that I was going to have to chop stuff, which would be the first time. Usually I‚Äôm having to add material. But it‚Äôs actually turning out to be the right length in the way I conceived it, so that‚Äôs one of those things you never know when you start. It‚Äôs magically working out in that way, so I take that as a good sign.\\"McKittrick, Christopher. \\"Wilson: A Walking Id\\". Creative Screenwriting, March 23, 2017.

The piece, written in 1942, was inspired by the Cuban genre of the same name. It was first arranged for orchestra in 1946.  Composition  After having premiered El Salon Mexico in Mexico City in 1937, Copland traveled to Havana and other Latin American countries to study their rhythms and musical forms, with which he had a fascination. During this trip, he finished his second book, Our New Music, together with his lover, Victor Kraft. Four months after that, in 1941, he became a representative of the Committee of Inter-American Relations and went on a tour which took him four months to complete and traveled around nine different countries. He spent the time during this trip giving lectures and concerts after returning once again to Havana, which he considered to be a special place to him. This trip to Havana led him to write two pieces: Las agachadas, a choral work, and the Danz√≥n cubano, for two pianos. He completed the latter while he was in Oakland, in the fall of 1942. However, it was largely based on themes, melodies and rhythms that Copland himself either heard or recorded during his stay in Cuba. As Copland himself explained: \\"The Danz√≥n cubano is in no sense intended to be an authentic danz√≥n, but only an American tourist's impression\\". It was written to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the League of Composers, in a concert entitled Salute to the League of Composers, which was held at New York's Town Hall on December 9, 1942. Copland, however, entitled the work Birthday Piece as a reference not only to the League's anniversary, but also to Rudy Burckhardt's birthday. The composer premiered this work together with Leonard Bernstein on this occasion and dedicated it to Rudy Burckhardt, who was a friend of Copland and his lover who accompanied them while on their trip to Havana. The score was published shortly after the premiere by Boosey & Hawkes in 1943. The Danz√≥n was later expanded for a large orchestra in 1946. It was premiered by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra on February 17, 1946, Reginald Stewart conducting. However, Copland revisited the piece many times during his professional career. Since then, it has been performed by many of the most important orchestras in the United States, such as the Cleveland Orchestra and the Los Angeles Symphonic Orchestra. The orchestral score was published again shortly after by Boosey & Hawkes in 1947. It was later compiled in an orchestral anthology of Copland's works, together with Quiet City, Lincoln Portrait, the Clarinet Concerto, and Three Latin- American Sketches. Eliot Feld also choreographed the work as a ballet under the same name, for three female dancers and one male dancer. After watching a televised rehearsal of the ballet, Copland asked Feld if he had even been to Cuba, to which Feld responded that he had never been to Cuba but had felt as if he had been there upon having listened to his piece. One of the last performances that Copland gave was in a concert by American fellow musician and Principal Pianist at the New York Philharmonic Paul Jacobs on December 15, 1979. In the concert, Jacobs discussed the influence of jazz in modern classical music, as he performed pieces by Frederic Rzewski, William Bolcom and Copland's own Four Piano Blues. After having been able to convince Copland to come up the stage, they both played the Danz√≥n, even though Copland confessed to have been a little nervous about playing the piano again after a hiatus of more than 10 years. As Copland said: \\"Paul's an old friend and he talked me into it\\". The piece was recorded and the concert was partially released by Nonesuch Records.  Structure  The piece is scored for two pianos and should not take much more than 7 minutes to perform. The score is marked Moderately, even though some editions and arrangements also include \\"Moderately (non-challant but precise)\\"; in fact, the orchestral version is usually performed a bit slower due to specific demands made by Copland in its time, given the difficulty and the expected preciseness of the different rhythms. As stated by Copland, the danz√≥n is not to be confused with rhumba, conga, or samba, but rather a bit slower dance. It is usually divided into two thematic parts which are mutually independent, but with a highly syncopated style. However, in this piece, Copland used up to four different themes. The orchestral arrangement of the Danz√≥n is scored for a piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, a cor anglais, two clarinets in B-flat, one bass clarinet in B-flat, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, four horns in F, three trumpets in B-flat, three trombones, a tuba, timpani, a xylophone, a large percussion section consisting of a bass drum, Chinese blocks, claves, a cowbell, cymbals, a gourd, maracas, a slapstick, a snare drum, and a woodblock, a piano and a large string section.

Voters chose six electors, or representatives to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson won the state of Arkansas with 56.06% of the popular vote, which was a substantial increase upon John F. Kennedy's 50.19% from the preceding election, although the Republican vote remained virtually unchanged at 43.41%. Johnson won all but ten of Arkansas' seventy-five counties, and all four congressional districts. Background Given the segregationism of its long- serving governor Orval Faubus, who had gained almost seven percent of the vote in the preceding presidential election, Arkansas would have seemed potentially likely to succumb to Goldwater due to his opposition to the recent Civil Rights Act. However, the GOP's nomination of the moderate Winthrop Rockefeller in the party's first serious run for governor in the state since Reconstruction took the steam out of a Goldwater challenge.Johnson, Robert David; All the Way with LBJ: The 1964 Presidential Election, p. 225 Faubus refused to endorse Goldwater,Bass, Jack and De Vries, Walter; The Transformation of Southern Politics Social Change and Political Consequence Since 1945, p. 93 despite hesitating over this during the summer. In addition, many white southerners commented to the effect that In mid-July, Texas Governor John Connally had made private polls suggesting that Johnson would lose Arkansas, as well as the hopeless Deep South states of Mississippi and Alabama.Johnson; All the Way with LBJ, p. 168 Nonetheless, that the increase in black registration in the Natural State had exceeded Kennedy's margin in 1960 suggested that Johnson's civil rights legislation did have some potential to help him, and in early August polls suddenly became confident Johnson would carry the state due to Goldwater's policies of privatizing Social Security and expanding the war in Southeast Asia ‚Äì a policy that did not play well in this isolationist state.Roberts, Chalmers M.; 'Goldwater Riding High in South, Survey Finds: Has Firm Hold on Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Florida; Texas Rates Tossup'; Los Angeles Times, August 2, 1964, p. I2 By October, a New York Times poll saw Arkansas as \\"safe\\" for JohnsonWicker, Tom; 'Big Johnson Lead Found in Survey'; The New York Times, October 6, 1964, pp. 1, 28 and his leads in polls increased as election day came closer.Johnson; All the Way with LBJ, p. 275 Ultimately, Johnson comfortably carried Arkansas, becoming the twenty-third and last consecutive Democratic presidential nominee to win the state; however, anti-civil rights feeling did cause Arkansas to vote 9.92 percentage points more Republican than the nation at-large ‚Äì this being the first time in 96 years when it had voted less Democratic than the nation. Johnson doubled Kennedy's margin, and reclaimed the counties of Clay, Craighead, Fulton, Marion, Randolph and Sharp, which in 1960 had defected to the GOP for the first time ever or since Reconstruction as a result of powerful anti-Catholicism.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 87 Johnson also claimed thirteen other Ozark counties which had supported Nixon in 1960. However, in the Delta and south of the state sufficient backlash against black civil rights occurred for Goldwater to claim six counties in those regions from the Democrats.Menendez; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, p. 91 Of these, only state namesake Arkansas County had ever been carried by a Republican since the McKinley era. Ashley County and Drew County voted Republican for the first time since James G. Blaine in 1884,Menendez; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, pp. 149‚Äì153 Union County for the first time since Reconstruction, while Goldwater was the first Republican to ever carry Columbia and Howard Counties.

In October 1940 he was promoted to full Admiral and received the command of Special Naval Force (Forza Navale Speciale, FNS) a unit specifically created for amphibious operations. FNS was composed of the light cruisers Bari and Taranto, the destroyers Carlo Mirabello and Augusto Riboty, the torpedo boats Antares, Altair, Arethusa, Andromeda, Angelo Bassini, Nicola Fabrizi and Giacomo Medici and the landing ships Sesia, Tirso and Garigliano; its initial task would be the invasion and occupation of the Greek island of Corfu, scheduled for 28 October 1940, coinciding with the start of Italy's invasion of GreecePier Filippo Lupinacci, Vittorio Emanuele Tognelli, La difesa del traffico con l'Albania, la Grecia e l'Egeo, pp. 26-27, 73-74. Bad weather, however, delayed the operation, until the poor results of the ground operations in Greece led to cancellation of the Corfu landing in order to divert the troops to the Greek-Albanian front. Between 29 April and 7 May 1941, following the collapse of the Greek resistance as a result of German intervention, the Special Naval Force under Tur proceeded to occupy the Ionian Islands. In 1942, FNS was tasked with the implementation of Operation C3, the planned conquest of Malta: according to the plan, 19 transport ships, 270 landing craft and about fifty other vessels, escorted by thirty destroyers and torpedo boats, were to land a total of 62,000 men (as well as 1,600 vehicles and 700 artillery pieces) on the island's coasts.Le tre previste invasioni di MaltaOperatione C3 Malta Admiral Tur was to direct the landing operation; in order to implement the landing (35,000 men were scheduled to be landed on the first day of the invasion, followed by another 25,000 in the following days), FNS was strengthened with MZ-type landing craft, ML-type motor launches, bragozzi, motor sailing vessels and lagoon vaporetti transformed into landing craft, railway ferries converted into landing ships, and several minelayers.Malta C3 In the first half of 1942, FNS, concentrated in Livorno, began training in landing operations along the coast of Tuscany, which had a rocky conformation similar to that of Malta; but in July 1942, due to the rapid Axis advance on the Libyan-Egyptian front, Operation C3 was postponed and then canceled.Operation C3 Malta On 11 November 1942, FNS (with a combined strength of 146 vessels) under Admiral Tur, left Leghorn and landed Italian troops at Bastia, Ajaccio, Porto Vecchio and Santa Maura to carry out the occupation of Corsica during the implementation of Case Anton, the German-Italian occupation of Vichy France. The landing (carried out with part of the personnel and equipment intended for the invasion of Malta), which did not meet with opposition from the modest Vichy forces, was executed without problems, and the island was smoothly occupied.Erminio Bagnasco, In guerra sul mare. Navi e marinai italiani nella seconda guerra mondiale, p. 322. In January 1943, Admiral Tur was appointed Naval Commander in France, with headquarters in Toulon, and in May he was transferred to the command of the Southern Tyrrhenian Naval Department, headquartered in Naples, a post he held until 8 August 1943. When the armistice of Cassibile was announced, on 8 September 1943, Tur was in Rome; following the German occupation of central and northern Italy, he remained in German-occupied territory, but he refused to cooperate with the German authorities, or to join the Italian Social Republic. On 30 March 1945 he was placed in reserve for reasons of age, but he was called back into service until 15 July 1945. He died in Rome on 22 October 1969.B.

Life  Before his elevation to the episcopate all that is known of Volkold's life is that he was at the court of Emperor Otto I as one of the tutors of the Emperor's son, the future Otto II. He seems to have been appointed Bishop of Meissen in 969.Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (1896): Volkold Before his elevation Volkold was the patron of the young Willigis, later Saint Willigis, and used his influence to obtain for him a position in the Imperial service. In 972 Volkold attended a synod in Ingelheim. When Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia, besieged the Albrechtsburg and the town of Meissen in 984 in support of the Imperial ambitions of Henry II of Bavaria after the death of Otto II, Volkold was obliged to seek refuge from the Sorbs in Erfurt, under the protection of Willigis, and was not able to return to his badly-damaged headquarters until after the re-conquest by Ekkehard I, Margrave of Meissen, in 987. In that year he put the diocese under Imperial protection. Doubtless as compensation for the bishopric's many losses he received from Otto II several gifts of estates, tolls and uses.F W Ebeling, Die deutschen Bisch√∂fe bis zum Ende des 16ten Jahrhunderts, Leipzig 1858 While on a visit to Prague he suffered a stroke, on Good Friday 992, and returned paralysed to Meissen, where he died on 23 August and was buried.

She is remembered for her tourism in the Yukon, her contentious divorce from a man styling himself as the Count di Castelmenardo, and her family connection to Teaneck, New Jersey. Family Edith Van Buren's father was General Thomas Brodhead Van Buren, a Union officer and U.S. diplomat who later became the U.S. Consul-General in Yokohama. Through her father, Edith Van Buren was related to the U.S. president Martin Van Buren. Her mother was Harriet Sheffield, daughter of the railroad magnate Joseph Earl Sheffield. Harriet Sheffield's brother-in-law, William Walter Phelps, encouraged the family to take up residence in Teaneck, New Jersey. Portrait Bust A marble portrait bust of Edith Van Buren by the American sculptor Luella Varney was exhibited at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exhibition. One list of Varney's work described Van Buren as \\"the beauty.\\" The bust is now on display at the Teaneck public library. Expedition to the Yukon In 1898, Van Buren went to Klondike with her friend Mary Evelyn Hitchcock, embarking from San Francisco on a steamer. Their luggage included multiple pets and an early motion picture device called an animatoscope. Hitchcock later described their visit in a book, Two Women in the Klondike. Countess di Castelmenardo Van Buren met Gennaro Vesicchio, also known as Gennaro di Castelmenardo, in Nice, France, where her brother Harold Sheffield Van Buren was a U.S. consul. Vesicchio represented himself as the count of Castelmenardo. The couple married in London on July 7, 1900. However, Vesicchio became indebted, losing money in Monte Carlo, and Van Buren learned that he was not actually a count. She paid for a title of nobility for him, then learned that he was committing adultery. She had him jailed for adultery, then sued for separation and later divorce.

Early life William Connolly was born in approximately 1786 in Lachine, Quebec. Though his family had Irish roots, they were fully established in French Canadian society by the time of his birth and were distantly related to Marguerite d'Youville. Career Connolly joined the North West Company (NWC) in 1801 as an apprentice clerk. Two years later, he married, according to the local custom, a M√©tis Cree girl Miyo Nipiy (also known as Susanna Pas de Nom), step-daughter of an influential chief. Later, the couple had their first child, John Connolly, probably near Southern Indian Lake, as he was stationed at Nelson House, Manitoba between 1802 and 1803 he was at Nelson House (Man.) and did not move to the Rat River House until 1804. Over the course of their marriage, the couple were to have six children together, including a daughter, Amelia born in 1812, who would become the 1st first lady of British Columbia. Connolly gradually ascended the corporate hierarchy of the NWC and later the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). When the NWC absorbed into the HBC in 1821, Connolly went west to New Caledonia to reexamine all regional operations in 1821. He was appointed Chief Factor in 1825 and held managerial responsibilities from Fort St. James until 1831, when Peter Warren Dease took over. While at Fort St. James he took James Douglas under his wing, impressed by Douglas' skills. Because of their close relations, Connolly agreed to Douglas marrying his daughter Amelia and performed their customary ceremony at the fort. In 1832 Connolly took his family back to Montreal, but disavowed his marriage to Susanna as being non-legally binding. On 16 May 1832, he married Julia Woolrich, his second cousin in a Catholic ceremony. Though he had repudiated his first family, he continued to support them, even after they left Montreal and moved to Saint Boniface, Manitoba, where Susanna lived in the Grey Nuns' convent. Soon after the marriage to Julia, the HBC placed him in charge of the king's posts they rented in Lower Canada and he and his new wife moved to Tadoussac. His territory increased over time and within six years included Mingan, Quebec, but Julia, by then the mother of two children, longed to return to Montreal. Connolly asked for leave and the company, hoping to push him into retirement offered a post at Fort Albany in Ontario, which they felt certain Julia would reject as unsuitable. In 1843, Connolly accepted retirement and returned to Montreal, where he lived lavishly until his death, on 3 June 1848 in Montreal.  Legacy  After his death, in 1862, Connelly's oldest son John, sued Julia Woolrich Connolly, who had inherited his father's estate. He argued that he and his siblings were legitimate heirs and entitled to inherit. He won his case and the verdict was upheld by the appellate courts. When Julia's heirs appealed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, the parties finally reached an out-of-court settlement. The judgment was important, as it validated the concept of common law marriage in Canada and upheld the right of children to inherit, but it also indicated that the laws and customs of First Nations people were valid and serve as an underpinning to Canadian law.

Launched in January 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018. FuboTV is the only vMVPD to launch outside of North America. There are several service options with different channel lineups, including the base package, fubo Standard, with 100+ channels, and add-on packages like Extra, Sports Plus, fubo Cycling, Latino Plus and Portugu√™s Plus. During its first five years, investors in FuboTV include AMC Networks, Luminari Capital, Northzone, Sky, and Scripps Networks Interactive. FuboTV was named to Forbes‚Äô Next Billion- Dollar Startups list in 2019. In October 2018, FuboTV announced it was approaching 250,000 subscribers, a +100% increase over the prior year. It also had 30,000 net additions in Q3 2018, ahead of most of its larger competitors and a sign that interest in vMVPDs continues to grow.

Upon closing, the combined company will be named fuboTV and led by current fuboTV CEO David Gandler. According to the article, fuboTV plans to leverage Facebank's IP portfolio to create new streaming experiences for consumers and also expand internationally. FaceBank is traded on the OTC exchange and, following the merger, Gandler noted the company plans to uplist to a major stock exchange. Following its merger with FaceBank Group, FuboTV began trading on the OTC under the ticker symbol FUBO. The company announced its intention to uplist to a major stock exchange \\"in the coming months.\\" After the merger, former Warner Music Group Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. was named Executive Chairman of the Board and early Spotify investor Par-Jorgen Parson and venture capitalist Daniel Leff was named to the Board. All three were early investors in FuboTV. FuboTV announced in May 2020 that it closed 2019 with nearly 316,000 paid subscribers. The company also said revenues grew 96% in 2019 to $146.5 million. On September 15, 2020, FuboTV said it expected to close 2020 with 410,000-420,000 subscribers as a result of the return of sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company also announced it was approved to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) \\"conditional upon successful pricing of this offering, under the ticker symbol FUBO.‚Äù FuboTV began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \\"FUBO\\" on October 8, 2020.

History  FuboTV was co-founded in January 2015 by David Gandler (CEO), Alberto Horihuela (CMO) and Sung Ho Choi. At launch, FuboTV cost $7 per month and offered live streams from soccer-centric channels. In early 2017, Fubo pivoted to become a broader streaming service, adding entertainment and news programming in addition to soccer and sports from NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. According to Fast Company, FuboTV still calls itself ‚Äúsports-first,‚Äù but instead of being the Netflix of soccer, it‚Äôs now pitching itself as a direct competitor to cable TV and to live-streaming bundles such as Sling TV and DirecTV Now. FuboTV was the first live-TV streaming service to support 4K HDR video (2018 World Cup), and it was the first to adopt an industry standard for handling sports blackouts. It also introduced dynamic ad insertion ahead of Hulu and YouTube TV. In December 2018, Fubo announced that they were going to expand into Spain. On February 20, 2019, it was announced that channels from Viacom Networks were going to be added on April 30, 2019. The Viacom channels launched on fuboTV in Spain in 2020.

As part of the wilderness system, it helps to preserve a variety of natural life forms and contributes to a diversity of plant and animal gene pools. Although it is located close to Blacksburg, Virginia, Brush Mountain is remote. The area looks out to the northwest across Craig Creek to the slopes of Sinking Creek Mountain. The area is part of the Craig Creek Cluster. Location and access Craig Creek The wilderness lies north of and in close proximity to Blacksburg, Virginia. It extends for about 8 miles along the northwest slope of Brush Mountain, bounded to the east by a power line, to the northwest by Craig Creek and private property, and to the southeast by Forest road 188.1 along the crest of the mountain. There are no trails in the area. Good access is gained from Craig Creek Rd. (Va 621) which follows Craig Creek with several pullouts for parking. Access roads are shown on National Geographic-Trails Illustrated Map #787 (Blacksburg-New River Valley). Natural history Old-growth oak- pine forests are scattered across the western half of the wilderness. An important species is table mountain pine which thrives in harsh conditions where few other trees will grow. It can be found on the dry southwestern slopes of Brush Mountain. The wilderness area contains some of the highest concentrations of this pine in the world. Two unusual plants are the parasitic sweet pinesap and piratebush. The only related species of these two plants are found in China and Japan. Sweet pinesap is about 10 cm high, with an erect stalk, lacks chlorophyll, has a light purplish brown color and scalelike leaves. It blooms from September to November or February to April, and is commonly found hidden in leaf litter under oak and pine trees. Piratebush is a shrub growing to 4 meters in height, with groups of 3-10 greenish flowers. It blooms from April to October and is commonly found growing with pines in dry, scrubby woodlands. While piratebush is rare, it sometimes occurs in large populations. The wilderness protects habitat for the James River spinymussel, an endangered mussel once found throughout much of the entire James River basin from Richmond to the mountains. Now only a few streams, such as Craig Creek, provide good habitat for the mussel. Mussels provide a natural filter to maintain clean water. Topography The wilderness is on the northwest side of Brush Mountain, a 2900 foot high ridge with many hollows stretching down from the ridge to Craig Creek. Hollows with names such as Hazelnut Hollow, Sugar Bottom Hollow and Sugar House Hollow probably refer to the natural resources that were gathered in the area. Others such s Betsy Boating Hollow, Jones Hollow, and Leyman Hollow may represent names of families that lived in the area at the end of the nineteenth century.Virginia Wilderness Committee: Brush Mountain Wilderness ‚Äì Virginia Wilderness Committee, accessdate: January 16, 2017 The wilderness is located a few miles north of the continental divide. The rock strata forming the wilderness are tilted upward to the north. To the south are Mississippian layers, formed between 320 and 360 million years ago. On the upper reaches of the mountain is tough Devonian sandstone, formed between 360 and 408 million years ago. It caps Brush Mountain and juts out to the north at the top of the wilderness slope. Below it lies brittle layers of older and more loose Devonian shale which is subject to erosion. The lower reaches along Craig Creek valley contain Silurian sandstone, formed between 408 and 438 million years ago and extending northwest to form Sinking Creek Mountain. Management This wilderness was designated by Congress in 1984 and is managed by the Forest Service.Wilderness.net ‚Äì Brush Mountain Wilderness ‚Äì General Information, accessdate: January 8, 2017 There are some regulations to maintain the integrity of the area. For example, motorized equipment, motor vehicles and mountain bikes are prohibited, group size is limited to ten people, and limits are placed on camping.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 8, 2017, and is written by Alex Carter and directed by Greg Colton. The story follows Quagmire flying his friends to San Francisco, and as they go home, they are soon ambushed by a group of Eastern European terrorists hijacking their plane, causing Quagmire to put his ex-Navy piloting skills to the test. This episode was dedicated in memory of cast member Carrie Fisher, who died on December 27, 2016 after going into cardiac arrest while on a flight to Los Angeles on December 23, 2016. A slide showing her picture with the words \\"In Loving Memory\\" on top and \\"Carrie Fisher 1956‚Äì2016\\" below was shown before the start of the episode. Plot At the Drunken Clam, Glenn Quagmire meets with Peter Griffin, Cleveland Brown and Joe Swanson and tells them that he can get a discount for friends and family and bring them along on a trip, so they plan on going to San Francisco. They steal a cab meant for Lois who was originally going to a timeshare hosted by Donna Tubbs' sister Janet with Donna and Bonnie Swanson. As Peter unknowingly grabbed Lois's suitcase, Lois finds a sex doll resembling her in the suitcase as Lois commented that Peter was \\"bringing her\\" in the suitcase. When they arrive in San Francisco, they do random stuff like riding Segways and getting 'lesbian' haircuts while checking out the sights and Peter even sits on Stephen Curry's lap. When the trip ends, Quagmire gives them a tour of the plane where they soon accuse Quagmire of goofing off while the plane was on autopilot which he claims to use while taking breaks. Quagmire takes offense to that and kicks them out of the cockpit. While flying, the plane gets hijacked by 3 terrorists from an unidentified Eastern European country who jam the frequency. The terrorists explain that they are going to punish America for supporting the other side of the unidentified Eastern European country in the civil war (implied it is Ukraine and the civil war is likely the War in Donbass). This hijacking is covered on the news by Tom Tucker and is watched by the Griffins, the Swansons, the Browns and Ida Quagmire. Quagmire refuses to allow the terrorists entry to the cockpit, even when Peter is threatened at gun point. Joe and Cleveland decide to take matters into their own hands by going down to the cargo hold and retrieve a gun from Joe's bag. One of the terrorists discovers this and heads down to the basement with Peter as a human shield. Joe opens the landing gear, but Peter gets caught with the terrorist and they have a fight on the landing gear. Just as the two are about to make peace while flying over Yosemite National Park, Cleveland manages to hit the terrorist off as he falls to a watery grave into the river below. When the trio go back up and knock out the 2 remaining terrorists, they are hailed as heroes. When Quagmire comes out to congratulate them and informs everyone that the plane will land in Nevada, an additional terrorist (the mastermind & ringleader of the hijacking team, who was also in reserve just in case the plan went awry) posing as a businessman hijacks the plane where he plans to crash it into Las Vegas' biggest hotel with Rita Rudner in it. Before the plan is carried out, Quagmire uses a barrel roll to subdue the terrorist. Unfortunately, Quagmire got angry at the passengers for not following the \\"Please Fasten Seatbelt\\" light that was turned on. \\"Oh come on doesn't anyone pay attention to the sign?\\". However, fighter jets appear unaware that the hijackers have been taken care of. The plane is shot in its right wing, but a determined Quagmire manages to land the plane in a large lake and keep everyone safe. As the passengers & co-pilot are tended by the EMTs and the damaged plane taken care of by the Firefighters and the 3 remaining terrorists are also arrested by the FBI (with the Police in tow and the averted crisis is also covered by the media as well), Peter, Cleveland, and Joe thank Quagmire for saving them and apologize for judging his flight actions. Just then, a military plane comes with the guys' respective families to reunite with them. Peter and Chris have a chat about some of the charges Chris found on Peter's card from their time in San Francisco and suggest he keeps some of his purchases private. When the various families plan to head back to Quahog and put this entire thing behind them, Peter breaks the fourth wall and claims to the audience \\"Oh, yeah, in case we didn't say, this was Spirit Airlines.\\" Reception The episode received an audience of 4.00 million viewers, an increase from the previous episode, and making it the third most-watched show of the night, behind Son of Zorn and The Simpsons.

It was released as a 7\\" vinyl single through Tuff Gong and Green Door Records. It was issued commercially with B-side track \\"Redder Then Red\\", which was misspelled on its initial printing, in 1971. It was written and produced by Marley and features uncredited lyrical contributions from Bunny Livingston. A reggae composition like the majority of Marley's works, \\"Guava Jelly\\" contains a rocksteady and island-like production with lyrics loosely based around sexual intercourse. His use of the term \\"guava jelly\\" was likely referring to a specific type of sexual lubricant. It was favorably viewed by several reviewers, with many of them finding the composition to be sexual and about love. The group placed \\"Guava Jelly\\" on several compilation albums, including Africa Unite: The Singles Collection in 2005, and Owen Gray and Herbie Mann created their own versions in 1974 and 1975, respectively. American artists Johnny Nash and Barbra Streisand also recorded covers of \\"Guava Jelly\\" and released them as commercial singles in 1972 and 1974, respectively. Nash's version was featured on his eleventh studio album, I Can See Clearly Now (1972), and was distributed in the 7\\" format in Jamaica and South Africa as the record's fourth and final single. Rita Marley, Bob's wife, was upset that Nash created a cover as he would be credited for the single's success and not Marley. Streisand's rendition was included on her sixteenth studio album, ButterFly (1974), and released as the record's lead single on 16 December 1974. It divided music critics in the way that several thought her voice was not suited for reggae music. In 1991 the singer would appear on Larry King Live and admit her disappointment in ButterFly and the songs that appeared on it.  Background and composition  lubricant products during sexual intercourse. \\"Guava Jelly\\" was released in two different formats in 1971. The standard edition includes the track as both the A-side and B-side tracks, while the version released in the United Kingdom includes \\"Redder Than Red\\" as its B-side, although it was misspelled as \\"Redder Then Red\\" on the release. It was written and produced by Marley, although longtime collaborator and friend Bunny Livingston contributed by writing additional lyrics and was uncredited for his work. It is written in the key of C major with Marley's vocals ranging from G4 to A5; it is additionally accompanied by the instrumentation of a piano and a guitar. A reggae and rocksteady recording, \\"Guava Jelly\\" features influence from Jamaican music, which is reflected in the lyrics; Marley wanted the sound of the single to more heavy on rocksteady than reggae, although he does refer to it as \\"moderate reggae\\" in later years. Mervin Stoddart, who wrote Bob Marley's Lyrics: Understanding and Explaining Their Pedagogical Value, stated that the single was inspired and emphasized by the \\"sweetness of love making\\". He also stated that \\"Non-Jamaican listeners might concentrate 'more on the beauty of the tune rather than the slightly risqu√© lyrics'\\". Authors Ian McCann and Harry Hawke predicted that \\"innocent\\" listeners would not recognize the explicit lyrics because of its \\"island charm\\". Marley begins the track by singing the line: \\"You said you love me\\" and follows with: \\"I said I love you\\". By incorporating \\"the concerns of soul\\" into the lyrics, he sings into the chorus: \\"Here I am / Me said, 'Come rub in 'pon me belly' / 'With you guava jelly, Damsel'\\". His use of the word Damsel refers to a woman in a relationship experiencing \\"emotional pain\\". Furthermore, authors Monique Guillory and Richard Green found the song's title refer to a type of sexual lubricant.  Reception  Writer John Masouri found that \\"Guava Jelly\\" was one of Marley's most commercial recordings from 1971, and used Nash and Streisand's admiration to it as evidence. Agreeing, Chris Salewciz (who wrote a biography about Marley in 2014) described the composition as \\"sexy\\". Jo-Anne Greene from AllMusic described the composition as a \\"rich, romantic piece\\" and enjoyed Marley's \\"fiery, sexy performance\\". She later noticed its impact in the music industry by writing, \\"'Jelly' quivered its way across the sound systems and beyond. In later years, Jelly would be covered time and again by some of the biggest names in the music business.\\"  Promotion and cover versions  The single has been featured on several of the group's compilation albums and greatest hits albums. Marley first included \\"Guava Jelly\\" on his four-disc box set, titled Songs of Freedom (1992). Alongside its appearance, the succeeding track is a medley of several songs: \\"Guava Jelly\\", \\"This Train\\", \\"Cornerstone\\", \\"Comma Comma\\", \\"Dewdrops\\", \\"Stir It Up\\", and \\"L'M\\". 1999's The Complete Bob Marley & the Wailers 1967-1972, Part 3 album also features the single and the previously unreleased demo titled \\"Guava\\". Grooving Kingston 12 (2004) and Africa Unite: The Singles Collection (2005) include \\"Guava Jelly\\" as well. \\"Guava Jelly\\" was licensed to several other singers after its initial release in 1971. Jamaican singer Owen Gray recorded \\"Guava Jelly\\" but added his own \\"modern reggae\\" touch to it. He released it as a promotional single in 1974 through Island Records with B-side track \\"Please Don't Let Me Go\\", which he wrote and produced himself. Flautist Herbie Mann's 1975 album Discoth√®que featured an instrumental version of \\"Guava Jelly\\".

It was first used as the B-side to his previous single, \\"There Are More Questions Than Answers\\", which was also released in 1972, and was produced by Nash. Rita Marley, Bob's wife, was upset that JAD Records lent the track for Nash to cover, as the label \\"wanted to make a star out of Johnny Nash, not of Bob Marley\\". Additionally, Steve Sullivan (author of Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 1) incorrectly claimed that Marley was commissioned to write \\"Guava Jelly\\" solely for Nash. However, Sullivan also writes that the success of Nash's version allotted Marley enough money to start his own record label, which he had always wanted to do. The label was eventually created and became known as Tuff Gong. Nash's rendition of \\"Guava Jelly\\" was released exclusively in Jamaica by Federal Records on 23 February 1973. The 7\\" single features the aforementioned title as the A-side and \\"The Fish & the Alley of Destruction\\" as its B-side. The following year, CBS Records International released it in South Africa, but instead with \\"Ooh Baby You've Been Good to Me\\" replacing the previously mentioned B-side. Sullivan took a liking to Nash's release, finding him definitely influenced by Marley and writing that \\"Nash's inviting high tenor voice, and lyrics designed to banish negativity and unleash hope\\" are able to create \\"pure pleasure\\" whenever its played on the radio. On the 2010 British miniseries This Is England '86, \\"Guava Jelly\\" was played on selected episodes and features on the accompanying soundtrack in 2010.  In other media  Nash has since placed \\"Guava Jelly\\" on several of his future releases. The single was first included on 1974 compilation album, Greatest Hits. Then \\"Guava Jelly\\" has inclusion on The Johnny Nash Collection (1977) and The Johnny Nash Album (1980), released by Sony Music and CBS Records International, respectively. It was also featured as track ten on his 1981 collection of singles, titled Stir It Up; the record was released exclusively by Hallmark Recordings. Other albums that feature his version of \\"Guava Jelly\\" include The Reggae Collection (1993), The Best of Johnny Nash (1996), Superhits (2004), and Collections (2006). The Trojan Records compiled This Is Reggae Music: The Golden Era 1960-1975 and released it on 26 October 2004; three songs by Nash were included: \\"Guava Jelly\\" on disc three, and \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" and \\"Stir It Up\\" on disc four.

Marley licensed the track to Streisand in 1974, a year where he took a break from recording music, in hopes of exposing more fans to his music. According to author Klive Walker, the singer created the cover in order to \\"decorat[e] her songs with a fresh 'tropical' beat\\". Similarly, other publications felt she released it during the growing popularity of reggae music in the United States. However, Streisand instead hoped for achieving a record featuring diverse and \\"eclectic\\" material, straying away from her previous works of the pop and rock genres. A critic for Stereo Review determined that Streisand sounds like Aretha Franklin on \\"Guava Jelly\\", singing with a more sexual tone previously unheard of in her catalogue. Streisand released the single in a 7\\" vinyl format on 16 December 1974 in three territories: the United States, the Netherlands, and Spain. The US version features B-side track \\"Love in the Afternoon\\", the Netherlands release includes a cover of David Bowie's \\"Life on Mars\\", and the Spain edition has the Spanish version of \\"Love in the Afternoon\\" (titled \\"Amor al Atardecer\\"). A promotional release in the United States has the mono and stereo versions of \\"Guava Jelly\\".  Critical reception  Streisand's version of \\"Guava Jelly\\" divided music critics. A writer for Billboard was enthusiastic of the release, writing, \\"Barbra takes the great Bob Marley reggae cut and commercializes it somewhat, though the flavor is still there. Good soulful backup and reggae type organ help make this an almost certain bet for heavy top 40 play\\". Author Derek Winnert referred to Streisand's version as a \\"success\\" in his 1996 book Barbra Streisand. However, an editor for Boating disliked Streisand's version and urged the public to \\"ignore\\" it, joking that it \\"does not belong in [...] our stateroom\\". A reviewer from Broadcasting disliked everything about her version, stating, \\"The Streisand voice and name alone might be enough to make a hit out of any of her single releases, but with the first single from her best-selling ButterFly album, the singer is taking no chances.\\" Years after its initial release, Streisand took to Larry King Live in 1991 and announced her displeasure with ButterFly and the songs on it. Biographer Tom Santopietro wrote that \\"Guava Jelly\\" and album track \\"Grandma's Hands\\" were among the bad songs on the album. He also stated that \\"Broadway divas do not take naturally to singing 'Ooh baby, here I am. Come rub it on my belly like guava jelly'\\". In agreement, writer Shaun Considine claimed that one unknown critic in particular panned the track, stating \\"Streisand was not born to sing reggae\\", while another joked that he/she had \\"no comment\\" to make in response to the release. Ben Gerson, writing for Rolling Stone, found the singer to be \\"unconvincingly animal\\" throughout her rendition. He continued, \\"Being beautiful, romantic and desirable have not come to her so effortlessly that she can easily throw them over for the sake a little authentic, malodorous sweat.\\"  Track listings  ;United States 7\\" single * A1 \\"Guava Jelly\\" - 2:55 * B1 \\"Love in the Afternoon\\" - 4:06 ;United States promotional 7\\" single * A1 \\"Guava Jelly\\" (Stereo) - 2:55 * B1 \\"Guava Jelly\\" (Mono) - 2:55 ;Netherlands 7\\" single * A1 \\"Guava Jelly\\" - 3:19 * B1 \\"Life on Mars\\" - 3:13 ;Spain 7\\" single * A1 \\"Guava Jelly\\" - 2:55 * B1 \\"Amor al Atardecer\\" - 4:06  References   Citations   Bibliography       External links  * 1971 singles 1971 songs 1972 singles 1974 singles Barbra Streisand songs Bob Marley songs Johnny Nash songs Songs about sexuality ","title":"Guava Jelly (song)"},{"id":"52814277","text":"William Shuttleworth (1834 ‚Äì March 3, 1903) was a Canadian baseball player and executive. He helped to develop the Young Canadians of Hamilton, the first known organized Canadian baseball team, in 1854, and was the club's president by 1860. Shuttleworth held the same role for the Maple Leaf club, and was vice-president of the Canadian Base Ball Association. Along with his executive roles and an extended playing career, he was an umpire in the 1860s. Shuttleworth has been inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Biography Early life and Young Canadians Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame list Shuttleworth's birth year as 1834, and the latter states that Brantford, Ontario was his birthplace. He was raised there,Humber, p. 105. and in 1851 he resided in Hamilton. His brother James, a shoemaker, lived in the same city during at least part of the 1850s.Humber, pp. 106‚Äì107. A version of a \\"baseball-type game\\" was played in Canada as early as 1838.Marsh, p. 199. Baseball later became popular in the Southern Ontario region.Jensen, p. 329.

In April 1854, the first known organized baseball club in Canada was formed. The team was the Young Canadians of Hamilton, and was one of several started in the 1850s in Ontario. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, Shuttleworth \\"was instrumental in its development.\\"Marsh, pp. 199‚Äì200. The team included men who worked various jobs in Hamilton, including clerks, Shuttleworth's profession. Early games in Ontario were primarily played under Massachusetts rules, with what author Brian Martin calls \\"some Canadian wrinkles.\\"Martin, chapter \\"Roots\\". There were typically 11 players per team in these games, with the overhand pitching style allowed, a change from New York rules of the time. In addition, an entire playing roster had to make outs before a team lost its turn at bat in an inning. On May 24, 1859, the Young Canadians played a game against another club from Hamilton, Young America, under New York rules, which mandated nine-person teams. Shuttleworth did not play, and was resistant to changes from the style of play that had prevailed in Canada.Humber, pp. 109‚Äì110. In 1860, Shuttleworth became the president of the Young Canadians. The club participated in two of the earliest international baseball contests in 1860. Their opponent in both games was Buffalo, New York's Niagaras; a team from that city had previously played against another club from Hamilton, the Burlingtons. The Young Canadians team lost 87‚Äì13 in the first game and 45‚Äì13 in the second.Humber, p. 112. When playing for his club, Shuttleworth was a catcher and served as the leadoff hitter. Maple Leaf Another Hamilton-based team was founded in 1861, called \\"Maple Leaf\\"; Humber considers it a probable successor to the Young Canadians. In one July 30 game against fellow Hamilton club Burlington, Shuttleworth played at the catcher position, receiving praise for his play. Just over a month later, Maple Leaf faced the Young Canadians of Woodstock, a team that included James Shuttleworth, who was also director for the club. His team defeated William Shuttleworth's Maple Leaf 24‚Äì22 after scoring three runs in the ninth inning.Humber, pp. 112‚Äì113. Shuttleworth married Matilda White in 1862. By that time, he had been named president of the Maple Leaf club, which played three further games against the Woodstock side between 1862 and 1864, losing each time. The Canadian Base Ball Association was founded in 1864, with Shuttleworth as its first vice-president;Humber, p. 114. By 1865, Shuttleworth was joined by his brother James on Maple Leaf, and won a vote to remain the team's president. In one June 1865 game against West Flamboro, he scored six runs and was described as \\"particularly agile on the occasion\\" as Maple Leaf won 34‚Äì11.Humber, p. 115. The Shuttleworth brothers each played in the club's victories against Maple Leaf of Guelph, Niagara, the Newcastle Beaver, and Ingorsoll before a game with the Woodstock team was called off because of a dispute over which baseball to use. In 1866, the start of Maple Leaf's season was delayed, as Shuttleworth and at least two other players had joined the Thirteenth Battalion and were defending Hamilton during the Fenian raids. On August 9, he was injured during a game against the Beaver and had to leave an eventual 75‚Äì44 loss in the third inning. He returned to the team by mid- August, scoring three runs in a win against Ingersoll.Humber, pp. 115‚Äì118. In 1867, Shuttleworth served as a Color-Sargeant in the Thirteenth Battalion, and participated in the World's Base Ball Tournament, an event in Detroit attended by over 20 teams. Maple Leaf placed third and was awarded a gold-plated ball as a trophy.Humber, p. 118. In addition to his duties with Young Canadians/Maple Leaf, Shuttleworth worked as an umpire in some 1860s games. One of these was the 1868 Canadian baseball championship game between the Young Canadians of Woodstock and Maple Leaf of Guelph. Behind a 12-run third inning, the Young Canadians prevailed to claim the title. In 1869, he continued to play for Maple Leaf; James Shuttleworth died that year. William remained president of Maple Leaf in 1870 and 1871, although there are no known records of him playing by this time.Humber, pp. 121‚Äì122. He did take part in an 1875 \\"old-timers\\" game in Hamilton, likely the first such contest in Canada. Later life Shuttleworth is not listed as an executive for the 1872 season. By this time, he and Matilda had four children, a fifth was born in 1874, before Matilda died on October 7, 1881. In the mid-1880s, Shuttleworth lived in a boarding house; at one point, he was employed by furniture maker James Reid. He moved to the United States in 1893 and resided in Geneva, New York; he worked as an upholsterer according to the 1900 U.S. Census.Humber, pp. 122‚Äì123. Shuttleworth died in Geneva on March 3, 1903; his body was buried in Hamilton. Legacy A summary of Shuttleworth's activities appeared in 1923's Herald Scrapbook; it asked, \\"Do the baseball enthusiasts of 1923 ever talk of/about Billy Shuttleworth?\\"Humber, pp. 123‚Äì124. His contribution to baseball in Canada was not recalled for many years afterward. The Hamilton Spectator's Steve Milton attributed this to a quick decline in Hamilton baseball, as the city's clubs were overtaken by western Canadian teams. In 1979, historian Bill Hutton found his name inside a book on Canadian labour and searched for further information; he later said, \\"I think at first people thought I made him up.\\" Canada's Sports Hall of Fame inducted Shuttleworth in 2015, as part of a one-time \\"Sports Legends Class\\" for pre-1955 figures honoured for the Hall's 60th anniversary. The following year, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame selected him for induction. In 2016, Shuttleworth became a member of the Hamilton Sports Hall of Fame. Shuttleworth has received recognition as the \\"Father of Canadian Baseball\\"; the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame considers him \\"a driving force behind the sport in Canada.\\" Humber credits Shuttleworth for \\"taking the game from its informal roots and formalizing it into an organized sport for young men with a team structure and eventually a well-developed network of teams\\" in the Hamilton area.Humber, p. 124.

During the Muromachi period, Koga was the seat of the Kant≈ç kub≈ç, under the Ashikaga clan. At the end of the Edo period, Koga Castle was the administrative center of Koga Domain, which was held by a large number of fudai daimy≈ç clans, spending the longest time under the control of the Doi clan (1633-1681, 1762-1871).  History  The fortification at Koga may date to the late Heian period or early Kamakura period, and the Azuma Kagami refers to a fortification in Koga built by Shimokobe Yukihira before 1180, although it is not certain if it was in this location. After the Battle of Uji (1180), the head of Minamoto Yorimasa was brought to Koga by the Shomokobe clan. A Shinto shrine to Minamoto Yorimasa still exists at the present Koga Castle site. In 1455, the Kant≈ç kub≈ç Ashikaga Shigeuji relocated his seat from Kamakura to Koga. His descendants ruled to 1583, when the castle was taken by the Later H≈çj≈ç clan, in the same year Ashikaga Ujinohime took the title Koga kub≈ç. The area was awarded to Tokugawa Ieyasu after the defeat of the H≈çj≈ç at the Siege of Odawara (1590) and subsequently became the center of Koga Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. During the Edo period, much of the castle remained as reconstructed by Doi Toshikatsu in 1633. Following the Meiji restoration, the structures of the castle were dismantled in 1873. Due to changes in the flow of the Watarase River and flood control work from 1910, almost nothing remains of the castle today.  Description  Plan of Koga Castle Koga Castle was a flatland-style castle built on a long, narrow peninsula in the middle of the Watarase River, with the river itself and wetlands to the east and south forming part of its natural defences. The central bailey Honmaru (Êú¨‰∏∏) had three-story donjon with a similar size and style as the donjon at Matsue Castle, which was officially styled as a yagura. The Honmaru was protected by the Ni-no-Maru (‰∫å„ÅÆ‰∏∏) to the west and the San-no- Maru (‰∏â„ÅÆ‰∏∏) to the north. Further north were two large forecourts: the Marunouchi Kuruwa ( ‰∏∏„ÅÆÂÜÖÊõ≤Ëº™ ) and Kannonji Kuruwa ( Ë¶≥Èü≥ÂØ∫Êõ≤Ëº™ ) and to the east as the long and narrow Higashiobi Kuruwa ( Êù±Â∏ØÊõ≤Ëº™), and in the south the Yorimasa Kuruwa ( È†ºÊîøÊõ≤Ëº™) and the Tatsuzaki Kuruwa ( Ëæ∞Â¥éÊõ≤Ëº™ ). An additional forecourt, the Suwa Kuruwa (Ë´èË®™Ëº™ ) occupied a small area on the opposite bank of the river. Remaining today are the Yorimasa Jinja shrine on the site of the Yorimasa Kuruwa, and the Koga History Museum on the site of the Suwa Kuruwa, which preserves a fragment of the original moat.

Early life  Richard Lucae came from an old Berlin pharmacy family. His father was Dr. Phil. h.c. August Friedrich Theodor Lucae (1800 ‚Äì 1848), pharmacist and owner of the . His mother was Caroline Lucae, born Wendel (1803 ‚Äì 1870), daughter of Johann Georg Wendel (1754 ‚Äì 1834), a professor of drawing arts at the Gymnasium in Erfurt. One of Richard's siblings was noted otologist Dr. August Lucae. Richard's early diverse artistic inclinations were greatly influenced by his uncle, August Soller, a Prussian government construction officer and an important architect of the Schinkel school. retrieved 11 Jan 2017.  Education  Lucae received training as a surveyor 1847‚Äì49. In 1850 he began studies in plasterwork at the () at the instigation of Johann Gottfried Schadow. He could not pass the entrance examination, so Schadow asked him to simply paint a human ear from memory. When Lucae was able to do it with ease, Schadow admitted him to the class contrary to all the rules.Fontane, Theodor (1882): \\"Saalow, ein Kapitel vom alten Schadow\\" in Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg IV: Spreeland. Berlin: Hofenberg (reprinted 2016). . Lucae completed his studies in 1852 and then received practical experience in the construction of Cologne Cathedral from 1853 to 1855. He then returned to the for advanced studies (1855‚Äì1859), taught there from 1859 onward, joined the academic committee in 1863, and in 1873 became its Director.  Career  Church of the Resurrection, Katowice Richard Lucae's first complete work is the Church of the Resurrection at Kattowitz, in the Prussian Province of Silesia. Built in cooperation with architect Friedrich August St√ºler, the foundation stone was laid on July 17, 1856. The hall building was completed in , the then popular German Neo- Renaissance architectural style. Apart from a Romanesque Revival and Art Nouveau transept added in 1900, the core of the building is Lucae's, including the main tower, the apse, part of the nave, the fa√ßade, and the rose window.  Residential buildings  Villa Joachim, Berlin After a study journey to Italy in 1859, Lucae was at first unable to find work in Berlin. All public building was tightly controlled by the Prussian government. He therefore started his own architectural business and focused on private residential buildings, such as Villa Kamel (1860) and Villa Siemens (1874-76). He then began work on the monumental Borsig Palace (1875‚Äì77), completed for industrialist Albert Borsig, one of the grandest Italianate villas ever built in GermanyKolinsky, Eva and Van der Will, Wilfried (1998): The Cambridge Companion to Modern German Culture. Cambridge University Press. . p. 283 Its walls, enlivened with sculpted window aediculae, also marked a new period in Berlin's architectural history.  Public buildings  Alte Oper, Frankfurt Technical University, Berlin Richard Lucae's residential work solidified his reputation and brought him into contact with prominent industrialists of the period. He went on to win design competitions for large public projects in 1873, including the Magdeburg Stadttheater (built 1873‚Äì76) and the Alte Oper in Frankfurt am Main (built 1873‚Äì1888). The floor plan of the Opera was influenced by the style of Gottfried Semper and the panther quadriga on the Renaissance-style building recalls the famous Semper Opera House in Dresden.\\"Chronik und Historie\\" (in German). Alte Oper Frankfurt, 2017, retrieved 13 Jan 2017. In 1874 Lucae began plans for the complete reconstruction of the interiors of the Bauakademie itself, which were complete in 1875. In 1876 the new German government initiated plans to create theK√∂niglich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg (Royal Technical University Charlottenburg) in a merger of the and the (Royal Trade Academy). Richard Lucae was called upon to design the new main building for the university, at that time the largest construction project in Berlin. He completed the grand Neo-Renaissance plans shortly before his death, with architect Friedrich Hitzig and master builder Julius Raschdorff making alterations during execution of the project. The new university opened in 1879.Dorling Kindersley Ltd (2016): DK Eyewitness Travel Guide Berlin New York: DK Publishing. p. 159 .  Other work  Lucae was a prolific lecturer and writer. He became a critic of the existing architectural styles and deplored housing of the era for its lack of natural lighting, ventilation, and functionality.Mallgrave, H.F. (2009): Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673--1968. Cambridge University Press. p 178 In particular he was fascinated by the new iron and glass buildings exemplified by the Crystal Palace. In contrast to conservative architects of the day, Lucae embraced this technology as a new way of defining architectural space.Lucae, pp. 265-306 By 1877 he was also serving as a Privy Councillor in the Prussian government's Technical Construction Department and was a member of both the Prussian Academy of Arts () and the Art Association (). He was friends with Theodor Fontane and F. Kugler through his membership in the literary club , which influenced literary life in Berlin for more than seventy years.NDB, p. 269 One of Lucae's students at the Bauakademie was Alfred Messel, who became one of the most well-known German architects at the turn of the 20th centuryBedoire, p. 254 He created new architectural style which bridged the transition from historicism to modernism, reflected in his designs for such buildings as the Pergamon Museum and Wertheim department store.Blauert Legacy Several of Richard Lucae's buildings went on to lead interesting lives in the history of Germany. Many were subsequently damaged or destroyed during World War II, with a few repaired or restored. His most notable buildings and their current status include: Alte Oper and the Lucae Fountain, Frankfurt, destroyed in 1944 and rebuilt in 1981. Full-sized canvas model of the Bauakademie in 2013.

The building was burnt to a shell during the bombing of Frankfurt on the night of March 23, 1944. In 1952 interim measures were taken to prevent the ruin from collapsing entirely. There were plans to demolish it and build an office block, but a citizen's initiative began in 1953 to save what became known as \\"the most beautiful ruin in Germany.\\"Pond, Elizabeth. \\"Frankfurt reopens opera house - 'the most beautiful ruin in Germany'\\" (in English).The Christian Science Monitor. 1 Sep 1981, retrieved 13 Jan 2017.

In 2004 the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation sponsored the construction of simulated canvas fa√ßade of the original Bauakademie to give an impression of its volume and form.

One year later, dramatic scenes relating to the Night of the Long Knives played out in its rooms. The building became the new headquarters for the SA (Sturmabteilung) and in 1938 it was incorporated into Adolf Hitler's New Reich Chancellery by Albert Speer.

Constructed in the 13th century, the dike continues to protect an area inhabited by 3 million people from flooding by the North Sea. History Dubbeltje op zijn kant, a monument commemorating the North Sea flood of 1953 Schielands Hoge Zeedijk was constructed in the 13th century by order of Adelaide of Holland, a noble woman who was regent of Holland while her nephew, Floris V, Count of Holland, was a minor. The Schielands Hoge Zeedijk never really collapsed, though the All Saints' Flood of 1570 indicated its weakness. In 1574 it was deliberately cut through in sixteen places during the Siege of Leiden. On 1 February 1953, during the North Sea Flood of 1953, the dike almost collapsed between Capelle aan den IJssel and Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel; the hole was filled by sailing a ship into the dike, an event commemorated by the monument Dubbeltje op zijn kant (\\"dime on its edge\\", a Dutch proverb indicating a dramatic event nearly happened).

Nowadays the dike ends at the Julianasluis near Gouda; from 1856 till 1936 the dike ended at an upstream lock called Waaiersluis.

He states that the name is a compound shortened from skinst√∏de-√•, with the second element aa or √• meaning 'river'.Rygh, Oluf. 1905. Norske Gaardnavne, vol. 11. Kristiania: Fabritius. Locally, the place is referred to as Sj√∏nst√•g, Skj√∏nst√•ga, and Sj√∏nstaa. Over time, the name has been written in many different ways in public documents.Berg, Gunnar. 1990. Sj√∏nst√• ‚Äì en matrikkelg√•rd som forsvant. Fauskeboka 1990. Fauske: Fauske Kulturstyre. History The Sj√∏nst√• farm The Sj√∏nst√• farm appeared in historical sources for the first time in a rent roll from 1665 under the name S√ºinstad, listing a tenant named Baard Peders√∏n. The farm was not included in the land committee's register of 1661, nor in the tithe list compiled between 1663 and 1665, and so it is likely that the farm was established in 1665. The property register one year later listed two tenant farmers at Sj√∏nst√•: the previously named Baard Peders√∏n and Guttorm Peders√∏n. It is possible that the two were brothers. The register states that the farm had recently been cleared on crown common land and that it would pay the highest rate in tax, which was ¬Ω v√•g () of stockfish as a public levy. The annual tithe to the church was ¬æ t√∏nne () of grain and 16 marks () of cheese. Furthermore, the land rent (landskylden; i.e., the rent that a tenant or leaseholder had to provide to the owner of the farm, which in this case was the king) was set at one v√•g () of stockfish. The high taxes may indicate that Sj√∏nst√• was a deserted farm after the Black Death in the Middle Ages. However, no archaeological finds from the Middle Ages have been discovered, and some have suggested that the Sj√∏nst√• farm, like other farms around √òvervatnet, was newly cleared in the second half of the 1600s. The residents of the farm settled on the lowest terrace at the outflow of the Sj√∏nst√• River, and they had meadows and fields on the other terrace levels. The soil was light and good, a mixture of sand and humus. The property register of 1666 states that the two properties at the site were seeded with one t√∏nne of grain and the livestock consisted of one horse, eight cows, one head of young cattle, seven sheep, and four goats. A description from 1820 stated: \\"The soil is sandy. The grain harvest is fairly safe. The harbor entrance is deep. ... The forest provides the farm with the necessary fuel and something to sell. The farm is subject to flooding.\\" There have been some increases in production since the farm was first referred to, but they have not been great. Life was often difficult at the location, and the steep hillsides and precipitous mountains formed natural boundaries that prevented expansion. The Sj√∏nst√• farm was royal property, and its owners were tenants of the state. In 1800 the farm was divided into two equally sized portions and sold. The first farm was called Nerg√•rd ('lower farm'), and the skipper and landowner Christen Ellingsen from the inner Leivset farm in Fauske obtained the deed in 1801. Neither he nor the subsequent owners ever stayed on the farm, but instead leased it to crofters. This farm was sold to Sulitjelma Mines in 1891. The second farm was called √òverg√•rd ('upper farm'), and it was sold to Sulitjelma Mines at the same time as Nerg√•rd. After the farms had been sold, lease agreements were established with the mining company; farming continued at Nerg√•rd until 1956, and the bachelor Andor Karolius Hansen lived at √òverg√•rd until his death in 1973. The waterway was a natural thoroughfare for those that lived at Sj√∏nst√•, and fishing was an important source of livelihood in addition to agriculture, just as was common for people along Skjerstad Fjord. The farm made use of the sea with fishing equipment and boats both Sj√∏nst√• and Finneid, and a half share in a fisherman's shack in Skrova. The fact that people at Sj√∏nst√• also had connections with the larger world is shown by a few of the inhabitants of Sj√∏nst√• listed with debt to Bergen merchants at Bryggen in the early 1800s. Sj√∏nst√• was thus not a farm cut off from the world, but participated in the rest of society at the time.Tove Mette M√¶land . Sj√∏nst√• G√•rd. Digitalt fortalt. Sj√∏nst√• as a station on the Sulitjelma Line In 1892 the Sulitjelma Line was built between Sj√∏nst√• and Fossen. The ore from the mining operations was transported by boat across Langvatnet (Long Lake) from Sulitjelma to Fossen, and then by rail from Fossen to Sj√∏nst√• to be taken by boat via √òvervatnet (Upper Lake) and Nedrevatnet (Lower Lake), so that it could be sent by ship from Finneid along Skjerstad Fjord. In 1956 the rail line was extended to Finneid and the transshipment activity at the Sj√∏nst√• station came to an end. As a junction, Sj√∏nst√• was a location with key personnel for the railroad and boats. Several community associations were soon started, such as a lodge, a shooting club, and a sports clubs (the Sj√∏nst√• sports club was founded in 1916).Enge, K√•re. 1980.

The inner farm consists of four houses and four elevated granaries (stabbur). The outer farm consists of a cowshed, storehouse, barn, woodshed, and stall. The buildings have remained unchanged since the 1800s and have a village-like feel. In 2006, the Sj√∏nst√• farm was given protected status by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.

At the age of 16 she began keeping a diary, which she continued writing well into adulthood. Her father died in 1894, and a year later she married William John Boyd, with whom she moved to Brooklyn; they kept the cottage which her father had willed her in Sag Harbor and used it as a summer home. Their son William was born in 1898, and their daughter Nancy followed three years later. She took lessons from the sisters Henrietta and Virginia Granbery in New York City, and they later visited her in Sag Harbor. She also spent time at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art run by William Merritt Chase, where her teacher was most likely Charles Elmer Langley. Eventually she and her husband returned full-time to live in the cottage in Sag Harbor, where she opened and operated the Herald House Tea Room.

It was known by different names for much of its existence but most of its designations included \\"Neva Infantry Regiment.\\" It served in several conflicts, including the Great Northern War, Seven Years' War, the Russo- Swedish War of 1808‚Äì1809, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78, and the Russo‚ÄìJapanese War. By 1914, the 1st Neva Infantry Regiment was part of the 1st Infantry Division, and it fought in World War I before being dissolved in 1918, after the events of Russian Revolution.  Organization  The unit was first formed in Saint Petersburg on 21 July 1706 as the \\"Kulikov Infantry Regiment\\" by order of Russian Emperor Peter the Great. On 10 April 1708 it was renamed \\"Neva Regiment\\" and in 1711 it became the \\"Neva Infantry Regiment\\". On 16 August 1712 its surviving members were merged into another regiment after sustaining heavy losses during the Great Northern War (the regiment would later be disbanded in 1731). On 15 July 1713 a new Neva Regiment was created, named after the original. In 1727 it was briefly designated as the \\"2nd Vladimir Infantry Regiment\\" before being renamed \\"Neva\\" again. It was reformed in 1731 and a decade later its total strength was 1,557 men. By 1753 the regiment's battalions each consisted of one grenadier and four fusilier companies, for a total strength of 2,859 men. In the mid-1750s two of its grenadier companies were reassigned to form other units. In 1762 the Neva Regiment was reformed and came to consist of 3 fusilier battalions, each of which included one grenadier and four fusilier companies. The following year it gained two new battalions, and its official strength was listed as 2,092 men during wartime and 1,880 during peacetime. On 29 November 1796 it was renamed \\"Neva Musketeer Regiment\\". On 31 October 1798 it was renamed \\"1st Lieutenant General Duke Volkonsky's Musketeer Regiment\\" and later \\"Lieutenant General Duke Gorchakov's\\" on 26 January 1800. In 1800 its numerical designation was changed to 2nd before being renamed \\"Neva Musketeer Regiment\\" on 31 March 1801. In 1811 it was renamed \\"Neva Infantry Regimen\\"t. In January 1833 the 1st naval battalion was added to the unit, and it was later renamed the \\"Neva Naval Regiment\\". In 1846 it became the \\"His Majesty King of Naples Regiment\\" before being changed back to \\"Neva Infantry Regiment\\" the following year. In April 1863 it lost three battalions which were reassigned to form the new \\"Neva Reserve Infantry Regiment\\". It was in 1867 that it first gained the name of \\"1st His Majesty King of the Hellenes' Infantry Regiment\\". In 1913 it was renamed \\"1st Neva Infantry Regiment\\". Part of the unit was transferred to form the new 221st Roslavl Infantry Regiment in August 1914, and the unit was disbanded in 1918.  Combat chronicle  The regiment saw its first action during the Great Northern War, fighting in the Battle of Poltava (1709), Battle of Vyborg Bay (1711), and during a naval battle that resulted in the capture of four frigates (1719). From 1716 to 1717 it took part in a 20-month march through Prussia to the shores of Sweden. The Neva Regiment took heavy losses during the conflict. In 1760, during the Seven Years' War, the regiment was decorated for taking part in the raid on Berlin. It might also have taken part in the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74) and the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì90). In 1812 it took part in fighting the French invasion of Russia and until 1815 the regiment was fighting abroad, including at the Battle of Leipzig. The Neva Infantry Regiment later took part in crushing the January Uprising in Russian Congress Poland. It later fought in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78, during which the regiment's 1st battalion earned a decoration for distinguished service in battle. In 1905 the unit was deployed to Manchuria to fight in the Russo‚ÄìJapanese War, but the conflict ended by the time they arrived in Harbin. Between 1907‚Äì08 the regiment took part in putting down revolutionary unrest in Voronezh. During that time all men of the unit received a marking which stated \\"For Accomplishment in the Turkish War of 1877 and 1878.\\" During World War I the 1st Neva Infantry Regiment participated in the East Prussian Operation, including the Battle of Tannenberg, in 1914 and was part of the 1st Infantry Division. It saw action as part of 2nd Army, 10th Army, 5th Army, and 12th Army; on the Northwestern Front and the Northern Front. It was dissolved by the Bolsheviks in 1918 and some of its members fought for the White movement in the Russian Civil War.Russian Army at the Battle of Tannenberg  Rank insignia   Officers  { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background- color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 12px 12px 12px 12px;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" !Label colspan=9Regimental rank insignia of the 1st Neva Infantry Regiment as of 1911 - align=\\"center\\" ! ! rowspan=3  67px ! rowspan=3  67px ! rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px - align=\\"center\\" ! rowspan=1 Shoulder board - align=\\"center\\" ! - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"background:#ff8800; color:black;\\" Rank designation  Polkovnik (en: colonel)  Podpolkovnik (lieutenant colonel)  Mayor (major)  Kapitan (captain)  Stabs-kapitan  Poruchik  Podporuchik  Praporshchik - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#cfcfcf;\\"  Rrank group !colspan=4 Shtab- ofitsery (en: staff officers) !colspan=4 Ober-ofitsery (en: upper, superior, or higher officers) }  NCOs and enlisted  { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:95%; margin: 12px 12px 12px 12px;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" !Label colspan=9Regimental rank insignia of the 1st Neva Infantry Regiment as of 1911 - align=\\"center\\" ! ! rowspan=3  67px ! rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px  rowspan=3  67px - align=\\"center\\" ! rowspan=1 Shoulder board - align=\\"center\\" ! - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"background:#ff8800; color:black;\\" Rank designation  Zauryad-praporshchik  Podpraporshchik  Feldfebel  Starshy unter-–æfitser (en: senior NCO)  –úladshy unter-–æfitser (en: junior NCO)  Yefeytor (en: Private first class)  Ryadovoy (en: Private) - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:#cfcfcf;\\"  Rank group !colspan=5 Unter-ofitsery (en: Non-commissioned officers) !colspan=2 Ryadovye (en: enlisted men) }  See also  *List of Imperial Russian Army formations and units  References  Infantry regiments of the Russian Empire Smolensk Governorate Military units and formations established in 1706 Military units and formations disestablished in 1918 ","title":"1st Neva Infantry Regiment"},{"id":"52815258","text":"The Union County Jail, also known as Old Union County Jail, in Blairsville, Georgia was built in 1934, a block away from Union County's historic courthouse.

Alfred Metters (c. 1863 ‚Äì 1 March 1918) was an Australian Baptist minister, remembered for his chaplaincy in South Australia during World War I. History Alfred Metters was born in Melbourne, the youngest child of James Metters (c. 1821 ‚Äì 2 October 1881), a bricklayer from Cornwall and his wife Susan Metters, n√©e Flux (c. 1824 ‚Äì 4 July 1875), from the Isle of Wight, who arrived in Victoria some time before December 1854. His brothers Charles Henry Metters (c. 1853‚Äì1929), John Thomas Metters (c. 1853‚Äì1924) and Frederick Metters (1858‚Äì1937) were ironworkers, founders of the Victorian firm of Metters Bros., oven and stove manufacturers. Sometime before 1880 Frederick left for South Australia, where he was associated with the Norwood Baptist Church and there patented his \\"top fire\\" stove design in 1891 and founded his own business which eventually became Metters Limited. Alfred Metters followed brother Fred to Adelaide on the SS Victorian in February 1883, and is reported as being engaged in commercial affairs of an unidentified nature, but quite likely with his brother. His heart was however in matters religious, as he was soon involved in various Baptist causes. He became Secretary to the Gospel Temperance Mission, and preached the Temperance cause for the Blue Ribbon Army, of which he became president in 1884. He was also closely involved with the YMCA and Band of Hope. In 1885 he began studying for the ministry at Union College, and in 1888 he began his ministry as pastor at Goodwood Baptist Church. In 1889 he became manager of Truth and Progress, the Baptist newsletter. In 1890 he and Rev. E. J. Henderson, pastor of the Baptist church at Laura, South Australia exchanged pulpits. In February 1892 he relinquished the pastorate of Laura and Appila for Jamestown, Georgetown and Cloverhill, which he resigned in November that year, and took over the Hill Street Baptist Church at Kapunda. He resigned that post and returned to Goodwood early in 1886. His next posting was in late 1898 to Mount Barker, but was suffering ill health, and resigned in May 1900 rather than face another cold winter in the hills, and was given a short-term posting at Magill. While in Mount Barker, he founded a Berean association. In May 1901 he accepted a call to Katanning, Western Australia, and in 1902 was appointed Superintendent of Baptist Home Missions and Vice-president of the Baptist Union of WA. He transferred to Fremantle in December 1902, being succeeded by Rev. A. A. Medley, and shortly after was elected Secretary of the Baptist Union of Western Australia, while retaining the vice-presidency, followed by the presidency in November. His health suffered however, and in March 1904 he returned to South Australia. Back in Adelaide, Rev. Metters represented the British and Foreign Bible Society and undertook various preaching roles for the Baptist Church. Around November he returned to Perth, where in April 1905 he was appointed editor of the Day Dawn and Baptist Church Messenger, but spent much of that year in Tasmania, and was appointed minister of the Devonport Baptist Church early in 1906. He left for Sydney in March 1907, where he had been appointed to the Granville and Liverpool churches, experimentally made into one circuit, but relinquished the pastorate a year later. He was recognised as being the instigator in 1906 of Federal Congresses of the Baptist Church in Australia, first held in September 1908. He received a call by the Hindmarsh Baptist Church, which he took up in June 1909. He added the Prospect church to his responsibilities in 1911. While pastor at Hindmarsh its finances improved sufficiently for considerable expansion to be undertaken. In 1912 he relinquished pastorate of Hindmarsh, but continued his association with Prospect. He was a proponent of a referendum for compulsory Bible instruction in State schools, and organizing secretary of the Scriptural Instruction in State Schools League. Writing For many years he conducted (as \\"Cousin Felix\\") the children's page in The Southern Baptist (later renamed The Australian Baptist) Chaplaincy In 1906 while in Tasmania he was appointed Chaplain (4th Class) with the Chaplains' Department of the Australian Military Forces, an appointment that followed him in his subsequent moves. By 1913 he had been elevated to the military rank of Captain, and in 1915 re-graded from Chaplain 4th class to Senior Chaplain, 1st Class (Other Protestant denominations), and promoted to Chaplain-Colonel in 1915. In February 1918 he was admitted to the No. 15 Australian General Hospital, North Adelaide, following a nervous breakdown, and died there a few weeks later.

He has been called the most important Christian writer in Arabic‚Äîor even throughout non-Christian Asia‚Äîduring the 11th century. He is best known for his Chronography, which is an important source for the history of Sassanid Persia. Name He shares the name of the Biblical prophet Elijah (, Eliyahu), whose name meant \\"My God is Jah\\"... The Syriac form of his name was Elƒ´yƒÅ or Elƒ´yƒÅh. In Latin translation, this became Elias. He is usually distinguished as \\"Elijah of Nisibis\\" (; ) from the location of his archbishopric. He is also known by the patronymic (; ),. meaning \\"Elijah, son of Shenna\\", in reference to the place of his birth. Life The valley of the Little Zab in the 19th century. StJacob Cathedral in present-day Nusaybin, Turkey. Elijah was born in Shenna, just south of the Little Zab's confluence with the Tigris (near present-day Al-Zab, Iraq) on 11 February 975. On Sunday, 15September 994, he was ordained as a priest at the monastery of Mar Shem øon by Yohannes, archbishop of Fars and bishop of Shenna. He studied throughout northern Mesopotamia, including Mosul. On Sunday, 15February 1002, he was consecrated bishop of Beth Nuhadra (present- day Dohuk, Iraq) by Yohannan, who had become the Nestorian patriarch in 1000 by appealing directly to the Abbasid governor at Shiraz without regard to the usual election procedures.Bar Hebraeus, Ecclesiastical Chronicle (.Abeloos & al.), ii. 260‚Äì2. On Sunday, 26December 1008, he succeeded Yahballaha as archbishop of Nisibis (present-day Nusaybin, Turkey). From 15‚Äì29 July 1026, he paid a series of visits‚Äîthe \\"Seven Sessions\\"‚Äîto the Abbasid vizier Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi to discuss Christian doctrines and other topics. Additional meetings between the two were held in December 1026 and June 1027. Three letters‚Äîtwo by Elijah and one by the vizier‚Äîare preserved from their correspondence the following year, showing their continuing good relations. He died on 18 July 1046 at Mayyafariqin. Works Chronography Elijah is best known for his Chronography or Chronology (; ), which forms an important source concerning the history of Sassanid Persia. It is divided into two sections, a chronicle modeled after Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History and a treatment of calendars and calendrical calculations. It is exceptional among Syriac chronicles for the large amount of civil history Elijah included among his ecclesiastical notices. The chronicle includes separate lists of the Sassanid dynasty (after the lost 7th-century work of James of Edessa) and the patriarchs of Seleucia (after the lost 5th-century work of Annianus of Alexandria). The popes and other patriarchs are included in the general annals which begin during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius and end with the year 1018. His treatment of calendrical systems has tables for computation of the Syriac and Persian new years and includes several Zoroastrian calendars, along with their feasts and holidays. As seen, many of Elijah's own sources, which he thoroughly documents, have now been lost and his own work is preserved in only a single manuscript,British Library Add. MS 7197. which fortunately includes few omissions. The manuscript is in Syriac, with most paragraphs in the first section followed by an Arabic translation. The Chronography was the last East Syrian text to be written in Syriac. There have been two published editions of the work: * . * . & Book of Sessions Elijah's Book of Sessions or Dialogues () claims to relate his conversations during his seven visits to the Abbasid vizier Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi.. Dedicated to the \\"honorable, believing, elder brother\\" Abu al-  øAla Sa øid ibn Sahl al-Katib, the work is intended as a literary apologetic as much as record of the events of the seven meetings, with its epilogue including the imprimatur of the patriarchal secretary Abu al-Faraj  øAbd Allah ibn at-Tayyib. In order, the chapters cover: * God's unity and trinity * Jesus's incarnation of divine and human natures * Quranic support for considering some forms of Christianity as a monotheistic religion * Logical and miraculous justifications for various Christian doctrines * Elijah's own profession of monotheism * Language and considerations of its importance in theology * Christian perspectives on astrology, Islam, and the soul According to Elijah's account, the vizier asking for the meetings after he had experienced a miraculous cure at the hands of a Christian monk, causing him to reconsider his previous understanding of their faith as polytheistic and unfaithful to God. It is particularly remembered for its statement of Christian monotheism in trinity in its 5th dialogue..

Elijah also composed other theological and scholarly works. He wrote defenses of Nestorianism against both Islam and other Christian denominations and treatises on Syrian canon law, asceticism, and ethics. His guide to \\"rational management\\" of anxiety () is also dedicated to the Abbasid vizier, whom he claims requested such a book during their sessions together. It advocates cultivating a general thankfulness; treatment of general anxiety through the religious virtues of piety, gratitude, chastity, humility, mercy, and repentance; and treatment of specific anxieties through the philosophical virtues of seeking advice, behaving well, and being generous, just, and forgiving. His \\"Letter on the Unity of the Creator and Trinity of His Hypotases\\" () states the arguments for trinitarianism for a curious Islamic judge. His \\"Letter on the Merit of Chastity\\" () attempts to refute Mu øtazilƒ´ al-JƒÅhiz's (. 869) arguments in favor of physical pleasure. He also composed a Syriac grammar and a Syriac‚ÄìArabic dictionary, The Book of the Interpreter (; ).

She was the first woman in the surgery department at Harvard Medical School and the first woman to become a pediatric surgeon in the state of Texas. She founded the pediatric surgery division at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Brooks actively conducted research throughout her career in addition to working as a pediatric surgeon. Brooks received the Horatio Alger Award in 1983. She was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. The Benjy Brooks Foundation for Children was erected in her honor by the parents of one of her patients to continue her legacy. Legislation named after Brooks was passed in Texas in 2018. Early life Brooks was born in Lewisville, Texas. She learned to read before she started school, and as a child, she was known to \\"perform surgery\\" on her sister's dolls. Brooks remembered that her fifth- grade teacher told her mother that Brooks was mentally retarded. \\"I didn't really fit into the sausage mill, to come out a little sausage like everyone else. Unfortunately, that's what our educational system does to children. At times, it takes away their creativeness and the fact that they are different,\\" Brooks explained. Career Nineteen years old when she earned a bachelor's degree at North Texas State Teacher's College, Brooks stayed at the school for another two years to complete a master's degree. She was a high school teacher for four years before she enrolled in medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. She pursued pediatric surgery, completing postgraduate training at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard Medical School and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. While at Harvard Medical School in 1953, Brooks, along with two other physicians, discovered a treatment for jaundice using gamma globulin. Returning to Boston, Brooks practiced there from 1957 to 1960. She was the first woman hired by the Harvard Medical School surgery department. She decided to return to Texas, where she was the third pediatric surgeon and the first woman in the specialty. She operated at Texas Children's Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital and was a faculty member at Baylor College of Medicine. In 1965, Brooks participated in the separation surgery for nine-week-old conjoined twins at Texas Children's Hospital. Although this was the tenth surgery of its type to take place in the United States, it was the first to take place in Houston and Brooks was the only member of the surgical team for this operation who was a woman. In 1973, Brooks became the founding chief of pediatric surgery at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and she held that post for a decade. In the mid-1970s, when Brooks was also the chief of pediatric surgery at Hermann Hospital, there were more than 200 pediatric surgeons in North America, but a small number were female. Brooks once stated that she felt that being a Texan aided in her successful career in the medical field due to the state's history of pioneering women. Brooks held a faculty appointment in leadership and ethics at the University of Texas at Tyler, she established the Bart Brooks Endowed Professorship there in honor of her brother, a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force who was killed in the Korean War. Honors and awards Brooks received outstanding alumni awards from both North Texas State University and the University of Texas Medical Branch. She received the Artist of Life award, given by the International Women's Writing Guild to honor high-achieving women. She received the Horatio Alger Award in 1983. She received this award for her research on birth defects as well as burn treatment. In addition to her research on birth defects and burn treatment, she was also interested in research on spleen repair and hepatitis prevention. In 1985, she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. In 1994, Dr. Brooks was named as one of \\"Houston's Pioneer Women and Today's Leaders.\\" Later life and legacy After retiring from active practice, Brooks continued to volunteer as a surgeon on mission trips in Romania through at least 1996. She died in 1998. Following her death, the Houston Chronicle referred to Dr. Brooks as a \\"strong child advocate\\" because, in addition to the surgeries she performed on children, she also once appeared in court to testify in a case of child abuse. Since 1991, the UT Medical School has given the Benjy Brooks Award to physicians who set good examples for students at the school. The Benjy Brooks Foundation for Children supports pediatric surgical care in Texas. The Benjy Brooks Foundation for Children was originally erected thanks to the parents of a patient she treated. The parents of this patient established this foundation in honor of Brooks to \\"continue her legacy of exceptional surgical care to children.\\" The Benjy Brooks Foundation for Children has led to improvements in the state of Texas with regards to the surgical care children receive. The foundation provides equipment to hospitals and offers grants to aid in the research of diseases affecting children. In 2018, the Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2018 was passed in the state of Texas. This bill provides hospitals that train physicians in pediatrics with financial support with the goal of ensuring children have access to physicians specialized in pediatrics.

Biography  Dr. Dodes received an A.B. from Dartmouth College in 1966, his D.M.S. from Dartmouth in 1966, and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1970. He is a Training and Supervising Analyst Emeritus of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and a retired Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.  Work on addiction  Prior to Dr. Dodes' work, psychological theories about addiction separated them from other common psychological symptoms. Dr. Dodes was first to recognize that addictions are identical to the symptoms we call compulsions, a view that allows for understanding and treating addictions the same way as other compulsive symptoms. In his book The Heart of Addiction and a series of peer-reviewed academic articles, Dodes showed that addiction is a symptom that reflects a need to reverse overwhelming feelings of helplessness. His second book, Breaking Addiction: A 7-Step Handbook for Ending Any Addiction was honored as a Library Journal Best Book in its category. In The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry, Dodes and his co- author reviewed 50 years of research and reported that most people who have experienced Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) have not achieved long-term sobriety, and only five to eight percent of the people who go to one or more AA meetings achieve sobriety for longer than one year. Gabrielle Glaser used Dodes' figures to state that AA has a low success rate in a 2015 article for The Atlantic, which says that better alternatives than AA for alcohol treatment are available. The 5‚Äì8% figure put forward by Dodes is controversial; Thomas Beresford, M.D., says that the book uses \\"three separate, questionable, calculations that arrive at the 5‚Äì8% figure.\\"  Other works  In 2004 Dodes appeared in an episode of Penn & Teller: Bullshit! In 2015 he appeared as an expert in the film \\"The Business of Recovery\\". He contributed an essay to the 2017 book The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.  Honors  In 2001, Dodes was honored by the Division on Addictions at Harvard Medical School for ‚ÄúDistinguished Contribution‚Äù to the study and treatment of addictive behavior. In 2009, Dodes was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry. Dodes was awarded an Author Prize by Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing for being in the top 5% of authors in 2011 and has remained in the top 5% through 2018 (the last year for which there are figures).
