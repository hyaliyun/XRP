History The station began life as Pennine Radio which was part of the Yorkshire Radio Network, but when it split its AM and FM frequencies, the medium wave licence became Classic Gold. Following a take over it was then relaunched as Great Yorkshire Radio, and then Great Yorkshire Gold. However, in 1997 promotional trailers began running across all three stations in the network saying that they would be soon converting to become Magic, despite the fact that this would not be the case in West Yorkshire, where negotiations were underway to take GWR's Classic Gold service. Unhappy with the confusion, bosses in Bradford decided to create an emergency local service, hence the name 1278 and 1530 AM West Yorkshire which ran for a short period until Classic Gold started. The station later became West Yorkshire's Big AM, Pennine's Big AM, West Yorkshire's Classic Gold, Pulse Classic Gold and Pulse 2.

The Bhaga River (a tributary of the Chandrabhaga or Chenab) originates from Surya taal. The other major tributary of the Chandrabhaga, the Chandra originates from the glacier close to the Chandra Taal lake in the Spiti district. Access Suraj Tal is from Keylong, the district headquarters of the Lahaul Spiti district, a frontier district of India which is approachable by road by the National Highway NH 21, also known as the Leh-Manali Highway. The NH 21 is the vital road link for the people living in the Lahaul Spiti district. The road skirts the Suraj Tal and is just short of the Bara-lacha-la pass.Training Report on Feasibility Study of Existing Manali-Darcha Highway and Proposed Darcha-Padam Road Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques (pages 11-13) It is sometimes falsely claimed to be the highest mountain road in the world (probably the true highest road is the Semo La in Tibet) but it remains inaccessible from Rohtang Pass to Leh during winter months of November to April since the pass becomes totally snowbound during this period.Lahaul and Spiti District Physical description Terrain A glimpse of approaching Suraj Tal The lake is fed from the glaciers and torrential nullahs (streams) originating from the Bara- lacha-la pass, which is long and is also called the \\"Pass with crossroads on summit\\" since roads from Zanskar, Ladakh, Spiti and Lahaul meet at this pass. In addition to the Suraj Tal and the Bhaga River that originates from it, Bara-lacha-la Pass is also the source of the Chandra and Yunan Rivers in the northwest and north, respectively. The lake is situated in the Upper Himalayan Zone or High Latitudinal Zone part of the Himalayas which has very sparse population with climatic conditions akin to polar conditions. Snowfall in this zone, though scanty, is reported to be spread all round the year. Rainfall precipitation is rare in the region. Snow precipitation from snow storms is reported to be less than of snow in nearly 50% of the storms, even though one observatory in the region has reported of snow fall. The precipitation starts melting from May. Snow on slopes is generally slackly bonded, with wind redistributing it. The average total snowfall recorded in a year is reported to be - with temperatures of Highest Max. , Mean Max.,Mean Minimum minus and Lowest Minimum of minus . The ground in the zone is covered with scree and boulders. Geology The Lake's geology is represented by the Bara-lacha-la Pass, which is reported to be an early rifting event on the northern Indian passive margin and that the Basalts which are emplaced along the trans- tensional faults indicate that. Bhaga Valley Small Deepak Lake en route to Suraj Tal The Bhaga Valley (Tod or Stod Valley) formed from Suraj Tal up to Tandi, the confluence point with Chandra River, is long. The valley, which is a narrow gorge, is devoid of any vegetation up to Darcha and thereafter it widens up to its confluence with Chandra River at Tandi with terraces between Darcha and Tandi which are under cultivation in the lower slopes, with the middle slopes having grasslands. Plantation of trees and shrubs to meet fuel wood and fodder requirements have been done on the hill slopes.Indian Himalayas, Lahaul and Spiti Tourism National Highway skirting the lake on the left Lahaul Spiti valley is common a destination for Indian and foreign tourists for road trips, trekking and motorcycling which cover the Lake and the Bara-lacha-la pass, en route from Manali to Leh.Suraj Tal Trekking Trekking tours are a common feature. One such trek route is the Zingzingbar- Suraj Tal-Bara-lacha-la, which involves trek along the Bhaga River for , cross a bridge to the North bank, then a further climb of from the bridge followed by a steep foot trail up to Suraj Tal.Darcha Baralacha Pass Trek Lahaul Biking tours Motorcycle trips during the season when the area is approachable are undertaken by tourists.

Catabolysis is a biological process in which the body breaks down fat and muscle tissue in order to stay alive. Catabolysis occurs only when there is no longer any source of protein, carbohydrate, or vitamin nourishment feeding all body systems; it is the most severe type of malnutrition.  Mechanism  Due to the normal metabolic rate of humans catabolysis becomes life-threatening only after 1–2 months from the cessation of nutrition going into the body. After this time, the damage to muscles and organs can be permanent and can also eventually cause death, if left untreated. Catabolysis is the last metabolic resort for the body to keep itself — particularly the nervous system—functional. Protein stores, especially in muscle tissue, provide the amino acids needed for the process. Amino acids are released into the blood and converted in the liver to alpha keto acids. Alpha keto acids can then be converted to glucose to maintain proper blood sugar levels. The situation can become dire when one begins to lose muscle mass; this is a sign that the fat has been expended and the body is now metabolizing the muscle tissue. This results in muscle atrophy, a loss of strength and, ultimately, a depletion of muscular tissue completely. Muscle weakness is not necessarily a symptom of catabolysis: the muscles will normally feel fatigued when they are not receiving enough energy or oxygen. Ultimately, catabolysis can progress to the point of no return when the body's machinery for protein synthesis, itself made of protein, has been degraded to the point that it cannot handle any protein. At this point, attempts to correct the disorder by giving food or protein are futile. The body has a natural store of fat (also called adipose tissue) that stores reserve energy. One can still stay alive while the body breaks down the fatty tissue (hence people wasting away from starvation). The person may, during catabolysis, have large amounts of lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the bloodstream, due to the muscle fibers and adipose tissues being broken down and sent to the nervous system and brain. One may also exhibit a fever, since the body is working hard to transfer the nutrients in the muscles and fat to the blood.  Treatment  While catabolysis can be deadly over time, if the person is given medical treatment early enough, the effects of catabolysis can be reversed. However, the person may require intravenous nutrition, a blood transfusion, and/or oxygen replenishment. After that, it may be a few weeks to a few months before the person's muscle mass and fat deposits can build themselves up again; there is a possibility that they may never build back up, depending on the severity of the condition.

It ran from 15 February 1996 to 31 March 1999. It featured many actors who have gone on to star in bigger TV shows, including Bad Girls actresses Simone Lahbib and Mandana Jones and No Angels star Sunetra Sarker. London Bridge revolved around a restaurant, SE1, and the neighbouring block of flats. It started out as a late-night drama which ran for 26 episodes in 1996, before returning as a twice-weekly soap opera later that year. It was not as popular as other British soaps due to only being shown regionally, although did on many occasions beat rival soap Hollyoaks shown on Channel 4. The show was axed in 1999. As of February 2015, the show started a repeat run on local TV channel London Live.  Characters  Major characters included: * Nick Kemp (Oliver Haden), the head chef and part-owner of SE1, a cockney with a violent temper and criminal connections * Isobel 'Bel' Kemp (Nicola King S1/Sally Edwards S2-4), Nick's wife, a middle-class accountant and part-owner of SE1 * Liz Kemp (Rosalind March), Nick's sister and manager of SE1, a sarcastic woman who doesn't suffer fools gladly * Jed Kemp (Sean Francis), Liz's son who works behind the bar at SE1 and drives a mini cab * Mary O'Connor (Simone Lahbib), a resident of the flats who is raped and later has an affair with Nick * Ravi Shah (Ayub Khan-Din), a lawyer and resident of the flats * Sam Haynes (Mandana Jones), Ravi's doctor girlfriend and later wife * Anthony 'Ant' Webster (Charles Simpson), Ravi's landlord and best friend who develops romantic feelings for Sam * Claire Turner (Jo-Anne Stockham), the mother of Ant's daughter Elizabeth * Cliff Lewis (Billy Geraghty), Nick's childhood friend and a chef at SE1 * Sid Kemp (Desmond Jordan), uncle of Nick and Liz * Nancy Parker (Annabel Leventon), Sid's ex-wife and Cliff's mother  Storylines  In its late-night format the show featured a gritty storyline involving newcomer Mary O'Connor (Simone Lahbib) being raped by a stalker. On becoming twice-weekly the soap introduced Cliff Lewis (Billy Geraghty) as Nick's former friend and the link to Nick's mysterious past. It was revealed that Nick and Cliff had been involved in an armed robbery together which had left a man dead. When Nick was murdered by being locked in the fridge at SE1, Cliff was the prime suspect. Cliff eventually told Nick's wife Isobel that he had seen her kill Nick and they embarked on a relationship. Isobel was eventually put on trial for Nick's murder, but was acquitted after the jury heard about the violence Nick had inflicted on her.  Location  Despite the title and ostensibly being set on the South Bank, the series was in fact filmed in and around 3 Mills Studios in Bow, east London (which also features prominently in the titles and end credits).  DVD releases  London Bridge Volume One, featuring the first 13 episodes, was released on DVD by Network on 14 November 2011. Volume Two was due to be released by Network in the summer of 2013, but as of 1 September 2015 it has not yet been released.

The organization was a way to answer the needs of a country in its post-war period of reconstruction. DBFC is a branch of the Salesians of Don Bosco. The United Nations asked to the Salesians in Thailand to attend the children and youth of the Cambodian Refugee camps during the 1980s. DBFC answered this request by opening provisional technical schools in the camps. After the peace agreements, the organization was invited by the Cambodian government to settle in the country. After the war the first printing press in Cambodia was provided by DBFC in the Don Bosco Technical School of Phnom Penh for the republishing, translating and writing of books and documents of education (during the Khmer Rouge Regime books were destroyed). Many schools were rebuilt in the villages and the Organization gained prestige as the first institution to provide technical education and to offer sponsorship to Cambodian children. History The genesis of DBFC started in the Khmer Refugee Camps along the Thai-Cambodian border in the early 80's after the 1979's Vietnamese invasion of the Khmer Rouge Cambodian Regime. The full control of the Khmer refugee camps was taken by the Thai Army that did not allow other foreign organizations to come into the camps for any kind of humanitarian activities. In this issue UN insisted to the Thai government to allow foreign organizations to attend the needs of the Khmer refugees. In 1989 Thailand agreed that the UN could send humanitarian help to refugees and among this was education to children and youth. UN asked the Catholic Church through the Catholic Office for Emergency Relief and Refugees. At its time, the Catholic Church asked the Salesians of Don Bosco in Bangkok to do something in technical education for Cambodian girls and boys of the refugee camps. The Thai Salesians visited the camps allowed by the Thai Army and opened technical centers among the tension of battles in the area. When the war was over and Cambodia had a more independent government, many Cambodian families from the refugee camps returned to their country and the Don Bosco technical centers were necessary anymore. The experience in the camps attracted the attention of the Royal Government of Cambodia that sent a delegation to Thailand to study the works and ways of education of the Salesians of Don Bosco in that country. In this way, the Salesians were invited in 1991 to settle in Cambodia and open educational works for a country completely destroyed by war. The government put under the custody of the Salesians an orphanage and provided land in what is today the Phnom Penh Thmey District, near the Pochenton Airport to build the first technical school that was completed in 1993. The lack of books and didactic material, all destroyed during the long war period, made that the Salesians gave importance to the printing workshops which supplied the first printing press of the country in the post-war period. The success of the first years of technical education provided by Don Bosco led the Cambodian government to give other lands for educational purposes to the Salesians in Battambang and Sihanoukville. At the same time, the Salesian Sisters joined the project in Cambodia by opening vocational training centers in Phnom Penh. As many young boys and girls came to the technical centers with a poor academic background (by 1999 only 30% of children had basic education due to the lack of schools in most part of the country),Cambodia in the Early 21st Century, Media Business Network International, Promo Khmer and the Royal Government of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, 2000, , Statistics of education, page 143. DBFC created the Children Fund with the intention to build schools in villages and support an intensive program of sponsorship for children. A technical school was opened in 1997 in Sihanoukville, a literacy center and children home was opened in Poipet in 2004. Other literacy centers were opened in Battambang for labor children of the brick factories in the intention of freeing them from factory life and providing an opportunity for a normal school situation. On February 12, 2007 His Majesty, Norodom Sihamoni, visited the Don Bosco Technical School in Sihanoukville, opened the Don Bosco Hotel School in that city and thanked DBFC for its presence in the reconstruction of Cambodia.  Development  As an NGO, the DBFC is a project with assignment agreement to the Cambodia Ministries.Cfr. Description of Agreements Between the Don Bosco Foundation of Cambodia and the Royal Government of Cambodia, DBFC, link retrieved on March 25, 2013. Its primary purpose is to provide basic education and appropriate technical training to orphaned and marginalized youth that are poor and have no sources of support. These children will be prepared for the job market and for future integration in the society. The new situation of today's Cambodia challenges the Salesian priests, brothers and lay educators to find new initiatives. As a result of poverty, many children were denied access to basic education and therefore, to professional and technical education. Therefore, since 1991 the Don Bosco Foundation of Cambodia has evolved into a new style of salesian presence. Under a grant from July 1995 to December 2001, USAID/Cambodia has provided support to establish and help with the operation costs of four Salesian Vocational Training Schools in Cambodia. During these six and a half years, the Salesians have trained more than 1500 youth. These young people have mastered new knowledge and skills as well as developed attitudes suitable for the dynamic and changing workplace. Presently 1378 students undergo education in basic employable skills required by industries attracted by the new social and economic programs and strategies of Cambodia. The Technical Schools and Training Centers in Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville, Battambang and Poipet are still in the process of expanding and developing. The improving of human resources through guided and structured learning activities, provide students with practical know-how and skills by the use of developing training plans, curricula/modules, and/or methods used in the actual training activities. The local job market demand for Don Bosco Technical School graduates is very encouraging with almost 100% of the yearly trainees finding employment even before their graduation. However, DBFC must strive to secure good jobs and improve employment position through supervised learning method while in school environment with three competitive plus skills factors: Computer, Internet Access and Agriculture/Farming in order to practice appropriate work concepts and skills in improving their training tasks. Don Bosco has also contributed to the technical education in Cambodia by providing translations of technical books into Khmer Language and publishing them. As a direct result of poverty many children were denied access to primary and secondary education, the Don Bosco Foundation of Cambodia offers scholarships to enable these children to go to school and receive education under the Don Bosco Children Fund. To meet the needs of children living and working in Bricks Factories in Battambang, Don Bosco Literacy Center has two literacy centers to educate 210 children through an intensive three-year curriculum after which they are reintegrated into government formal high school curriculum. In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Cambodia, around 450 AIDS orphans and/or children living in AIDS affected families are offered support in order to access to education and health care. In addition to helping members from the poorest elements of a society, the Salesians have always had a special concern for homeless youth, orphans and young people in difficulties. The Don Bosco Literacy and Skills Training Center Project to support street children and disadvantaged youth in Poipet (border town with Thailand) is a strategy to fight social evil, promote basic education, and improve the life chances of the children and disadvantaged youth. It is a traditional element in Don Bosco Presences to have a place for more informal education through the Salesian Youth Movement style of seminars, scouting, retreats and youth centers. Don Bosco Youth Center- Kep provides these services.

Its focus is on the health and independent living of ventilator users, whether they are using assisted ventilation long-term – at home or in nursing facilities—or short-term in emergency rooms and critical care units. Many ventilator users have neuromuscular conditions, such as respiratory polio or post-polio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinal cord injury (SCI), or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Historically, IVUN’s efforts have been primarily addressed to ventilator users with neuromuscular conditions. But people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or obesity hypoventilation syndrome may also need to use assisted ventilation.  Mission IVUN’s mission is “to enhance the lives and independence” of ventilator users “through education, advocacy, research, and networking” among ventilator uses, respiratory health professionals, and ventilatory equipment manufacturers.IVUN homepage. Support comes from individual members, donors, and sponsors. IVUN’s parent organization is Post-Polio Health International (PHI).http://www.post- polio.org/ PHI homepage. It shares that organization’s headquarters and staff in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as its volunteer Board of Directors. IVUN’s publications, website, and volunteer advisory boards are its own, however. Current activities Education IVUN publishes (both online and in print) authoritative medical information based on interaction between ventilator users and healthcare professionals. Currently, users can find online free of charge a 16-page introductory document describing the history of ventilators, the various types of ventilators, and the types of user- interfaces;http://www.ventusers.org/edu/vabout1.html Information about Ventilator-Assisted Living. a packet of documents dealing with emergency medical care for home ventilator users (checklists for users, caregivers, physicians, and Emergency medical services personnel);http://www.ventusers.org/vume/index.html Emergency Medical Care for Ventilator Users. and a comprehensive Home Ventilator Guide which provides technical information on home/portable ventilator equipment from manufacturers worldwide.http://www.ventusers.org/edu/index.html Home Ventilator Guide Past issues of IVUN’s quarterly newsletter, Ventilator-Assisted Living, are also online.http://www.ventusers.org/edu/valnews/index.html ISSN 1066-534X IVUN’s staff maintain a telephone answer-line and answer e-mail inquiries during business hours.  Networking IVUN publishes, and makes available free online, the Resource Directory for Ventilator-Assisted Living,http://www.ventusers.org/net/index.html Resource Directory for Ventilator-Assisted Living which lists respiratory health professionals who are experts in long-term assisted ventilation, ventilatory equipment manufacturers and their contact information, and organizations whose members use assisted ventilation. IVUN’s website manages an equipment exchange, a peer-to-peer advice page, and ventilator news digests. IVUN staff regularly attend medical meetings and international conferences on home ventilator use, and coordinate presentations by ventilator users at medical meetings such as those for the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). In addition, IVUN/PHI’s periodic international conferences present many sessions relevant to ventilator users. Advocacy and Research With respect to advocacy and research, IVUN’s activities are integrated with those of PHI. A recent research grant of direct relevance to ventilator users is a study, conducted in 2005 by a team at Johns Hopkins University, on the “Timing of Noninvasive Ventilation for Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.” An earlier research award (2001) went to researchers at the University of Toronto, Canada for a study on ”Ventilator Users' Perspectives on the Important Elements of Health-Related Quality of Life.”http://www.ventusers.org/res/index.html Research Awards History IVUN was formally established under that name in 1987, but its roots go back to the polio epidemics of the 1940s and 1950s, when the possibility of long-term survival with mechanically assisted ventilation became a reality. Beginning in 1949, IVUN’s founder, Gini Laurie, was an American Red Cross volunteer in the polio wards of Cleveland’s City Hospital, and later in the part of that hospital (Toomey Pavilion) that became one of the 15 respiratory care and rehabilitation hospitals funded by the March of Dimes. Those centers all across the country began to close after the polio epidemics in the United States ended. Laurie, however, was determined to keep the respiratory polio survivors in touch with each other, and with their medical specialists. She did this first by taking over the editorship of Toomey Pavilion’s alumni newsletter, the Toomeyville Jr. Gazette, and circulating it widely throughout the United States. Copies also went to individuals and organizations in Canada, Great Britain, Europe, and Australia. In 1960, her informal organization of volunteers was incorporated under the name Iron Lung Polio Assistance, and her newsletter grew into a magazine called the Toomey j. Gazette. In 1964, the organization changed its name to Iron Lung Polios and Multiplegics, to reflect more accurately Laurie’s cross- disability concerns. The magazine became the Rehabilitation Gazette in 1970, carrying a wide range of articles on independent living for people with physical disabilities. Laurie soon became one of the central figures in the development of the independent living movement and in the founding of the Centers for Independent Living in the United States. Laurie’s central concerns, however, always included ventilator users. Specifically, they concerned finding ways for ventilator users to leave hospitals and nursing homes with the support necessary for them to live active, effective lives as members of their communities. As some cross-disability organizations such as the American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD) dissolved into disability-specific organizations, IVUN was formed to make sure there were publications and networks specifically for long-term ventilator users.

Life  Bergmüller was born in Türkheim near Buchloe (now in Bavaria) and received his first artistic education at his father's cabinet making workshop. From 1702 until 1708 he was apprentice to court painter Johann Andreas Wolff in Munich. In 1711 he went on cultural journey to the Netherlands in order to broaden his horizon. He became master painter and received the citizenship of Augsburg in 1711. In the same year he married Barbara Kreutzerin with whom he had ten children, one of which, Johann Baptist Konrad Bergmüller, became a fresco painter too, and also a renowned copperplate engraver and art theorist. Bergmüller quickly acquired a high reputation in Augsburg and created works of art, few of which have survived however. He became the most important teacher of fresco painting at the Imperial City of Augsburg Academy, founded in 1710. His style of composition and his motifs were influential on his pupils. In 1723 he published Anthropometria, a textbook on the theory of proportions. He became the Catholic director of the academy alongside his Protestant counterpart, in 1730 and remained in this function until his death in Augsburg in 1762. His most famous pupils were Johann Georg Wolcker, Gottfried Bernhard Göz and Johann Evangelist Holzer.

She not only encourage the women to create products for market, she also encouraged them to cultivate their minds and become independent. The Catholic church didn't agree with this type of education. So much so that the parish priest came to the school and broke it up. The school continued to flourish until 1856, even without the support of the church. The Jellicoes moved to Dublin in 1858 where she helped revive Cole Alley Infant School for poor children of all religions run by the Quakers. With support of the Dublin Statistical Society, established in 1847 to tackle social problems, Jellicoe developed observation and research techniques that she used to investigate prisons, slums and workplaces in Dublin. She was asked to present a paper at the 1861 meeting of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science on the conditions of women working in factories in Dublin. She collected data on wages, working conditions and advancement opportunities. She concluded that women employed in these institutions were helpless working in insecure positions. She spoke to pillars of society on the importance of educating the working class by establishing infants schools and evening schools for older girls. On 19 August 1861 Jellicoe, along with Barbara Corlett, founded the Dublin branch of London-based Society for Promoting the Employment of Women to educate women for work outside the home. The response to the Society was overwhelming. In the first couple of years over 500 women registered for classes with the Society. Jellicoe quickly found that the gentlewomen attending the courses thought working for wages was taboo and social suicide. This prompted her to found a new employment society Queen's Institute. The classes provided by the Institute focused on practical skills such as bookkeeping, secretarial skills and sewing-skills that would result in employment. Potential employers began to show an interest in Institute graduates, most prominently the Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company, which provided equipment and its head engineer as a teacher. Jellicoe's work with the Institute led her to realise that women must be educated before they could be trained. She was widowed in 1862, and using her £3000 inheritance, she financed a more permanent home for the Queen's Institute. In 1866, with the help of Archbishop Chenevix Trench, she founded Alexandra College, Dublin, the first women's college in Ireland to aim at a university type education. The college was named in honour of the then Princess of Wales. The College offered advanced education for women with classes offered in Greek, Latin, Algebra, Philosophy and Natural Sciences among others. Her foundation of the Governess Association of Ireland followed in 1869 and Alexandra School, a secondary school attached to Alexandra College, was founded in 1873.O'Connor, Anne V. \\"Anne Jellicoe\\". in Mary Cullen & Maria Luddy (eds.), Women, Power and Consciousness, Dublin, 1995.

Heliocybe sulcata, the type and sole species, is characterized by thumb-sized, tough, revivable, often dried, mushroom fruitbodies, with a tanned symmetric pileus that is radially cracked into a cartoon sun-like pattern of arranged scales and ridges, distant serrated lamellae, and a scaly central stipe. Microscopically it differs from Neolentinus by the absence of clamp connections. Like Neolentinus, it produces abundant, conspicuous pleurocystidia. Heliocybe sulcata typically fruits on decorticated, sun-dried and cracked wood, such as fence posts and rails, vineyard trellises in Europe, branches in slash areas, and semi-arid areas such on sagebrush or on naio branches in rain shadow areas of Hawaii, or in open pine forests. Etymology Heliocybe derives from the Greek helios (= the sun) and cybe (=head), and means \\"the sun-head\\". It was coined in reference to its sun-like pattern on its pileus together with its affinity to sun-baked habitats. Classification In older classifications, H. sulcata was known as Lentinus sulcatus or Panus fulvidus. However, there is strong phylogenetic evidence for the segregation of a group of brown rot causing fungi at the level of order, including Neolentinus and Heliocybe and Gloeophyllum, from the Polyporales where Lentinus and Panus are classified. Heliocybe has also been placed into synonymy with Neolentinus, but anatomically they differ by the absence versus the presence of clamp connections and phylogenetically Heliocybe is distinct, being either a sister group to Neolentinus or to a Neolentinus-Gloeophyllum-clade, or allied to Gloeophyllum odoratum.

It was crafted and delivered in 1888 to the then Tsar of Russia, Alexander III. This is one of the lost Imperial eggs, so few details are known about it. Design The exact design of the Cherub with Chariot Egg is unsure. A single photograph of the egg exists, though it is hidden by another egg and can only be seen in a blurry reflection. There is a brief description from the imperial records in the Russian State Historical Archives in Moscow which describes the gift as \\"Angel pulling chariot with egg - 1500 roubles, angel with a clock in a gold egg 600 roubles.\\" According to Marina Lopato in Fabergé: Imperial Jeweller (1993) this description means the clock is inside the gold egg, which is in the chariot being pulled by the angel. Fabergé's invoice carries a similar description, itemizing a cherub pulling a chariot with an egg and a cherub with clock in a gold egg. These two descriptions are backed up by the 1917 inventory of seized imperial treasure which reads \\"gold egg, decorated with brilliants (diamonds), a sapphire; with a silver, golded [sic] stand in the form of a two-wheeled wagon with a putto.\\"Lowes, 2001 Pg. 25 Surprise The surprise would have been the clock being inside the egg on the chariot, though the exact design is not known. History of the egg The egg would have been presented to Maria Feodorovna on April 24, 1888 by Alexander III. The egg was kept in the Gatchina Palace in 1891, and was one of 40 or so eggs sent to the Armory Palace of the Kremlin in 1917 after the Revolution by the Provisional Government. In 1922 it was transferred to the Sovnarkom, after which the exact whereabouts of the egg are unknown. In the 1930s Victor and Armand Hammer may have purchased the egg. A sales catalog for Armand Hammer's 1934 exhibition at Lord and Taylor in New York City describes a \\"miniature silver armour holding wheelbarrow with Easter Egg, made by Fabergé, court jeweler\\" which seems to describe the Cherub with Chariot Egg. Armand Hammer may have been unaware of the significance of this item if it was in fact the 1888 Imperial egg, since he had a habit of promoting imperial items yet did not make an effort to promote this egg. Whether this was the 1888 egg, and where it is today is unknown.

However, for the cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, a Northern Ireland team took part, as the Republic is not a member of the Commonwealth. It remains the only appearance of such a side in international cricket. The tournament started for Northern Ireland with a match against South Africa. Northern Ireland scored 89/5 before rain brought an end to their innings in the 39th over. A target of 131 from 38 overs was set using the Duckworth-Lewis method for South Africa, which they achieved in the 32nd over, Dale Benkenstein scoring 44 not out. Ryan Eagleson took 3/28 for the Northern Irish team. Their second match was against Barbados, and Barbados scored 296/5 from their 50 overs, Philo Wallace top scoring with 92. Northern Ireland could only score 120/7 in reply, Stephen Smyth top scoring with 58, losing by 176 runs. Northern Ireland picked up their only win in their third match, against Bangladesh.

The aircraft was a Douglas DC-8 operated by Nationair for Nigeria Airways. Flight 2120 is the deadliest accident involving a DC-8 and remains the deadliest aviation disaster involving a Canadian airline. Aircraft and crew The aircraft involved in the accident was a 1968 Douglas DC-8-61, C-GMXQ, owned by the Canadian company Nolisair, usually operated by Nationair. At the time of the accident, it was being wet-leased to Nigeria Airways, which in turn sub-leased it to Holdtrade Services to transport Nigerian pilgrims to and from Mecca. The DC-8 was the primary aircraft type used by the airline. William Allan, the 47-year-old captain, a former Canadian Air Force pilot, had logged 10,700 flight hours and 1,000 hours in type. Kent Davidge, the 36-year-old first officer, had logged 8,000 flight hours, of which 550 hours were in type, and was the pilot flying on the accident flight. Victor Fehr, the 46-year-old flight engineer, had logged 7,500 flight hours, of which 1,000 hours were in type. Accident The aircraft departed King Abdulaziz International Airport bound for Sadiq Abubakar III International Airport in Sokoto, but problems were reported shortly after takeoff. Unknown to the crew, the aircraft had caught fire during departure, and though the fire itself was not obvious since it started in an area without fire warning systems, the effects were numerous. Pressurization failed quickly, and the crew was deluged with nonsensical warnings caused by fire-related circuit failures. In response to the pressurization failure, Allan decided to remain at , but the flight was cleared to as a result of the controller mistaking Flight 2120 for a Saudia flight that was also reporting pressurization problems due to Captain Allan mistakenly identifying as \\"Nationair 2120\\" rather than \\"Nigerian 2120,\\" a mix- up that lasted for three minutes, but was ultimately found not to have had any effect on the outcome. Amidst this, First Officer Davidge, who had been flying C-GMXQ out, reported that he was losing hydraulics. The crew only became aware of the fire when a flight attendant rushed into the cockpit reporting \\"smoke in the back ... real bad.\\" Shortly afterwards, Davidge reported that he had lost ailerons, forcing Allan to take control; as Allan took over, the cockpit voice recorder failed. At this moment, the air traffic controller realized that Flight 2120 was not the Saudia flight and was in trouble, and directed them towards the runway. Allan subsequently contacted air traffic control multiple times, among his pre-mortem communications being a request for emergency vehicles. When the aircraft was about from the airport and at an altitude of , a point where the landing gear could conceivably have been lowered, it began to experience an inflight breakup and a number of bodies fell from it, indicating that the fire by that time had consumed, at least partially, the cabin floor. Just short of the runway, the melting aircraft finally became uncontrollable and crashed, killing whatever portion of the 261 occupants on board—including 247 passengers—had not already suffocated or fallen out of the aircraft. Nine of the fourteen crew were identified, but \\"no attempt was made to identify the passengers\\". , the accident remains the deadliest crash involving a Douglas DC-8, as well as the second-deadliest accident taking place on Saudi Arabian soil, after Saudia Flight 163. Cause Prior to departure, the lead mechanic had noticed that the \\"#2 and #4 tyre pressures were below the minimum for flight dispatch,\\" and attempted to inflate them, but no nitrogen gas was readily available. The project manager, unwilling to accept a delay, disregarded the problem and readied the aircraft for dispatch. As the aircraft was taxiing, the transfer of the load from the under-inflated No. 2 tire to the No. 1 tire on the same portside axle resulted \\"in overdeflection, over-heating and structural weakening of the No. 1 tyre.\\" \\"The No. 1 tyre failed very early on the take-off roll,\\" followed almost immediately by the No. 2. The latter stopped rotating \\"for reasons not established,\\" and the subsequent friction of the wheel assembly with the runway generated sufficient heat to start a self-sustaining fire. The crew realised there was a problem, but not the nature or seriousness of it. The aircraft was not equipped with fire or heat sensors in the wheel assembly. The first officer was recorded remarking, \\"We gotta flat tire, you figure?\\" According to Canadian Transportation Safety Board members interviewed for an episode of Mayday about the accident, standard procedures regarding tire failure during the takeoff roll on the DC-8 did not include rejecting takeoff for tire or wheel failures, so the captain proceeded with the takeoff. Due to common jet aircraft design, the accident became inevitable the moment the landing gear was retracted, mere seconds after takeoff and long before an emergency became apparent. When this occurred, \\"burning rubber was brought into close proximity with hydraulic and electrical system components,\\" causing the failure of both hydraulic and pressurisation systems that led to structural damage and loss of control of the aircraft. The Transportation Safety Board later concluded, \\"had the crew left the landing gear extended, the accident might have been averted.\\" Fuel, \\"probably introduced as a result of 'burn through' of the centre fuel tank,\\" intensified the fire, which eventually consumed the cabin floor. People began falling out of the aircraft when their seat harnesses burned through. \\"Despite the considerable destruction to the airframe, the aircraft appeared to have been controllable until just before the crash.\\" It was discovered during the investigation that the mechanics had known about the under-inflated tires since 7 July but that the project manager, lacking the relevant training to make an informed decision, had prevented maintenance on the tires because the aircraft was behind schedule, requiring them to record false pressure readings in the log to make the aircraft seem airworthy. This meant that Nationair executives had pressured the colleagues of the cockpit crew to withhold information that had serious safety implications. Aftermath Soon after the accident, a group of Toronto-based Nationair flight attendants pooled funds to create a memorial plaque, inscribed with the names of the victims. The memorial, complete with a cherry tree planted to commemorate their colleagues who died in Jeddah, was given a permanent home at the head office of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority. The aircrash, combined with Nationair's poor reputation for on-time service and mechanical problems, led to serious problems with public image and reliability among tour operators. These difficulties were compounded when Nationair locked out its unionised flight attendants and proceeded to replace them with strikebreakers on 19 November 1991. The lock-out lasted 15 months and by the time it ended in early 1993, Nationair found itself in severe financial trouble. At the time, Nationair owed the Canadian government millions of dollars in unpaid landing fees. Creditors began seizing aircraft and demanded cash up front for services. The company was declared bankrupt in May 1993, owing CDN$75 million. In 1997, Robert Obadia, owner of Nationair and its parent company Nolisair, pleaded guilty to eight counts of fraud in relation to the company's activities.

It was crafted and delivered to the then Tsar of Russia, Alexander III who presented it to his wife, Maria Feodorovna on Easter day 1889. The egg is one of the lost Imperial eggs, but is known to have survived the Russian Revolution and was sold by Wartski in London in 1952. Design of egg This egg was designed as an étui containing woman's toilet items. While the exact appearance of the egg is not known, it is described in the 1917 inventory of confiscated imperial treasure as being decorated with \\"multi- colored stones and brilliants, rubies, emeralds and sapphires.\\" Surprise in egg The surprise was the fact that egg was essentially an etui, or necessaire, with 13 diamond-encrusted implements and toilet articles. History On 9 April 1889, Alexander III presented the egg to his wife, Maria Feodorovna. It was housed at the Gatchina Palace and was taken on at least one trip to Moscow, as demonstrated by an invoice for the trip which describes the egg. After the 1917 revolution the Nécessaire Egg was seized along with the rest of the imperial eggs and sent to the Armoury Palace of the Kremlin. During the early part of 1922 the egg was transferred to the Sovnarkom. It was last shown at Wartski Ltd., court jewelers and Fabergé specialists. It was shown at Wartski's in 1949 as part of the first dedicated exhibition of Faberge's works in Europe. It was later acquired and sold by the firm. In an article on the egg, Wartski states, \\"It was last recorded [on our premises] on the 19th June 1952 when it was sold to a buyer named as ‘A Stranger’ for £1250...The purchaser’s anonymity was safeguarded throughout Wartski’s records and they remain unidentified.\\" Its current whereabouts are unknown.

He was one of the main figures of the Brabant Revolution (1789–1790) against the Imperial rule of Joseph II. This revolution led to the short-lived existence of the United States of Belgium with himself as Prime Minister (11 January 1790 – 2 December 1790).  Family  Van der Noot family. He was the son of Nicolas van der Noot, Lord of Vrechem, and is distantly related to the current Marquess of Assche. Overview Two lawyers, Jan Frans Vonck and Henri Van der Noot, were the leaders of the revolt but each represented a different faction. The Vonckists were inspired by the French Revolution (1789–1799) and sought a link-up with the people and the patriot army. The Statists led by Van der Noot strived for the restoration of old privileges of the nobility and the church such as the \\"Joyous Entry\\" and sought cooperation with the Dutch Republic. In contrast to Vonck, who was of the opinion that the Belgian people themselves had to fight against the despot of Vienna, Van der Noot had more confidence in obtaining foreign support. In 1788 Van der Noot travelled to England, the Dutch Republic and Prussia to get attention for the cause of Brabant liberty. Only Prussia, which itself had beaten the Dutch patriots in 1787, was inclined to support the Belgian patriots as they were at that time anti-Austrian. Van der Noot had less success seeking support from the last Grand Pensionary of Holland, Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel. In October 1789 Van der Noot and General Vander Meersch with a small patriot army from Breda captured the entire province of Brabant. In his first concurred (or freed) town, Hoogstraten, Van der Noot published his Manifesto of the Brabant People on 24 October 1789. The document explains why the people of Brabant have the right to disobedience against a ruler. The main argument is that the will of a nation is the highest law and if that is violated by a ruler the nation has the right to revolt against the ruler. Gravestone of Henri van der Noot Van der Noot captured Turnhout, defeating the Imperials in the Battle of Turnhout on 27 October and Ghent was taken on 13 November. On 17 November the imperial regents Albert of Saxony and Archduchess Maria Christina fled Brussels. The remains of the imperial forces withdrew behind the citadel walls of Luxembourg and Antwerp. Van der Noot declared Brabant independent, and all other provinces of the Austrian Netherlands with the exception of Luxembourg soon followed suit. On 11 January 1790 they signed a pact, establishing a confederation, headed by Van der Noot, under the name Verenigde Nederlandse Staten/États-Belgiques-Unis (United States of Belgium). When Prussia abandoned the revolt after the signing the Convention of Reichenbach (27 July 1790) with the Holy Roman Empire the fragile state soon came under attack by the Imperials of Leopold II, who had succeeded his brother Joseph II after the latter's death on 20 February 1790. In November 1790 Van der Noot had to flee to the Dutch Republic and thereafter to England. In 1792 he made an appeal for cooperation with the French occupiers (1794–1815). He returned to Brabant but was arrested 1796 and imprisoned in 's Hertogenbosch. He died in 1826 in Strombeek and his tomb is located in the wall of the vicar's compound of the Sint-Amandsparochie in Strombeek-Bever.

Operation was relatively simple for its day, a pilot or flight engineer would have to enter the individual waypoints by their latitude and longitude points, next the pilot or engineer would have to enter the starting location in latitude and longitude.

Shovelton began his professional life with a teaching career, during which he began to perform professionally in oratorio and opera. He became a full-time professional singer in 1971, performing with Scottish Opera and other companies. Shovelton joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1975, playing the leading tenor roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas until the company closed in 1982.

Early career Shovelton first sang professionally in oratorio, performing in such works as Handel's Messiah, Haydn's Creation, Mendelssohn's Elijah, and Verdi's Requiem, finally becoming a full-time singer in 1971. Early in his career he played principal roles with Nonesuch Opera, Chelsea Opera Group, Tayside Opera, Basilica Opera, Scottish Opera and its touring group, Opera for All. His roles included Roderigo in Verdi's Otello, Don Curzio in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, and Lysander in Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. He returned to the Savoy Operas in 1973 with the touring companies Gilbert and Sullivan for All in the UK and The World of Gilbert & Sullivan in Australasia and the US. Having joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as principal tenor at the beginning of the 1975–76 season, Shovelton initially played Tolloller in Iolanthe, Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard, and later that season added the roles of Luiz in The Gondoliers and the Duke of Dunstable in Patience. In 1977 he added to his repertoire the roles of Cyril in Princess Ida and Box in Cox and Box when those works were revived. He played the Defendant in a special performance of Trial by Jury in 1978 at London's Middle Temple Hall to commemorate the Bar Musical Society's first hundred concerts. In April 1979 he left D'Oyly Carte to tour with several other former D'Oyly Carte singers in a group that he founded, The Gilbert and Sullivan Companions, and he took other singing assignments. In 1980, he rejoined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, continuing with them until the company closed in February 1982.

He was one of the highest functionaries of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and close associate and advisor to Stepan Bandera. Born in Rzeszów, Galicia (then Austria-Hungary). Origin According to the Yary family legend the Yarys descended from a Ukrainian Cossack wounded during the Siege of Vienna in 1685. According to historians O. Kucheruk and Z. Knysh, Yary was of patrilineal Czech and matrilineal Hungarian-Jewish descentО.Кучерук \\"Рико Ярий - загадка ОУН\\" Львів, ЛА \\"ПІРАМІДА\\" 2005 р.(Polish rather than Hungarian (maiden name \\"Pollack\\") according to PatrylyakІ.К.

In the military In 1912, he completed his studies in the Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt, and commanded a sapper battalion after graduationІ.К. Патриляк. Військова діяльність ОУН(Б) у 1940—1942 роках. — Університет імені Шевченко \\\\Ін-т історії України НАН України Київ, 2004 p.261-262. In the years of World War I (1914–18), he was an officer in the 9th Dragoons Legion of the Austrian Army. In 1918, he went over to the side of the Ukrainian Galician Army (UHA) and commanded a sniper division and later the 2nd cavalry. In 1919, he fought with the 5th Kherson battalion of the Ukrainian National Republic. In 1920, as part of the battalion he was interned in Czechoslovakia and was held at an internment camp in Uzhhorod. In the OUN From 1921-29, he was an active member of the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), one of the closest advisers to Yevhen Konovaletz. In January 1929, he took part in the First Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in Vienna, where the formation of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists OUN was announced. IN 1933 Yary attempted to obtain a post at the Ukrainian Institute founded by hetman Skoropadsky in Berlin (on OUN's behalf), but he could not secure an appointment due to opposition from the Nazi authorities. This attempt led to a smear campaign in the Polish press that accused Yary and Konovalets of being German agents.http://referaty.com.ua/ukr/details/949/3/ From 1937-38, he became the liaison officer between Yevhen Konovaletz and admiral Wilhelm Canaris of the Abwehr, and directed espionage training courses of the UVO organized by the Abwehr. He became an agent of the Special services, and was an adviser during the discussions between Y. Konovaletz and the Japanese Military Attache. During the 1930s Yary was one of the members of the Provid, or leadership council of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. He was the only member of the Provid to side with Bandera when the organizations split into Bandera and Melnyk factions. Yary's support for Bandera turned some Ukrainians against Bandera because it was considered suspicious that of all the members of the OUN's leadership council only the one of not fully Ukrainian ethnicity chose to follow Bandera.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 62 . Yary's influence on Stepan Bandera was instrumental in the division of the OUN into its two factions. After the division, he stayed with the OUN(b) (Bandera faction). In November 1940, he arranged contact between Bandera and the Abwehr and set up the Vienna Bureau of the OUN(b). On his initiative the Nachtigall and Roland Battalion were formed. After the Proclamation of Ukrainian Independence he was given the portfolio of Ambassador to Japan. At the same time there were reports by the Einsatzgruppe B that Yary and his wife were Jewish, and as such subject to persecution.Bundesarchiv (BA).- Koblenz. / R 58/214 f. 69. After the abrogation by the Nazis of the independent Ukrainian State Yary left the General Government and from 1942 he lived in the Rumanian- occupied Bukovina. In 1943, he was arrested by the Gestapo and was sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After World War II After the war, he returned to his own house in Austria in the Soviet occupational sector. The Soviet occupation forces made no attempt to arrest him, which has led to suspicions that he might have worked for the Soviet intelligence. However, after retiring in Austria, in order to avoid Soviet persecution, he moved to the British sector. After the war, he left political life entirely. According to another source, in the 1950s Yary became active in OUNb again.

Robert Grimm, a socialist politician, travelled to the Russian Republic as an activist to negotiate a separate peace between Russia and the German Empire, in order to end the war on the Eastern Front in the interests of socialism. When the Allies discovered the proposed peace deal, he had to return home. Arthur Hoffmann, the Swiss Federal Councillor who had supported Grimm, had to resign. Background In 1917, German troops were divided in fighting the Romanians and Russians on the Eastern Front and British, French and other Allied forces on the Western Front. The Allies insisted that the division of Germany's military strength was crucial to their own success. During the 1917 February Revolution, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia abdicated his throne, a provisional government was instated. At the time, the Russian Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was living in exile in Switzerland. Lenin was willing to make peace with Germany regardless of Russia's Triple Entente commitment. Therefore, the Germans assisted in Lenin's return to Russia. Grimm's trip to Russia Following the February Revolution, socialist-democratic Swiss National Council (Nationalrat) member and International Socialist Commission Secretary Robert Grimm traveled to Petrograd. Grimm, accompanied by Russian-Jewish-Italian socialist activist Angelica Balabanoff, facilitated the movement of political refugees — most prominently Vladimir Lenin — from Switzerland to Russia via Germany and Sweden. During his trip, Grimm passed through Stockholm, where he secured the passage of \\"some 250 Russian exiles who were returning home.\\" Grimm arrived in Petrograd on May 22, 1917. While in Russia, he also intended to weigh the possibility of a separate peace agreement between Russia and the German Empire. In Petrograd, Grimm and Balabanoff were accused by the press of being German agents and working toward a separate peace between Germany and Allied countries. On May 26/27, 1917, Grimm sent a telegram to Federal Councilor (Bundesrat) and Foreign Affairs Minister Arthur Hoffmann stating that Russia was eager for peace with Germany. On June 13, 1917, a Swiss envoy informed his superiors that a cable message telegram between Bern and Petrograd sent by Hoffmann was deciphered by the Russian Foreign Ministry. This message indicated a conspiracy by Hoffmann and Grimm to incite separate peace negotiations between Germany and Russia. A translated version of the telegram appeared in The New York Times on June 18, 1917: > I am convinced that Germany and her allies would immediately take up peace > negotiations at the wish of Russia's allies. As to what concerns the German > war aim, you can read articles in the Norddeutsche Ailgemeine Zeitung. > There, after consultation with Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg, the > declaration has been made regarding annexation to the effect that Germany > does not desire any increase in her territory or any economic or political > expansion. In the telegram, Hoffmann confirms the improbability of a German offensive attack along the Eastern Front, which would threaten a separate Russian–German peace. The telegram was leaked to international news sources, causing widespread outrage, especially among the Western powers.  Switzerland neutrality  After the leakage of Hoffmann's telegram, Switzerland's neutrality was greatly called into question. Hoffmann was forced to resign and stated in his letter of resignation that he \\"strived to negotiate exclusively for the promotion of peace, at the interest of his country.\\" However, Allied Forces saw these actions as explicitly non-neutral, as a separate peace between the German Empire and Russia would strengthen German troops on the Western Front. France and Great Britain questioned the presence of a silent majority in Switzerland that supported the Central Powers.  Aftermath  Arthur Hoffmann On June 18, 1917, the Pan-Russian Congress of all Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates officially moved to expel Grimm in a 640–121 vote. By the time of the vote, Grimm had already left Russia. On June 20, 1917, Grimm resigned as Chairman of the International Socialist Commission (ISC). After appointing new leadership at the Third Zimmerwald Conference, the ISC appointed a commission to investigate the Grimm–Hoffmann affair. Grimm was censured, but ultimately cleared of acting with German imperialistic interests and actively supporting a separate peace. Grimm eventually rebounded from the scandal, going on to become the President of the National Swiss Council in 1946. Hoffmann, who had not consulted his colleagues over his initiative, retired immediately. In Switzerland, Hoffmann became a controversial figure. Citizens from the western district of Romandy were particularly outraged by the affair. His former business dealings in Germany increased the public's growing suspicion that he was a German sympathizer. However, Hoffmann denied acting out of sympathy with Germany. Many were also surprised by his partnership with Grimm. Hoffmann was replaced by Gustave Ador, head of the International Red Cross. Ador's succession relieved some tension and restored some trust in the Federal Council.

Early life Mackenzie was born near Nelson, Lancashire, England, the eldest of the 11 children of Alexander Mackenzie, a Scottish contractor, and Mary née Roberts. He started his career as an apprentice weaver but changed to civil engineering, becoming a pupil of a lock carpenter on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1811. He continued his training on a dry dock at Troon harbour, on Craigellachie Bridge and as an agent on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal. Career In 1822 he became an agent for the completion of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal. Soon after this he was appointed resident engineer for Thomas Telford's Mythe Bridge at Tewkesbury, then resident engineer to the improvements to the Birmingham canals, again under Telford. Following this he returned to contracting, his profitable contracts including tunnels on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway between Edge Hill and Lime Street, and contracts for the Grand Union, North Union, Midland Counties and Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock railways. Non-railway contracts included Liverpool Haymarket, the Manchester and Sheffield Junction Canal and the Shannon navigation. In 1840 Mackenzie was invited by Joseph Locke to tender for works on the Paris to Rouen railway. He tendered jointly with Thomas Brassey and together they were granted the contract. When this was complete he built more railways in France, Spain, the Italian states and Belgium. Also in partnership with Brassey he built further railways in France, England, Wales and Scotland. Mackenzie also made investments, which included ironworks in Wales and France, housing in Liverpool and estates in Scotland. Personal life Mackenzie's pyramidal tomb In 1819 Mackenzie married Mary Dalziel, daughter of a Glasgow commission agent. Mary died in 1838 and in 1839 he married Sarah Dewhurst. Mackenzie maintained offices in Paris and in Liverpool and from 1843 he lived at 74 Grove Street, Liverpool, where he died in 1851. He was buried in St Andrew's Church, Rodney Street, Liverpool in 1851. A pyramid-shaped monument was erected at the grave by his brother Edward in 1868. An inscription on the pyramid door reads: \\"In the vault beneath lie the remains of William Mackenzie of Newbie, Dumfriesshire, Esquire who died 29th October 1851 aged 57 years. Also, Mary his wife, who died 19th December 1838 aged 48 years and Sarah, his second wife who died 9th December 1867 aged 60 years. This monument was erected by his Brother Edward as a token of love and affection A.D. 1868. The memory of the just is blessed\\". William's estate amounted to £341,848, almost all of which was left to his youngest brother, Edward. He had no children. The Diary of William Mackenzie, published by Thomas Telford Publishing in 2000, is a full transcription of Mackenzie's handwritten diaries, and it provides insight into his busy life. The inscription proves that MacKenzie was buried beneath (not entombed inside) the pyramid and that the monument itself was not erected until 16 years after his demise. Even so, the legend of his upright interment continues to be told and believed by many.

He took a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from Willamette University and a master's degree in physics from Stanford University. From 1929 he worked as a research physicist at Bell Labs and his early work on temperature-sensitive resistors led to 13 patents on thermistors. After World War II he was part of William Shockley's group, where his experimental results were essential in developing models of semiconductor behaviour. In 1946, acting on a suggestion by Shockley he put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate (gu) placed across a P-N junction producing the first evidence of power amplification in the search for the transistor. In 1954 his work on silicon rectifiers led to the first practical photovoltaic cell (solar cell), together with Daryl Chapin and Calvin Souther Fuller.

Historical sources mentioned that he was a lord of a fortress near the city of Ganja (modern-day Azerbaijan), who migrated in the early 1070s to Cilicia and founded the House of Lampron that ruled the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in the 12th and 13th centuries. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Oshin was a member of the Pahlavuni clan. Disappointed with the inability of the Byzantines to protect him against the advance of the Seljuk Turks, Oshin fled west from his fortress near Ganja to Cilicia in 1072. The 12th century chronicler Samuel of Ani wrote about Oshin's departure from his ancestral lands: \\"...with his brother Halgam, with his wife and other nobles. Carrying his wealth and the finger of the holy apostle Peter, he entered Cilicia and captured from the Muslims the fortress of Lampron, at the foot of the Taurus Mountains toward Tarsus.\\"Macevitt, 57 His kinsman, Abu'lgharib Artsuni, governed Taurus and Mopsuestia in the name of the Emperor Alexius I Comnenus.Kurkjian, 214 He ceded to Oshin two forts in western Cilicia, Lampron and Barbaron at Tarsus near the Cilician Gates.The later Crusades, 633 While Samuel of Ani implies that Oshin seized Lampron from Muslims, other Armenian writers closer to the Hethumids suggest that Oshin was merely a faithful chieftain of Abulgharib who later ceded the castle of Lampron to him. Matthew of Edessa and Sempad the Constable mention Oshin only in passing. The Emperor had no objection to seeing the Armenians becoming a buffer between him and the invading Seljuks; and confirmed Oshin, together with two other Armenian leaders who had established themselves in the Taurus, Ruben and Gogh Vasil, in their positions by bestowing on them the imperial title of sebastos. Oshin has been identified by historians such as Steven Runciman with general Michael Aspietes, whose exploits were told by Anna Comnena in her AlexiadSewter, 372 as well as with UrsinusEdouard Dulaurier was the first to identify Ursinus with Oshin.

Historian Joseph Laurent argued that Ursinus, Aspietes and Oshin were all different people in his article Arméniens de Cilicie: Aspiétès, Oschin, Ursinus from the journal Revue des Études Arméniennes; however, Christopher Macevitt found the links between Ursinus and Oshin persuasive and compelling.Macevitt, 195 In September 1097 when Baldwin of Boulogne took Tarsus from Tancred who had recently captured the city, Oshin/Ursinus sent ambassadors to Tancred advising him to attack Mamistra. Oshin was thus in a position to support either Baldwin or Tancred. Once the Crusaders moved on to Antioch, Oshin provided them with provisions, eager to have them leave Cilicia. Issue He married to a daughter of Abu'lgharib Artsuni, governor of Tarsus, and had issue: * Héthoum II († 1143), lord of Lampron ** Oshin II ((1125 † 1170), lord of Lampron ** Smbat († 1153), lord of Baberon *** Vasak († after 1199), lord of Baberon **** Constantine (1180 † 1263), lord of Baberon.

The term is most often applied to a college curriculum in the United States that prepares a student for a career as a mortician or funeral director. Many also study embalming to supplement their mortuary science studies. Some states require funeral directors to be embalmers as well. Students applying for mortuary science should have a plan about it and must develop passion for the study before applying for the course at the college level. This would make students study hard and become knowledgeable on the subject matter. Cahill p. 109–111 History Funeral directing occurred in ancient times. Most famous are the Egyptians who embalmed their dead. In the United States, funeral directing was not generally in high esteem before the 20th century, especially in comparison to physicians,Torres p. 382 but because many funeral directors study embalming as part of mortuary science programs, they can be classified as a part of the medical field.Torres p. 383 Funeral directors gained higher status that peaked in the 1950s but which later declined in the 1960s and 1970s. Many reputations were eroded as a result of high-profile exposés on a few rare cases of unethical sales practices and police investigations that followed criminally negligent behavior of some morticians. However, funeral homes remain a necessity in society. Training Degree requirements differ by school and by state. Those wishing to become funeral directors have other requirements that usually include two years of college coursework (including studies in mortuary science), one year of experience as an apprentice, and a qualifying examination.Bureau College degrees in mortuary science can usually be earned in two to four years. Some community and junior colleges offer two- year programs while universities can offer both two- or four-year programs. The curriculum typically includes courses in anatomy, physiology, pathology, embalming techniques, restorative art, and business management. Suggested coursework or extracurricular activities include those that enhance skills in public speaking and interpersonal communication, as funeral directors should be personable and skilled communicators in their work with grief-stricken clients. More than thirty states have schools that offer mortuary science programs. For example, Illinois, Mississippi, New York, and Texas all have four schools.\\"Directory of Accredited Mortuary Schools in the United States\\" Student reactions Students of mortuary science often report feeling the pressure of odd questions and looks from other college students.Cahill p. 105 They are frequently shunned by other students and often find that they associate only with other mortuary science students.Cahill p. 106 Regarding personal reactions, mortuary science students indicate a certain level of desensitization, as human bodies they work with become an impersonal “interconnected system of arteries and veins.” While students often explain that their first experiences are the most difficult, they do become accustomed to the work, though the various odors are considered the worst element of the job.Cahill p. 108 Risks Mortuary science students are also subject to disease. As morticians sometimes work with infectious cadavers, an element of risk is inherent, though considered remote if recommended precautions are followed. They are also subject to formaldehyde exposure during embalming procedures,Suruda et al. but that is avoided with strict health regulations. Emotional stress can take a psychological toll on mortuary science students. Students report the strongest reactions when working with the bodies of children.Cahill p. 109 The emotional and mental strains account for a high drop-out rate among mortuary science students. Funeral homes Studies in mortuary science include business management classes, as many graduates later open their own funeral homes as small businesses. Twenty percent of funeral business are made up of individual businesses owned by morticians. Because of the need for funeral homes in most cities in every state, many establishments thrive and competition grows.Torres p. 384 Establishing a funeral home is not difficult in some states for degreed individuals. In some cities, a mortician's license may include a registration fee, formal notification to the state, and/or a building inspection.Torres p. 388, as quoting Roger D. Blackwell Facilities Funeral home facilities usually include: * Wake room: for services and visitations. * Preparation room: for embalming and restoration. * Merchandise display: caskets and other merchandise that customers may purchase. * Privacy room: for the family. * Office: for mortician's personal and administrative use. * Livery: a garage to keep funeral coaches and other vehicles. Funeral homes usually have staff available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

History Originally a faction within the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), the PL were launched in February 2007 and named that way in October. Its leaders were Carlo Giovanardi and Emerenzio Barbieri, who wanted closer ties with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the other parties of the House of Freedoms coalition, including Lega Nord. In April Giovanardi's bid to become secretary of the UDC had been supported by the 13.8% of the vote during a party congress. When, on 18 November 2007, Berlusconi proposed the formation of The People of Freedom (PdL) party, Giovanardi suddenly hinted that he could leave UDC and join the new party. That finally happened on 4 February 2008, citing that the 72% of UDC voters would be interested in voting the PdL. UDC members who followed Giovanardi included Vito Bonsignore, Tomaso Zanoletti, Luigi Compagna, Giuseppe Galati, Francesco Lucchese, Alfredo Meocci and Francesco Massi. The PL were joined also by Riccardo Conti, a former UDC member who was then in Middle Italy. In early April PL announced an alliance, within the PdL, with Gianfranco Rotondi's Christian Democracy for the Autonomies.\\"I democristiani nel PdL\\", Radio Radicale. In the 2008 general election the party got two deputies and two senators elected in the PdL's lists. After the election, Giovanardi was appointed Undersecretary in the Berlusconi IV Cabinet. On 29 March 2009 the party was merged into the PdL, during the first PdL's congress, and was converted into a faction. On 15 November 2013 the PL left the PdL in order to join the newly formed New Centre-Right (NCD) party. On 26 November 2015 the PL left the NCD.

Women's rights in Colombia have been gradually developing since the early 20th Century. University of Vigo; political rights and citizenship of Colombian women History Background Women in Colombia have been very unimportant in military aspects, serving mainly as supporters or spies such as in the case of Policarpa Salavarrieta who played a key role in the independence of Colombia from the Spanish empire. Some indigenous groups such as the Wayuu hold a matriarchal society in which a woman's role is central and the most important for their society. Women belonging to indigenous groups were highly targeted by the Spanish colonizers during the colonial era. Many indigenous women were subject to slavery, rape and the loss of their cultural identity. Colombialink.com: First woman to enter a university Throughout the colonial era, the 19th century and the establishment of the republican era, Colombian women were relegated to be housewives in a male dominated society. Education for women was limited to the wealthy and they were only allowed to study until middle school in monastery under Roman Catholic education. On December 10, 1934 the Congress of Colombia presented a law to give women the right to study. The law generated controversy, as did any issue related to women's rights at the time. Educational rights School girls in Colombia Before 1933 women in Colombia were only allowed schooling until middle school level education. Liberal congressman Jorge Eliécer Gaitán defended the decree Number 1972 of 1933 to allow women to receive higher education schooling, while the conservative Germán Arciniegas opposed it. The decree passed and was signed by the Liberal government of Alfonso López Pumarejo. The state-owned National University of Colombia was the first higher education institution to allow female students. Gerda Westendorp was admitted on February 1, 1935, to study medicine. Gabriela Peláez, who was admitted as a student in 1936 and graduated as a lawyer, became the first female to ever graduate from a university in Colombia. In 1936, María Carulla founded the first school of social works under the support of the Our Lady of the Rosary University. After this, women began to be seen by many as equal to men for their academic achievements, creativity, and discipline. At the same time, citizens began to support the idea of citizenship for women following the example of other countries. The constant political violence, social issues, and economic problems were among the main subjects of study for women, mainly in the areas of family violence and couple relationships, and also in children abuse. Legal contracts rights A group of women led by Georgina Fletcher met with then-president of Colombia Enrique Olaya Herrera with the intention of asking him to support the transformation of the Colombian legislation regarding women's rights to administer properties. The law was named ley sobre Régimen de Capitulaciones Matrimoniales (\\"Law about marriage capitulations regime\\") which was later proposed in congress in December 1930 by Ofelia Uribe as a constitutional reform. The law's main objective was to allow women to administer their properties and not their husbands, male relatives or tutors, as had been the case. The move generated a scandal in congress. It did not pass, and later generated persecutions and plotting against the group of women. As leader of the group, Georgina Fletcher was persecuted and isolated. The Régimen de Capitulaciones Matrimoniales was once again presented in congress in 1932 and approved into Law 28 of 1932. Suffrage rights Women's right to suffrage was granted by Colombian dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in 1954, but had its origins in the 1930s with the struggle of women to acquire full citizenship. In 1957 women first voted in Colombia on a plebiscite. Family life Cohabitation is very common in this country, and the majority of children are born outside of marriage. In the 2000s, 55,8% of births were to cohabiting mothers, 22,9% to married mothers, and 21,3% to single mothers (not living with a partner). Family life has changed dramatically during the last decades: in the 1970s, 68,8% of births were inside marriage; and divorce was legalized only in 1991.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19390164 Issues Domestic violence In the 1990s, Colombia enacted Ley 294 de 1996, in order to fight domestic violence.http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/colombia.dv.96.htm In 2008, Ley 1257 de 2008, a comprehensive law against violence against women was encted.http://www.sdmujer.gov.co/images/pdf/ley1257.pdf Marital rape was criminalized in 1996.http://www.omct.org/files/2004/07/2409/eng_2003_04_colombia.pdf Article 42 of the Constitution of Colombia provides that “Family relations are based on the equality of rights and duties of the couple and on the mutual respect of all its members.

Life Ulrich Horstmann finished his studies of English and Philosophy in 1974 with a doctoral thesis on Edgar Allan Poe. He was a lecturer at the University of South Africa in Pretoria. After habilitation in 1983 he lectured at the University of Münster until 1987. Since 1991 he has been a professor of English and American literature at the University of Giessen. He lives in Marburg/Lahn. Since 1976 Ulrich Horstmann has published, alongside scientific work, essays, novels and plays of his own, as well as translations from English. In 1983 he became known for his treatise The Beast, in which he promoted a philosophical position which was diametrically opposed to the peace movement Zeitgeist of those years: He advocated a philosophy of \\"escape of mankind\\" which aims for an early self- destruction of the human race by means of the accumulated nuclear weapons found in arsenals around the world. He pushed the pessimism and misanthropy of his mentor Schopenhauer to the extreme. It has been proved by the author's subsequent publications which are written with an attitude of nihilism and extreme distaste for the world, that The Beast was in no way, as suspected by some critics, a particularly bitter satire. Ulrich Horstmann is a member of PEN Germany and received the Kleist Prize in 1988 after being nominated by Günter Kunert. Thought Horstmann puts forth the theory that mankind has been pre-programmed to eliminate itself in the course of history—and also all its memory of itself—through war (thermonuclear, genetic, biological), genocide, destruction of its sustaining environment, etc. “The final aim of history is a crumbling field of ruins. Its final meaning is the sand blown through the eye-holes of human skulls.” Ulrich Horstmann Through his analysis of history, he has concluded that our species is engaged in a constant process of armament, with the eventual end goal of wiping itself out through war. History, for him, is nothing more than a slaughterhouse . . . “the place of a skull and charnel house of a mad, incurably bloodthirsty slaughtering, flaying and whetting, of an irresistible urge to destroy to the last.” Although inspired by the already extreme philosophy of Philipp Mainländer, Horstmann ends up with an even more explicit solution regarding the problem of human existence. In his book The Beast he actually goes so far as to suggest the use of nuclear weapons in order to bring forth the extinction of the human race. For him only the annihilation of life would give rise to a universal redemption in which we would once again achieve the existential peace of inorganic matter.

Shulman (born May 10, 1967) is President and Chief Executive Officer of OneMain Financial. Shulman is a former U.S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Early life and education Shulman was born in 1967 to Jeff and Celia Shulman. He grew up in Oakwood, Ohio (Greater Dayton Area). He graduated from Oakwood High School in 1985. Shulman holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams College, a Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and a Juris Doctor degree magna cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center. Pre-IRS business career Shulman co-founded and served as Executive Vice President of FoundryOne, Inc., a company focused on building and spinning off technology- focused startups within major corporations. Previously, Shulman was Vice President of Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and served as a senior policy advisor and as Chief of Staff for the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service.List of Staff Members (house.gov) Shulman began his career as a consultant at A.T. Kearney in New York City. Shulman came to NASD in 2000. He first served as Executive Vice President, Technology Strategy and Corporate Development, before being promoted to President, Markets, Services and Information. He then was promoted to Vice Chairman of NASD, and later became Vice Chairman of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). He played a key role in the merger between New York Stock Exchange regulatory operations and NASD, which created FINRA. At NASD, he directed NASD's efforts to restructure itself as solely a regulator and spin-off its market subsidiaries. He led the negotiations that resulted in the sale of both the NASDAQ Stock Market and the American Stock Exchange. He also oversaw NASD's efforts to become active in the fixed income markets by launching the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), NASD's real-time corporate bond market regulatory and information system. He was the lead executive in negotiating corporate bond transparency with the financial services industry, and hired the team that launched the product. Another main area of focus was heading the successful effort by NASD to modernize its technology systems. He also led NASD into new business segments, and helped it to re-vamp its surveillance technology in order to win contracts to regulate other exchanges besides Nasdaq. IRS Commissioner Nomination On November 22, 2007, Republican President George W. Bush announced he would appoint Shulman to be Commissioner of the IRS, despite the fact that Shulman had donated to the Democratic National Committee in the 2004 election.http://www.politicalmoneyline.com/tr/tr_MG_IndivDonor.aspx?sMP=1&sText;=shulman%2c+douglas&sCycle;=2004 When being questioned by the U.S. Senate Finance Committee in January 2008, he said that the IRS must be \\"competent, fair and impartial.\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T_ouAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=KaIFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1360,6941506&dq;=douglas+shulman&hl;=en On March 14, 2008, he was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate to be the 47th IRS Commissioner. Shortly after President Obama was re-elected in the 2012 presidential election, on November 11, 2012, Shulman finished serving out his full term as Commissioner. Stimulus packages In March and April 2008, one of his first duties was to send out 77 million tax rebates after congress passed the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. He also led the IRS after congress passed Obama's $787 billion economic recovery stimulus package. As part of the stimulus package, also referred to as the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, about one third of the $787 billion was administered through the tax system. Some of the key provisions that the IRS administered under Shulman’s leadership were the first time home buyers credit, net operating loss carrybacks (which allowed businesses to get tax credits when credit lines were frozen), and expanded Earned Income Tax Credit. Offshore accounts One of Shulman’s signature initiatives was the cracking down of offshore tax evasion. He is largely credited with being the key leader in shifting the paradigm of tax evasion and bank secrecy. In August 2009, he persuaded Switzerland to turn over the identities of 4,450 Americans with secret UBS bank accounts. UBS paid a $780 million fine. This was the first time that a Swiss bank had ever broken Swiss bank secrecy, and is largely viewed as a watershed event in the erosion of bank secrecy and tax evasion. Under his leadership, the IRS launched multiple voluntary compliance programs—the offer was to have people who had been hiding money overseas to pay back taxes, pay a penalty, but avoid criminal prosecution. From 2009 to 2011, the IRS collected $4.4 billion from 33,000 people who had offshore accounts. He said it was an \\"amount we never thought we'd reach. If we catch people before they come in voluntarily, it's going to be a much worse outcome for the taxpayer.\\" In January 2012, he revived a program that would be even more strict toward offshore accounts. He said the \\"long-term goal is deterrence. We want to wake up and have the next generation of taxpayers not even think about hiding their assets overseas.\\" Healthcare reform The IRS was given major responsibilities for the money flows of the affordable care act. The provisions that the IRS needed to prepare for under Shulman’s leadership included the individual mandate, the employer mandate, insurance company reporting of fact of coverage, and financial data for exchanges to make determinations regarding who is eligible for tax credits. There were also a number of tax provisions in which the health care industry would pay taxes to help offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act, and tax credits for small businesses to buy insurance. The mandate that individuals buy insurance or pay a fine garnered a lot of attention. In April 2010, Shulman said that taxpayers' refunds in order to collect fines from those who don't buy health coverage via Affordable Health Care for America Act. In response to Republican arguments that the IRS would abuse their powers, he said he would not allow the IRS to be \\"too punitive.\\" According to the Congressional Budget Office, the fines would range from several hundred dollars to as much as 2.5% of household income. Modernizing the IRS's Technology While serving as commissioner, Shulman led a major modernization of the IRS's technology to streamline tax payment processing, facilitate compliance, and improve customer service. The core of the modernization was to move all tax returns to daily processing, as opposed to the historical batch processing of returns (every one or two weeks). The result was the customer service representatives could have access to accurate data and there was real time information to combat non-compliance, including refund fraud. The goal of daily processing was a goal that had eluded the IRS since it was first set in 1988.https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Commissioner-Doug-Shulman-Speaks-at- AICPA-Meeting When Shulman came to the IRS, the modernization effort was off- track and over budget. Under Shulman’s leadership, the program was turned around. In 2011, the Government Accountability Office listed the program as one of seven successful major IT acquisitions across government, an achievement that it attributes to strong management and oversight, and “executive-level focus and attention.” Shulman focused on completing the modernization during his term that would end in 2012. He recruited a new team to build the database and secured funding. On January 17, 2012 Shulman oversaw the transition to the Customer Account Data Engine 2, moving the data of 140 million taxpayers into a modern database environment. This was the first successful major upgrade of the IRS data repository for more than 50 years. In addition to modernizing IRS’s core technology, Shulman also significantly increased electronic filing of tax returns when he was Commissioner. This digitization effort led to more better customer service and more efficiency at the IRS. By the end of his tenure, approximately 80% of all individual tax returns were filed electronically. Policy on aiding Madoff victims The IRS released a number of guidelines to help the 4,800 victims of the Bernie Madoff $65 billion scandal. Shulman said the IRS will allow the amount of the theft loss to include the investor's unrecoverable investment for Ponzi scheme victims. Victims who are part of small businesses will be able to go back 5 years to recover investments and so-called \\"phantom profits\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V2NjAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=FXkNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3414,2004849&dq;=douglas+shulman+madoff+scandal&hl;=en Tea Party controversy / 2013 IRS scandal Douglas Shulman was the Commissioner of the IRS during some of the time when new criteria, including the name of organizations, were used to identify tax exempt applications for review. However, Douglas Shulman was not mentioned in the Inspector General report that uncovered and detailed this issue. In a congressional hearing held on May 21, 2013, Douglas Shulman denied responsibility for the policy, stating that he found out some facts, but not all the facts about a list of names, from Steven T. Miller and at that time he was also informed that the practice had been stopped and the issue had been referred to the Inspector General for review. In March 2012, he testified in front of the U.S. House of Representatives and told U.S. Congressman Charles Boustany \\"what’s been happening has been the normal back-and-forth that happens with the IRS. None of the alleged taxpayers, and obviously I can’t talk about individual taxpayers and I’m not involved in these, are in an examination process. They’re in an application process which they moved into voluntarily. There is absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back-and-forth that happens when people apply for 501(c)(4) status.\\" However, both Steven Miller, from whom Douglas Shulman found out about the inappropriate criteria, and Douglas Shulman stated that Douglas Shulman did not know about the inappropriate criteria in March 2012 when he made this statement. In May 2013, he told Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn “I certainly am not personally responsible for making a list that had inappropriate criteria on it. With that said, this happened on my watch, and I very much regret that this happened on my watch.” Post-IRS business career On July 13, 2018, OneMain Holdings, Inc., announced Shulman as its next President and Chief Executive Officer.https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/onemain-holdings-inc-names- doug-shulman-president-and-chief-executive-officer-2018-07-13-91593412 Earlier, he was an executive at BNY Mellonhttp://triblive.com/business/headlines/7515395-74/mellon-bank- shulman#axzz3OAFrYQiC and had been a Senior Advisor with McKinsey & Company.

The academy has no departments and focuses on conceptually driven practices and transdisciplinary work. The academy has about 50 students. The school is located in the street of Mejlgade in the Latin Quarter of Aarhus. Other recognized Art Academies in Denmark comprise the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen, and Funen Art Academy in Odense. There are other institutions which also use the name 'art academy', but none of these are state recognized as institutions of higher education.http://www.detfynskekunstakademi.dk/http://www.kunstakademiet.dk/  History  DJK was established in 1959 as an independent player in the Danish milieu of educations in the arts. In 1964 the academy moved into its current location in the buildings in Mejlgade 32-34. In 1969 DJK entered the state budget, effectively making all students of Danish citizenship eligible for state education stipend SU (Danish: abbr. for Statens Uddannelsesstøtte). In 1999 the academy decided to discontinue the traditional division into media- based departments (painting, sculpture, graphics, etc.) which was characteristic of the classical art academy, and today the academy offers all forms of teaching to all students regardless of year group. The building in Mejlgade was renovated in 2006.  Educational scope  The objective of the Jutland Art Academy is to teach and research within the visual arts, while developing an artistic and intellectual community of study and creation. It is essential for the academy that its activities reflect the fact that visual art must be in investigative dialogue with the constantly changing world of political, technological and economic conditions that shape our contemporary society. Students are encouraged to work in any given media (painting, sculpting, graphics, performance, new media etc.). The different modes of teaching at the school includes thematical workshops, reading groups and seminars, lectures, technical courses and various forms of individual guidance. The teaching does not include classical training, but focuses instead on individual subject matter and context. All lectures in every discipline are open for all the students during the entire study programme. All students are offered a small studio space. The education is carried out by a team of engaged and significant artists, all actively performing both nationally and internationally. During the education it is essential that the student is prepared for many different kinds of co-operation. The teaching language is Danish, in some cases English or other Scandinavian languages. The study consists of a 3-year basis education and a 2-year specialized education. Admission at the education takes place on the basis of an evaluation of the applicant's works and an interview between the admission committee and the applicant. 8-12 students are admitted each year.http://www.djk.nu/  Organization  The current rector of the school is art historian and curator Judith Schwarzbart, since March 2016. Former rectors are visual artist Jesper Rasmussen (2007–15) and visual artist Jytte Høy (1996-2007).http://www.djk.nu/ Jutland Art Academy receives funding from the Ministry of Culture Denmark, the Aarhus Municipality and various foundations and private sponsors.

TDCC datasheet 7,65 × 53 Arg. is a first-generation smokeless powder rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge developed for use in the Mauser Model 1889 rifle by Paul Mauser of the Mauser company. It is also known as 7.65×53mm Argentine, 7.65×53mm Argentine rimless, 7.65mm Argentine, 7.65×53mm Belgian Mauser or 7.65mm Belgian (in the United States) and 7.65×53mm Mauser (in Belgium). The 7.65×53mmR is a rimmed variant of the 7.65×53mm Mauser cartridge. Ballistically it is comparable to the also-rimmed .303 British cartridge. History The 7.65×53mm Mauser was the result of considerable experimentation by Paul Mauser to optimize the bullet diameter for use with the new smokeless propellant introduced as Poudre B in the 1886 pattern 8mm Lebel that started a military rifle ammunition revolution.Mauser Rifles and Pistols by W. H. B. Smith At the time of its development it was a high- performance smokeless-powder cartridge. This cartridge was loaded commercially by many manufacturers in the United States until about 1936. Hornady is the only major U.S. ammunition manufacturer to still produce this cartridge. Sporting ammunition in this caliber is still loaded in Europe. Norma, Prvi Partizan, and Fabricaciones Militares (FM) currently produce 7.65×53mm ammunition.Prvi Partizan Official website Boxer-primed cases are easily formed from .30-06 brass; resize and trim.

All sizes in millimeters (mm). 7.65×53mm Mauser maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 22.2 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 280 mm (1 in 11.02 in), 4 grooves, Ø lands = 7.65 mm, Ø grooves = 7.92 mm, land width = 4.20 mm and the primer type is large rifle. According to the official Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (CIP) rulings the 7.65×53mm Mauser can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In CIP member countries every rifle cartridge combination has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum pressure to certify fit for sale to consumers. This means that 7.65×53mm Mauser chambered arms in CIP regulated countries are currently (2013) proof tested at PE piezo pressure. The American .308 Winchester cartridge is a close ballistic twin of the 7.65×53mm Mauser. The .308 Winchester being a post World War II cartridge developed by Winchester to provide similar performance in a short bolt action format.

The term is typically used in artificial and biological neural network research. Computation In a computational neural network, a vector or set of inputs \\\\textbf{x} and outputs \\\\textbf{y}, or pre- and post-synaptic neurons respectively, are interconnected with synaptic weights represented by the matrix w, where for a linear neuron :y_j = \\\\sum_i w_{ij} x_i ~~\\\\textrm{or}~~ \\\\textbf{y} = w\\\\textbf{x}. where the rows of the synaptic matrix represent the vector of synaptic weights for the output indexed by j. The synaptic weight is changed by using a learning rule, the most basic of which is Hebb's rule, which is usually stated in biological terms as > Neurons that fire together, wire together. Computationally, this means that if a large signal from one of the input neurons results in a large signal from one of the output neurons, then the synaptic weight between those two neurons will increase. The rule is unstable, however, and is typically modified using such variations as Oja's rule, radial basis functions or the backpropagation algorithm. Biology For biological networks, the effect of synaptic weights is not as simple as for linear neurons or Hebbian learning. However, biophysical models such as BCM theory have seen some success in mathematically describing these networks. In the mammalian central nervous system, signal transmission is carried out by interconnected networks of nerve cells, or neurons. For the basic pyramidal neuron, the input signal is carried by the axon, which releases neurotransmitter chemicals into the synapse which is picked up by the dendrites of the next neuron, which can then generate an action potential which is analogous to the output signal in the computational case. The synaptic weight in this process is determined by several variable factors: * How well the input signal propagates through the axon (see myelination), * The amount of neurotransmitter released into the synapse and the amount that can be absorbed in the following cell (determined by the number of AMPA and NMDA receptors on the cell membrane and the amount of intracellular calcium and other ions), * The number of such connections made by the axon to the dendrites, * How well the signal propagates and integrates in the postsynaptic cell. The changes in synaptic weight that occur is known as synaptic plasticity, and the process behind long-term changes (long-term potentiation and depression) is still poorly understood. Hebb's original learning rule was originally applied to biological systems, but has had to undergo many modifications as a number of theoretical and experimental problems came to light.

The name in Norwegian is a reference to the resurrection of Jesus.Vaakevandring , (German) CrossOver. Retrieved 2007-11-30 Vaakevandring played symphonic black metal with influences from Norwegian folk music. History In 1996, Alexander Nygård and Trond Bjørnstad formed a pop band called Lothlorien with Morten Sigmund Magerøy and a local guitar player. Lothlorien's style became heavier and soon changed its name to Inertia. Trond left bass and began to do death growl vocals and the second guitar player started playing bass. Lothlorien got some internal problems because of religion. The second guitar player (then new bass player) wanted to write about darker subjects, and eventually left the band. Around the same time Pål and Ronny Hansen invited Magerøy to join them in their project \\"Signum Crusis\\". They rehearsed once and then Alexander Nygård became their guitarist. They changed the band name to \\"Korsferd\\". Morten played guitar, Ronny played bass and Pål Dæhlen played drums. Hansen concentrated on vocals and Trond became the bass player. By that time the band name was changed to Vaakevandring. The band achieved notable popularity for its Demo 98/99. It was produced and engineered by Stian Aarstad, the keyboard player of Dimmu Borgir. This caused a lot of rumors in the internet. The reason Stian wanted to mix their demo, was that he heard them at a show they played. He offered them a free session in studio, because he needed training in mixing and engineering. Their demo was finished in December 1998, and they have at this point made 1000 copies of it. It was released on cassette in Indonesia through THT Productions in the beginning of 2000. Next, the band recorded a song entitled \\"Fall of Man\\" for Endtime Productions' compilation In the Shadow of Death. Antestor's Lars Stokstad played guitars on that song. Both Hansen and Magerøy joined the notable band Antestor around this time while still were members of Vaakevandring. Entrevista a Vaakevandring de Noruega Pål Dæhlen joined Frosthardr. Vaakevandring's demo was re-released as a self-titled EP by the Norwegian label Momentum Scandinavia. It has become a classic of the unblack metal genre. They performed as co-headliners with Antestor at Sweden's Endtime Fest in 2007.Endtime Festival 2007 . Retrieved 2007-11-30 Antestor's guitarist Vemod (Lars Stokstad) played guitars for that show. Style and importance In the early 1990s the unblack metal scene was formed and it resented the satanism contained in black metal lyrics. The founder of unblack metal was Horde.\\"So the album was created with a prophetic, free, submissive, obedient, reverent, anti-Satan and Christian mindset.\\" – Horde: Interview with Son Of Man Records (retrieved 2007-11-30) The genre initially focused on Christian elementary content as the setting of the Father's Prayer, and issues such as conversion and salvation. The bands such as Antestor, Crimson Moonlight and Vaakevandring are believed to have taken a more emotional and philosophical approach to lyrics, as opposed to an exclusive evangelism approach. Vaakevandring transferred the development of the classic black metal in Scandinavian to the emotional dealing with philosophical and ideological content to the Christian part of the scene.\\"Our songs deal with personal challenges as well as on spiritual struggles.\\" -Pål Dæhlen Interview with CrossOver 2007 led to a revitalization of the project. In the wake of the Endtime Festival in Sweden, the band played as the headliner. Because of the personnel, they overlapped their program together with Antestor.

The older traditions of the formerly dominant Ile-Ife kingdom are largely oral in nature. Before Oyo Empire The history of the Yoruba people begins in Ile-Ife. This kingdom was founded by the deities Oduduwa and Obatala, who are believed to have created the world. Oduduwa was the first divine king of the Yoruba people, and Obatala fashioned the first human beings out of clay. It is said the Yoruba people believe that their civilization began at Ile-Ife where the gods descended to earth. The Ethnic group became popular internationally due to their trading with the Portuguese which gave them guns for their trade. The Yoruba were invaded by the Fulani in the early 1800s, which pushed the people to the South. In the late 1800s, they formed a treaty with the Fulani people and were colonized by the British in 1901. The people who lived in Yorubaland, at least by the seventh century BC, were not initially known as the Yoruba, although they shared a common ethnicity and language group. The historical Yoruba develop in situ, out of earlier (Mesolithic) Volta-Niger populations, by the 1st millennium BC . Archaeologically, the settlement at Ile-Ife can be dated to the 4th century BC, with urban structures appearing in the 8th-10th Centuries. \\"Between 700 and 900 A.D. the city began to develop as a major artistic center,\\" And \\"by the 12th Century Ife artists were creating bronze, stone, and terracotta sculptures.\\" The phase of Ile-Ife before the rise of Oyo, ca. 1100–1600, is sometimes described as a \\"golden age\\" of Ile-Ife. Oyo Empire Ife was surpassed by the Oyo Empire as the dominant Yoruba military and political power between 1600 and 1800 AD. The nearby Benin Empire was also a powerful force between 1300 and 1850. Oyo developed in the 17th century and become one of the largest Yoruba kingdoms, while Ile-Ife remained as a religiously significant rival to its power at the site of the divine creation of the earth in Yoruba mythology. After Oduduwa's ascension in Ile-Ife, he had a son. This son later became the first ruler of the Oyo empire . The Oyo kingdom subjugated the kingdom of Dahomey. It traded with European merchants on the coast through Ajase. The wealth of the empire increased, and its political leaders wealth increased as well. This state of affairs continued until Oba Abiodun, Oyo's last great ruler, engaged his opponents in a bitter civil war that had a ruinous effect on economic development and the trade with the European merchants. The downfall of the kingdom came soon after, as Abiodun became concerned with little other than the display of royal wealth. Oyo's empire had collapsed by the 1830s. Like Oyo itself, most of the surrounding city states were controlled by Obas, elected priestly monarchs, and councils made up of Oloyes, recognised leaders of royal, noble, and often even common descent, who joined them in ruling over the kingdoms through a series of guilds and cults. Different states saw differing ratios of power between the kingship and the chiefs' council. Some, such as Oyo, had powerful, autocratic monarchs with almost total control, while in others such as the Ijebu city-states, the senatorial councils were supreme and the Ọba served as something of a figurehead. In all cases, however, Yoruba monarchs were subject to the continuing approval of their constituents as a matter of policy, and could be easily compelled to abdicate for demonstrating dictatorial tendencies or incompetence. The order to vacate the throne was usually communicated through an aroko or symbolic message, which usually took the form of parrots' eggs delivered in a covered calabash bowl by the Oloyes. Modern history Map of Yoruba people, West Africa (Nigeria), 1898 The Yoruba eventually established a federation of city-states under the political ascendancy of the city state of Oyo, located on the Northern fringes of Yorubaland in the savanna plains between the forests of present Southwest Nigeria and the Niger River. Following a Jihad led by Uthman Dan Fodio and a rapid consolidation of the Hausa city states of contemporary northern Nigeria, the Fulani Sokoto Caliphate invaded and annexed the buffer Nupe Kingdom. It then began to advance southwards into Ọyọ lands. Shortly afterwards, its armies overran the Yoruba military capital of Ilorin, and then sacked and destroyed Ọyọ-Ile, the royal seat of the Ọyọ Empire. Following this, Ọyọ-Ile was abandoned, and the Ọyọ retreated south to the present city of Oyo (formerly known as \\"Ago d'Oyo\\", or \\"Oyo Atiba\\") in a forested region where the cavalry of the Sokoto Caliphate was less effective. Further attempts by the Sokoto Caliphate to expand southwards were checked by the Yoruba who had rallied in defence under the military leadership of the ascendant Ibadan clan, which rose from the old Oyo Empire, and of the Ijebu city-states. However, the Oyo hegemony had been dealt a mortal blow. The other Yoruba city-states broke free of Oyo dominance, and subsequently became embroiled in a series of internecine conflicts that soon metamorphosed into a full scale civil war. These events weakened the southern Yorubas in their resistance to British colonial and military invasions. In 1960, greater Yorubaland was subsumed into the Federal Republic of Nigeria.Gat, Azar. \\"War in human civilization\\" Oxford University Press, 2006, pg 275. The historical records of the Yoruba, which became more accessible in the nineteenth century with the more permanent arrival of the Europeans, tell of heavy Jihad raids by the mounted Fulani warriors of the north as well as of endemic intercity warfare amongst the Yoruba themselves. Archaeological evidence of the greatness of their ancient civilization in the form of, amongst other things, impressive architectural achievements like Sungbo's Eredo that are centuries old, nevertheless abound.Gat, Azar. \\"War in human civilization\\" Oxford University Press, 2006, pg 275.  Major towns, cities, and the diaspora  Many Yoruba peoples organize themselves into villages, towns and cities in the form of kingdoms. Major cities include Ile-Ife, Oyo, Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Ijebu-Ode and Akure. Some towns and cities of the Yoruba people are collectively considered to be clans due to similarities in their origins and cultures. A number of other cities, though non-Yoruba, have histories of being influenced by the Yoruba. These cities are Warri, Benin city, Okene, and Auchi. The Yoruba diaspora has two main groupings. The first one is composed of the recent immigrants that moved to the United States and the United Kingdom after the political and economic changes in the 1960s and 1980s. The second group is much older, and is composed of descendants of kidnapped Yoruba who arrived as slaves to countries such as the United States, Cuba, Trinidad, Brazil, Grenada, and other countries in the Caribbean and South America in the 19th century. Much like in the case of Yorubaland itself, many people who belong to the Yoruba diaspora are Christians or Muslims. Yoruba traditional worship remains influential in diaspora communities, however.

Blunt was a Sandy Hook pilot boat acquired by the Union Navy during the American Civil War in 1861. See George W. Blunt (1856) for more details. She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat as well as a dispatch boat in support of the Union Navy blockade of Confederate waterways. Towards the war's end, she was reconfigured as a rescue and salvage ship. Her new task was to remove many of the shipwrecks, hulks, and other in-water debris of war. Construction and service - commissioned in 1861  The G. W. Blunt, formerly the pilot schooner George W. Blunt, was a wooden two-masted schooner built by Daniel Westervelt in New York and launched 6 September 1856. The schooner was acquired by the Navy in New York City on 23 November 1861.Causing some confusion is the second pilot boat, replacing the 1856 schooner and named George W.

She was commissioned on 4 December 1861 and acting Master was Henry Sherwood who was in command.  Union Navy service  Arriving at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 11 December 1861, G. W. Blunt served as a mail and dispatch boat for the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron between Charleston, South Carolina, Wassaw Sound, Georgia, and Fernandina, Florida. En route to Georgetown, South Carolina, on 19 April 1862 she captured the blockade-running schooner Wave with a cargo of cotton. For the following year the G. W. Blunt was on a blockade duty off Charleston and assisted in capturing several more vessels. She departed Port Royal, South Carolina, for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 7 May 1863 and was decommissioned for repairs on 13 May 1863. Recommissioned on 2 June 1863, the G. W. Blunt rejoined the blockading squadron off Charleston, patrolling the many small inlets and bays near the main harbor. Cruising on Charleston station on 1864, the G. W.

The region is under territorial claim between three countries (more Territorial claims in Antarctica). The single Ukrainian Antarctic station is named after Russian and Ukrainian mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky (1863–1945) who was the first president of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Before being handed over to Ukraine in 1996, the research base for almost half of century existed as a British research base.Akademik Vernadskyi Antarctic station, chronology of events (Станція АКАДЕМІК ВЕРНАДСЬКИЙ: хроніка подій).

Coordination and operational administration of the base is conducted by the National Antarctic Scientific Center of Ukraine which is part of Ministry of Education and Sciences of Ukraine. The closest neighboring Antarctic stations are Palmer Station of the United States and Yelcho Base of Chile, reopened in 2015. Wordie House History Map of Gerlache Strait region, Cartographic base: Antarctic Digital Database www.add.scar.org/ British Faraday Station (Station F) The Faraday Station existed for 49 years and 31 days (7 January 1947 – 6 February 1996) operated by FIDS and BAS. The research base was established in 1947 at the Wordie House site on Winter Island by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (today British Antarctic Survey) as Argentine Islands. The primary purpose of the station was to research geophysics, meteorology, and ionospherics. In May 1954 the base moved from Winter Island to the present site on adjacent Galindez Island where the main building was named \\"Coronation House\\" in honor of the 1953 coronation of Elizabeth II. The personnel of the British Argentine Islands station (later Faraday Station) sometimes used the Argentine Groussac refuge station at Petermann Island. On 15 August 1977 it was renamed as Station F — Faraday soon after the Argentine Air Force established own military base at Southern Thule earlier in November 1976 (see Corbeta Uruguay base) during 1970–1980s contestation of the region between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The British base was renamed Faraday Station in honour of British scientist Michael Faraday. In September 1977 at Rasmussen Island was planted memorial cross in honor of G H Hargreaves, M A Walker and G J Whitfield. On 14 August 1982 another memorial cross was planted at Petermann Island in honor of A C Morgan, K P Ockleton and J Coll. Ukrainian Vernadsky Station Ukraine took over the operation of the base in February 1996, which was sold by the UK for a symbolic one pound. The cost of disassembling the base with good environmental practices and standards would be too costly. The National Antarctic Scientific Center of Ukraine continues a programme of meteorology, upper atmospheric physics, geomagnetism, ozone, seismology, glaciology, ecology, biology and physiology research. Climate The climate of the base is classified as marine subantarctic. The climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding Pacific Ocean, moderating winter and summer temperatures. Thus, winter temperatures rarely fall below owing to the warmer waters while in summer, the cool waters and snow cover causes temperatures to rarely reach above . The mean annual temperature is although within the last decade, temperatures have risen with much of it in winter and autumn. Being located in the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, the climate is dominated by the low pressure systems that develop over the Pacific Ocean and move eastwards towards the peninsula mountain range. This process leads to frequent precipitation and strong winds in the base. Unpredictable and short snowfalls and snowstorms occur often. On average, the base receives 300 days with snow per year. Anticyclone weather patterns caused by high pressure systems in the interior of Antarctica or from the north are rare. In the cases that they occur, when the weather is influenced by the high pressure system from the interior of the continent, cold air masses from the south moves northwards. This can occasionally lead to foggy conditions and hoarfrost. Statistics Infrastructure Main complex The station consists of nine buildings standing on rock foundations. A 1961 extension at the east end of the hut provided living quarters for 15 people. Major alterations in 1980 updated the living and working accommodation. A two-storey extension provides sleeping accommodation for 24 people, a clothing store, boiler room and reverse osmosis plant on the ground floor. Upstairs are a lounge, library, dining room, gift store and kitchen. Visitors could purchase $3 shots of horilka (made on the premises) up until 2016 in the lounge. The old part of the building is now mostly laboratories and work rooms, together with the surgery and washrooms. The generator shed was erected in 1978-79, with the old one now used as a frozen food store and a carpenter's workshop. Other buildings include two non- magnetic buildings, a balloon launching shed (now skidoo garage), and a general store. Wordie House Not part of the current Ukrainian Research Base, yet associated with the history of preceding British Faraday Station, the Wordie House served as a foundation of new British Antarctic station. Built on the site of an earlier British Graham Land Expedition sometime in 1935–36, it was destroyed, possibly by a tsunami, in 1946.History of Faraday (Station F). British Antarctic Survey. The hut was named \\"Wordie House\\" after Sir James Wordie, a member of 1914–16 Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition who visited during its construction. To commemorate the historic landmark, on 19 May 1995 the Wordie House at Winter Island has been restored and designated as Historic Site and Monument No. 62. After Faraday base complex at Galindez Island was transferred to Ukraine, the new Vernadsky base personnel continued temporarily supervise the Wordie House. In January 2007 the landmark was inspected by conservation architect for BAS and since October 2009 the Wordie House is managed by United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust under a \\"Memorandum of Understanding\\" with BAS. Rasmussen Hut At Rasmussen Island there is a hut that was under official use in Mar 1984–6 Feb 1996.History of Rasmussen Hut (Station RS). British Antarctic Survey. Currently it is considered as closed, yet used occasionally by Ukrainian personnel from Vernadsky Station for emergency refuge shelter and recreational. Operations Climate research As one of the longest operating bases in Antarctica, Vernadsky Station has been the subject of scientific research studies on long-term temperature trends that indicate global warming. A study published in the April 2013 issue of the International Journal of Climatology examined the daily observed temperature at the Faraday/Vernadsky station from 1947 to 2011. It concluded that “Faraday/Vernadsky is experiencing a significant warming trend of about 0.6°C/decade (1.1°F) over the last few decades. Concurrently, the magnitude of extremely cold temperatures has reduced.”Vernadsky Station -- TravelPod Postal services and tourism Vernadsky Station operates several services for visiting tourists. A post office accepts postcards at a cost of US$2 each. This is one of only a few post offices where visitors may send mail from Antarctica. Stamps for letters cost $6. Mail will take several months to be delivered. In addition to selling postage and accepting outgoing mail, the post office sells commemorative postcards and envelopes for $2 to $3 each.

Commissioner, 344 U.S. 6 (1952), is a United States Supreme Court case regarding taxation. The case involves taxpayers who liquidated a corporation in 1937. The taxpayers (properly) reported the income from the liquidation as long-term capital gains, thus obtaining a preferential tax rate. Subsequent to the liquidation in 1944, the taxpayers were required to pay a judgment arising from the affairs of the liquidated corporation. The taxpayers classified this payment as an ordinary business loss, which would allow them to take a greater deduction for the loss than would be permitted for a capital loss.. The \\"Arrowsmith Doctrine\\" is a principle of United States Federal Income tax law that holds that financial restorations associated with prior income items take the same tax \\"flavor\\" as the prior income items. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue characterized the payment of the judgment as part of the original liquidation transaction, and therefore the loss was a capital loss and not an ordinary business loss. The Tax Court disagreed with the Commissioner and found it to be an ordinary business loss. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Tax Court and held it to be a capital loss. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that it was a capital loss. Allowing the income from the liquidation to be taxed as a capital gain, while allowing loss payments out of that income to be deducted as an ordinary business expense would result in a windfall for the taxpayers.Arrowsmith, 344 U.S. at 11. They would gain a double benefit by paying a lower tax on capital gain income, but would be able to offset high- rate income by using the ordinary loss deduction. The taxpayers principally relied on the well-settled rule that each tax year stands alone.United States v. Lewis, . However, the Supreme Court held treating the proceeds of the liquidation consistently did not violate this rule, as it in no way attempts to reopen or amend the tax filings from 1937-1940.Arrowsmith, 344 U.S. at 9-10. This case was decided prior to the enactment of Sec. 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code, however that statute would not have changed the outcome in this particular case.

Born in Marlfield, County Tipperary, English first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of nineteen when he first linked up with the Tipperary junior teams as a dual player. He made his senior hurling debut during the 1953–54 league after already being included on the senior football team. English went on to play a key role for over a decade and won five All-Ireland medals, seven Munster medals and eight National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner- up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, English won four Railway Cup medals. At club level he won several championship medals in various grades with Marlfield. Throughout his career English made 36 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1967 championship. In retirement from playing English became involved in team management and coaching. He was a long-serving selector on several All- Ireland-winning teams. English is widely regarded as one of Tipperary's greatest ever players. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at midfield on the Tipperary Hurling Team of the Century. Playing career Club English played his club hurling with his local club Marlfield GAA. He enjoyed some success by never won a senior county title. Junior English first played for Tipperary as a member of the junior hurling team in 1950. He was added to the junior football team the following year as Tipperary claimed the provincial title following a fourteen year absence. The 3–6 to 1–4 defeat of Kerry gave English a Munster medal. Two years later English was a key member of the junior hurling team once again. A narrow 4–7 to 4–6 provincial final defeat of Cork, after an earlier draw, gave him a Munster medal in that code. On 11 October 1953 Tipperary hosted Warwickshire at Thurles Sportsfield in the All-Ireland decider. A 4–10 to 3–3 victory gave English an All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship medal. Senior =Beginnings= English made his senior debut for Tipperary during the 1953–54 National League. It was a successful campaign for Tipperary, with English winning a first league medal following a 3–10 to 1–4 defeat of Kilkenny. Tipperary retained their league title in 1955, with English collecting a second winners' medal following a 3–5 to 1–5 defeat of Wexford. In spite of a lack of championship success, English won a third league medal in four seasons in 1957 following a 3–11 to 2–7 defeat of Kilkenny once again. =First All-Ireland= In 1958 English won a first Munster medal as Tipperary regained the provincial crown following a 4–12 to 1–5 trouncing of reigning champions Waterford. Tipperary later defeated Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 7 September 1958. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley. Liam Devaney, Donie Nealon and Larry Keane all scored goals for Tipperary in the first-half, while Tony Wall sent a seventy- yard free untouched to the Galway net. Tipperary won the game by 4–9 to 2–5 giving English his first All-Ireland medal. English won a fourth league medal in 1959 following a 0–15 to 0–7 defeat of Waterford, however, Tipperary subsequently surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns. Tipperary asserted their dominance in 1960 by retaining the league title with a 2–15 to 3–8 defeat of Cork. It was English's fifth winners' medal in that competition. He later won a second Munster medal following a narrow 4–13 to 4–11 defeat of Cork in what has been described as the toughest game of hurling ever played. This victory allowed Tipperary to advance directly to an All-Ireland final meeting with Wexford on 4 September 1960. A certain amount of over-confidence was obvious in the Tipperary camp, particularly in trainer Phil Purcell's comment that no player was capable of marking Jimmy Doyle. The game ended in remarkable circumstances as the crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the referee's whistle for the end of the game. When the crowd were finally moved off the pitch Tipperary continued playing with only twelve men, but Wexford won on a score line of 2–15 to 0–11. It was English's first All- Ireland defeat. =Total dominance= 1961 saw English collect a sixth league medal following a 6–6 to 4–9 defeat of Waterford. He later added a third Munster medal to his collection, as old rivals Cork were downed by 3–6 to 0–7. The absence of the All-Ireland semi-final allowed Tipperary to advance directly to the final itself, with Dublin's first native hurling team providing the opposition on 3 September 1961. The game was a close run thing, however, Tipp held on to win by 0–16 to 1–12. It was English's second All- Ireland medal. In 1962 Tipperary were still the kingpins of Munster. A 5–14 to 2–3 trouncing of Waterford in the decider gave English a fourth Munster medal. Tipperary's nemesis of two years earlier, Wexford, waited in Croke Park to test them once again in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1962. Wexford, however, were not the force of old and the side got off to possibly the worst start ever by a team in a championship decider. After just ninety seconds the Leinster champions were down by two goals, however, the game turned out to be much closer than people expected. Tipp eventually secured the win on a score line of 3–10 to 2–11, giving English a third All-Ireland medal. After losing the following year's Munster final to Waterford in one of the hurling shocks of the decade, Tipperary bounced back in 1964 with English collecting a seventh league medal. Tipperary later cantered casually past Cork by fourteen points in the provincial decider, giving English a fifth Munster medal. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against Tipperary. John \\"Mackey\\" McKenna scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1–8 to 0–6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Seán McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5–13 to 2–8. It was English's fourth All-Ireland medal. In 1965 English won an eighth and final league medal as New York were narrowly defeated on an aggregate score of 6–19 to 5–20. Tipperary demolished all opposition in the provincial championship once again and a 4–11 to 0–5 trouncing of Cork gave English a sixth Munster medal. Wexford were Tipp's opponents in the subsequent All- Ireland final on 5 September 1965, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipperary on that occasion by 2–16 to 0–10, courtesy of a brace of goals by Seán McLoughlin. The win gave English a fifth All-Ireland medal. =Decline= After surrendering their provincial crown in 1966, Tipperary bounced back the following year, with English winning a seventh Munster medal following a 4–12 to 2–6 defeat of Clare. On 3 September 1967 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. Tipperary looked like continuing their hoodoo over their near rivals as they took a 2–6 to 1–3 lead at half-time. Goalkeeper Ollie Walsh was the hero for Kilkenny as he made a series of spectacular saves, however, the team lost Eddie Keher and Tom Walsh to injury in the second half. In spite of this, Kilkenny laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over the team since 1922, and a 3–8 to 2–7 victory resulted in defeat for Tipperary. The defeat brought the curtain down on English's inter- county career. Inter-provincial English also lined out for Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won Railway Cup medals in 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1963. Post-playing career In retirement from playing English continued his involvement on the inter-county scene as a selector. He was a key member of the backroom team when Tipperary won both Munster and All- Ireland titles in 1971. In the 1980s English served as a selector under Babs Keating. Together with former player Donie Nealon they guided Tipp to three successive Munster titles and an All-Ireland title in 1989. In 2000 English was chosen, by popular opinion, to partner Mick Roche at midfield on the Tipperary Hurling Team of the Century.

She and her younger sister were raised in Fremont Place, an upper-class neighborhood of Los Angeles, by her uncle Harry Cohn, the founder of Columbia Pictures. Leonore and her younger sister, Judith, attended the Page Boarding School for Girls in Pasadena. Harry Cohn's wife, Rose, raised the girls as Christian Scientists. Leonore Cohn graduated from Stanford University in 1940 with a B.A. After graduating, she married Beldon Katleman, whose family owned real estate and a national parking lot chain; they had a daughter, Diane, but the marriage ended in divorce after a few years. In 1946, she married Lewis Rosenstiel, the multimillionaire founder of the Schenley liquor distillery, and they had a daughter named Elizabeth;https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/18/archives/miss-rosenstiel-and-jh- kabler-3d-lawyer-are-wed.html that marriage, too, ended in divorce. She and Walter Annenberg, then editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, met in 1950 at a party in Florida and the two were married the following year. Ambassador's wife Upon her husband's appointment as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1969, Mrs. Annenberg ordered a renovation of the thirty-five room Winfield House, the ambassador's official London residence. The total cost of the project was about US$1 million and took six months to complete. While in London, Leonore founded the American Friends of Covent Garden, an organization designed to foster goodwill between the U.S. and Great Britain through musical expression. Chief of Protocol Walter and Leonore Annenberg with President Ronald Reagan, 1981 Annenberg with former Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter during a flight to the funeral of Anwar Sadat, October 1981 The Annenbergs contributed substantially to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, and upon Reagan's election in 1981, Lee Annenberg was named as Chief of Protocol of the United States. This position placed her in charge of advising the President, Vice President, and Secretary of State on matters dealing with diplomatic protocol, and formally welcoming foreign dignitaries upon their arrival to the United States. Annenberg oversaw a staff of 60 who worked on myriad details, ranging from the choice of the state gifts that will be given to the guest, to the bathrooms the foreign delegation may visit. She said of her position, \\"It's all about making your guests feel respected and welcome\\". Annenberg attracted some controversy during her tenure when she curtsied before the visiting Prince Charles upon arriving for a diplomatic visit, commentators saying it was unseemly in a republic which gained its independence from the same monarchy. As Chief of Protocol, she achieved the rank of Ambassador. Friends of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the Annenbergs hosted the Reagans annually at their Rancho Mirage, California, estate, \\"Sunnylands\\". Annenberg resigned her post in January 1982, stating that she wanted to spend more time with her husband. Philanthropy and committee work After leaving her post at the State Department, Lee Annenberg began work to promote and enhance cultural appreciation in the United States. She and her husband continued to donate money to worthy causes as philanthropists. In 2001, Annenberg was awarded the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. Upon being presented the award, she explained why she and her husband donated to causes as philanthropists: > Walter and I believe that education is the foundation of a democratic > society. When asked what motivates his philanthropic work, my husband has > responded with a very powerful statement: 'I regard my philanthropic work as > an investment in the future of America. It is the most effective way I can > serve my country and help to ensure its benefits for the next generation.' Mrs. Annenberg served many charitable organizations and on many committees. Stemming from her interest in and endowments to the arts, she was a trustee emerita and a member of the Acquisitions Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, member of the Board of Trustees of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, one of the managing directors of The Metropolitan Opera, honorary trustee and former board president of the Palm Springs Art Museum, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. Mrs. Annenberg was chairwoman emerita of the Foundation of Art and Preservation in Embassies, and a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. She was also a member of the Distinguished Daughters of Pennsylvania and an active trustee emeritus of the University of Pennsylvania. She served on the governing boards of both Annenberg Schools for Communication. In 1993, she and her husband, Walter, were awarded the National Medal of Arts.Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. Later life Leonore and Walter Annenberg with President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan, 1981. Walter Annenberg died on October 1, 2002, aged 94. Lee Annenberg succeeded her husband as chairman and president of the Annenberg Foundation, an organization founded by her late husband which funds nonprofit organizations as well as education institutes and programs of the arts. She continued to donate money to worthy causes in the fields of science, education, and art until her death. In 2006, she was ranked as the 382nd wealthiest person in the world by Forbes magazine, and the 488th in 2007. Annenberg, in 2007, was the 165th richest person in the United States, according to Forbes, with a net worth of 2.5 billion dollars. Annenberg traveled to Washington, D.C., in May 2007 to attend the state dinner for Queen Elizabeth II, hosted by President George W. Bush. The following month, she accepted the prestigious Philadelphia Award, an honor given to those in the Philadelphia region who worked to better the area. Most recently before her death, Annenberg became an honorary board member of the Richard Nixon Foundation and an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Arts. Death Lee Annenberg resided in Rancho Mirage, California, prior to her death on March 12, 2009, aged 91. According to a family spokesperson, Leonore Annenberg died at Eisenhower Medical Center of natural causes. At the time of her death, Annenberg had been in declining health. At the announcement of her death, statements were issued by former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, as well as former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Mrs. Reagan called Annenberg \\"a dear and longtime friend\\" and praised the Annenbergs' philanthropic work as having \\"left an indelible print on education in the United States\\".

Gartree is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Constructed on the western part of the site which was previously RAF Market Harborough Gartree Prison opened in 1965, and was originally a Category C training centre, but its status was quickly upgraded to a maximum security prison. The prison is infamous for a daring helicopter escape in 1987. The breakout remains the only one of its type to have been carried out in the United Kingdom. On 10 December 1987 at 3.15 pm, John Kendall and Sydney Draper were sprung from Gartree's exercise yard with the aid of a hijacked Bell 206 JetRanger helicopter. Kendall was a gangland boss serving eight years while Draper was serving a life sentence for murder. The escape caused great controversy at the time and led to a tightening of security at the jail. Kendall was recaptured 10 days later, but Draper remained on the run for another 13 months. In 1992 Gartree was downgraded from a category A to a category B training prison. Since then the population of life sentenced prisoners at Gartree grew, and in 1997 the prison's role changed to that of a main life prisoner centre. In a 2003 report the Board of Visitors criticised Gartree Prison for a serious shortage of staff, and budget cuts which were having a significant impact on services at the jail. The report noted that despite more than 30 proven allegations of racial discrimination between prisoners, there were not enough resources at the prison to release a member of staff to train as a race relations officer. In June 2004 a scheme to support older prisoners was launched at Gartree Prison. This was in response to the fact that Gartree had one of the highest number of older prisoners in the country, holding 400 inmates aged over 50, with 17 aged over 60 and three in their 70s. The scheme which was backed by Age Concern was designed to work with older prisoners to promote access to their rights and discuss services within the prison. The prison today Gartree Prison currently has Category B status, and many of its inmates are long-term prisoners serving life sentences. Most prisoners are employed in prison workshops or in the prison gardens, however there is a small learning department which provides education including offending behaviour programmes. 2013 X Factor winner Sam Bailey is a former Prison Officer at the prison.

It is an epithelial malignancy characterized by the histologic appearance of signet ring cells. Primary SRCC tumors are most often found in the glandular cells of the stomach (SRCC originates in the stomach in 90 percent of patients), and less frequently in the breast, gallbladder, urinary bladder, and pancreas. SRCCs do not normally form in the lungs, though a few incidences have been reported. Among colorectal cancers, the prevalence of SRCC is less than one percent. Though incidence and mortality of gastric cancer has declined in many countries over the past 50 years, there has been an increase in occurrences of gastric SRCC- type cancers. SRCC tumors grow in characteristic sheets, which makes diagnosis using standard imaging techniques, like CT and PET scans, less effective.  Causes  Some cases are inherited, and these cases are often caused by mutations in the CDH1 gene, which encodes the important cell–cell adhesion glycoprotein E-cadherin. Somatic mutations of the APC gene have also been implicated in the development of gastric SRCCs. The role of other risk factors in gastric cancer such as salt-preserved food, smoking, auto-immune gastritis are not well studied in SRCC.  Mechanism of formation  SRCCs are dedifferentiated adenocarcinomas that lose the capability for cell–cell interaction. Highly differentiated adenocarcinomas form SRCCs via a loss of adherens and tight junctions that typically separate MUC4, a mucin protein, and ErbB2, an oncogenic receptor. When MUC4 and ErbB2 are able to interact, they trigger an activation loop. As a result, the ErbB2/ErbB3 signaling pathway becomes constitutively activated, cell–cell interactions are lost and signet carcinomas are formed. Constitutive action of the ErbB2/ErbB3 complex also enhances cell growth. The mechanism of this malignant cancer is still unclear; however, it has been found that a colon carcinoma cell known as HCC2998 causes an increase in differentiated tumor production. The reason for this increase is due to active PI3K that are converted to a SRCC-like cells. Metastasis The pattern of metastasis is different for gastric signet cell carcinoma than for intestinal-type gastric carcinoma. The SRCC tumor is often seen in the peritoneum and has also been known to spread to lymphatic permeation of the lungs and to the ovaries, creating Krukenberg tumors. Cases of gastric carcinomas metastasizing to the breast and forming signet-ring cells have also been reported. One study suggests that when signet-ring cells are found in a breast tumor, the presence of gastric cancer should also be considered. Histology SRCCs are named due to their resemblance to signet rings, which result from the formation of large vacuoles full of mucin that displace the nucleus to the cell's periphery. Stomach cancers with both adenocarcinoma and some SRC (known as mixed-SRCC) exhibit more aggressive behavior than purely SRCC or non-SRCC histologies. A study of SRCC colorectal cancers compared mucin-rich SRCC tumors and mucin-poor SRCC tumors. They concluded that the latter more frequently demonstrated adverse histologic features such as lymphatic invasion, venous invasion and perineural invasion.  Treatment  Chemotherapy has relatively poor curative efficacy in SRCC patients and overall survival rates are lower compared to patients with more typical cancer pathology. SRCC cancers are usually diagnosed during the late stages of the disease, so the tumors generally spread more aggressively than non-signet cancers, making treatment challenging. In the future, case studies indicate that bone marrow metastases will likely play a larger role in the diagnosis and management of signet ring cell gastric cancer. In SRCC of the stomach, removal of the stomach cancer is the treatment of choice. There is no combination of chemotherapy which is clearly superior to others, but most active regimens include 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Cisplatin, and/or Etoposide. Some newer agents, including Taxol and Gemcitabine (Gemzar) are under investigation. In a single case study of a patient with SRCC of the bladder with recurrent metastases, the patient exhibited a treatment response to palliative FOLFOX-6 chemotherapy. There are reports of occasional pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy leading to pulmonary hypertension and coagulation problems that could be successfully treated with Imatinib. Prognosis by organ These aggressive tumors are generally diagnosed at advanced stages and survival is generally shorter. The prognosis of SRCC and its chemosensitivity with specific regimens are still controversial as SRCC is not specifically identified in most studies and its poor prognosis may be due to its more advanced stage. One study suggests that its dismal prognosis seems to be caused by its intrinsic tumor biology, suggesting an area for further research.  Bladder  Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder is extremely rare and patient survival is very poor and occurs mainly in men ages 38 to 83. However, one such patient treated with a radical cystectomy followed by combined S-1 and Cisplatin adjuvant chemotherapy did demonstrate promising long-term survival of 90 months.  Colorectal  Primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the colon and rectum (PSRCCR) is rare, with a reported incidence of less than 1 percent. It has a poor prognosis because symptoms often develop late and it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. Five-year survival rates in previous studies ranged from nine to 30 percent. Average survival was between 20 and 45 months. It tends to affect younger adults with higher likelihood of lymphovascular invasion. It is worth noting that the overall survival rate of patients with SRCC was significantly poorer than that of patients with mucinous or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. In advanced gastric cancers, the prognosis for patients with the SRCCs was significantly worse than for the other histological types, which can be explained by the finding that advanced SRCC gastric cancers have a larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, a deeper invasive depth and more Borrmann type 4 lesions than other types.  Stomach  When compared to adenocarcinoma stomach, SRCC in the stomach occurs more often in women and younger patients. Patients with SRCC of the stomach show similar clinicopathological features to patients with undifferentiated histology. A recent study found that patients with SRCC had a better prognosis than patients with undifferentiated gastric carcinoma. However, when narrowed to patients with only advanced stage gastric cancer, those with SRCC had a worse prognosis than other cell types.

The screenplay by Coslough Johnson and Stanley Z. Cherry focuses on a pair of senior citizens who, disguised as hippies, engage in a crime spree. Plot The title character, a widow whose savings have been depleted by her selfish, middle-aged children, Lulu and Ad, finds herself homeless when the bank forecloses on her mortgage. She becomes friendly with Bill Green, an aging itinerant salvaging the house's plumbing, who she soon discovers is really fugitive bank robber William Gruenwald. Hoping to recoup her losses from the bank that took her home, Bunny blackmails Bill into teaching her how to rob the institution in exchange for keeping his identity a secret. She wears a long blonde wig, oversized hat, and sunglasses, while he dons a fake beard, leather vest, and bell-bottom pants, and the two pull off the caper and escape on a 250cc Triumph TR25W Trophy motorcycle. Buoyed by their success, Bunny convinces Bill to join her in more heists, and the different modus operandi they use – setting free a canary to distract the guard, setting off smoke bombs – make it difficult for police lieutenant Horace Greeley and criminologist R. J. Hart to profile their suspects. Cast *Bette Davis as Bunny O'Hare *Ernest Borgnine as Bill Green *Jack Cassidy as Lieutenant Greeley *Jay Robinson as John C. Rupert *Joan Delaney as R. J.

The film marked the second on-screen pairing of Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine, who co-starred in The Catered Affair in 1956. The American International Pictures release was filmed partially on location in Albuquerque. New Mexico Governor David F. Cargo made a cameo appearance as a state trooper. The film led to two lawsuits for American International Pictures. Davis, who had script approval, was upset with changes made in editing, and she sued the company for loss of income and damage to her career for changing the film into a \\"slapstick\\" production instead of the \\"humorous social commentary\\" for which she had signed. The suit eventually was dropped. Writer Cherry sued for $13,400, the balance of his fee, and also asked for 5% of the film's net profits. The outcome is unknown.Bunny O'Hare at Turner Classic Movies Soundtrack The soundtrack includes the following vocals: *\\"Monday Man\\", written by Billy Strange and Keith Roberts, performed by Billy Curb *\\"Right Or Wrong\\", written by Mack David and Billy Curb, performed by Billy Curb *\\"The Ballad Of Bunny O'Hare\\", written by Mack David and Billy Curb, performed by Billy Curb Reception Bette Davis was unhappy with the final film and sued AIP for $3.3 million in damages.

Speech science involves anatomy, in particular the anatomy of the oro-facial region and neuroanatomy, physiology, and acoustics. Speech production Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body, 20th ed. 1918. Coronal section of larynx and upper part of trachea. Sagittal section of nose mouth, pharynx, and larynx. The production of speech is a highly complex motor task that involves approximately 100 orofacial, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and respiratory muscles. Precise and expeditious timing of these muscles is essential for the production of temporally complex speech sounds, which are characterized by transitions as short as 10 ms between frequency bands and an average speaking rate of approximately 15 sounds per second. Speech production requires airflow from the lungs (respiration) to be phonated through the vocal folds of the larynx (phonation) and resonated in the vocal cavities shaped by the jaw, soft palate, lips, tongue and other articulators (articulation). Respiration Respiration is the physical process of gas exchange between an organism and its environment involving four steps (ventilation, distribution, perfusion and diffusion) and two processes (inspiration and expiration). Respiration can be described as the mechanical process of air flowing into and out of the lungs on the principle of Boyle's law, stating that, as the volume of a container increases, the air pressure will decrease. This relatively negative pressure will cause air to enter the container until the pressure is equalized. During inspiration of air, the diaphragm contracts and the lungs expand drawn by pleurae through surface tension and negative pressure. When the lungs expand, air pressure becomes negative compared to atmospheric pressure and air will flow from the area of higher pressure to fill the lungs. Forced inspiration for speech uses accessory muscles to elevate the rib cage and enlarge the thoracic cavity in the vertical and lateral dimensions. During forced expiration for speech, muscles of the trunk and abdomen reduce the size of the thoracic cavity by compressing the abdomen or pulling the rib cage down forcing air out of the lungs. Phonation Phonation is the production of a periodic sound wave by vibration of the vocal folds. Airflow from the lungs, as well as laryngeal muscle contraction, causes movement of the vocal folds. It is the properties of tension and elasticity that allow the vocal folds to be stretched, bunched, brought together and separated. During prephonation, the vocal folds move from the abducted to adducted position. Subglottal pressure builds and air flow forces the folds apart, inferiorly to superiorly. If the volume of airflow is constant, the velocity of the flow will increase at the area of constriction and cause a decrease in pressure below once distributed. This negative pressure will pull the initially blow open folds back together again. The cycle repeats until the vocal folds are abducted to inhibit phonation or to take a breath. Articulation In a third process of speech production, articulation, mobile and immobile structures of the face (articulators) adjust the shape of the mouth, pharynx and nasal cavities (vocal tract) as the vocal fold vibration sound passes through producing varying resonant frequencies. Central nervous control The analysis of brain lesions and the correlation between lesion locations and behavioral deficits were the most important sources of knowledge about the cerebral mechanisms underlying speech production for many years. The seminal lesion studies of Paul Broca indicated that the production of speech relies on the functional integrity of the left inferior frontal gyrus. More recently, the results of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), provide growing evidence that complex human skills are not primarily located in highly specialized brain areas (e.g., Broca's area) but are organized in networks connecting several different areas of both hemispheres instead. Functional neuroimaging identified a complex neural network underlying speech production including cortical and subcortical areas, such as the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor areas, primary motor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Speech perception Speech perception refers to the understanding of speech. The beginning of the process towards understanding speech is first hearing the message that is spoken. The auditory system receives sound signals starting at the outer ear. They enter the pinna and continue into the external auditory canal (ear canal) and then to the eardrum. Once in the middle ear, which consists of the malleus, the incus, and the stapes; the sounds are changed into mechanical energy. After being converted into mechanical energy, the message reaches the oval window, which is the beginning of the inner ear. Once inside the inner ear, the message is transferred into hydraulic energy by going through the cochlea, which is filled with fluid, and on to the Organ of Corti. This organ again helps the sound to be transferred into a neural impulse that stimulates the auditory pathway and reaches the brain. Sound is then processed in Heschl's gyrus and associated with meaning in Wernicke's area. As for theories of speech perception, there are a motor and an auditory theory. The motor theory is based upon the premise that speech sounds are encoded in the acoustic signal rather than enciphered in it. The auditory theory puts greater emphasis on the sensory and filtering mechanisms of the listener and suggests that speech knowledge is a minor role that’s only used in hard perceptual conditions. Transmission of speech Waveform (amplitude as a function of time) of the English word \\"above\\". Spectrogram (frequency as a function of time) of the English word \\"buy\\". Speech is transmitted through sound waves, which follow the basic principles of acoustics. The source of all sound is vibration. For sound to exist, a source (something put into vibration) and a medium (something to transmit the vibrations) are necessary. Since sound waves are produced by a vibrating body, the vibrating object moves in one direction and compresses the air directly in front of it. As the vibrating object moves in the opposite direction, the pressure on the air is lessened so that an expansion, or rarefaction, of air molecules occurs. One compression and one rarefaction make up one longitudinal wave. The vibrating air molecules move back and forth parallel to the direction of motion of the wave, receiving energy from adjacent molecules nearer the source and passing the energy to adjacent molecules farther from the source. Sound waves have two general characteristics: A disturbance is in some identifiable medium in which energy is transmitted from place to place, but the medium does not travel between two places. Important basic characteristics of waves are wavelength, amplitude, period, and frequency. Wavelength is the length of the repeating wave shape. Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the particles of the medium, which is determined by the energy of the wave. A period (measured in seconds) is the time for one wave to pass a given point. Frequency of the wave is the number of waves passing a given point in a unit of time. Frequency is measured in hertz (hz); (Hz cycles per second) and is perceived as pitch. Each complete vibration of a sound wave is called a cycle. Two other physical properties of sound are intensity and duration. Intensity is measured in decibels (dB) and is perceived as loudness. There are two types of tones: pure tones and complex tones. The musical note produced by a tuning fork is called a pure tone because it consists of one tone sounding at just one frequency.

The concerts were designed to allow musicians to show their support for the abortion rights movement in the United States and Canada. Background The first Rock for Choice concert was organized by L7 and music editor Sue Cummings of the LA Weekly, who brought their idea for a pro-abortion rights benefit concert modeled on Bob Geldof's Live Aid. Rock for Choice's first concert was held at the Palace on Vine Street in Hollywood, California on October 25, 1991, and featured Nirvana, Hole, L7, and Sister Double Happiness.http://feminist.org/rock4c/index.html Feminist Majority Foundation Concert attendees were encouraged to speak out about women's issues from a politically progressive angle, especially abortion rights, and voter registration. Rock for Choice L7/Joan Jett concert footage and politics are featured on the rockumentary Not Bad for a Girl. An after- party that followed the initial concert led Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl and members of L7 to encourage artist Jim Evans to do a poster for a future Rock For Choice show, leading to the creation of the poster group TAZ. The TAZ collective, creating work in the style of underground comix, went on to do posters for some of the biggest Rock For Choice shows. L7 performed at the September 27, 1992 Rock for Choice benefit concert at the Hollywood Palladium along with Exene Cervenka, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Mudhoney. In October 1993, seven bands played a sold out Rock for Choice benefit including bands X, Firehose, with headliner Rage Against the Machine. Later Rock for Choice concerts included the Foo Fighters, Ween, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine and other prominent bands of the era. The genesis for Rock for Choice came from an interview that Sue Cummings did with L7 for the LA Weekly, in which the band said they were planning to advertise one of their upcoming local shows as \\"Rock for Coat Hangers\\" and donate the proceeds to a pro-abortion rights group. Sue encouraged the band to consider expanding their gig to a larger scale, contending that since there had been many benefit concerts performed in the past in the United States to help resolve famine abroad, it would be appropriate to have similar concerts raising funds for abortion access (which she saw as a more pressing and relevant issue to Americans). Cummings asked the band if they would be willing to invite other artists to play the show, contacted several feminist organizations to find a sponsor, and arranged a meeting with the Feminist Majority Foundation when they agreed to participate. The Rock for Choice concert series originated at about the same time as the Riot Grrrl movement, made up of a new generation of feminists and rock bands originating in Olympia, Washington. Both Rock for Choice and Riot Grrrl were reacting to the early 1990s bombing of abortion clinics by certain fringe elements of the pro-life movement, and were often associated in the public's mind as a single movement, although few Riot Grrrl bands, with the exception of Bikini Kill, ever played Rock for Choice shows. But Rock for Choice formed an important cultural bridge between the baby boomer feminists of the 1970s, who had organized the Feminist Majority, and the generation X feminists of the 1990s music scene. The concert series evolved into an organization managed by the Feminist Majority Foundation, which released a number of compilation albums featuring artists that supported Rock for Choice. The album Spirit of '73: Rock for Choice included fourteen female artists of the 90s singing hits from the 70s and was named based on the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002AYM Amazon.com: Spirit of '73 The final Rock for Choice concert was held in 2001 and was emceed by actress Gillian Anderson.

Early life and education Richard Milford Blatchford was born at Fort Hamilton, New York on August 17, 1859, He was the son of Samuel T. Blatchford (1822–1886) and Agnes Leadbeater Blatchford (1824–1911), and his ancestors had come from Devonshire, England in the eighteenth century. His great-grandfather was Reverend Samuel Blatchford, his great-uncle was the New York attorney Richard Milford Blatchford, and the U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Blatchford was a cousin. He was educated at Williston Seminary in Massachusetts and Claverack College in New York, and graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with the class of 1882. He was also a graduate of the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, and of the U.S. Army War College, then in Washington, D.C. Military career Blatchford was commissioned in the United States Army directly from civil life and appointed as a second lieutenant in October 1883. He served with the 11th Infantry Regiment on the American frontier in Dakota Territory, Kansas, and Arizona. Colonel Blatchford, He became a captain on April 26, 1898, during the first days of the Spanish–American War. Following two tours of duty in Puerto Rico, he served in the Philippines from 1901 to 1904, both in the field and in garrison, with the 28th, 11th, and 6th Regiments. After a brief tour as a recruiter in New York, Blatchford was an instructor and inspector for the Missouri National Guard. However, he had served with the 11th Infantry Regiment almost continuously while rising through the ranks, and in April 1913, he became a colonel and was given command of the regiment in Texas City, Texas. In 1914, Blatchford was assigned to command the 12th Infantry Regiment, then stationed in the San Francisco Presidio. Blatchford's regiment, a part of the Eighth Brigade under Brigadier General John J. Pershing, included 700 enlisted men and 30 commissioned officers. In April 1914, while on training maneuvers near Stanford University, Blatchford received orders for his regiment to travel with Pershing by rail to El Paso, Texas, where Pershing assembled the Eighth Brigade to guard the Mexican border. The regiment was later stationed at Nogales, Arizona, where Blatchford made arrangements for Pershing's peace conference on August 29, 1914 with Mexican generals Pancho Villa and Álvaro Obregón. While commanding the 12th, Blatchford organized a regimental school of musketry at the Presidio. By late 1915, Colonel Blatchford had been detailed as commandant of the Army's School of Musketry (today's Infantry School) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and held that position in April 1917 at the time of America's entry into World War I. On May 15, 1917, Blatchford was promoted to brigadier general in the National Army. He sailed for France in July 1917 to observe trench warfare and Allied training methods, and on July 25 he was appointed commanding general of the Line of Communications, part of the American Expeditionary Forces. On August 5, 1917, he received a promotion to major general in the National Army. Blatchford failed to organize a functioning line of communication in France, resulting in inadequate transport of supplies to U.S. troops. Unhappy with his performance, Pershing decided to replace Blatchford with Francis Kernan. After being relieved of his command in Paris, Blatchford took charge of billeting at Neufchâteau. According to General Johnson Hagood, this job \\"certainly did not warrant a special headquarters with a major general in command,\\" but Blatchford maintained a large staff for allocating billets and office space, including a colonel in charge of constructing new buildings. In November 1917, Pershing sent Blatchford back to America, due to lack of competence. To spare his feelings and reputation, Pershing told him that he was needed to train a combat unit and then lead it to France to take part in the fighting. Blatchford later viewed the removal as a stain on his career, and he pursued the matter with Pershing after the war. In response, Pershing wrote that Blatchford's performance had in fact been unsatisfactory, and that their \\"lifelong friendship\\" had caused Pershing to refrain from telling him so at the time. Despite being replaced as head of the Line of Communications, Blatchford's career flourished after his return from France. He briefly commanded the 158th Depot Brigade at Camp Sherman, Ohio (1917–1918), before taking command of the Panama Canal Department. He remained in command at the Panama Canal Zone through 1919, continuing after the end of the war. He later commanded the Presidio of San Francisco (1920–1921), 8th Infantry Brigade and Camp Lewis (1921), and 5th Infantry Brigade and Vancouver Barracks (1921–1922). He retired on December 1, 1922 with his permanent rank of brigadier general. In 1930, Congress passed legislation allowing the temporary generals of World War I to retire at the highest rank they had held, and Blatchford was promoted to major general on the retired list.

She was previously the 64-gun Modeste, of the French Navy, launched in 1759 and captured later that year. French career and capture Modeste was laid down at Toulon in April 1756 to a design by Noël Pomet, and was launched on 12 February 1759. Work on her was completed by May 1759, and she joined Chef d'escadre Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran's fleet in the port. The Seven Years' War was being fought at the time, and the Toulon fleet was being blockaded by Admiral Edward Boscawen. Taking advantage of the British fleet's departure for supplies, the French left port and sailed into the Atlantic. There they were chased and finally brought to battle by Boscawen off Lagos, Portugal. The ensuing Battle of Lagos, fought between 18 and 19 August 1759, saw the defeat of the French fleet, with two of their ships destroyed and three taken. Captured alongside Modeste were the 74-gun ships Téméraire and Centaure. Taken as a prize into Portsmouth, she was surveyed there that December, and was purchased for the navy on 7 January 1760 for the sum of £17,068.18.1½. She was named HMS Modeste, retaining her French name, on 11 January and was added to the navy lists. Having been commissioned into the navy, she underwent a refit in June and July 1760. British career Modeste was commissioned under her first commander, Captain Henry Speke, in April 1760, though command soon passed to Captain Robert Walsingham. Walsingham went out to the Mediterranean and was involved in naval operations there, capturing the 32-gun Bouffonne off Cadiz at the Action of 17 July 1761, while in company with . Modeste then sailed to the Leeward Islands in October 1761 and was present at the reduction of Martinique in January and February 1762. Captain John Hollwall took command later that year and Modeste remained in the Leeward Islands until returning to Britain to be paid off in March 1764. She spent the next few years laid up, being occasionally surveyed and repaired as required. She was fitted out at Portsmouth in early 1771 and was recommissioned as a guard ship under Captain John Wheelock. She went out to Jamaica in June 1771, but returned to Britain to be paid off in October 1772. She was fitted out for her final role, a receiving ship at Portsmouth, between July and August 1778. She saw out the rest of the American War of Independence and most of the French Revolutionary Wars in this state, until finally being broken up at Portsmouth in August 1800.

The town is best known as the site of the Panama Canal's Gatun Locks and Gatun Dam, built by the United States between 1906–1914.  Early history  The name “El Gatún” appears in Spanish colonial era maps as the name of a village and river, though its uncertain when exactly the area was populated or named. The village was located on the west bank of the Chagres River near its present-day location. In 1671, the British pirate Henry Morgan and his men bivouacked close to Gatún after sacking and burning down the old Panama City. In the mid-19th century, Gatún was described as a sleepy village of 40 or 50 cane huts, on the edge of a broad savannah. On a hill overlooking the river were ruins of an old Spanish fort. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought about dramatic changes to the isthmus of Panama, particularly to Gatún. All over Panama, rates for meals and lodging shot up overnight, fueled by increased demand and gold fever. Travelers going upriver on the Chagres stopped through Gatún, paying $2 a night for a hammock before proceeding on the often dangerous barge trip and overland mule ride to Panama City, from where they sailed on to San Francisco. To meet the demand of travelers rushing to California, a group of New York financiers formed the Panama Railroad Company and set about to construct the first railroad connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. When work began in 1850, ships carried machinery, provisions and workers up the Chagres as far as Gatún. From there, they worked their way back up through the swamp toward the railroad’s Atlantic terminus on Manzanillo Island (now Colón). The first stretch of rail from Manzanillo Island to Gatun was completed in 1851. Construction was completed in 1854 and the first train completed the journey from coast to coast in January 1855, passing by Gatún. After 1869, with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States, traffic on the Panama Railroad decreased and the town’s main role was as a river trading post for bananas and other crops grown inland and brought by barge to be transported to larger markets by rail. As with the first gold rush-driven boom, Gatún’s next boom came about rapidly though not unexpectedly. In 1881, the Compagnie universelle du canal interocéanique de Panama, led by Count Ferdinand de Lesseps, acquired the rights from Colombia to build a Canal through the isthmus of Panama. This effort included the purchase of the majority stake of the Panama Railroad. The French shipped in pre-fabricated buildings, many of which were brought to Gatún. French warehouses, quarters and machine shops went up in Gatún and along the railroad line, and the town itself was rechristened \\"Cité de Lesseps.\\" French excavation works in the area between Limón Bay and Gatún advanced significantly, but by the late 1880s the effort floundered financially and at the cost of thousands of victims of yellow fever and other fatal diseases. With the eventual suspension of excavation activities, Gatún once again fell quiet, but it would not be too long before yet another boom changed Gatún.  Canal construction era  In 1904, when the US purchase the French Company’s rights and properties, American engineers and planners arrived at the former Cité de Lesseps to resume long abandoned excavation works. The initial American plan, like the original French plan, was to dam the Chagres at Bohío, from Colón. However, Chief Engineer John F. Stevens advocated harnessing the Chagres and installing the Atlantic side locks at Gatún, and work began on both of these in 1906. The new, American Gatun started essentially as a tent city. A plank road was installed and by June 1907, 97 buildings had been erected and work on a commissary was started. In April 1908, the old native village and its inhabitants were moved to an area called \\"New Town,\\" east of the present town of Gatun. It consisted of over 110 buildings, including a church and about 25 stores. A few months later, Lt. Col. William L. Sibert established the headquarters of the Canal organization's Atlantic Division in Gatun and built his house to the east of the town. The year 1909 saw significant development for Gatun. A new $25,000 clubhouse was built on a knoll near the present building 122. As excavation works and construction of the locks advanced, the railroad was moved to its present location and construction of a new railroad station and new two-story commissary was begun. The town began to take shape, with schools, a two-story hotel, a post office and telephone exchange, a dispensary, a two-story lodge hall near the clubhouse and new quarters. The American residents of Gatun had also established several active lodges and social clubs. By March 1913, the population of Gatun was 8,887. Nine months later, it had dropped to 5,943 as the Gatun Dam was completed, the Gatun Locks were operating and only clean-up work remained. An official estimate at the time projected the future population of Gatun at 160 American employees and their families.  Gatun, CZ  After the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914, the Canal Zone’s population was expected to decrease sharply. During the early 1920s, there was some talk of abandoning Gatun altogether, but in 1928, new quarters were built for 164 “local-rate” families. In 1932, plans to replace most of Gatun’s old housing were approved and grading for the $1,250,000 project began on January 31, 1934. Buildings came down right and left to make way for more permanent wood and masonry buildings. Just a few years after Gatun’s refurbishment, on August 11, 1939, the U.S. Congress authorized the immediate construction of the long studied \\"Third Locks Project\\". For Gatun, this meant excavation of a new canal about half a mile to the east of the existing canal. This construction would have made Gatun an island between two sets of locks. During the war, the Gatun Locks were surrounded by solid 26-foot corrugated metal steel fences and barrage balloons were anchored overhead. Buildings or part of buildings which might be fire hazards were torn down to prevent them from burning and lighting the locks. Lights were out by 11:00 p.m., street lights were removed and cars drove with blacked-out headlights. Air raid shelters were built and air raid drills held. By 1944, as the war receded to the Pacific and Gatun and the Canal Zone returned to its normal way of life. On March 31, 1944, just 35 years after its first clubhouse was built, a new clubhouse was inaugurated. At the time, it was called the “newest and most complete of any in the clubhouse system.” The building eventually also housed the “U.S.-rate” commissary and post office. A local-rate commissary and clubhouse was also combined in the segregated portion of Gatun known as Chagres. Gatun from the 1940s to 1970s was known for its active Civic Council, its many active hobbyists and its Tarpon Club. The Gatun area was home to three horseman's clubs: Gatun Saddle Club located right by town, Atlantic Saddle Club located just outside town and Mindi Acres, located adjacent to Ft. Davis. These were members of the Canal Zone Horsemen's Association, The CZHA organized yearly shows and events which climaxed in the Championship show hosted by the Abu Saad Shriners. The Tarpon Club, first organized in 1914, started as the Gatun Fishing Club and was allowed to construct a clubhouse in 1915. Over the years, its guests included Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as ex-King Leopold III of Belgium. The Tarpon Club is one of the few remaining Gatun institutions which remains today.  Present-day Gatún  Today, most of Gatún is a virtual ghost town, administered and maintained by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). The eastern part of town, formerly called \\"New Town,\\" has been demolished to make way for the Panama Canal Expansion Project's expanded third locks channel. Many cruise passengers and tourists visit or pass by the Gatun Locks but do not venture into town to appreciate its remaining Canal Zone style architecture. The former clinic, school, swimming pool and fire station are used by the ACP, but the old Sibert Lodge is no longer active. Gatun and Gatun Lake Benefits Created in 1913 by the damming of the Chagres River, Gatun Lake is an essential part of the Panama Canal which forms a water passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, permitting ship transit in both directions. At the time it was formed Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world. Lake Gatun encompasses approximately , a vast tropical ecological zone part of the Atlantic Forest Corridor and Eco-tourism on Gatun Lake has become a worthwhile industry for Panamanians. This impassable rain- forest around Gatun Lake has been the best defense of the Panama Canal and today these areas have endured practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas on earth that various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat. Barro Colorado Island is the largest island on Gatun Lake and home to the world famous Barro Colorado Tropical Research Institute which was established for scientific study in 1923, shortly after the lake was formed. Today the research and nature reserve are operated by the Smithsonian Institution. Many of the most important ground breaking scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here. Gatun Lake also serves to provide the millions of gallons of water necessary to operate the Panama Canal locks each time a ship passes through and provides drinking water for Panama City and Colon. Angling is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake. It is suspected that the Cichla Monoculus clade Cichla Pleiozona species of Peacock Bass was introduced by accident to Gatun Lake by a renowned Panamanian aquarist and doctor in 1958. Locally called Sargento these peacock bass are not a native game fish of Panama but originate from the Amazon, Rio Negro and Orinoco river basins of South America where they are called Tucanare or Pavon and are considered a premier game fish. Since 1958, the species of Peacock Bass have flourished to become the dominant angling game fish in Gatun Lake of the Panama Canal. The aggressive fish are considered very desirable by anglers. They hit topwater lures, subsurface lures imitating baitfish, and a variety of fly patterns. When hooked, they perform admirably, generating a respectable fight on appropriate tackle. Oddly, they have a preference for feeding during daylight hours. Lake Gatun remains to this day, as it has been for more than 50 years, one of the best peacock bass angling lakes in the world.

Rune king Thor is universal being that is after omniversal and multiversal sentience. Jane Foster Marvel announced that in October 2014 there will be a new Thor who is female. As revealed in the aftermath of the Original Sin storyline, Thor lost his ability to wield Mjolnir, which was later found by Jane Foster who obtains Thor's power and his name. Thor, unaware of his successor's identity and believing Jane Foster would not be able to use Mjolnir due to her cancer, used the battle axe Jarnbjorn. Alternative continuities 1602 A version of Thor appears with an alter ego of an elderly Christian priest named Donal—an allusion to Thor's original secret identity Donald Blake. Donal fears and despises his alter-ego, believing that the shared existence will damn him.Marvel 1602 #1–8 (November 2003 – June 2004) This version of Thor speaks in Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse rather than the Shakespearean English that the mainstream universe Thor speaks in. 2099 Set in the year 2099, the role of Thor is taken by a man named Cecil MacAdam, who belongs to a class of priests known as \\"Thorites\\" who worship the original version of Thor. Avatarr, the CEO of Alchemax, grants him and others the powers of the Norse gods, along with brainwashing that both convinces them they are the gods and keeps them under his controlSpider-Man 2099 #15 (1994) Later, in \\"2099: Manifest Destiny\\", a rejuvenated Steve Rogers finds Mjolnir and becomes the new Thor. He gives Mjolnir to Miguel O'Hara (Spider-Man 2099) at the end of the story. Age of Apocalypse In this continuity, Donald Blake never discovers Mjolnir and thus never becomes Thor. Blake, as a member of the Human High Council, meets with Mikhail Rasputin (one of Apocalypse's horsemen) for peace talks. Knowing the mutant would never keep his word, Blake stabbed him through the chest with his cane and shoved him out a window, where both fell to their deaths. Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics universe, Thor is joined with Orion to form Thorion. Thorion was the son of Thanoseid (Thanos/Darkseid), but was traded to All-Highfather Odin in order to seal a truce between the realms of Apokolips and New Asgard. During one adventure, L'ok D'saad (An amalgamation of Loki and Desaad), he for whom Thorion was traded, sought to use the Mother Cube (a mixture of a Mother box and the Cosmic Cube) and its Infinity Essence to awaken the Sleeping One called Surtur and bring about a second Ragnarok that would end everything. Thorion, however, invoked the power of the Source via his hammer to halt L'ok's evil wishes. Because of the great energies released during their conflict, Thorion was remade into a cosmic being known as The Celestial.Thorion of the New Asgods #1 (June 1997) In Unlimited Access, a limited series which further explored themes introduced in DC vs. Marvel, the hero known as Access formed an amalgamation of what appeared to be the Silver Age versions of Thor and Superman (in his then-current blue energy form). Together, they were known as Thor-El.Unlimited Access #4 (March 1998) King Loki In an alternate future depicted in Loki: Agents of Asgard, King Loki successfully destroys the Earth, and King Thor comes to him for revenge for killing everyone he loves. King Loki raises an army of undead from the corpses of the Avengers, and Thor fights them off before King Loki retreats into the past to corrupt the Thor of the present.Loki: Agents of Asgard #12 Marvel Cinematic Universe In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999), this version of Thor is played by Australian actor Chris Hemsworth. Marvel Noir While Thor does not appear in Marvel Noir, the Noir version of Baron Zemo reveals that his castle was previously inhabited by a mad Norse Man who believed that he was a God of Asgard, and would frequently attack people with a hammer. Zemo holds up his skeleton, and the skull is wearing a helmet reminiscent of Thor's original helmet in the 616 continuity.Iron Man Noir #3 Marvel Zombies Briefly, Thor appears as a cannibalistic zombie wielding a makeshift version of a hammer composed of a concrete block and pipe as he is no longer worthy to wield Mjolnir, which he breaks when trying to attack the Silver Surfer. When the Silver Surfer is finally struck down, only a handful of zombies manage to eat a piece of his body, and Thor is not one of them. Those who did consume the Silver Surfer acquire his cosmic powers, and Thor, along with the rest of the zombies, is seemingly slaughtered. Giant-Man can be seen throwing away his skeleton after burning his body. But in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days- a one shot prequel to the main events of the Zombie universe-, Thor is amongst the heroes on the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier who survived the first wave of the zombie plague. After Reed Richards was driven insane following his construction of a device to travel to other universes, Thor, on Nick Fury's orders, destroyed the device rather than using it to escape to another dimension unaffected by the virus, in order to ensure that what had happened to their world couldn't happen to another.Marvel Zombies #1–5 (February−June 2006) Old King Phoenix Thor This version is one of the most powerful version of Thor and being of Marvel Multiverse. He was able to defeat God Emperor Doom having power of The Beyonder, Iron Fist, Ghost Rider and Doctor Strange. Ruins In Ruins an alternate universe where \\"everything that can go wrong will go wrong\\" Donald Blake (Thor's human alter ego) appears claiming to have found Mjolnir when in fact he ate hallucinogenic agaric mushrooms. However, Mjolnir appears at the site where the Avengers of this reality had perished at the hands of the United States military indicating Thor and Donald Blake are two separate people in this reality. Ultimate Marvel Thor is a member of the superhero team the Ultimates in the Ultimate Marvel Universe.First appearance in Ultimates #1–13 (March 2002 – April 2004) Despite his claims to be a Norse god, he is regarded by many to be delusional during the first months of his career. It is not until he is seen summoning an army of Asgardian warriors to fend off an attack on Washington DC by demonic forces commanded by Loki that Thor's teammates realize he is exactly who he says he is.Ultimates, vol.2 #13 Infinity Wars During the Infinity Wars storyline, where the universe was combined in half, Thor was fused with Iron Man creating Iron Hammer. Sigurd Stark was the fifth richest person on the world thanks to his genius about technology, however due to his lack of memories before five years, taunted him driving to drink. After going through the Norvegian, he was attacked by some Dark Elves, lead by Krimson Kurse (fusion Crimson Dynamo and Kurse). He got poisoned by an arrow, slowing killing him and taken by the Elves to aid their other prisoner Eitri (fusion of Eitri and Ho Yinsen) in order to build powerful weapons for the Elves. Then, Sigurd became friend with Eitri and together build an armor, that prevented the poison from killing Sigurd, along with a hammer in order to escape the Dark Elves. However, during their escape Eitri is killed and after Sigurd defeated the Elves and Krimson Kurse, he discovered that Krimson was his lost friend who had turned into a Thrall to be a servant to Dark Elves and after that he mercy killed his friend. Sigurd then decided to the All-Father on Asgard to seek help into defeating Malekith (fusion of Malekith and Mandarin) and with the help of his A.I. assistant H.E.I.M.D.A.L.L. (fusion of Heimdall and J.A.R.V.I.S.) opened the B.I.F.R.O.S.T. and went to Asgard. When travelling, he remembered his old memories: his true name was Stark Odinson, who due to his arrogance, his father Howard Odin (fusion of Howard Stark and Odin banished his son to Earth where he would learn to how is like to be a mortal. Upon arriving, Malekith had trapped the Aesir and had allied with Madame Hel (fusion of Madame Masque and Hela and Stane Odinson (fusion of Loki and Obadiah Stane). Luckily, Iron Hammer was able to defeat Malekith and Odin allowed his son to become a god again, however Sigurd refused, feeling better as a human.Infinity Wars: Iron Hammer #1-2. Marvel Comics What If? In an early What If story, Jane Foster discovered the stick rather than Donald Blake, spending time as a female Thor (called Thordis) before she was recalled to Asgard, allowing Odin to return the hammer to its rightful owner, although Jane went on to be elevated to godhood so that she could marry Odin.What If vol. 1 #10 In What If Rogue possessed the power of Thor?, Rogue accidentally permanently absorbed Thor when she and Mystique attempted to break the Brotherhood out of prison, resulting in her killing most of the Avengers and the Brotherhood when she was unable to cope with Thor's power. Although Loki attempted to manipulate her into waging war on Asgard after she was able to lift Thor's hammer, the sight of Odin's genuine sense of loss allowed Thor's remnants to manifest in her subconscious, affirming that he was an ideal as well as a person, allowing Rogue to inherit his power and position as she became the new Thor.What If vol. 2 #66 In What if Thor was the Herald of Galactus?, Galactus comes to devour Asgard. His herald kills Sif and Thor kills the herald in revenge. Galactus then announces that Asgard has fed him enough, and asks Thor to become his new herald in exchange for leaving Asgard alone. Thor agrees and directs Galactus to worlds with bloodthirsty races he deems worthy of destruction. Until the day Munnin, one of Odin's ravens, reaches him to inform him that Odin is dead and Asgard has fallen. Thor returns to Asgard, now under control of Loki and the frost giants, who reveal that Galactus' coming to Asgard was part of his plan to weaken Odin. After recovering Mjolnir, which he left behind, Thor guides Galactus to Asgard to feed in order to defeat Loki, since Asgard is an insult to what it once was. Thor frees Balder and the other imprisoned Asgardians, telling them to flee to Midgard. Thor defeats Loki, but continues being Galactus' herald: if he can be bold enough to decide which world is to be devoured, he is still worthy of wielding Mjolnir. On Earth, Balder becomes the premier super hero of Chicago.What if Thor #1 (February 2006) Thor also later becomes the Herald of Galactus in the 2020 run of the main Thor comic book series.Thor vol. 6 #1 Wastelands A grown up Dani Cage, daughter of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, is a recurring character in the Old Man Logan miniseries and its sequel, Dead Man Logan.

Sit-in held outside the prime minister's residence in Kathmandu to mark Black Day on 1 June 2013. Nepal Bhasa movement (Newar: नेपालभाषा आन्दोलन) refers to the struggle for linguistic rights by Newar speakers in Nepal in the face of opposition from the government and hostile neighbors. The campaign aims to increase the use of Nepal Bhasa in the home, education, government and business. Despite a high level of development, Newar culture and language are both under threat. Newars have been fighting to save their language from the time of the repressive Rana regime till today, and activists have been jailed, exiled and tortured. Page 75. Pages 35-36. Opponents have even petitioned the Supreme Court to have its use barred. The history of Nepal Bhasa since the late 18th century has been marked by constant struggle against state repression and a hostile environment. The movement arose against the suppression of the language by the state that began with the rise of the Shah dynasty in 1768 AD, and intensified during the Rana regime (1846-1951) and Panchayat system (1960-1990). Page 186. Moreover, hostility towards the language from neighbors grew following mass migration into the Kathmandu Valley, leading to the indigenous Newars becoming a minority in their homeland. During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the valley population speaking Nepal Bhasa dropped from 74.95% to 43.93%. The language has been listed as being \\"definitely endangered\\" by UNESCO. The language movement can be divided into the following eras. *Shah/Rana era *First democratic era *Panchayat era *Second democratic era *Loktantra era Shah/Rana era Martyr Shukra Raj Shastri wrote a grammar in 1928. Dharmaditya was jailed for three months in 1940. Chittadhar Hridaya, sketched in jail, ca. 1944. He was sentenced to six years for writing a poem. Phatte Bahadur Singh was sentenced to life in prison for publishing an anthology of poems in 1939. Dhammalok Mahasthavir and seven other Buddhist monks were expelled from Nepal in 1944 for writing books on Buddhism. Buddhist monk Sudarshan Mahasthavir was jailed for six months in 1965 for protesting Radio Nepal's ban on Nepal Bhasa. Following the advent of the Shahs, the Gorkha language became the court language of Nepal,Levy, Robert I. (1990) Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal.

Page 8. As a result, development of the language and literature was stifled. During the period 1909 to 1941 known as the Renaissance era, a few authors braved official disapproval and started writing, translating, educating and restructuring the language. Writers Nisthananda Bajracharya, Siddhidas Mahaju, Jagat Sundar Malla and Yogbir Singh Kansakar are honored as the Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa. Shukraraj Shastri and Dharmaditya Dharmacharya were also at the forefront of the movement. In 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled Nepal Bhasa Vyakarana which was published from Kolkata, India in 1928.Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 27. Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa from Kolkata in 1925. Also, the Renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name \\"Nepal Bhasa\\" in place of the Khas imposed term \\"Newari\\". Writers jailed In 1940, the government mounted a crackdown against democracy activists and writers in which Shukraraj Shastri was hanged. A large number of authors were imprisoned for their literary or political activities. Dharmacharya was jailed for three months. Chittadhar Hridaya was sentenced to six years, Siddhicharan Shrestha was sentenced to 18 years, Phatte Bahadur Singh was sentenced to life imprisonment and Dharma Ratna Yami was sentenced to 18 years. They were released in 1945 after serving five years. In prison, Hridaya produced his greatest work Sugata Saurabha, an epic poem on the life of the Buddha. Shrestha wrote a collection of poems entitled Seeswan (\\"Wax Flower\\", published in 1948) among other works. Monks expelled Theravada Buddhist monks stood up to the Rana regime and published books on Buddhism from India and brought them into Nepal. This led to the Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal. In 1944, eight monks were expelled for refusing to stop teaching Theravada Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa. In 1946, the ban on writing was lifted, and the monks were allowed to return to Nepal following international pressure. Their writings and public activities in Nepal Bhasa had a profound impact on the development of the language.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. , 9780674019089. Pages 47-49. Pages 89-90. Working abroad Nepal Bhasa lovers took the movement to India and Tibet where they formed associations to organize writers and bring out publications to escape government suppression in Nepal. Newar merchants based in Kolkata, Kalimpong and Lhasa were major patrons of the language movement. Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa, the first ever magazine in Nepal Bhasa, was published from Kolkata in 1925 by Dharmaditya Dharmacharya. He also established a literary organization named Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Mandal (Nepal Bhasa Literature Organization) in 1926.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. . Pages 27-28. Retrieved 2 February 2012. Page 89. In 1944, the Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal went to Sarnath and formed an organization named Dharmodaya Sabha. In 1947, it launched Dharmodaya magazine from Kalimpong funded by trader Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar. Monk Aniruddha Mahathera was the first editor.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

Newar traders based in Lhasa promoted Thaunkanhe magazine which launched in Kathmandu in 1951. It was the first Nepal Bhasa magazine to be published from Nepal, and the first editor was a former merchant Purna Kaji Tamrakar. In 1950, a literary society named Chwasa Pasa (Pen Friend) was formed in Kolkata by Prem Bahadur Kansakar and another writer Madan Lochan Singh to bring together writers living in exile. The society moved to Nepal in 1951 after the advent of democracy.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 129. First democratic era Following the fall of the Ranas and advent of democracy in 1951, there was greater linguistic freedom, and Nepal Bhasa struggled to catch up. Books, magazines and newspapers appeared. A daily newspaper Nepal Bhasa Patrika began publication in 1955. On the radio State-owned Radio Nepal began broadcasting the news in Nepal Bhasa once a day in 1951. In 1958, Kathmandu Municipality passed a resolution that it would accept applications and publish major decisions in Nepal Bhasa in addition to the Nepali language. In schools and colleges Nepal Bhasa entered a vibrant phase in the educational system. It was included in the curriculum, and Nepal Rastriya Vidhyapitha recognized it as an alternative medium of instruction in the schools and colleges affiliated to it. In 1953, the government recognized Nepal Bhasa as a spoken language and an oriental language subject. The Nepal Educational Council adopted it as an optional subject. Following lobbying by language lovers, Nepal Bhasa was included in the course of study at the high school level in 1954, at the intermediate level in 1960 and bachelor level in 1962. And for two decades, Nepal Bhasa was widely taught in schools and colleges in the Kathmandu Valley and other parts of Nepal with thousands of students studying it as an optional subject. Panchayat era In 1960, parliament was abolished, political parties were forbidden and the Panchayat system was established. Under this autocratic system, the government followed a one-language policy, and Nepal Bhasa suffered another period of suppression. Page 9. It was gradually pushed out of the media and the educational institutions, triggering protest movements. Page 91. The restrictive policy of Panchayat encouraged the formation of literary associations to provide a forum for writers to present their works. In 1962, Birat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi (Grand Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference Trust) was formed in Bhaktapur. It organized annual literary meets which continue till today. Jah magazine In 1960, Nepal Bhasa students at Tri-Chandra College in Kathmandu launched an annual magazine named Jah (ज:) (meaning \\"light\\" in Nepal Bhasa) after the college magazine Light refused to include Nepal Bhasa articles in it. The magazine led to the organization of students interested in Nepal Bhasa in the college. That same year, they started the annual Inter-College Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference and also produced a weekly radio program in Nepal Bhasa on Radio Nepal named Jeevan Dabu (\\"Life's stage\\"). In the successive years, Jah served as a breeding ground for new writers and language activists.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 114. Movement of 1965 In 1963, Kathmandu Municipality's decision to recognize Nepal Bhasa was revoked. In 1965, the language was banned from being broadcast over Radio Nepal. Page 14. The removal of Nepal Bhasa from the country's only radio station sparked a protest movement which became known as the Movement of 1965 (\\"Bais Salya Andolan\\"). The protest took the form of literary meets as other types of demonstrations were prohibited. Literary programs were held weekly in market squares and courtyards where participants recited poems and sang songs containing critical messages. The government cracked down by putting a number of activists in jail including writers Mangal Man Shakya, Pushpa Gopal Shrestha and Shree Krishna Anu. Page 8. Buddhist monk Bhikshu Sudarshan Mahasthavir was jailed for six months and six days.Shrestha, Ishwari Maiya (2010). Bhikshu Sudarshan wa Waykah ya Kriti Dhalah. Kathmandu: Bhikshu Sudarshan Memorial Group. Page 12. Other prominent campaigners like Durga Lal Shrestha, Hitkar Bir Singh Kansakar and Mangal Man Shakya (of Om Bahal) were forced to go underground. The movement was made leaderless, and it came to a stop after a year. Pages 15-19. The ban on Nepal Bhasa remained, but the 1965 Movement succeeded in raising awareness about linguistic rights and arousing public opinion against the Panchayat regime. Its most important achievement was creating a new generation of writers and campaigners who would take over from the activists who fought for the language during the Rana regime and lead the movement in the subsequent decades.Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: History of Nepalbhasa Literature. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 118. Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala, founded in 1979, is one of the organizations that emerged during this period to struggle for language rights. Out of school The New Education System Plan brought out in 1971 disrupted the popular study of Nepal Bhasa in educational institutions. Under the plan, vernacular subjects were removed from the curriculum, and students were forced to choose between the mother tongue and technical subjects, leading to Nepal Bhasa being pushed into the background. Student enrolment in the course dropped, resulting in the subject being pulled out of many schools and a further decline in students. From 1977, students could study Nepal Bhasa at the Master's level; but the university degree was not counted for promotion by the government, and so there were few takers for the subject. Page 75. Foreign radio In addition to government suppression, Nepal Bhasa has faced opposition from hostile critics. After Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation began broadcasting a weekly half-hour program in Nepal Bhasa on 6 November 1983, opponents in Nepal pressured the radio station to shut it down. Similar opposition led to All India Radio - Kurseong stopping broadcasting Nepal Bhasa songs during its Nepali service in 1966. Page 67. Page 1. Second democratic era Arbitrary actions increased resentment towards Panchayat. In 1988, police arrested participants in a procession marking the birth anniversary of Nepal Bhasa poet Siddhidas Mahaju. Page 9. After the 1990 People's Movement that brought the Panchayat system to an end, the languages of Nepal enjoyed greater freedom. Page 310. However, efforts to get Nepal Bhasa reincluded as an optional subject after a gap of two decades were unsuccessful due to lack of funding. The 1990 constitution recognized Nepal as a multi-ethnic and multilingual country. It also said that each community shall have the right to operate schools up to the primary level in its own mother tongue. However, the government's responsibility was not stated and communities had to open such schools on their own. In 1991, Jagat Sundar Bwane Kuthi, the first Nepal Bhasa-medium school, opened in Kathmandu with the efforts of volunteers and the support of domestic and foreign donors. Meanwhile, years of efforts to gain official recognition for the standard name Nepal Bhasa finally succeeded. On 8 September 1995, the government decided that the name Nepal Bhasa should be used instead of Newari. However, the Central Bureau of Statistics has not been doing so. Critics file suit On 25 July 1997, Kathmandu Metropolitan City declared that its policy to recognize Nepal Bhasa, which had been passed on 18 April 1958 and cancelled by the Panchayat regime in 1963, would be revived. The rest of the city governments in the Kathmandu Valley announced in quick succession that they too would officially recognize Nepal Bhasa -- Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City on 14 July, Bhaktapur Municipality on 23 July, Madhyapur Thimi Municipality on 10 September, Banepa Municipality on 7 October, Dhulikhel Municipality on 10 October, and Kirtipur Municipality on 15 September 1997. While Newars hailed the move, its detractors went to court. A group consisting of Lal Bahadur Thapa, Yagyanidhi Dahal, Hari Prasad Pokhrel, Achyut Raman Adhikari and Dhruba Raj Thebe filed a joint petition at the Supreme Court of Nepal against their decision. And on 18 March 1998, the Supreme Court issued a stay order preventing Kathmandu Metropolitan City from using Nepal Bhasa pending a final verdict. Subsequently, on 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the local bodies as being unconstitutional. Page 18. After the verdict was announced, demonstrators marched through Kathmandu in protest. Black Day Newars have been observing June 1 as Black Day with protest meets and public demonstrations recalling the day when the Supreme Court barred Nepal Bhasa from being used in local bodies. On some occasions, the protests have been marked by vandalism and arrest of protestors by the police. Loktantra era A second People's Movement in 2006 ousted the Shah dynasty and Nepal became a republic which gave the people greater linguistic freedom. The 2007 Interim Constitution stated that the use of one's mother tongue in a local body or office shall not be barred. Page 56. However, subtle discrimination persists. Organizations with names in Nepal Bhasa are not registered, and municipality officials refuse to accept applications written in the language.

She authored poetry and books in the Gullah language and produced popular recordings in Gullah. She was also involved in theater and film productions that promoted popular understanding of the language. Biography The Gullah language is spoken by about 250,000 African Americans, called Gullahs, who live in the coastal region of South Carolina and Georgia. Gullah is a creole language that combines influences from English and African languages. Although the Gullah people and their language are now a focus of pride for African Americans, Gullah speech was long ridiculed as \\"ignorant\\" and \\"backward.\\" Geraty came forward as a defender of Gullah in the 1950s when prejudice against the language was still extremely strong. A white woman, Geraty spent some of her childhood years on Yonges Island, South Carolina. She learned Gullah from a family servant named \\"Maum Chrish,\\" and she attributed her love of Gullah speech to those early interactions. Geraty worked for many years as a librarian in the Charleston County School System. Noticing that white teachers could not understand the speech of Gullah-speaking children, she spoke out in favor of language training for the teachers, but for many years her views were regarded as eccentric at best. Geraty later produced a popular long-playing record with amusing anecdotes in Gullah. She wrote a Gullah-English dictionary, a Gullah cookbook, and a Gullah adaptation of the children's book The Night Before Christmas. She also wrote the script and served as the dialect coach for the award-winning film Gullah Tales in which the characters speak entirely in Gullah, and she served as a consultant to the BBC production The Story of English. Geraty translated the libretto of Porgy & Bess into Gullah and produced her version of the famous musical for audiences in Charleston. She also wrote a Christmas book dedicated to her Great grand children Luke and Anna. Geraty was still active in her work to promote Gullah until shortly before her death at the age of 89. Even in advanced age, she was still controversial, sometimes telling Gullah young people that their Gullah speech was not correct because it was different from the old-fashioned Gullah she learned as a child. But Geraty had many warm friendships in the Gullah community, and in her later years, she often expressed joy at hearing Gullah spoken by small children. She devoted her life to preserving the language that she had learned as a child, and to gaining respect for it in the wider world. Awards In 1995, Geraty received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the College of Charleston in recognition of her efforts to preserve the Gullah language. In 1998, she received the South Carolina Governor's Award in the Humanities. Her other honors include the Pegasus Award from the South Carolina Poetry Society and the Outstanding Accomplishment Award from the National League of American Penwomen.

In 1972 the site was cleared again under the supervision of James de Vere Allen, the Curator of the Lamu Museum. Takwa was never a large place. It was founded around 1500, and probably abandoned around 1700. Kirkman thought that it was perhaps a place where holy men or religious people retreated. The Great Mosque at Takwa is relatively well preserved. The other structure of importance is the Pillar Tomb, which has an inscription with the date of 1681–1682.

J. Smeed. The report stopped short of an unqualified recommendation for road pricing but supported congestion pricing for busy road networks. Team The team was led by R. J. Smeed, the deputy director of the British Road Research Laboratory (RRL) and included 11 economists and engineers, including: *Smeed, a noted statistician and transport planner, credited with identifying \\"Smeed's law\\" that describes motorists' tolerance towards speed and risk. He observed that drivers would not go out if traffic speeds fell below 9 mph; but if speeds rose, more would drive until they caused more congestion. *Gabriel Roth, a noted road transport economist. *Michael Edwin Beesley a pioneer of Cost Benefit Analysis techniques whose key innovation was the valuation that people give to their time. * J. Michael Thompson,Michael Thompson Obituary a transport economist. Background The taxation system in operating at the time was based on the Salter Report into road and rail transportation from 1933.  Conclusions  The principles laid down were that \\"The road user should pay the costs that he imposes upon others\\", namely the following: * road costs (construction, maintenance, lighting) * congestion (the delay the motorist causes to others) * social costs (risk, noise, fumes) The operational requirements should be the following: * related to the amount of use made of the roads * costs should vary according to the location, time, and type of vehicle * cities should be zoned, with costs raising to 10 shillings per hour of driving in the centre of London or Cambridge * costs should be stable and known in advance * payment in advance of travel should be possible The results of the radical study were reported into the then Ministry of Transport, indicating that the effect of speeding up congested traffic would benefit the country's economy by £100–£150M per annum. It would be possible and feasible to impose car user restraint strategies by charging through the metering of road usage, if the government had the will to do so. Charging zones would be identified by clear signs on their boundaries; these could be electrical and thus be changed at various times of the day. A simple national colour-coded scheme could be used to indicate the charge rate in force at that time or to allow different charging zones to exist side-by side. They recognised that traditional toll collection methods would not be practical in city centres, where the road layout had not been designed to provide natural gateways into the tow, and where the demolition and land required for toll booths or toll plazas would be unacceptable. Instead, they investigated charging through a daily licence system, managed either by a remote wireless automatic identification of the vehicle, or by a meter mounted inside the vehicle, which could track both driving charges and parking. They recommended a tamper-proof credit or pre-payment meter inside the car, as with the technology available at the time, any external recording mechanism would require expensive equipment for tracking and book keeping and threaten the privacy of the vehicle users they tracked. A single metering system could be used in any British city centre that chose to adopt a charging zones. There was also an economic analysis that showed that the largest part of the economic benefit from road pricing was not in the relief of congestion but in the revenue collected, which would only be released when the revenue is used. In the arguments that followed, the good that could come about by using the money from such a scheme was frequently overshadowed by a vision of the restraints and penalties levied on the motorist.  Reactions  The report was received with ambivalence by the Macmillan government, which had commissioned it: the Ministry reported in June 1964 that it would first need to study the implications and thus the government was \\"therefore in no way committed to this form of restraint\\". It initially withheld release of the full report to the public and took its time to consider it. It was rumoured that the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, had suggested to \\"take a vow that if we are re-elected we will never again set up a study like this one\\". Events took over, and two elections were fought in 1964 and 1966 with transport as a major election issue, resulting in a new Wilson government with Barbara Castle as Minister of Transport. A large majority enabled her to bring into law a number of the then-controversial safety concepts that the RRL had been investigating, such as speed limits and breathalyzers. She appeared to become an advocate of road pricing per the Smeed Report and publicly criticised the construction of new urban motorways as \\"self-defeating\\", during a tour of US cities, slowing down the UK's future urban road building programme as a consequence. However, the political will needed to establish such a scheme seemed to be slipping away, and commitment atrophied in the UK as the minister requested more feasibility reports, until, in 1970, the government changed and the scheme effectively died. The Smeed committee members had already become frustrated and moved on. In 1966, Smeed was appointed Professor of Traffic Studies at University College London (UCL) and formed the then Research Group in Traffic Studies, which grew to become the present Centre for Transport Studies at UCL within the University of London Centre for Transport Studies. The chair of the parallel and quasi-competing committee, Professor Sir Colin Buchanan took up a post as professor of transport at Imperial College in 1963. Roth, one of the authors of the report, acrimoniously left the country to join the World Bank in 1967, citing the delays and the mutation of the pricing scheme from an enabling investment-raising mechanism into a method of restriction. Legacy The Smeed Report remained influential elsewhere, with economist Maurice Allais following up this work in 1965 with a report for the EEC that recommended rail and road privatisation to allow the operation of free market forces across Europe's roads and railways, and with the Adam Smith Institute who encouraged Roth to revisit his earlier analysis in 1992, when he noted that \\"the idea of charging for the use of congested roads is still hypersensitive, and many politicians avoid the subject studiously.\\" After Roth analysed its congestion problems for the World Bank Singapore adopted many of the ideas originally identified in the Smeed Report, introducing its first Restricted Zone in 1975. It uses a variable Electronic Road Pricing structure on expressways and through gateways into the central business district with pricing based on time and congestion levels. It aims to reduce congestion, encourage the use of public transport, car pooling, less congested alternative routes and different times of travel. A cordon based charging scheme has also been running in the city centre of Oslo, Norway since 1990. However, this differs in some key respects from Smeed's scheme, as it relies on a system of 19 wireless AutoPASS-enabled entrypoints with toll booths, and it was not designed as a congestion charge. Instead it is a hypothecated tax or fund-raising mechanism to pay for new roads, in the first instance, and public transport more latterly. It was not until 2002 that the principle was re-adopted in Britain, with legislation passed to allow the first schemes to be implemented in Durham and then London, with consideration given to a national road pricing system. Research by the likes of Lewis and Mogridge were better able to formulate the observation that the more roads are built, the more traffic there is to fill these roads. Combined with the visible effects of growing levels of traffic, this developed the intellectual argument upon which to consider introducing new methods of charging.

He played for Surrey as an opening batsman. His career with them took in the period from 1952 to 1958 when they won an unequalled seven successive County Championship titles. He began with the Minor County Bedfordshire, that being the county of his birth, and played three matches for them in August, 1946. He then joined Surrey. He played in only six first-class matches in total between 1947 and 1949, but made a big advance in 1950 when he played in 19 matches, scored his maiden century and averaged 31.37. He had a poor season the following year and appeared in only 11 matches, but in 1952 he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time, averaged 36.15 and was awarded his county cap. From then on he was a regular member of the side until worsening arthritis meant that after 1959 he was no longer fit enough for first-class cricket. He had two poor seasons in 1955 and 1958, but otherwise reached 1,000 runs every year, making six times in all. When he made his highest score of 191 against Kent at Blackheath in 1956, he put on 174 in two hours with Peter May for the third wicket. He was a useful off-spinner, but his opportunities with the ball were limited by the presence in the Surrey side of Jim Laker and Eric Bedser.

It was published in North America by Imagineering's parent company Absolute Entertainment and in Japan by Jaleco. It was published by Nintendo in Europe. The Rescue of Princess Blobette follows the two protagonists as they attempt to rescue Princess Blobette from her imprisonment from a castle tower. The game features the same puzzle-platforming gameplay mechanics as Trouble on Blobolonia. Controlling the boy, the player must feed the blob different flavored jelly beans to transform it into different tools to traverse the castle. The Rescue of Princess Blobette was designed and programmed by David Crane, who also created the original NES game. Gameplay Using the licorice jelly bean transforms the blob into a ladder, allowing the boy to reach treasure. The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolonia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flamethrowers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one. Development The Rescue of Princess Blobette was developed by Imagineering and designed and programmed by David Crane, who was also the lead designer on Trouble on Blobolonia. A then-untitled follow-up to Trouble on Blobolonia was revealed in the September 1990 issue of GamePro. On November 9, 1990, The Rescue of Princess Blobette was first released in Japan by Jaleco under the title . Absolute Entertainment, the parent company of Imagineering, published the game in North America during May 1991. The rights to the A Boy and His Blob series are currently owned by Majesco Entertainment. This company published a WayForward Technologies remake of A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia on the Wii, simply titled A Boy and His Blob, and re-released the classic NES game on the Wii Virtual Console in 2009. When Sean Velasco, director at WayForward, was asked if they were able to pick up The Rescue of Princess Blobette, he responded, \\"Blobette is also the property of Majesco, so there is no reason she could not appear in a new game. Oh man, we have such awesome ideas for her!\\" Reception Critical reception for The Rescue of Princess Blobette has been relatively positive. Computer and Video Games praised the game as being addictive and fun, and recommended it to players who want something original and have a lot of time on their hands. Nintendo Power echoed these comments, adding that it is challenging to both novice players and players who have already mastered the original A Boy and His Blob. Ed Griffiths of Nintendojo felt the game's graphics and sound to be very plain, but found gameplay mix of puzzles and exploration satisfying for first time players. Griffiths summarized, \\"It's short and it's not as much fun the second (or hundredth) time through, but this game is still a keeper. It's thoroughly enjoyable while it lasts, and its unique gameplay gives it a well-deserved cult classic status. Still, there are other games out there that'll give you more bang for your buck.\\" 1UP.com writer Ray Barnholt, who is familiar with the original A Boy and His Blob, was thoroughly unimpressed with The Rescue of Princess Blobette. Barnholt disliked the limited room to move, the ability of the blob to accidentally push the boy into a deadly trap, and no way to save one's progress.

Opened in 1972, the shopping center initially featured Jefferson Ward and Britt's discount stores, and later included the first locations for the retail chains Office Depot and Sports Authority. The complex was torn down in 1995 and redeveloped as a strip mall. History Lakes Mall opened in 1972, anchored by discount stores Jefferson Ward and Britt's, with other major tenants including a Pantry Pride supermarket and a McCrory dime store. By the 1980s, the mall was losing business to larger shopping centers in town. Also, Britt's closed in 1981, Pantry Pride in 1984, and Jefferson Ward in 1985. By 1986, the center had more than 25 vacancies; a year later, 42 of its 83 storefronts were vacant. Despite the increasing vacancies, the first Office Depot opened in the mall in 1986, and a flea market filled the former Britt's. Shortly after the Office Depot opened, the owners announced that they would begin renovating the mall with a \\"main street\\" theme. Kmart bought the former Jefferson Ward building, converting part of it to a Builders Square home improvement store, while the rest became the first location of Sports Authority, a sports equipment store. Since Office Depot, The Sports Authority, and Builders Square did not open to the mall, traffic within the mall itself continued to decline. By 1989, the only other retailers inside were McCrory (which closed on December 31 that year), two restaurants, a men's clothing store, and some offices and service tenants. Also, the mall's owners filed a mortgage on it, but the mortgage holder was charged in a foreclosure suit because it also owned space in the mall and could no longer afford to pay rent. The city building inspector declared the building unsafe in April 1990. Builders Square closed its store in July 1990 so that Sports Authority could expand both its retail floor space and headquarters. A month later, the last two tenants (an optician and dentist's office) moved out following a roof collapse, leaving only Sports Authority and Office Depot. In 1992, renovation plans were announced that called for demolition of the structure, except for those stores. The mall was finally torn down in 1996, with Linen Supermarket, Mac Frugal's (which converted to Big Lots in 2002) and Smart & Final opening on portions of the former lot. Sports Authority moved out in 2003, moving its headquarters to suburban Denver, Colorado, and Big Lots closed the same year. Smart & Final also closed its Florida stores in 2003. The complex was purchased in 2008 by UrbanAmerica LP of New York City, and Florida Career College moved into a portion. In 2009, Ross Dress for Less opened on the north side of the mall, and Burlington Coat Factory opened at the south end in 2010. Yoram Izhak, also the owner of Lauderhill Mall, bought the property in May 2012.

He is principally known for his panoramic battle scenes as well as his landscape paintings. A single still life by his hand is known. After training and starting his career in Antwerp, the artist moved to Brussels where he entered into the service of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. Following his appointment by the Archduke to the position of Côntroleur des fortifications pour le service de sa Maj. en Flandre (Controller of fortifications in the service of his Majesty in Flanders) he lived from 1661 until his death in 1668 in Bergues-Saint-Winoc.

By 1649 van den Hoecke had left Antwerp for Brussels where he became a court painter of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. Here he joined up with his half-brother Jan, court painter of the Archduke since 1644 when the Archduke was still residing in Austria.Matthias Depoorter, Jan van den Hoecke at Barok in Vlaanderen From 1661 until his death in 1668 Robert van den Hoecke resided in Bergues-Saint-Winoc as the Côntroleur des fortifications pour le service de sa Maj. en Flandre (Controller of fortifications in the service of his Majesty in Flanders). In this position he was responsible for all defence works in Flanders. His fellow Antwerp painter Gonzales Coques painted van den Hoecke's portrait in the form of an allegory of sight, one work in a series on the five senses.National Gallery website (accessed 14 July 2014). The portrait shows van den Hoecke in his official capacity as \\"Côntroleur des fortifications\\" wearing a belt and a sword. The artist is holding a painter's palette in hand and in his other a just finished picture of a military camp, which corresponds to the plan of Ostend lying on the table in front of him. The choice of the painter-engraver Robert van den Hoecke as an impersonation of the sense of sight was peculiarly apt, since his delicacy of handling was particularly admired by his contemporaries.W. Martin Conwary, The Five Senses at the National Gallery in: The Magazine of Art, Marion Harry Spielmann Cassell, Petter & Galpin, 1883, p. 214 Work Storming of a fortress Some thirty paintings by Robert van den Hoecke are conserved in public museums of which only two are dated – Skating on the moat in Brussels in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (1649) and Military camp in the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Dunkerque.Robert van den Hoecke at the Dorotheum As controller of the fortifications of Flanders, he painted many views of camps, battles and cities. As the court painter of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, the governor of the Southern Netherlands, Robert van den Hoecke created various compositions showing the participation of the Archduke in the daily life of the territory in his charge. These works with an obvious propagandistic intent include paintings such as the Skating on the moat in Brussels with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm watching and the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm at a nocturnal fire.Paintings of Robert van den Hoecke at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna Many of his works depict battles as well as scenes from military life such as camps. These were painted on small canvases, often set at night and including a great many figures.Adam Bartsch, Le peintre graveur, Volume 5, Van Degen, 1805, p. 147-150 Robert van den Hoecke was a gifted staffage and still life painter and this may be the reason why he collaborated with the court battle painter Peter Snayers on a Military scene presumably depicting the siege by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Armentières in 1647 (Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest). The large figures and the elaborate still life are the work of van den Hoecke, while the smaller figures in the second plane depicting the siege of the city are by the hand of Snayers.Peter Snayers and Robert van den Hoecke, Military scene at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest Military scene with Peter Snayers Van den Hoecke is also known for his landscapes, many of which are winter landscapes.Muzeul de Artă al Republicii Socialiste România, Liza Damadian, Nina Stănculescu, Flemish Engraving in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Meridiane Publishing House, 1982, p. 108 His small landscapes typically feature a multitude of small figures with a view of a low horizon. In these works he displayed his style which stood out through its meticulous draftsmanship, fine brushwork and bright tonalities. Examples of the religious compositions in his oeuvre are the series of twelve paintings on copper depicting the Twelve Apostles, in the collection of the Musée du Mont-de-Piété in Bergues, which is attributed to Robert van den Hoecke.Musée du Mont-de-Piété de Bergues in: Dossier de presse nuit europeenne des musees dans le Nord-Pas-de-Calais, 19 May 2012, p. 8 These works were formerly housed in the Saint-Victor church in Bergues. As shown in the St. Matthias from this series, the landscapes in the religious compositions and their figures are painted with the same attention to detail as in his winter landscapes.Jan Van den Hoecke in: Larousse That Robert van den Hoecke was also interested in still life painting is evidenced by a stand- alone Still life of household utensils (Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna). Various of his paintings also incorporate extensive still life elements as demonstrated in his contribution to the collaborative effort with Peter Snayers on the Military scene (Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest), to which he added a still life of pottery, vegetables, food and dead game. He engraved about 21 etchings.Édouard Fétis, Galerie du Vte du Bus de Gisignies, 1878, p. 30 His etchings represent mainly military subjects as well as some religious scenes. They are characterized by a great correctness, a fine touch and a quick point. View of Ostende A comprehensive florilegium (at Sotheby’s London on 30 April 2015, lot 30), containing detailed studies of European flora such as narcissi, irises and capsicums, was attributed by a previous owner to Robert van den Hoecke. The spine label of the book is contemporary with the work and indicates the artist as \\"van den Hoecke\\". It is therefore possible that the artist responsible for the work was not Robert but his father Gaspar or his brother Jan.Hoecke, Robert van den (attributed to), Manuscript florilegium at Sotheby’s London on 30 April 2015 The largest collection of his paintings is located in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

It was released in 1991–1992 for a large number of home systems. While Paperboy debuted in arcades and was subsequently ported to home systems, this game was only released for consumer systems. It was released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, NES, SNES, and ZX Spectrum.  Gameplay  The game was much like the original: the player controls a paperboy (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles, such as tires rolling down a driveway while a car is being repaired, or strange houses like a haunted house, while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty. There are four specific actions that can be taken somewhere in the middle of each stage that reward the player with a front-page photo on the newspaper afterwards. Such actions included breaking a window with a paper, where the next day's paper would read \\"Mysterious Vandalism Baffles Police\\", showing an angry policeman looking at broken windows. Others could be coming across a gas station being robbed and hitting the gunman with a paper behind his back, then having the next day's paper headlined with \\"Paperboy {Papergirl} Foils Armed Robbery\\" or seeing a runaway baby carriage and stopping it with a paper, and the forthcoming headline being \\"Girl {Boy} Saves Breakway Baby\\". Both heroic stories would show a happy policeman rewarding the paperboy with candy.

Seiberg–Witten invariants are similar to Donaldson invariants and can be used to prove similar (but sometimes slightly stronger) results about smooth 4-manifolds. They are technically much easier to work with than Donaldson invariants; for example, the moduli spaces of solutions of the Seiberg–Witten equations tends to be compact, so one avoids the hard problems involved in compactifying the moduli spaces in Donaldson theory. For detailed descriptions of Seiberg–Witten invariants see , , , , . For the relation to symplectic manifolds and Gromov–Witten invariants see . For the early history see . Spinc-structures The Spinc group (in dimension 4) is :(U(1) \\\\times \\\\mathrm{Spin}(4))/(\\\\Z/2\\\\Z). where the \\\\Z/2\\\\Z acts as a sign on both factors. The group has a natural homomorphism to SO(4) = Spin(4)/±1. Given a compact oriented 4 manifold, choose a smooth Riemannian metric g with Levi Civita connection abla^{g}. This reduces the structure group from the connected component GL(4)+ to SO(4) and is harmless from a homotopical point of view. A Spinc-structure or complex spin structure on M is a reduction of the structure group to Spinc, i.e. a lift of the SO(4) structure on the tangent bundle to the group Spinc. By a theorem of Hirzebruch and Hopf, every smooth oriented compact 4-manifold M admits a Spinc structure. The existence of a Spinc structure is equivalent to the existence of a lift of the second Stiefel- Whitney class w_2(M) \\\\in H^2(M, \\\\Z/2\\\\Z) to a class K \\\\in H^2(X, \\\\Z). Conversely such a lift determines the Spinc structure up to 2 torsion in H^2(X,\\\\Z). A spin structure proper requires the more restrictive w_2(M) = 0. A Spinc structure determines (and is determined by) a spinor bundle W = W^+ \\\\oplus W^- coming from the 2 complex dimensional positive and negative spinor representation of Spin(4) on which U(1) acts by multiplication. We have K = c_1(W^+) = c_1(W^-). The spinor bundle W comes with a graded Clifford algebra bundle representation i.e. a map \\\\gamma:\\\\mathrm{Cliff}(M, g) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\mathit{nd}(W) such that for each 1 form a we have \\\\gamma(a):W^\\\\pm \\\\to W^\\\\mp and \\\\gamma(a)^2 = - g(a, a). There is a unique hermitian metric h on W s.t. \\\\gamma(a) is skew Hermitian for real 1 forms a. It gives an induced action of the forms \\\\wedge^* M by anti-symmetrising. In particular this gives an isomorphism of \\\\wedge^+ M \\\\cong \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\mathit{nd}^{sh}_0(W^+) of the selfdual two forms with the traceless skew Hermitian endomorphisms of W^+ which are then identified. Seiberg–Witten equations Let L = \\\\det(W^+) \\\\equiv \\\\det(W^-) be the determinant line bundle with c_1(L) = K. For every connection abla_{A} = abla_0 + A with A \\\\in iA^1_{\\\\R}(M) on L, there is a unique spinor connection abla^{A} on W i.e. a connection such that abla^{A}_X(\\\\gamma(a)) := [ abla^{A}_X, \\\\gamma(a)] = \\\\gamma( abla^{g}_X a) for every 1-form a and vector field X. The Clifford connection then defines a Dirac operator D^A = \\\\gamma \\\\otimes 1 \\\\circ abla^A = \\\\gamma(dx^\\\\mu) abla^A_\\\\mu on W. The group of maps \\\\mathcal{G} = \\\\\\\\{u: M \\\\to U(1)\\\\\\\\} acts as a gauge group on the set of all connections on L. The action of \\\\mathcal{G} can be \\"gauge fixed\\" e.g. by the condition d^*A = 0, leaving an effective parametrisation of the space of all such connections of H^1(M,\\\\R)^{\\\\mathrm{harm}}/H^1(M,\\\\Z) \\\\oplus d^* A^+_{\\\\R}(M) with a residual U(1) gauge group action. Write \\\\phi for a spinor field of positive chirality, i.e. a section of W^+. The Seiberg–Witten equations for (\\\\phi, abla^A) are now :D^A\\\\phi=0 :F^+_A=\\\\sigma(\\\\phi) + i\\\\omega Here F^A \\\\in iA^2_{\\\\R}(M) is the closed curvature 2-form of abla^A, F^+_A is its self-dual part, and σ is the squaring map \\\\phi\\\\mapsto \\\\left (\\\\phi h(\\\\phi, -) -\\\\tfrac12 h(\\\\phi, \\\\phi)1_{W^+} \\\\right) from W^+ to the a traceless Hermitian endomorphism of W^+ identified with an imaginary self-dual 2-form, and \\\\omega is a real selfdual two form, often taken to be zero or harmonic. The gauge group \\\\mathcal{G} acts on the space of solutions. After adding the gauge fixing condition d^*A = 0 the residual U(1) acts freely, except for \\"reducible solutions\\" with \\\\phi = 0. For technical reasons, the equations are in fact defined in suitable Sobolev spaces of sufficiently high regularity. An application of the Weitzenböck formula :{ abla^A}^* abla^A \\\\phi = (D^A)^2\\\\phi - (\\\\tfrac12\\\\gamma(F_A^+) + s)\\\\phi and the identity : \\\\Delta_g \\\\phi_h^2 = 2h({ abla^A}^* abla^A\\\\phi, \\\\phi) - 2 abla^A\\\\phi_{g\\\\otimes h} to solutions of the equations gives an equality : \\\\Delta\\\\phi^2 +  abla^A\\\\phi^2 + \\\\tfrac14\\\\phi^4 = (-s)\\\\phi^2 - \\\\tfrac12h(\\\\phi,\\\\gamma(\\\\omega)\\\\phi). If \\\\phi^2 is maximal \\\\Delta\\\\phi^2\\\\ge 0, so this shows that for any solution, the sup norm \\\\\\\\phi\\\\_\\\\infty is a priori bounded with the bound depending only on the scalar curvature s of (M, g) and the self dual form \\\\omega. After adding the gauge fixing condition, elliptic regularity of the Dirac equation shows that solutions are in fact a priori bounded in Sobolev norms of arbitrary regularity, which shows all solutions are smooth, and that the space of all solutions up to gauge equivalence is compact. The solutions (\\\\phi, abla^A) of the Seiberg–Witten equations are called monopoles, as these equations are the field equations of massless magnetic monopoles on the manifold M. The moduli space of solutions The space of solutions is acted on by the gauge group, and the quotient by this action is called the moduli space of monopoles. The moduli space is usually a manifold. For generic metrics, after gauge fixing, the equations cut out the solution space transversely and so define a smooth manifold. The residual U(1) \\"gauge fixed\\" gauge group U(1) acts freely except at reducible monopoles i.e. solutions with \\\\phi = 0. By the Atiyah-Singer index theorem the moduli space is finite dimensional and has \\"virtual dimension\\" :(K^2-2\\\\chi_{\\\\mathrm{top}}(M)-3\\\\operatorname{sign}(M))/4 which for generic metrics is the actual dimension away from the reducibles. It means that the moduli space is generically empty if the virtual dimension is negative. For a self dual 2 form \\\\omega, the reducible solutions have \\\\phi = 0, and so are determined by connections abla_A = abla_0 + A on L such that F_0 + d A = i(\\\\alpha + \\\\omega) for some anti selfdual 2-form \\\\alpha. By the Hodge decomposition, since F_0 is closed, the only obstruction to solving this equation for A given \\\\alpha and \\\\omega, is the harmonic part of \\\\alpha and \\\\omega, and the harmonic part, or equivalently, the (de Rham) cohomology class of the curvature form i.e. [F_0] = F_0^{\\\\mathrm{harm}} = i (\\\\omega^{\\\\mathrm{harm}} + \\\\alpha^{\\\\mathrm{harm}}) \\\\in H^2(M, \\\\R). Thus, since the [\\\\tfrac1{2\\\\pi i} F_0] = K the necessary and sufficient condition for a reducible solution is : \\\\omega^{\\\\mathrm{harm}} \\\\in 2\\\\pi K + \\\\mathcal{H}^- \\\\in H^2(X,\\\\R) where \\\\mathcal{H}^- is the space of harmonic anti-selfdual 2-forms. A two form \\\\omega is K-admissible if this condition is not met and solutions are necessarily irreducible. In particular, for b^+ \\\\ge 1, the moduli space is a (possibly empty) compact manifold for generic metrics and admissible \\\\omega. Note that, if b_+ \\\\ge 2 the space of K-admissible two forms is connected, whereas if b_+ = 1 it has two connected components (chambers). The moduli space can be given a natural orientation from an orientation on the space of positive harmonic 2 forms, and the first cohomology. The a priori bound on the solutions, also gives a priori bounds on F^{\\\\mathrm{harm}}. There are therefore (for fixed \\\\omega) only finitely many K \\\\in H^2(M,\\\\Z), and hence only finitely many Spinc structures, with a non empty moduli space. Seiberg–Witten invariants The Seiberg–Witten invariant of a four-manifold M with b2+(M) ≥ 2 is a map from the spinc structures on M to Z. The value of the invariant on a spinc structure is easiest to define when the moduli space is zero-dimensional (for a generic metric). In this case the value is the number of elements of the moduli space counted with signs. The Seiberg–Witten invariant can also be defined when b2+(M) = 1, but then it depends on the choice of a chamber. A manifold M is said to be of simple type if the Seiberg- Witten invariant vanishes whenever the expected dimension of the moduli space is nonzero. The simple type conjecture states that if M is simply connected and b2+(M) ≥ 2 then the manifold is of simple type. This is true for symplectic manifolds. If the manifold M has a metric of positive scalar curvature and b2+(M) ≥ 2 then all Seiberg–Witten invariants of M vanish. If the manifold M is the connected sum of two manifolds both of which have b2+ ≥ 1 then all Seiberg–Witten invariants of M vanish. If the manifold M is simply connected and symplectic and b2+(M) ≥ 2 then it has a spinc structure s on which the Seiberg–Witten invariant is 1. In particular it cannot be split as a connected sum of manifolds with b2+ ≥ 1\\\\.

A Domestic Story (1849), Fadette. A Domestic Story (1851) and Little Fadette (1967), is an 1849 novel by French novelist George Sand, née Amantine Dupin. Sand wrote the rural story together with La Mare au Diable and François le Champi in the 1840s as she returned from Paris to the countryside of Châteauroux. The novel is one of Sand's best known today. Plot The novel takes place in the 19th-century French countryside. The parents of Landry and Sylvinet, identical twins, who are respectable and relatively rich farmers, do not follow the advice that is given at the twins' birth to keep separating and distinguishing them from each other while they are still young. Consequently, the twins grow up together. Although they are opposites, with Landry the less emotional, more conventionally strong twin, and Sylvinet, the less physically strong and more emotional one, the twins both love each other more than anything else. When they are 14 years old, the plot takes a turn. Due to the family's dire financial straits, one twin has to leave to work in a neighbouring farm, and Landry is chosen. Landry tries to hide his distress out of pride, unlike Sylvinet, who cries and is very demonstrative. Sylvinet does not understand how Landry can pretend to want to leave home. He is therefore hurt, and he responds angrily and emotionally to the separation, disappearing into the woods. When looking for his brother in the woods, Landry encounters Fadette. Fadette lives with her younger brother and a grandmother who makes the two children work constantly. The children are despised and looked down upon by the other villagers for being different. The children are known as \\"witches\\" and indeed often appear unkempt, covered in dirt, and at one with the elements. When Fadette helps Landry to find his brother, she makes him promise to return the favor. She helps Landry cross a small river, on the other end of which he finds his brother. At the next village fête, Fadette asks Landry to dance with her and only her. Landry is angered, though he knows he has promised to fulfill the favor. He is ashamed to be associated with Fadette due to her reputation as a witch and is disappointed, as Madelon, the most beautiful and coquettish girl in town, wants to dance with him instead. However, he reluctantly keeps his promise and even defends Fadette when the village boys attack her. Moved but embarrassed by the gesture, Fadette tells Landry to dance with whomever he wants and leaves the party. However, Landry goes after her and hears her crying. They talk at length in the dark village, and Landry realises that she is a very sweet, sensible, and intelligent person, and begins to fall in love with the little Fadette. He even wants to kiss her but she refuses, telling him that he will regret it the next day. Fadette is right; the next day, Landry remembers her dirty face, and does not understand how he could have felt such an attraction for her. But soon after, he overhears a conversation between Fadette and Madelon that emphasizes that Fadette is kind and humble and the other girl is vain and proud. His feelings are then revived. He asks Fadette to marry him; a secret engagement. Sylvinet is aware that something is different about his brother and that the relationship between them has changed. He suffers deeply and behaves badly in the eyes of everyone around him. Sylvinet then discovers their secret but keeps it to himself. It is when Madelon finds out that the news is spread through the village. Everyone, including Landry's parents, are shocked and urge him to end the relationship immediately. Landry refuses but Fadette decides to leave town to put an end to the scandal and talk. Some time after, Landry decides to leave since, due to Sylvinet's increasing anger and depression toward him, the twins' relationship has begun to fracture. When Fadette returns to town, she has become a prosperous, attractive, and reputable young woman. After her grandmother's death, she inherits a surprisingly large amount of money and is able to look after herself and her brother properly. Now everyone in the village is forced to finally acknowledge her merits and even Landry's parents approve of their engagement. But jealousy is making Sylvinet more and more disgruntled and even physically ill. Although he initially refuses to see Fadette, she actually manages to cure Sylvinet and he finally accepts her. After Landry and Fadette are married, Sylvinet enlists in the army and leaves the provinces. Landry is not aware of Sylvinet's feeling, but in a twist of irony, it turns out that his mother and probably Fadette have suspected all along that Sylvinet is in love with Fadette. Thus his final enlistment is an act of sacrifice, as he does not want to stand in the way of his brother's happiness. Publication and adaptations The novel was translated into English and published in 1900 by Henry Holt and Company, and an updated critical translation by Gretchen van Slyke was published by Penn State University Press in 2017.

Greatly influenced by construction of railroads in the 19th century, it experienced growth in tourism as well as the development of towns and villages into some of the first modern suburbs in the United States. American Indian settlements At the time of European contact, the Lenape people (named the Delaware by Europeans) inhabited the western end of the Island, and spoke the Munsee dialect of the Algonquian language family. Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to record an encounter with these people when he entered what is now New York Bay in 1524. The eastern portion of the island was inhabited by speakers of the Mohegan- Montauk-Narragansett language group of the same language family, representing their ties to the aboriginal peoples inhabiting what is now Connecticut and Rhode Island. The area was central to the production of Wampum, providing the resources necessary for its creation. Montaukett tribe and their northern neighbors Decades after the decline in population of Native American on Long Island, amateur anthropologist Silas Wood published a book claiming that there had been several homogenous \\"tribes\\" traditional to Long Island; they erroneously became collectively known as the Metoac, a word that has no known Native American origin and means nothing in any indigenous language on Long Island. Modern scientific scholarship has shown that there were two linguistic groups representing two cultural identities on the island, as noted above, not \\"13 tribes\\" as asserted by Wood.Strong, John A. Algonquian Peoples of Long Island Heart of the Lakes Publishing (March 1997). Bragdon, Kathleen. The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. Columbia University Press (January 15, 2002). . The Montaukett, Unkechaug, and Shinnecock nations, three Native American groups with ties to aboriginal inhabitants, still live on the island. A Native American name for Long Island is Paumanok, meaning \\"The Island that Pays Tribute\\". More powerful tribes in the surrounding areas forced the relatively peaceful Long Islanders to give tributes and payment to avoid attacks.Richmond Hill Historic Society Tributary tribes Colony Dutch and English Settlements A map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies. The western portion of Long Island was settled by the Dutch, who named it Lange Eylant. They also had early settlements in the 17th century on what are now Manhattan and Staten Island. On April 22, 1636 Charles I of England ordered that the Plymouth Colony, which had laid claim to the island but had not settled it, give the island to William Alexander. Alexander through his agent James Farret (who personally received Shelter Island and Robins Island) in turn sold most of the eastern island to the New Haven and Connecticut colonies.The History of Long Island – Benjamin F. Thompson – Gould Banks and Company – 1843 Lion Gardiner was the first English settler as he settled on Gardiners Island in 1637. Farret arrived in New Amsterdam in 1637 to present his claim of English sovereignty and was arrested and sent to prison in Holland where he escaped. English attempted to settle at Cow Bay at what today is Port Washington in May 1640 but were arrested and released after saying they were mistaken about the title.Year book of the Holland Society of New-York By Holland Society of New York – 1922 English settlements on the east end began in earnest shortly thereafter. Puritans from New Haven, Connecticut, arrived in present-day Southold on October 21, 1640. Under the leadership of the Reverend John Youngs, with Peter Hallock, the families of Barnabas Horton, John Budd, John Conklin, William Wells, John Tuthill, Thomas Mapes, Richard Terry, Matthias Corwin, Robert Akerly, Zachariah Corey and Isaac Arnold planted the first English and first white settlement in eastern Long Island. They purchased the land in the summer of 1640 from an Indian tribe named the Corchaugs. The Corchaug name of what became Southold was Yenniock. Southampton was founded when settlers from Lynn, Massachusetts established residence on lands obtained from local Shinnecock Indian Nation also in 1640. The first settlers included eight men, one woman, and a boy who came ashore at Conscience Point. Dutch complaints did not matter. Officials of the Colony of New Netherland did not make immediate efforts to expel the English from such a remote place. Southold remained under the jurisdiction of New Haven until 1662, and of Connecticut until 1674. When the English handed over the colony of New York to the Dutch in 1673, the eastern towns, including Southold, Easthampton and Southampton, refused to submit. The Dutch attempted to force the matter by arms. The English colonists repelled them with assistance from Connecticut settlers. When New York became English again in 1674, these eastern towns, whose people were Yankee by background, preferred to stay part of Connecticut. Although Connecticut agreed, the government of the Duke of York forced the matter. Governor Sir Edmund Andros threatened to eliminate the settlers' rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676.Richard Mather Bayles, Sketches of Suffolk County, Historical and Descriptive, with a Historical Outline of Long Island, 1874 This was chiefly the result of the Duke of York's grudge against Connecticut, as New Haven had hidden three of the judges who sentenced the Duke's father King Charles I to death in 1649. Long Island contained three of the original twelve counties of the English Province of New York organized in 1683: Kings, Queens, and Suffolk. At that time, Queens County included all of present-day Nassau County and a small portion of western Suffolk County. Residents in Long Island towns conducted several witch hunts, including one involving the daughter of Lion Gardiner in East Hampton. Early colonial figures on the island include Wyandanch, William \\"Tangier\\" Smith, Captain William Kidd, Lion Gardiner, and John Underhill. Revolutionary War The Battle of Long Island, the largest Revolutionary War battle, ranged across Kings County, now the Borough of Brooklyn in New York City. Apart from espionage and raids across Long Island Sound, there was limited military action in Queens and Suffolk County. Throughout most of the war, Long Island was controlled by the King's forces. As was customary, they billeted Hessian and regular troops with local households, who had to provide bedding and food for soldiers. In Oyster Bay, Major John André was visiting the headquarters of Lt. Col. James Simcoe at Raynham Hall, the family home of Robert Townsend, one of George Washington's Culper Ring spies. Townsend family legend holds that Robert's sister Sally overheard André and Simcoe discussing Benedict Arnold's treasonous plan to turn West Point over to the King's forces.Raynham Hall Museum , accessed 2 Jun 2008. The facts are that Simcoe occupied the house only from late 1778 to early 1779, and Arnold did not obtain command of West Point until August 1780. Colonists conducted numerous raids on Long Island during the war, usually by whaleboats from Connecticut. The most famous raid was the Sag Harbor or Meigs Raid in 1777. Possibly the last battle of the American Revolution was the \\"Boat Fight\\" of December 1782.Frederic Mather, The Refugees of 1776 from Long Island to Connecticut, Albany: J.B. Lyon, 1913, 225-8, 204-8 Nineteenth century In the 19th century, Long Island was still mainly rural and agricultural. Suburbanization started modestly on Long Island when reliable steam ferry service allowed prosperous Wall Streeters to get to new Brooklyn Heights homes in time for dinner. Rural traffic was served by the new Brooklyn and Jamaica Plank road through Jamaica Pass, among others. After the American Civil War, streetcar suburbs sprawled out onto the outwash plain of central and southern Kings County. Trolleys also brought workers from other parts of western Queens to Long Island City jobs. The Long Island Rail Road was begun as a combined ferry-rail route to Boston via Greenport. The predecessor to the Long Island Rail Road began service in 1836 from the ferry terminal (to Manhattan) through Brooklyn to Jamaica in Queens, and completed the line to the east end of Long Island in 1844. Other rail lines to Coney Island, the Rockaways and Long Beach serviced the beach resort towns. The growing and merging railroads opened up more than 50 stations in (present-day) Nassau County and over 40 in Suffolk Country, laying the foundation for the future suburbanization of the island.MTA Long Island RailRoad Map, (C) 2004 From 1830 until 1930, population roughly doubled every twenty years, and several cities were incorporated, such as the City of Brooklyn in Kings County, and Long Island City in Queens. By the late 19th century, Long Island had become a summer refuge for residents of New York City. The Landing, in Glen Cove, is named for the spot where 19th- century steamship lines would disembark summer visitors, not far from where J. P. Morgan had his summer mansion. Long Island was the home of a branch of the prominent Roosevelt family, including author Robert Roosevelt, and his more famous nephew, President Theodore Roosevelt, who built a summer home at Sagamore Hill on the North Shore of Nassau County – on the outskirts of Oyster Bay. Roosevelt Field was named after Quentin Roosevelt, Theodore's son. Gold Coast Mansions on the North Shore of Long Island were also the homes of the wealthy Vanderbilt family and late-19th-century financiers and industrialists, such as John Paul Getty, Charles Pratt and others. The Brooklyn Bridge, the first of seven bridges constructed across the East River, connects Long Island with the Borough of Manhattan (in background). Until the 1883 completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, the only connection between Long Island and the rest of the United States was by boat. Other bridges and tunnels followed, and a suburban character spread as population increased. On January 1, 1898, Kings County and portions of Queens were consolidated into The City of Greater New York, abolishing all cities and towns within them. The easternmost 280 square miles (725 km2) of Queens County, which were not part of the consolidation plan, formed a separate county in 1899. \\"Nassau\\", one of several names by which the island was once known, was revived to represent the newly established county.  Slavery on Long Island  Black people have been an integral part of Long Island history, most arriving first as slaves before the Revolution and working both at domestic and rural trades. New York and Long Island kept slavery until laws for its gradual abolition were passed in 1799. The last slaves were freed by 1827. Most freedmen settled near where they had been living. With the small family farms and industrial economy within the North, the need for slavery was much less than in the Southern United States. Slavery tended to be more common in rural areas of the Northeast, like Long Island, rather than in the cities.Burrows, Edwin G., and Mike Wallace. Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898. New York: Oxford University Press. 1999. Slavery took a different form in the Northern states than on Southern plantations. While slaves were still treated as property by law, and included as bequests in wills, they were fewer in number.Griswold, Mac K. The Manor: Three Centuries at a Slave Plantation on Long Island. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. 2013. On Long Island, it was typical for farmers to own five or six slaves per household. They lived closely within the family, sometimes within the same quarters. After the Civil War, the issue of race increased on Long Island, as well as surrounding areas in New York. Fears of freed blacks taking the jobs of working-class whites created tensions in addition to tensions with immigrant communities seeking work.Peterson, Carla. Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in nineteenth century New York City. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2011. As time progressed, African Americans within the local Tri-State area began to work in industrialized cities such as New York City and Philadelphia. Growth in the 20th century Early in the 20th century, elevated and subway trains allowed masses of workers to commute to Manhattan jobs from Queens and eastern Brooklyn, which offered cheaper and larger housing but were far beyond reasonable walking distance. Seven new bridges were built across the East River - Williamsburg Bridge (1903), Queensboro Bridge (1909), Manhattan Bridge (1909), Hell Gate Bridge (1916), Triborough Bridge (1936), Bronx-Whitestone Bridge (1939), and Throgs Neck Bridge (1961). Immigrants spilling over from New York City made comfortable lives on Long Island. The immigration waves of Southern and Eastern Europe have been pivotal in creating the diversity on Long Island that many other American regions lack. These immigrations are reflected in the large Irish American, Italian American and Jewish-American populations. Typically the immigrants lived in the city first or the more urban western parts of the island, and their children and grandchildren moved further east. Late-20th-century immigrants, by contrast, often settled directly in Nassau County and other suburban areas. When racing was banned on public roads, one of the Vanderbilts opened the Long Island Motor Parkway in 1908 from Kissena (Queens) to Lake Ronkonkoma. This limited access motor highway was one of the first in the world. In the 1920s and 1930s, suburbanization reached beyond the western end of the island, and Long Island began the transformation from backwoods and farms to the paradigm of the American suburb. Under its president Robert Moses, the Long Island State Park Commission spanned the island with parkways and state parks. Jones Beach was the most famous, \\"the crown jewel in Moses' State Park System\\". Long Island quickly became New York City's retreat – with millions of people going to and from the city to the new state parks. In time, development started to follow the parkways and the railroad lines, with commuter towns springing up first along the railroad, then the roadways: the Southern State Parkway, the Northern State Parkway, and, from the 1960s on, the Long Island Expressway. After World War II, Long Island's population skyrocketed, mostly in Nassau County and western Suffolk County. People who worked and lived in New York City moved out to Long Island in the new developments built during the post-war boom. The most famous post- war development was the town of Levittown. Positioned along the Wantagh Parkway and near Southern State Parkway, in the area formerly known as Island Trees, Levittown became the first place where a developer built numerous adjacent houses in one subdivision, providing great opportunity for GIs' returning home to build families. After the success of Levittown, other areas modeled what some people criticize as \\"suburban sprawl\\", and Nassau County became more densely populated than its eastern counterpart, Suffolk County. In the late 1960s, areas in Suffolk County, such as Deer Park and Commack, also saw rapid development. Driving out east along routes such as New York Route 27 (Sunrise Highway) along the South Shore or on the North Shore along New York State Route 25 (Jericho Turnpike) or New York State Route 25A, houses and buildings start to spread out, even turning back to the potato and sod farms that once were East of and including towns such as Mount Sinai. (Although Development is Spreading Further East) 21st century Long Island and 9/11 Long Island residents suffered many losses in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. A large portion of the island's residents commute daily to Manhattan for work. In the days after the attacks, many of the victims' cars remained parked in the same spots at Long Island Rail Road stations- leaving a visual reminder of the intimate nature of the tragedy for other commuters. On a per capita basis, the village of Garden City lost the most people in the attacks. Almost all of Long Island's volunteer fire departments were called to assist the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) by providing manpower at Ground Zero, assisting in evacuations, and providing firefighting coverage for areas of the city stripped by the response to lower Manhattan. Due to extremely clear weather, many in Eastern Long Island, including places like Old Inlet and Fire Island, could see the huge clouds of smoke rising for days from the ashes of the World Trade Center. 2008–2009 recession Long Island slipped into recession in October 2008 almost a year later than the U.S. economy. It lost 7,100 private-sector jobs in the 12 months ended in November 2008 with losses spread across most industries. Taking into account coming business failures, layoffs delayed until after the holiday season, and cost controlling in the growing health care and government sectors, Nassau-Suffolk could lose another 20,000 to 35,000 payroll jobs before losses abate late this year or next. This is in addition to potential job losses among the These losses could push Long Island's unemployment rate from the current 5.2 percent to as much as 6.8 percent by year end. The median price of newly sold Nassau homes fell from a peak of $502,500 in August 2007 to $410,000 in November 2008, a drop of more than 18 percent. Comparable Suffolk prices peaked at $520,000 in June 2007 and declined to $435,000 in November 2008. Median home prices on Long Island could fall by another 15 percent before the Long Island housing market bottoms out, probably in 2010. This assumes that the market settles back to its long-term ratio of home prices being 15 times annual rents. Aviation history Long Island is important in the history of aviation. Roosevelt Airfield was established in 1916 in Garden City, Nassau County. From this airport, Charles Lindbergh took off on his historic 1927 nonstop Orteig Prize flight from New York to Paris, France. Roosevelt Airfield was closed in 1951. Its land was redeveloped for commercial uses, including a shopping mall, Hofstra University, and numerous mid-density housing developments. Long Island was also the location of major historic aerospace companies. Farmingdale-based Republic Aviation, for instance, manufactured the famed P-47 fighter aircraft during the World War II period. Grumman Aircraft, with operations in Bethpage and Calverton, produced the F-14 U.S. Navy fighter during the 1970s and 1980s. It was also the chief contractor on the Apollo Lunar Module that landed men on the moon. They received the contract on 7 November 1962, and ultimately built 13 lunar modules (LMs). One is on display at the Cradle of Aviation Museum at the former Mitchel Air Force Base on the Hempstead Plains of Long Island. Another important historic Long Island airport was Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. Opened in 1931, it was New York City's first commercial airport. It was the start point or terminus of historic flights by Amelia Earhart, Roscoe Turner, Wiley Post, and Howard Hughes. It was sold to the Navy shortly before World War II for use as a Naval Air Station. In 1972, the Navy departed and the open space was transferred to the National Park Service as part of Gateway National Recreation Area. Two of New York City's main airports, LaGuardia Airport which opened for commercial flights in 1939, and John F. Kennedy International Airport opened in 1948, are located on the geographic Island. There have been more than ten major air disasters. The three following planes all crashed in either Nassau or Suffolk County: In 1965, Eastern Airlines Flight 663 crashed into Jones Beach State Park after take-off. In 1990, Avianca Flight 52 crashed into Cove Neck, NY, killing 73 passengers. In 1996, TWA Flight 800 exploded over water off the coast of the small hamlet of East Moriches. Fatalities totaled 230 people in the disaster. A monument to those lost stands at Smith Point County Park on Fire Island in Suffolk County. On July 25, 2012, Representative Carolyn McCarthy (NY-04), who represents part of Nassau County, introduced the Long Island Aviation History Act. The bill, H.R. 6201, requires the National Park Service to study various ways to commemorate and preserve Long Island's aviation history, including by designating parts of Long Island as National Historic Sites and National Historic Parks. The bill also requires the National Park Service to evaluate ways to enhance historical research, education, interpretation and public awareness of Long Island's aviation history.

(14 February 1831 - 28 January 1895) was a Holy Cross father and vicar general for the Acadian population of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island (Maritime Canada). Born in Saint Philippe-de-Laprairie, Lower Canada, he was an itinerant primary school teacher before beginning religious studies in 1852, at the Congregation of Holy Cross at Saint-Laurent near Montreal. He was ordained a priest on 29 July 1855 at age 24. First appointed as assistant priest in the rural parish of Saint-Eustache, he afterwards taught at a business college in Saint-Aimé (Massueville) in the diocese of Saint- Hyacinthe. In 1863, Bishop John Sweeny of New Brunswick recognized a need to provide education to the French speaking Catholic population the Maritime colonies, as well as English-speaking Catholics of Irish and Scottish descent. Under Sweeny's mandate, in the fall of 1864 Father Lefebvre founded St. Joseph's College in Memramcook, New Brunswick as a post-secondary centre of learning. It received a provincial charter in 1868 and became eligible for financial support from the government. However the funding only lasted until 1871 when New Brunswick passed its controversial Common Schools Act which attempted to secularize education in the province. In refusing to accept the requirements of the Act, Father Lefebvre forfeited future funding and as a result, the college remained in financial difficulties for the rest of its existence. Nonetheless, the college would make a significant impact within Acadian and English Catholic society by creating a necessary educated class. Father Lefebvre died on 28 January 1895. Three years later, the College was granted university status in 1898. The College remained open until the 1960s when it was absorbed into the University of Moncton. His life and work are commemorated at Monument Lefebvre where the college was founded, and where he died. His biographer was Pascal Poirier.

It was Cage's first piece for orchestraPritchett, 40 and also the first to use what Cage later called the gamut technique, albeit in an early form.Pritchett, 40-45Nicholls, 189 Overview Cage composed the music in early 1947, in the midst of working on Sonatas and Interludes. A piano version was first completed, and an orchestral arrangement followed. Cage dedicated The Seasons to Lincoln Kirstein. The ballet was premiered on May 17, 1947 by the Ballet Society (by which the work was commissionedWilliam Fetterman. John Cage's Theatre Pieces: Notations and Performances, p. 14. Routledge, 1996. ) at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, with original choreography by Merce Cunningham (now lost). Costumes and scenery were designed by Isamu Noguchi. The dancers at the first performance were Gisela Caccialanza, Fred Danieli, Dorothy Dushock, Gerard Leavitt, Tanaquil LeClercq, Job Sanders, Beatrice Tompkins and Cunningham himself.Date on the first performance and contributors from: Anatole Chujoy, Phyllis Winifred Manchester. The Dance Encyclopedia p. 811. Simon and Schuster, 1967. 992p. The ballet is in one act divided into nine sections: Prelude I, Winter; Prelude II, Spring; Prelude III, Summer; Prelude IV, Fall; Finale (Prelude I). As in Sonatas and Interludes and the later String Quartet in Four Parts (1950), Cage was influenced by Indian aesthetics and like the latter work, The Seasons is built on the Indian concept of seasons: winter is associated with quiescence, spring with creation, summer with preservation and fall with destruction. The Finale is a reprise of the first Prelude, symbolizing the cyclical nature of seasons. As in the majority of Cage's compositions from the 1940s, the music of The Seasons is based on a predefined proportion. In this case the proportion is 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, and it governs not only the construction of individual movements, but also the proportions of the entire work, roughly defining the relative lengths of the movements. The compositional technique involves using gamuts of sounds, i.e. predefined sonorities (single notes, chords, aggregates); Cage started developing this approach in The Seasons, and later perfected it in String Quartet in Four Parts and Concerto for Prepared Piano.

He was among those tried, convicted, and imprisoned for the murder of Polish Interior Minister Bronislaw Pieracki, in 1934. The court sentenced him to death, but the state commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. He escaped when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. As leader of OUN-B he is responsible for the genocide of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia.Lebed proposed in April to \\"cleanse the entire revolutionary territory of the Polish population,\\" so that a resurgent Polish state would not claim the region as in 1918.

Radosław Ignatiew, Antoni Kura, Warszawa 2008, p.34-49 In 2009, the United States Congress directed the National Archives and Records Administration to review declassified intelligence records pertaining to the activities of the Nazis and the Japanese Imperial Government that were not processed in time for the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group's (IWG) final report in 2007. The follow-up report from the IWG's Richard Breitman and Norman J. W. Goda included a discussion of Lebed's relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency during the Cold War. In 1949 he emigrated to the United States and lived in New York. Through Prolog Research Corporation, his CIA funded organization, he gathered intelligence on the Soviet Union as late as into the late 1960s. The CIA project name for the operation was AERODYNAMIC. The report stated that as late as 1991 the CIA, for fear of compromising the operation and triggering outrage within the Ukrainian émigré community, shielded Lebed from prosecution for war crimes by preventing the United States Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations from learning about his wartime connections to the Nazis. He died in 1998. Early life Born in Novi Strilyscha, a small town in Galicia, nowadays western part of Ukraine (at the time, Austria–Hungary), Lebed completed his studies in Lviv which during the Interbellum was part of the Second Polish Republic. In 1930-32 he took an active part in setting up youth groups of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) in the area around Lviv. From 1932-34 he directed communications between the Ukrainian Executive and the Foreign Command of the OUN. In 1934, he participated in the preparation of the assassination of the Polish Minister of Internal Affairs Bronisław Pieracki. After the assassination he attempted to flee through Gdansk-Szczecin to Germany, but by order of Himmler was arrested by the Gestapo and handed over to the Polish authorities. During the Warsaw Process (1934–36) he was given the death penalty which was later commuted to life imprisonment. He escaped in September 1939 while being evacuated from the Bereza Kartuska concentration camp due to the threatening Soviet invasion. From November 1939 through March 1940 he served as the chief of the school of espionage and sabotage founded by the Abwehr in Zakopane. World War II In 1940, during the internal conflict that erupted within the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) he supported Stepan Bandera, and, in 1941, became his assistant. In June 1941, he was one of the functionaries in the short- lived Ukrainian government. Lebed assumed control of Bandera's faction of the OUN in western Ukraine, which would come to dominate the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) until 1943.The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) was created in 1942 by a faction of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). The UPA fought mostly against the Armia Krajowa of Poland and the Red Army in Western Ukraine. The OUN-UPA men – who were also known as the \\"Bandera Men\\" – are accused of several crimes, including killing some 100,000 Poles, Czechs and Jews in the Western Volyn Region. Thousands of Ukrainians who refused to cooperate with them were also murdered. For those activities, Bandera is now considered to be a criminal and a terrorist in Poland. In 1941 UPA leader Bandera urged the Ukrainian people to help Nazis destroy Moscow and the Bolsheviks. In Western Ukraine, many people see Bandera as a hero. Streets in several cities have been named after him and a monument has also been recently been erected in his name in Lviv. But in eastern, southern and central parts of the country Bandera is seen as a traitor and Nazi sympathizer In 1942, he was a participant in the 3rd Special Conference of the OUN, and headed the head council and the delegate for external contacts of the Direction of the OUN. In 1944 he became one of the founders of the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR) and the general Secretary of International Policies of the UHVR. At the recommendation of the UHVR he traveled to the West where he contacted various Western governments. In 1948, he became a member of the OUN (Diaspora). Alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany  In a government reports publication, published by the National Archives, Lebed is being suspected of having collaborated with Nazi Germany. Lebed was described as a \\"Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected Nazi collaborator\\",Salazar, Christian and Herschaft, Randy (2010-12-11) Declassified CIA Files Detail Ties Between U.S. And Ex-Nazis, Associated Press and later labeled as a \\"well-known sadist and collaborator of the Germans\\" by United States Army counterintelligence.Roberts, Sam (11 December 2010). \\"Declassified Papers Show U.S. Recruited Ex-Nazis\\".

History The museum is located in a seaplane hangar, built by German occupation forces during World War II. The German seaplane base Seefliegerhorst Aalborg was established there in 1940. Following the war, the hangar was used as a storage depot for equipment of the Danish Civil Defence Forces. In August 2001, the hangar was provided to the Garrison Historical Society of Aalborg for the creation of a military museum. The building was renovated and the museum opened on 22 June 2002. In 2009 a second exhibition hall was opened creating a total exhibit area of approximately . Exhibits The museum covers most branches of Danish defence organizations -- the Danish Navy was excluded because it was already represented in the city's maritime museum. The branches include the Royal Danish Army, the Royal Danish Air Force, the Home Guard, the Police, and the Danish Emergency Management Agency with an emphasis on their activities during and after World War II to the present. There are also exhibitions of Denmark during World War II 1940-45, and about Aalborg as a garrison city since 1779. In the original command bunker of the seaplane base are exhibitions on the three German airbases in Aalborg during WW II and the camps for German refugees after the end of the war. Funding The museum is a private institution that does not receive government grants for the operation. The museum is almost exclusively run by volunteers, who have served in the Danish armed forces. Defence authorities provided most of the museum's exhibits, especially the heavy equipment such as vehicles and fighter jets, thus the museum contains a large portion of stockpiled equipment during the Cold War. The museum is open daily from 1 April to 31 October. Because the hangar is unheated, the museum is open only by special arrangement from 1 November to 1 April. However the museum is open in week 7 and 8 (Danish winter vacation period. The museum had more than 18,500 visitors in 2012.

Mary was a Christian Scientist and a philanthropist, perhaps best known for her involvement in the publication of the first braille version of the KJV Bible. The couple had seven children together: Judith F. Longyear, Robert D. Longyear, Howard M. Longyear, Abby B. Roberts, Helen M. Paul, John B. Longyear, and John M. Longyear, Jr.\\"United States Census, 1900,\\" database with images, FamilySearch(https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MS9C-CNT : accessed 23 February 2018), John M Longyear, Marquette city Ward 3, Marquette, Michigan, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 118, sheet 13B, family 267, NARA microfilm publication T623 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1972.); FHL microfilm 1,240,728. Some sources list the Longyears as having only five children but this discrepancy is likely due to that Howard and John died young, Howard M. Longyear at 20 and John B. Longyear as a toddler. For some years, the family was accompanied by a nurse, a young German woman named Angela Nerling, who both lived and traveled with them. In the early 20th century, Longyear made the decision to move from Michigan, where his family lived in a stone mansion on the shores of Lake Superior, to Massachusetts. His wife Mary was reportedly unsettled by the idea of leaving the family's home and so, Longyear arranged for the home to be dismantled and transported 1,300 miles across the country by railroad to their new hometown and reassembled there in 1903. Longyear lived out the rest of his life in Brookline, Massachusetts.

He did his secondary schooling at the Royal College of Curepipe. Called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1978, Ajay Daby studied in the United Kingdom and is a member of The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, London. He is married to Geeta Prayag, a laureate of the Queen Elizabeth College and doctor from the Sheffield University. Daby started his legal career as a private legal practitioner before joining the State Law Office as State Prosecutor, but only for a very brief period. He soon resigned from his post in the Judiciary to join politics. Elected MP of the PSM in 1982 in Flacq-Bon Acceuil, Constituency No 9 at the age of 26, he became the youngest MP in the country. He was further elected as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Mauritius. In 1983, he was one of the founder members of the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). He was in the same year, re-elected MP of Flacq-Bon Acceuil under the banner of the newly created MSM and went on to become the youngest Speaker of the Commonwealth and Association des Parlementaires de Langue Francaise (AIPLF). He was re-elected in Constituency No 11 (Rose-Belle/Vieux Grand Port) and was called upon to take the post of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly yet again. In 1990, on a question of principle, Daby refused to give the casting vote much needed by the then government to change the status of Mauritius to that of a republic and sever ties with the British Crown. He voiced his dissent with his leader and party on this question. The MSM - MMM newly formed coalition not having the required three-quarters majority to expel Mr Daby from his Speakership, went ahead to amend the Constitution to enable the removal of the Speaker by a simple majority. On 5 December 1990, the Constitution of Mauritius was amended accordingly. Mr Daby then joined the Mauritius Labour Party, but for a brief spell only. In 2001, Mr Daby was made Commissioner for Drug Assets Forfeiture under the Government led by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, and later by Paul Berenger, until 2005, when there was a change of government following general elections. Daby is back at the bar and is regularly seen in high-profile cases.

The ships' complement consisted of 85 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 261 The reciprocating ships had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . They carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. Construction and career When ordered, the ship was intended to be named The Soo, but the name was changed after the city she was named for, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, objected. The ship was renamed Sault Ste. Marie and was laid down on 27 January 1942 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. Ltd in Port Arthur, Ontario. The ship was launched on 5 August 1942 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Port Arthur on 24 June 1943, the first of the Canadian Algerines.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 199 After commissioning the minesweeper sailed up the St. Lawrence River, making her way to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Sault Ste. Marie then proceeded to Bermuda to work up and upon her return, joined the Western Escort Force escort group W-9 for convoy escort duties in the Battle of the Atlantic. The minesweeper took the position of Senior Officer Ship upon joining the group. As Senior Officer Ship, the commander of the escort would be aboard her during convoy missions.Burn, p. 242 Sault Ste. Marie remained a part of escort group W-9 until mid-April 1945 when she transferred to group W-7, retaining the position of Senior Officer Ship with the new group. W-7 was disbanded in June 1945, after which the minesweeper was placed in reserve at Sydney, Nova Scotia. After a short period, Sault Ste. Marie was transferred to the West Coast, arriving at Esquimalt, British Columbia on 12 December 1945. A month later on 12 January 1946, the minesweeper was paid off into the reserve again. On 7 May 1949, the ship was recommissioned as a training ship. She was assigned to until the end of 1954.Gimblett & Hadley, p. 154 In mid-December 1955, she returned to the East Coast, joining the Eleventh Canadian Escort Squadron at Halifax. The minesweeper was used as a training vessel during the summers from 1956 to 1958 on the Great Lakes. On 1 October 1958 Sault Ste. Marie was paid off.

Many hardware components can be seen. Hardware of the Macintosh (or Mac) is produced solely by Apple Inc., who determines internal systems, designs, and prices. Apple directly sub-contracts hardware production to external OEM companies, maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. Apple buys certain components wholesale from third-party manufacturers. The current Mac product family uses Intel x86-64 processors, however it is moving to Apple-designed processors until 2022. All Mac models ship with at least 8 GB RAM as standard. Current Mac computers use AMD Radeon or integrated graphics. Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt. USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today; Thunderbolt is intended for high-performance devices such as external graphics cards.  Processor architecture  The original Macintosh used a Motorola 68000, a 16/32-bit (32-bit internal) CISC processor that ran at 8 MHz. The Macintosh Portable and PowerBook 100 both used a 16 MHz version. The Macintosh II featured a full 32-bit Motorola 68020 processor, but the Mac ROMs at the time contained software that only supported 24-bit memory addressing, therefore using only a fraction of the chip's memory addressing capabilities unless a software patch was applied. Macs with this limitation were referred to as not being “32-bit clean.” The successor Macintosh IIx introduced the Motorola 68030 processor, which added a memory management unit. The 68030 did not have a built-in floating point unit (FPU); thus, '030-based Macintoshes incorporated a separate unit—either the 68881 or 68882. Lower-cost models did without, although they incorporated an FPU socket, should the user decide to add one as an option. The first “32-bit clean” Macintosh that could use 32-bit memory addressing without a software patch was the IIci. In 1991, Apple released the first computers containing the Motorola 68040 processor, which contained the floating point unit in the main processor. Again, lower- cost models did not have FPUs, being based on the cut-down Motorola 68LC040 instead. After 1994 Apple used the PowerPC line of processors, starting with the PowerPC 601, which were later upgraded to the 603 and 603e and 604, 604e, and 604ev. In 1997, Apple introduced its first computer based on the significantly upgraded PowerPC G3 processor; this was followed in 1999 with the PowerPC G4. The last generation of PowerPC processor to be introduced was the 64-bit PowerPC 970FX (\\"G5\\"), introduced in 2003. During the transition to the PowerPC, Apple's “Cognac” team wrote a 68030-to-PowerPC emulator that booted very early in OS loading. Initially the emulation was very slow, but later versions used a dynamic recompilation emulator which boosted performance by caching frequently used sections of translated code. The first version of the OS to ship with the earliest PowerPC systems was estimated to run 95% emulated. Later versions of the operating system increased the percentage of PowerPC native code until OS X brought it to 100% native. The PowerPC 604 processor introduced symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) to the Macintosh platform, with dual PowerPC 604e-equipped Power Macintosh 9500 and 9600 models. The G3 processor was not SMP-capable, but the G4 and G5 were, and Apple introduced many dual-CPU G4 and G5 Power Macs. The top of the range Power Macintosh G5 uses up to two dual core processors, for a total of four cores. On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced that the company would begin transitioning the Macintosh line from PowerPC to Intel microprocessors (the transition was completed on August 7, 2006) and demonstrated a version of Mac OS X running on a computer powered by an Intel Pentium 4 CPU. Intel-powered Macs are able to run Macintosh software compiled for PowerPC processors using a dynamic translation system known as “Rosetta.” From OS 10.7 on, Rosetta is not an option. The first Macs with Intel processors were the iMac and the 15-inch MacBook Pro, both announced at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2006. Throughout the year the Mac mini was transitioned to the Intel architecture, with users having choice of either Core Solo or Core Duo CPUs. The iBook product line was phased out by the MacBook and on August 7, 2006, the Power Mac G5 was discontinued in favor of the Mac Pro, based on the new Intel Xeon \\"Woodcrest\\". The Xserve was also transitioned to an Intel Xeon \\"Woodcrest\\". In the second half of 2006 Apple launched new iMac and MacBook lines using the Core 2 Duo processor. In 2020 Apple announced their transition to Apple Silicon, returning to RISC and enabling compatibility with the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV.  Expandability and connectivity  Apple detractors have always criticized the fact that Macs cannot be upgraded, as can most PCs. While most PC's use an ATX-formfactor logic board, power supply, and case, Apple has eschewed the popular standards as to give their design team maximum flexibility. However, Apple does use Intel processors, as well as industry-standard memory, drives, and peripherals. Historically, Macs were not designed to be taken apart. Ever since the original closed-box Macintosh in 1984, Apple has always preferred that upgrades take place outside the case. While PC users would open up their computer to install a second hard drive, Mac users would simply plug an external hard drive into their computer; this adds slight cost and the external hard drive performs more slowly, but is easier for the average user to perform. Due to the Macs' unique designs, most tasks that involve opening the computer are relegated to Apple-certified technicians; otherwise, the machine's warranty is null and void. However, Apple towers (such as the Mac Pro) permit access to all of the system's internals, allowing users to add or replace common items such as memory, drives, or expansion cards.  Internal slots  The earliest form of internal Macintosh expandability was the Processor Direct Slot (PDS), present from the SE onwards. It was basically a shortcut to the CPU socket, not a bus—which also meant that parts for the PDS slot were tied to a specific Macintosh model, with the notable exception of the LC PDS slot, which was standardized across the entire LC line. The PDS slot could be used for processor upgrades, Ethernet cards, the Apple IIe Card, or video cards. The last line of Macintoshes to have PDS slots was the first generation of the Power Macs. The first Macintosh to feature a bus for expansion was the Macintosh II, in the form of six NuBus (parallel 32-bit bus) slots. The NuBus was abandoned in favor of PCI in the second-generation Power Macs, and the G4 introduced 64-bit PCI slots as well as an AGP slot for video cards. The Power Mac G5 quickly introduced PCI-X slots, which were short-lived, as the final G5's and the Mac Pro use PCI Express for graphics and expansion. In 2013 with the launch of the updated Mac Pro, no mac had any slots. However with the redesign in 2019 this was restored.  Processors  The Mac Pro features upgradeable Intel processors, although Apple does not officially support this. The Power Mac G3, as well as the very first Power Mac G4, had a socketed processor which could be upgraded. From then on, the Power Macs had their processor(s) on a daughtercard. All other Macs, including the Mac mini, most iMacs, and all of Apple's notebooks, have the processor permanently soldered to the logic board. Nevertheless, this did not stop companies such as Daystar and Sonnet from marketing processor upgrades for almost every system.  Memory  For memory, Apple has used standard SIMMs (30 and 72-pin), proprietary 168-pin DIMMs, and later, industry-standard SDRAM and DDR. Speed has gone up as time has gone by. Only the 27-inch iMac and Mac Pro allow the user to upgrade the memory via an access door or removable panel. All MacBooks have soldered-in memory, while the 21.5-inch iMac, Mac Mini, and iMac Pro have upgradable RAM but require a disassembly.  Disks  The earliest Macintoshes used a proprietary serial port (a 19-pin D-subminiature connector) for external floppy or hard drives, until SCSI was introduced with the Macintosh Plus. SCSI remained the Macintosh drive medium of choice until the mid-1990s, when less expensive ATA drives were introduced, first on budget models, then across the whole range. Macs have also used Serial ATA for internal hard drives and optical drives, and FireWire or USB 2.0 for external drives. Today, all notebooks, the Mac Mini, and most iMacs have directly soldered storage. A few iMacs, as well as the iMac Pro and Mac Pro feature upgrades, but the former two require a very extensive disassembly. All Macs had an optical drive until 2008, when they introduced the MacBook Air without one. Hard drives would later be removed from other products, the Mac Mini in 2011, the MacBook Pro and iMac in 2012, and the Mac Pro in 2013. Mac OS X, understands the Mac OS Standard and Mac OS Extended file systems. It is also capable of using disks formatted with Windows's FAT or NTFS file systems, as well as the Unix File System. Currently, Mac OS X Leopard betas have read-only support for ZFS, while paid members of Apple Developer Connection get access to an in-development read-write ZFS driver.  Peripherals  The very first Macs (the Macintosh and the Macintosh 512K) used proprietary connectors for the keyboard and mouse. The Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) was introduced with the Macintosh II and Macintosh SE. It was the standard input connector for keyboards and mice until USB was introduced with the iMac. The last Macintosh to have ADB was the Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White), alongside the now- standard USB. Until February 2005, the PowerBook G4 and iBook G4 notebooks still used the ADB protocol to communicate with their built-in keyboards and trackpads, however they did not include any external ADB connectors. The majority of Mac computers have historically shipped with a single-button mouse. This changed in August 2005, when Apple released the four-button Mighty Mouse (a wireless version was made available on July 25, 2006) and began to ship it with new desktop Macs. As of late 2009, they have begun to also offer a Multi-Touch mouse, Magic Mouse, capable of receiving touch finger gestures. Starting with a new iMac G5 released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras to appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by remote control for accessing media stored on the computer. This was discontinued later on. Other legacy Macintosh peripheral connectors include the RS-432 serial ports, the GeoPort, and the AAUI port for networking. From 2006 to 2019, Apple used the MagSafe connector in at least one notebook. Nowadays they use USB-C to charge.  Networking  Early Macs used the built-in serial ports for LocalTalk, which set up a fast (at the time) network between two machines. Later, a modified AUI port was added named Apple Attachment Unit Interface to provide a more user friendly version of 10BASE2 cabling and adapters, with Apple's version known as FriendlyNet. As this was an implementation of an Ethernet physical layer it was indifferent to the protocols used - and allowed connection of Macintosh machines using LocalTalk, TCP/IP, or other protocols assuming it was supported by programs. Eventually as Ethernet over twisted pair emerged as the dominate method for connecting computers, all Macs adopted the now familiar modular 8 pin modular jack as standard. Fibre Channel adapters are also available for the Mac Pro and the discontinued Xserve, generally for connection to large storage subsystems and/or high bandwidth multimedia applications. Apple introduced 802.11 wireless networking to the Mac in 1999, with AirPort technology built into the iBook. Three years later, it was updated to the 802.11g-compatible AirPort Extreme. With the exception of the desktop Mac Pro (available as user option), all current Macs feature 802.11-capable WiFi cards as standard. Macs with IEEE 1394 support (a.k.a. FireWire) provide TCP/IP connectivity through this interface by default, allowing two machines to easily create a high-speed connection through a single FireWire cable.  Video  For connecting displays, Apple used a DA-15 connector on all models prior to the Blue and White Power Mac G3, which used a VGA connector. The original AGP-based Power Mac G4 used VGA, complemented by a DVI port; almost all later Macs, however, used the Apple Display Connector in addition to a VGA or DVI port, until the last revisions of the Power Mac G5 came standard with two DVI ports. Apple includes DVI-to-VGA adapters with its DVI-equipped computers. With the release of the unibody MacBook Pro, DVI was phased out in favor of DisplayPort. Smaller form-factor laptops, such as the iBooks and 12\\" PowerBook G4 and later generations of the Mac mini did not have enough space available to fit a full-size VGA or DVI connector. As such, these machines use a miniaturised variant, mini-VGA or mini-DVI, intended to be used with an adapter. However, even Mini-DVI was too large for the original MacBook Air. It instead was equipped with a micro-DVI port and came with an adapter. The MacBook Air was the only Mac to ever use this connector, until it too was phased out in favour of DisplayPort. The original DisplayPort connector was never used on Macs, Apple instead opting to create and standardise a miniature version of the connector: mini-DisplayPort. In 2011, Apple introduced the Thunderbolt connector, and is currently their primary video out. PowerPC-based Macs, for the most part, required compatible video cards. The current Intel- based Macs can use any EFI-compatible video card; normal PC video cards will work only if the user boots into Microsoft Windows.

The screenplay by Damiani, Tonino Guerra, and Ugo Liberatore is based on the best- selling novel La Noia by Alberto Moravia. The film stars Horst Buchholz, Catherine Spaak, Isa Miranda and Bette Davis. Synopsis Mediocre artist Dino is obsessed with young model Cecilia and distraught that she shares her sexual favors not only with him, but with actor Luciani as well. In an effort to derail her plan to vacation in Capri with his rival, Dino proposes marriage, and when she rejects his offer, he invites Cecilia to join him at the Rome estate of his domineering mother, a wealthy American, in the hope that he can seduce her with his glamorous lifestyle. Despairing that he will never have a monogamous relationship with her, he crashes his sportscar into a wall. While recovering in the hospital, he realizes his feelings will never be reciprocated. When Cecilia returns from her trip assuming their liaison will continue, Dino announces that the affair is over.

Critical reception In his review in the New York Times, Howard Thompson observed, \\"under Damiano Damiani's studied direction, the incidents move in stilted, crabwise fashion... Miss Davis... is truly a sight, looking like a Pekingese under a blonde bob and growling an atrocious Southern accent... At times, especially under-scored by Miss Davis's withering expression and lava lingo, the picture's overripe sexuality is downright funny.\\" Time magazine said it \\"is one of those \\"international\\" movie projects that appears to have been dreamed up by its principals... in a spirit of reckless unity...

It flows in a general south to north direction, from the area around Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur (in Les Jardins-de-Napierville) to its mouth in the Saint Lawrence River, at the border between the cities of Brossard and La Prairie. Geography The Saint-Jacques River meanders through the agricultural and forested lowlands of the Montérégie region near the Saint Lawrence River. As a result, it flows through and drains areas of sparse and dense population like agricultural towns and suburban cities on the south shore of the Island of Montreal. The main hydrographic slopes near the Saint-Jacques River are: * north side: Prairie Creek; * east side: Acadia River, Lécuyer watercourse; * south side: Saint-André Creek, Acadia River; * west side: St. Lawrence Seaway, St. Lawrence River. The Saint-Jacques River has its source of a set of agricultural streams draining the area south of the municipality of Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur, Quebec and west of the watershed with the slope hydrographic survey of the Acadia River. Course from the head (26.1 km, 16 mile segment) The Saint-Jacques River flows first on to the north, passing west of the village of Saint-Jacques-le-Mineur, Quebec, until the Méchal Creek mouth (coming from the southwest). In this first segment, it passes in the rank Saint-Philippe-Nord and Saint-Marc. Then, the river flows on the northwest to the village of Saint-Philippe-de-Laprairie which it crosses in serpentine fashion. From this village, the river flows northwest ( serpentine to the mouth of Saint-André Creek (coming from the southwest). Then the river runs north on Autoroute 30 (east side) winding on to the northeast in agricultural zones in the rang Saint-Joseph-Nord in the Town of La Prairie, Quebec, to the Autoroute 10. Rivière Saint-Jacques, vu du parc Radisson à Brossard le 27 juin 2018. Course downstream of Autoroute 10 (segment of ) After crossing the Autoroute 10 at east of the A10 junction and the A30, the Saint-Jacques River runs on to the northwest in an agricultural zone until the autoroute 30 which it crosses at north of the junction of the A10 and the A30. Then the river flows northwest ( past the Brossard, Quebec Illinois Park and serpentine to route 134, which is Taschereau Boulevard. This last segment of the river passes east of Parc Émilie-Gamelin in La Prairie, Quebec and collects the waters of Saint-Claude stream (coming from the east) whose main tributaries are the \\"ruisseau des Bois\\" and the \\"Battle Creek\\". In this last segment, the Saint-Jacques River runs westward across a golf course and serving more or less of a boundary between the cities of Brossard, Quebec and La Prairie, Quebec. Meandering course A common characteristic of rivers, such as this one, that flow through sedimentary soil of lowlands is the formation of bends and oxbow lakes along its course. This meandering course is due to the erosion of the soil. One notable oxbow lake along this river is located in the territory of Brossard, forming an island (at )..  Regional Park of the Saint-Jacques River  The creation of the Saint-Jacques Regional Park is sponsored by the Ville-Marie Priority Intervention Area Committee (ZIP). The area between Taschereau Boulevard and Autoroute 30 includes public lands whose transfers to cities are yet to be completed. In the long term, this regional park project aims to encompass the Boisé de Brossard (largely composed of private land) and the \\"Boisé de la Commune\\" in La Prairie (entirely composed of private land). Saint-Jacques seen from North shore in Saint-Jacques park of Brossard as of July, 9th 2018. From the seaway, this river is navigable by canoe and kayak to the east of Autoroute 30. This watercourse, which delimits the towns of Brossard and La Prairie, Quebec, is surrounded by former farmland. Its banks, which are generally bare of trees, include turtles and water birds such as ducks and herons. Hypothetically, this area could be transformed into a regional park encompassing the surrounding woodlands; this park could cover a larger area than the Mont-Saint-Bruno National Park. The river is accessible via Radisson Park where visitors can rent river boats. In December 2014, the City of Brossard acquired for a million dollars a strip of 50-meter (55 yard) wide riparian lands covering 9830 square meters (2½ acres), between Radisson Park and Taschereau Boulevard, with the objective of protecting this waterfront. History Early 17th century The Saint-Jacques River was first described by Samuel de Champlain in his notes on his 1611 voyage along the Saint Lawrence River and in the area around La Place Royale on the Island of Montreal: References  See also  * Roussillon Regional County Municipality * Saint Lawrence river, un cours d'eau * St. Lawrence Seaway * Brossard, a city * La Prairie, a city * List of rivers of Quebec Brossard Rivers of Montérégie La Prairie, Quebec Tributaries of the Saint Lawrence River Les Jardins-de-Napierville Regional County Municipality ","title":"Saint Jacques River (Roussillon)"},{"id":"14408717","text":"Adham Faramawy (ادهم فرماوي) is an artist of Egyptian descent born in Dubai, based in London.

The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. Construction and career St. Boniface was laid down at Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Port Arthur, Ontario on 21 May 1942.

As Senior Officer Ship, the commander of the escort would be aboard her during convoy missions.Burn, p. 242 She remained a part of this group until mid-April 1944, when she transferred as Senior Officer Ship of escort group W-4. St. Boniface continued in this role until December 1944 when she put into Halifax to undergo minor repairs. After working up in Bermuda, she returned to escort group W-4. On 18 April 1945, St. Boniface collided with the merchant vessel in the approaches to Halifax. The minesweeper made Halifax under her own power but had suffered significant damage. The repairs took three months, at which point, W-4 was disbanded in June. In August, the ship was made a training vessel at , remaining at this post until January 1946. St. Boniface was placed in reserve at Halifax and remained there until being paid off on 25 June 1946.

Piloncitos (also known as Bulawan) are tiny engraved gold coins or weights found in the Philippines from the Archaic period (pre-Hispanic era). Trade among the early Filipinos and with traders from neighboring islands was conducted through Barter. The inconvenience of barter later led to the use of some objects as a medium of exchange. Gold, which was plentiful in many parts of the islands, invariably found its way into these objects that included the Piloncitos, small bead-like gold bits considered by the local numismatists as the earliest coin of ancient Filipinos, and gold barter rings. The word is derived from Spanish (same spelling), meaning \\"little weights.\\" Piloncitos is presumably an offshoot of the silver and may have evolved into the bullet or Pod duang coinage of Sukhothai in Thailand.http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos- treasure-of-philippine.html Historical usage An example of Piloncitos with a Baybayin Ma (18px) character. Since ancient times, gold has been one of the main products of the islands. Both ancient and modern goldsmiths exude exquisiteness in their craftsmanship for trade, personal vanity and prestige. Piloncitos are the earliest form of precious metal based currency of Tondo, Namayan and Rajahnate of Butuan in present-day Philippines. It is likely made of pure gold with a weight ranging between 0.5 grams to more or less than 3 grams. Piloncitos are tiny engraved bead-like gold bits unearthed in the Philippines. They are the first recognized coinage in the Philippines circulated between the 9th and 12th centuries. They emerged when increasing trade made barter inconvenient. Descriptions Piloncitos are so small—some are of the size of a corn kernel—and weigh from 0.09 to 2.65 grams of fine gold. Large Piloncitos weighing 2.65 grams approximate the weight of one mass. Piloncitos have been excavated from Mandaluyong, Bataan, the banks of the Pasig River, Batangas, Marinduque, Samar, Leyte and some areas in Mindanao. They have been found in large numbers in Indonesian archeological sites leading to questions of origin. That gold was mined and worked in the Philippines is evidenced by many Spanish accounts, like one in 1586 that stated: Other currencies or coinages used by early Filipinos The Barter rings along with Piloncitos. The early Filipinos traded Piloncitos also along with Gold rings, which is gold ring-like ingots. These barter rings are bigger than doughnuts in size and are made of nearly pure gold. They are also very similar to the first coins invented in the Kingdom of Lydia in present-day Turkey. Barter rings were circulated in the Philippines up to the 16th century. Similarities in neighboring countries Piloncitos is not exclusively found in the Philippines as most collectors and local historians state. Similar type of gold can be found in some regions of Indonesia which they call massa.http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos- treasure-of-philippine.html Origins In an era before coined money was widely used, Indo-Pacific beads were made first at a site called Arikamedu in South India ca. 200 BC. The manufacture then moved in sequence to Ceylon, South Thailand, Java and finally Malaya. By about 1200–1300 AD the larger Majapahit beads, excavated today in the interior of Java, had supplanted it. Since these factory sites have been dated, archaeologists now use the beads to date sites, though whether beads rose to the level of metals, salt, cloth, and cowries as \\"standard\\" trade goods is uncertain.http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of- philippine.html The first indigenous metallic coinage in the region, ca. 750–850 AD, comes from the Javanese kingdom of Sailendra (Chinese: Ho-ling). These roughly dome-shaped silver of irregular weight bore stamps of a flowing vase, and the sandalwood flower (quatefoil). By 850 AD weights had been standardized at 20 rattis to a Massa of about 2.4 grams. Silver and gold coins of Massa and fractional denominations were issued until about 1300 AD, with changes in shape and quality of inscription marking periods of issue. The gold Piloncitos of the Philippines are a late offshoot of the gold coinage, while the bean-like silver \\"namo\\" series, of the Malay isthmus was presumably an offshoot of the silver and may have evolved into the bullet (Pod-Duang) coinage of Sukhothai in Thailand.http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of- philippine.html See also * Early Indonesian coins * Philippine piso * Philippine real * List of historical currencies * History of Philippine money * Pod-duang  References  External links *Central Bank of the Philippines – Money museum * http://coin.filipinonumismatist.com/2011/06/piloncitos-treasure-of- philippine.html Ancient currencies Medieval currencies Modern obsolete currencies Philippines currency history 1852 disestablishments ","title":"Piloncitos"},{"id":"14408774","text":"Invasion of Italy may refer to: * The Lombard invasion of Italy, from 568 * The Allied invasion of Italy, 3–17 September 1943 * The German invasion of Italy, Operation Achse, 8–19 September 1943 ","title":"Invasion of Italy"},{"id":"14408784","text":"Museum of Local History may refer to: United States *Museum of Local History - Fremont, California *Museum of Local History - Milton, Florida ","title":"Museum of Local History"},{"id":"14408824","text":"Alex Kelly may refer to: * Alex Kelly (rapist) (born 1967), American convicted rapist from Connecticut * Alex Kelly (The O.C.), fictional character played by Olivia Wilde in the U.S. television series The O.C. * Alex Kelly (rugby union) (c. 1871–c. 1913), Australian rugby union player * Alex Kelly (filmmaker), filmmaker  See also  * Alexander Kelly (disambiguation) * Alexandra Kelly, UK-based entrepreneur ","title":"Alex Kelly"},{"id":"14408842","text":"HMCS Wallaceburg was an that served in the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War.

The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. Service history Royal Canadian Navy Wallaceburg was ordered on 12 December 1941. The ship was laid down on 6 July 1942 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company Ltd. at Port Arthur, Ontario and launched on 17 December later that year.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 200 The vessel was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 18 November 1943 at Port Arthur. After commissioning Wallaceburg worked up around Halifax. Upon completion of her trials, the vessel was assigned to the Western Escort Force. She initially joined escort group W-8 in February 1944 before joining group W-6, where she became the Senior Officer's Ship. As Senior Officer Ship, the commander of the escort would be aboard her during convoy missions.Burn, p. 242 In December 1944, Wallaceburg was reassigned to escort group W-8 and remained with the group until July 1945. In July and August 1945, the vessel was attached to as a training vessel before being placed in reserve at Sydney, Nova Scotia. The ship was transferred to Halifax and paid off on 7 October 1946. While in reserve, Wallaceburg was maintained as the depot ship for the reserve fleet. On 1 November 1950, Wallaceburg was recommissioned as a cadet training vessel. The vessel returned to reserve, to be reactivated on 4 April 1951. Following reactivation, the minesweeper went on a training cruise to Philadelphia. In December 1951, Wallaceburg and deployed to the Caribbean Sea for a training cruise, making port visits at Bermuda and Nassau. In April 1952, Wallaceburg participated in a naval exercise off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. In June 1953, Wallaceburg and Portage sailed to Bermuda for a training exercise with the American submarine . On 15 April 1955, Wallaceburg, Portage and were assigned to the Eleventh Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Halifax. She spent the summers of 1956 and 1957 on the Great Lakes. The ship was paid off again on 24 September 1957. Belgian Navy Georges Lecointe with unchanged main gun On 31 July 1959, Wallaceburg was sold to Belgium and renamed Georges Lecointe. Upon acquisition, the vessel was redesignated a coastal escort and had the 20 mm anti-aircraft armament replaced with 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in single mounts.Gardiner & Chumbly, p. 26 In 1960 she participated in operations in Congo, as the flagship. In 1966 the vessel had the 4-inch main gun replaced with another 40 mm gun. She remained in service until 1969 when she was discarded,. She was sold in 1970 for breaking up.

Mick rode for the majority of his career in Great Britain and less often Ireland. Career as a Jockey Mick Fitzgerald's career lasted for over 15 years. After experience on the Pony racing circuit in Ireland he began riding out for Richard Lister, a local flat trainer in County Wexford, at the age of 16. This was followed by a move to the Curragh to ride out for John Hayden. Once he had left school at 18, a growth spurt led to an increase in weight forcing a switch to National Hunt racing. Fitzgerald's first National Hunt yards were in South West England with John Jenkins and Richard Tucker. His first two winners came during this association at the end of 1988, the first being a horse called Lover's Secret at Ludlow on 11 December. However it took until 1991/2 National Hunt season for Fitzgerald to obtain regular rides and winners. This was with Jackie Retter before he struck up a partnership with Ray Callow's Duncan Idaho allowing him to showcase his skills. Looking back on the years between 1988 and 1991 he has confessed to almost giving up and moving to Australia. After proving himself with regular rides he was given a retainer to Lambourn trainer Nicky Henderson. This was to become long standing job as the main stable jockey lasting until the end of his career. Fitzgerald's big winners included the Grand National, on Rough Quest in 1996, and the Cheltenham Gold Cup on See More Business in 1999. He was leading jockey at the Cheltenham Festival in 1999 and 2000. This reflected a relationship with Paul Nicholls alongside his retainer who at the time was an up-and-coming trainer. Later in his career, Fitzgerald came back from injury to win the 2005 Hennessy Gold Cup on Trabolgan at Newbury for Nicky Henderson. The winner was special for all as Fitzgerald had returned from injury inspired by the horse, and as the Newbury racecourse is close to Lambourn the race is extra-special for the Lambourn racing community. During 2008 Grand National in which he was riding L'Ami he fell at the second fence sustaining spinal injuries. This was the second injury of this type he sustained in the latter part of his career. On 7 August 2008 due to his injury, aged 38, Mick was forced into retirement as any return came with the threat of paralysation. Fitzgerald had initially planned to retire in Spring 2007 on the offer of a sporting hospitality job, but Nicky Henderson had such a successful season that Fitzgerald found it impossible to hang up his boots. Although his career was cut short he is still one of the most successful jump jockeys of all time riding over 1300 winners. Career post retirement Mick Fitzgerald is now a popular face presenting and analysing both flat and National hunt races. Initially working for At The Races, in 2013 he joined the Channel 4 Racing presenting team to give an insight into the racecraft and training of jockeys. Mick transferred to ITV along with terrestrial television coverage in 2017. Despite being unable to ride since his injury, he is still closely involved in racing. When not presenting he spends time at Nicky Henderson's yard helping to advise about race tactics. Fitzgerald is also involved in the British Racing School coaching young and aspiring jockeys on their technique as well as attitude. Personal life Mick Fitzgerald lives in the Lambourn area of Berkshire. He has three children and lives with his wife. Mick had an earlier marriage, and was at one time brother-in-law to Paul Nicholls by marriage. Fitzgerald is a well known character on the Lambourn racing scene, and is a close friend of Champion Jockey AP McCoy, with the pair playing golf together often. Mick has become a patron to Alder Hey Charity.Alder Hey Charity. \\"Meet our supporters\\", Liverpool 2013. Retrieved on 23 June 2014. Fitzgerald wrote an autobiography when he finished riding, called \\"Better Than Sex: my autobiography\\". The title comes from Mick's famous quote to Des Lynam live on the BBC after winning the 1996 National – \\"After that, Des, even sex is an anticlimax!\\".

It hosts the Eastern Qing Tombs, a site that is the final resting place of some of the Qing emperors and empresses. The 78-square-kilometer site, known more widely as the Eastern Qing Tombs, is the burial place for 5 emperors, 15 empresses and 136 imperial concubines within 15 tombs, including the Shunzhi Emperor (1638–1661), the Kangxi Emperor (1654–1722), the Qianlong Emperor (1711–1799), and Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908).  History   Ming Dynasty  Malanyu is home to the Yongwang Tower [zh], a Ming-era tower.  Qing Dynasty  While on a hunting trip, Emperor Shunzhi of the Qing Dynasty, allegedly awestruck by the area's beauty, declared that he wished to be buried there. His successor, Emperor Kangxi, began the construction of tombs on the site, now known as the Eastern Qing Tombs, in 1663. Emperor Kangxi, along with a team of both Manchu and Han planners, planned out the site, which includes a number of pathways, towers, temples, pavilions, arches, and sculptures. Emperor Kangxi, after his reign, was buried at the site with his concubines.  1928 Robbery  In 1928, the Eastern Qing Tombs were robbed in a large-scale looting orchestrated by local warlord Sun Dianying, and his subordinate, Tan Wenjiang. Despite widespread outrage at the looting, even by top Chinese officials, Sun faced no reprocussions. Administrative divisions Malanyu is divided into 1 neighborhood committee, 25 administrative villages, 30 natural villages [zh].  Demographics  Malanyu is one of the two minority-majority towns in Zunhua, with Han Chinese constituting only 13% of the town's population. While most of the people in Malanyu are ethnically Manchu, there are also significant Mongol and Hui populations.

It is the fore- runner of the 16-bit Sensible Soccer. In the United States the game was released as Keith Van Eron's Pro Soccer.  Gameplay  The game can simulate a full 11-a-side game of football on a grass pitch, or 6-a-side soccer,Microprose Soccer at homepages.tesco.net/~parsonsp based on the American indoor league of the time. A single player can work through a World Cup (or Indoor League) tournament, or take on a series of increasingly tougher computer teams. A two-player friendly can be played head to head. The control method was designed to be as simple as possible, lending itself to fast and flowing football (in the manner of the later Sensible Soccer). A quick tap of the fire button passed forward, a longer hold of the button chipped the ball at height. Pushing backwards and fire did an overhead kick. Pushing forwards and fire took a shot. Most unusual was the \\"banana kick\\", the strength of which could be varied among three settings in the options menu. By pushing diagonally as a shot was taken, the ball would swerve in the air to get round defenders and goalkeeper. Rival game Kick Off would also add this after-touch feature. Most versions featured a simulated \\"action replay\\" after a goal was scored, with the C64 version featuring black & white stripes to resemble a video rewinding. Development Preview pictures of the game appeared in an issue of Zzap!64 magazine, with a plea for a publisher to come forward. The Electronic Pencil Company ported the game to the Amiga and Atari ST. The programmer created a 6502 emulator, transferring the game code and logic to the 16-bit machines. Reception Zzap!64 gave 90% for the game. The game was voted Best 8-bit Simulation of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. In the Spectrum sales charts, it was number two, behind Robocop, which was number one every month for most of the year.

The village sits on the B 785 Fergushill Road and on the junction of the road to Montgreenan and Torranyard on the Lochlibo Road. The OS maps show that it was named 'Montgreenan' up until at least 1938, with the name Benslie given to the wood, the old farmhouse on the 'island' created by the three roads and the term Benslie Square. A Mission hall is marked as being at Benslie square on the 1910 OS map. The postal address may have been the direct cause of the name change, preventing confusion with the nearby Montgreenan estate. Some dwellings were also present at Rosebank or Woodneuk (1858 OS map), situated just before the bridge that crossed the railway at Montgreenan station. A small mine was developed here and only a brick tower and bing remain in 2007. The village had a small Church hall which was used for indoor bowls and other activities. This building was demolished in 1993 and was replaced by a house named Kinnoull, a new family to the village moved into the house in 1994. A tennis court also existed at one time, next to the church hall. A number of new houses have been constructed since 1990; transforming the size and nature of this rural settlement. A Chapel Hill cottage existed at one time,Eglinton Archive. suggesting that the chapel existed on the 'hill', possibly within what is now Benslie Wood. A small mound existed in the wood near Wood Neuk Cottage, but this may have been removed during the building of the new houses. The 1774 Ayr Roads Act names a Corsehill Chapel on the Toll Road from Kilwinning to Dreghorn via Milnburn.McClure, page 53. A statement to the effect that a chapel existed in the middle of the 'feature;' has been made, however details are lacking.Benslie wood chapel There is a Lady Acre on the lands of Corsehill.Robertson (1889), page 30.

The railway was built by the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal company as the Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway. It commenced on the west side of Ardrossan harbour. The long Doura branch waggonway was opened in 1834, and left the main line near Stevenston. It turned east (crossing under the later Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway) and connected various industrial workings on the Eglinton Castle estate on its way to reach the Doura coal pit.Lewin.Whishaw. The Fergus Hill branch left the Doura branch just after the Lugton Water crossing to reach the Fergus Hill coal pit. In 1833 (sic) Sir James Cunningham extended the Doura branch to his extensive coal and fireclay workings at Perceton. Up until the 1850s this line was worked using horse haulage. Each wagon carried about one ton of coal. The Doura branch was private until 1839 when the Ardrossan Railway Company came into being.Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park The re-laying of track with a heavier rail and the gauge conversion from 4 ft 6ins to 4 ft 8½ins was all carried out in a period of one week in spring 1840. The landowners had paid for the extension and the line had its gradients and curves altered to allow for locomotive working. One record gives October 1, 1846Hawksworth, Page 7 for the opening of the Standard Gauge Doura to Perceton section of the line and another July 1, 1848.Lindsay, Page 8 In spring 1840 the line had been regauged to standard gauge and thus it could be connected with the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway; in 1854 both lines merged with the new Glasgow and South Western Railway. 1830s railway track Vignole rail from the 1834 Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway Vignole rail at Millburn 'station.' A section of the light weight 1831 waggonway track survived at Millburn near Benslie and was recovered in 2009 for restoration and study. This Vignole type section track has a large surface of contact with the sleeper and is therefore a flat-bottomed rail rather than double-headed, bull-headed, etc.Ransom, pages 223–224. It is long, typical of early rail lengths and has no holes for fishplates as these were not invented until after 1839; special joint-chairs were used at that time to hold the ends in place. The fishplate, originally without bolt holes, was invented by William Bridges AdamsRansom, page 224. in May 1842 and used from 1849. Several holed sandstone blocks have been found built into the 'Hurry' at and it is likely that the wrought iron rails were spiked to these large stone sleepers. Granite railway sleepers shipped in via Ardrossan from Ailsa Craig are also said to have been used. The rail height is somewhat less than a typical modern rail as it was not designed to carry the weight of a locomotive.Essery, page 9. The rail dimensions are high; wide at the bottom (the foot); wide at the top (the head). The central web is therefore much shorter than conventional rails. When the Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway was converted to standard gauge circa 1840, heavier rails were used, the lighter version probably being the type recovered from Millburn.McConnell, David. The Ardrossan and Kilwinning Railway. South Millburn Cottage Opposite the old South Millburn farm is a ruined cottage with unusual architectural features. The gable ends both held rectangular windows with an unusually elongated vertical axis, not set centrally, but offset towards the back of the building which itself faces South Millburn. These slit windows would have given a clear view to anyone within the building of any activity to the sides of the building. The side facing South Millburn had one similar windows to the gable inserts as shown by a surviving lintel. The side facing the Eglinton estate had two doors and one splayed and one lit window with finely worked recycled stone that may have come from Kilwinning Abbey. Both gable ends of the building had fireplaces and a door in each. The building was built to serve the South Millburn pit as it was first known as South Millburn Pit House. After the pit closed it was used as a cottage or cottages in the late 19th and through the mid-20th century and was later converted for use as a pig sty before being used in some way when the site was used as a parking and maintenance area for coaches.Janet McGill (2008) of Auchenwinsey Farm. Oral information.Robert McGill (2008) of Auchenwinsey Farm. Oral information. Early horse drawn railway and coach. The old Ordnance Survey maps indicate that this building sat just behind and parallel to the horse drawn waggonway trackbed, opened in 1831 to Byres at Kilwinning and ran up to Doura by 1834, ending at the coal pits. Later the building had the Perceton / Sourlie freight Branch of the Glasgow and South Western Railway located in front of it. A door was set into the gables ends. The fireplaces were set in the gable ends, despite the odd position of the windows. This building stood close by to a railway crossing keeper's hut at the level crossing that controlled rail traffic crossing the Eglinton Castle estate's Millburn Drive and the nearby road. Millburn drive was also part of the old 1774 road from Kilwinning to Irvine, running across the Red Burn at the Drukken Steps and passed in front of the Draughtburn Gates and lodges.Strawhorn. The method of construction and architecture of the 'build' shows that it was constructed under the influence the Earl of Eglinton, possibly using re-cycled stone (See gallery); as were many of the Eglinton estate structures, the stone coming from the old Kilwinning Abbey ruins and possibly other sources. Well made recycled stone is mixed with poorly worked stone or rubble and bricks were used in the chimney flues. In 2013 Kilwinning Heritage carried out an industrial archaeology rescue investigation at the cottage, assisted by Rathmell Archaeology, resulting in excavations, measurements and local history research to record and clarify issues relating to the building's construction, uses and occupancy. The Robson family were the last occupants and the main building ended its life as a pigsty.Oral communication. Mrs. Janet McGill, Auchenwinsey Farm, 2009.

In 1913 the village was said to be 67 years old.Benslie Miner's Rows The population was 318 in 1881. At first the houses only existed at the 'Square' and then later the village was extended towards the road which runs up passed the church. A number of coal pits were in the area as shown by the first edition OS map, one pit being close to the 'Millburn Cottage' opposite South Millburn. In 1937 most of the miner's rows were demolished and the miners were moved to the Dirrans.Ness, page 15. The Hurry and coup The old coup used by the Benslie miner's rows. The coup for the 'old' miner's rows or village was just to the right of the entrance to Millburn Drive and was excavated circa 2006 by enthusiasts who retrieved many bottles and other items from the 'heyday' of the miner's rows.McGill, Robert, North Millburn Farm. Oral communication. 2007. The original waggonway ran along one side of this coup and part of a stone fronted 'dock' or loading platform wall still stands, partly built with old stone railway sleepers. Much of the 'dock' stones has been robbed and it may have had walling on two sides originally with a lane on the western side running down to a siding on the standard gauge track. The structure may be related to the construction and resource requirements of the Eglinton Tournament of 1839 as it lies close to the tournament site and lay on the railway that ran from Ardrossan Harbour. The name 'coup' may derive from the well known waggon of that name that was designed to tip its load. A good example is preserved at the National Museum of Rural Life. Doura coal pits Dr. Duguid states in the late 18th century that the Doura pits had not been worked since the time of Mary Queen of Scots (1542–1587), when they had supplied coal to the Palace of Holyrood and Edinburgh Castle.Service, page 117. This is not as unlikely as it seems because the mining methods of the time had exhausted the available coal stocks and that their existed an \\"exhorbitant dearth and scantness of fewale within the Realme.\\"Hall, Page 29 He was the doctor for the pit and recalls that when the pit was drained, William Ralston, the ganger, found the old workmen's tools and their bones at the coal face. In Duguid's time another disaster took place after heavy frosts had loosened the pit soil and the pit supports gave way. Pate Brogildy from the Redboiler survived, however he later had his arm ripped off at the shoulder blade by the flywheel of the pit steam engine. He survived as the twisting motion of the 'amputation' had sealed the arteries. Willie Forgisal (Fergushill?) of Torranyard had his leg amputated above the knee. James Jamphrey from Corsehill was killed instantly.Service, pages 138–139. The Statistical Account records that the coals at Doura were ell and stone-coals. Easter Doura mine employed 12 - 16 colliers and was owned by Lord Lisle and was leased by him for £140 per annum in the 18th century.  Benslie wood and the Baroque deer park or garden  This 'Baroque' or 'Celtic Cross' feature is what is now known as Benslie Wood, part of the extensive Eglinton Castle historic landscape, located outside of the formal 'Pleasure Gardens' on Benslie farm.General Roy's Military Survey of Scotland 1747 - 52. Much of this landscape feature's outline survives except on the Benslie village side of the present wood, with the present road cutting through the extreme edge of the feature. The 'outline' is formed from linear earth banks which contain a quantity of stone and shows signs of being originally planted up with beech and sycamore trees as evidenced from the remains of old tree stumps or surviving old tree specimens. With no evidence of a boundary wall, it is possible that a pale existed to make the enclosure stockproof. The linear bank is mostly curved, except for short sections where 'right angle' bends were required to form the desired 'baroque' shape. It may have had a pale or fence on top of it to make it stockproof, in addition to the boundary ditch. {style=\\"float:left; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:27em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 10px; background-color: #F5F5F5; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Etymology - style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:x-medium;\\" The meaning of Benslie is most likely to be the shelter or grassland / lea (Lee) on the hill (Ben).Warrack, Alexander (1982) Chambers Scots Dictionary. Pub. W. & R. Chambers. Edinburgh. } Skill would have been necessary to accurately lay out this complex shape. A cross-shape and peripheral 'path' network appears to have been created of which no definite sign remains. The extensive earth movements associated with the 'rig and furrow' works appear to pre-date the feature, the same works being visible in the surrounding fields as well. The position of the older holly trees is suggestive of their being in lines as if they are the remains of an internal 'hedge' planting. These old holly trees were a feature of the wood as far back as the 1930s. Oliver Rackham has shown that holly trees can live for three to four hundred years and therefore the old hollies could date from 1747. A few show clear signs of long predating the birch trees, their present stunted growth only occurring once the birch trees were mature and cast significant shade.Rackham, page 27. Holly is fairly resistant to cattle and deer, indeed it was deliberately planted because its foliage was cut as iron rations for deer and other stock in winter.Rackham, page 158. The 1747 Roy's map is a 'snapshot' in time and does not necessarily represent the completed feature. It does not appear as an extension of the extensive Eglinton 'pleasure gardens', however it does appear to align with the large rond-point still known as 'The Circle'. As a feature it is unlikely that the entire 'baroque' shape could be seen from any nearby location, but it may have been discernible from the upper areas of the castle. The original feature appears to have had open launds, delineated by sycamore and beech planting on the outer boundary and possibly the aforementioned holly planting in the interior. In 1775 Andrew Armstrong's, A new map of Ayrshire... shows a circular woodland on the borders of the Doura estate, open apart from what appears to be a single tree in its centre. The appearance of the landscape feature in 1747 Benslie Fauld farm. The name 'fauld' may hold a clue to the purpose or use of this landscape feature as this is Scots for an area manured by sheep, cattle or possibly deer.Warrack, Alexander Edit. Chambers Scots Dictionary. Pub. W. & R. Chambers, Edinburgh. At this time the main estate 'pleasure gardens' did not include a deer park. The present wood is largely composed of silver birch trees which have grown naturally. The wood was felled in the 1940s by a foundry owner in Kilwinning and the ground was regularly burned until about forty years ago to keep it clear of brambles, trees, etc. Downy birch, oak, sycamore and willow are also present. An unusually predominant presence of holly trees, especially old holly trees, has already been remarked upon and may reflect a feature of the planting of the original 'Baroque' feature. The 'Baroque' or 'Celtic cross' layout is said to be similar to that which existed at the Optagon Park, Alloa Estate, Clackmannanshire; which in turn was modelled after the Dutch taste and based upon Hampton Court, the favourite home of King William; a Dutchman.Swan, Adam (1987). Clackmannan and the Ochils. Pub. Scottish Academic press. . It is possible that this area was incomplete when mapped by Roy in the 1750s. Mr. Robert McGill of North Millburn Farm recalls that local lore has it that after a 'plague' in the 19th century a large number of people from the local miner's rows were buried in a mass grave in Benslie Wood. Another local tradition is that the bodies were buried in the nether fields of South Millburn, close to the old Doura coal pit. The wood was created on the lands of the old Benslie farm, however a small wood existed before and a remnant of this wood survived until recently in the area now occupied by Benslie House and Kinnouli. John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832, shows Benslie Wood, bisected by a road, but without the characteristic shape. Benslie Fauld farm A tale is told of a visit by a local character, Daft Wull Speir, to Benslie Fauld. Wullie was given a bowl of brose by the farmer's wife and whilst saying grace he decided that the servant girl was being less than generous with the milk, so he said between his clasped fingers, Ay, noo, Jean, juist pour't a' on your wa's!Service (1913), Page 34 Views of the 'Baroque Deer park' at Benslie Wood Image:Benslie Wood.JPGBenslie wood on the site of the old Baroque feature.

The Benslie wood mound A Moot hill usually existed within each barony in feudal times, such as the surviving 'Court Hill' near Beith and the now destroyed example at Greenhills near Barmill in the Barony of Giffen. Fergushill was a barony, as was Montgreenan. It is not known where the moot hills were for these. A fair sized mound is shown on several OS maps as existing within Benslie Wood close behind Wood Neuk cottage and therefore to the rear of the modern houses facing onto the road to Montgreenan. The purpose of this mound is unknown, however it would have been a prominent feature if the hill was not afforested and it could have served as the moot hill for the barony or it may be a plausible candidate for the site of the old chapel. An irregularly shaped raised area of ground runs down from near Benslie Fauld farm into the garden of Wood Neuk.  Fergushill church  Fergushill church in Benslie was built to serve the local rural and mining communities of Doura, Fergushill, and Montgreenan.Fergushill Church It was consecrated on Sunday, 3 November 1879 and the first minister was then Rev. William McAlpine.Ker, page 153. It got its name from the Fergushill Mission which was based at Fergushill school which had closed in 1950. The old school master's house (See photograph) is still in existence at the junction of the road to Seven Acres Mill.Ker, page 151. The church had its spire blown down in a gale in 1968, also damaging the roof; the building was repaired in 1969.Ness, James A. The Church of Scotland Presbytery of Ardrossan decided to close the church in June 2009; over a hundred people attended the final Sunday service.Kilwinning Adveertiser, Irvine Times, June 2009 The manse, later named 'Janburrow' is now a private house and stands at the entrance to the old Montgreenan railway station drive. Janbarrow first belonged to Mr. James Watson, a local joiner and was purchased by the G&SWR; for its agent at Montgreenan station in 1884 at the cost of £255. The house was purchased from the railway by Mr. Currie of Hurlford and later purchased by the church in 1906 when an extra bay was added.Hawksworth, page 14. Opposite is Burnbrae cottage, built as the Montgreenan Estate factor's house in 1846. 'Janburrow' is derived from the lady named Janet who came from Burrowland farm and lived in the old manse for many years after a Mrs Reid, the previous owner, had died.

Doura Hall  Aitken's 1823 map showing the position of Doura, Benslie, etc. Doura Hall was a 17th-century building located on the road up to Doura Mains farm. It had been the intention of the Lairds of Corsehill to build a new house at the 'Dowrie' in the Barony of Dowra, however nothing was done, but plans of the proposed buildings have survived.Davis, pages 206 & 207. It was lived in by Sir Walter Montgomerie- Cunninghame in the 1780s after he lost Lainshaw House. James Boswell described it as a poor building. It was demolished in the 19th century and appeared on the 1910 to the mile OS map. A Dovecote hill and orchard brae are further reminders of this estate, owned by the Cunninghames of Corsehill. South Millburn is marked as East Doura on the 1910 OS map. A smithy was located at the Doura hamlet in the late 18th century. In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that the hall had six hearths and was occupied by Lady Corshill. The barony had sixteen other dwellings.Urquhart, Page 92 In 1775 Andrew Armstrong's, A new map of Ayrshire... shows the 'Dowrey' mansion house and wooded policies of Doura. John Ainslie's 1821 Map of the Southern Part of Scotland uses the name 'Dourey'.  Micro history, traditions and wildlife  Plagues were an occurrence in the 18th and 19th-centuries with outbreaks of small pox in 1791, cholera in 1832 and scarlet fever in 1837. Sentinels were placed at points on the roads to stop anyone entering or leaving the effected areas.James Ness papers. Lichens on ash tree bark. The name 'Benslie' exists as a surname. It is not known if any connection exists with the village. The British Telecom 2006/7 'Phone Book' has Benslie with the spelling 'Bensley' and even Bensley Cottage (Sic) is recorded as being in Montgreenan. Houses existed at the end of Millburn Drive and mid-way along. On the left when facing Millburn Lodge; where it joins Fergushill Road, was the railway hut used by the railway employee who controlled the level crossing gates which permitted freight trains to cross the drive.

The BRT replaces the previously planned commuter rail service, the Lynx Red Line, that was routed along the existing Norfolk Southern O Line right-of-way. However, several issues had arisen that included ineligibility for federal funding and Norfolk Southern refusal to allow access to its right-of-way. In 2019, after a reevaluation of the entire corridor, the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) decided to move forward with BRT and shelve the commuter rail; which had been met with frustration by various city leaders and residents impacted by it. Since February 3, 2020, MetroRAPID, a rebranding and overhauling of four existing express bus routes, has been setup to utilize the I-77 express lanes, which were completed in 2019. History Commuter Rail The Red Line was a planned ten station commuter rail that was to connect between Mount Mourne in southern Iredell County and the proposed Gateway Station in Uptown Charlotte. It would primarily serve the towns of Huntersville, Cornelius and Davidson in northern Mecklenburg County. It would be routed along the existing Norfolk Southern O Line right-of-way, roughly paralleling North Graham Street and North Carolina Highway 115, as it extends through north Mecklenburg County. It is estimated to be in length. Originally, it was thought to cost $261 million to complete the first phase by 2012 and an additional $112 million to complete phase two by 2019; the line would contain 1,200 parking spaces and 10 stations along the corridor. However, several issues have arisen that have increased the project's price tag, and it currently has no scheduled construction or operations start date. =Design and planning= By 2011, the Lynx Red Line was planned to be built in one phase. Due to less revenue in the transit tax, in January the Metropolitan Transit Commission voted that the Lynx Red Line along with the Blue Line extension were the top two priorities, leaving the streetcar to be funded by the city and postponing further work on the LYNX Silver Line and the Airport corridor until after the Red Line and Blue line projects were completed. The Red Line was projected to be in operation by mid to late 2018. =Feasibility= By June 2011 the project had been 90% designed and an operating agreement was signed with Norfolk Southern Railway, but the project lacked nearly 80% of the needed funds to begin construction. In October 2012, The Charlotte Observer noted that \\"the Red Line...has little chance of federal funding, and CATS may not have enough money to pay for even a portion of construction costs. The NCDOT is working on creative ways to finance the project, but it appears to be years away.\\" On October 17, 2012, the NCDOT, the Red Line Task Force and CATS requested Norfolk Southern to conduct a study of the \\"Red Line\\" concept. As the Red Line would utilize the NS O-Line between Charlotte and Mooresville, the study would determine if and how both freight and passenger services could use the same line while allowing normal freight services to continue. It was estimated at a meeting of the task force on October 24 that the study would be initiated by late January 2013 and completed by early 2014, after which further feasibility studies and projections could be made. However, in early 2013, Norfolk Southern expressed its doubts that the $416 million project would be feasible. On June 25, 2014, following the completion and release of the feasibility study, CATS officials said that the Red Line would be too costly and complicated to build. Several reasons were provided, including: *The continued refusal of Norfolk Southern to share its existing trackage with CATS, necessitating the construction of a new railway line parallel to the NS rails. This would increase the overall project cost by $215 million and cause \\"multiple disruptions to adjacent communities\\", as building a parallel rail line would involve construction costs, right-of-way purchases, and the complete rebuilding of all road intersections along the proposed line. *The project's ineligibility for federal funding due to low ridership projections. *The inability of CATS to fund the Red Line on its own. North Corridor reevaluation Despite the negative assessments of the feasibility study, the Metropolitan Transit Commission, including the Red Line task force, did not take any official steps to disband the project. While the director of the N.C. DOT rail division, Paul Worley, said that he would work with Norfolk Southern officials to begin a study concerning the proposed Gateway Station, he said that the Red Line concept would not be included, as \\"no viable plan\\" for it now existed. Though the mayor of Davidson, John Woods, said the results of the feasibility study were \\"a serious setback,\\" he added that developing transit in the northern portion of Mecklenburg County remained important for the region, and one possible alternative to a commuter rail line could be bus rapid transit. North Corridor reevaluation In July 2018, CATS began a reevaluation of the Red Line and three alternative options to replace it if still not feasible. The process involves a series of public meetings and various surveys to know where the public stands regarding the Red Line and how each of the alternative options rank. CATS recently held a survey to get the public's opinion on the LYNX Red Line. This information will be presented late 2018.http://charlottenc.gov/cats/transit-planning/red- line/Pages/default.aspxhttp://charlottenc.gov/cats/transit- planning/2030-plan/Pages/default.aspx In January 2019, CATS announced that plans for either a commuter or light rail between Uptown and Mooresville was not feasible. In the short term, CATS will run express buses along the I-77 Express lanes. In the next five to ten years, service would be expanded to true bus rapid transit (BRT).

He was a leading authority on international relations theory, and was the founder of neofunctionalism. Haas was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and acted as a consultant to many national and international organizations. Early life Haas was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1924 to a secular Jewish family. He emigrated to the United States in 1938 due to the rise of anti-semitism in Germany. He attended the University of Chicago and then worked in the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Service from 1943-46 where he studied Japanese and Japanese weapons. Following the war he studied at Columbia University, where he received his BS, followed by an MA. It was there, too, that he gained his PhD in public law and government in 1952. Academic career Haas began his academic career in 1951 at UC Berkeley, where he remained until his death. He was director of the UC Berkeley Institute for International Studies from 1969-73. He was Robson Professor of Government in the University of California, Berkeley, political science department. After he retired in June 1999, he continued as a researcher and teacher at Berkeley. He supervised many graduate students who also went on to successful careers. Main interests Haas was mainly interested in international integration. Haas realized that traditional European politics could be dramatically changed by liberalizing movement of goods capital, and persons, but his analysis differed significantly from classical liberalism. He is the founder of neofunctionalism as an approach to the study of integration. Neofunctionalism recognizes the importance of national states but also stresses the roles of regional interest groups and the bureaucracy of regional organizations. Though the member states create the initial conditions, regional interest groups and international bureaucrats push the process forward, and national governments increasingly solve conflicts of interest by conferring more authority on the regional organizations, and citizens increasingly look to the regional organization for solutions to their problems. Private life Haas was married to the late Hildegarde Vogel Haas for 57 years. He had a son, Peter M. Haas, who is a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Works Haas published numerous books, monographs and articles. In 1997, The Uniting of Europe was chosen as one of the 50 most significant books in international relations in the twentieth century by the journal Foreign Affairs.Hyman 2003Ruggie et al. 2005 His works include: *Haas, Ernst B. 1952.

The Silver Line would connect the CPCC Levine Campus in Matthews and the proposed Gateway Station in Uptown Charlotte, and then continue on to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport before terminating in Belmont. The Southeast Corridor is proposed to follow a path primarily along Independence Boulevard, as it extends through southeastern Mecklenburg County. To be built at a cost of over $1 billion, this portion of the line would be 13.5 miles (21.7 km) long and have 13 stations, 8-10 of which would be park-and-ride. Currently, there is no firm construction schedule in place. The West Corridor is proposed to have 10 stations and follow along Wilkinson Boulevard, from Uptown Charlotte west through the Mecklenberg County, entering Gaston County, and terminating in Belmont. History Southeast Corridor The prospect of developing a light rail line between Matthews and Uptown along Independence Boulevard was initially evaluated in 1985. By 1997, the Charlotte City Council voted, at the recommendation of an independent transit panel, for the development of a busway in the median of Independence in lieu of light rail. The decision to develop a busway over light rail was based on overall costs of $126 million for a busway versus $300 million for light-rail. However, by 1999 delays in the construction of the busway resulted in a renewed grassroots effort of rail advocates to have light rail placed along Independence. As a result of this campaign, Representative Robin Hayes, who served as a member of the House Transportation Committee, to design the busway in such a manner as to be adapted for light rail when it can be economically justified. In 2002, the Metropolitan Transit Commission recommended that the Independence corridor see the construction, but that as part of the initial engineering studies, light rail accommodation be considered. By 2006, a study released by the Charlotte Area Transit System indicated that the cost of light rail along the corridor would be roughly double that of a busway and have fewer riders. The estimates stated light rail on Independence would be in length at a cost of $585 million, with a projected ridership of 14,400 in 2030; and stated a busway would be in length at a cost of $315 to $325 million, with a projected ridership of 16,000 in 2030. In September, the MTC voted to delay on determining whether a busway or light rail should be built along the corridor until 2011. By October 2012, the MTC had voted in favor of a busway on interior lanes of the highway. However, in May 2013, a 30-member funding task force suggested a light rail line instead, at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. The 2006 study had estimated the line would be 13.5 miles (21.7 km) and be complete through Idlewild Road by 2022, to Sardis Road North by 2024 and finally to CPCC Levine by 2026. Additionally, the line would contain 3,350 parking spaces and 16 stations along the corridor at a cost of $582 million. In September 2016, after three years of further studies and consultations with area residents, CATS settled on light rail as the most viable option for the Silver Line. At the time, however, CATS lacked any further sources of funding to invest in future projects. John Lewis, the system's CEO, said he would wait for the Blue Line Extension to begin service in August 2017 before resuming discussions on how best to fund the new lines. A possible option could be to have neighboring counties contribute towards project costs. The Silver Line would come within less than a mile of the Union County border at the CPCC Levine Station. Lynx Silver Line will have 13 stations with about 10 having park-and-ride lots. In January 2019, CATS announced that the Silver Line would cross from Independence Boulevard over to 11th Street, run parallel to I-277 to North Graham Street, then turn south to link to the planned Gateway Station and continuation along the West Corridor. West Corridor West Corridor reevaluation The West Corridor was proposed as a streetcar line to serve as an extension for the LYNX network in Charlotte, North Carolina, initially slated for completion by 2034. It would connect Charlotte-Douglas International Airport in west Charlotte with the Charlotte Transportation Center in Uptown Charlotte. It was to follow a primarily east-west path along West Morehead Street and Wilkinson Boulevard, through west Charlotte. The first phase was estimated to be 6.4 miles (10.3 km) with 10 stops. It was to be completed between Uptown and Ashley Road by 2029 at a cost of $163 million. The second phase between Ashley Road and the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport was scheduled for completion by 2034 at a cost of $324 million. In July 2018, CATS began a reevaluation of the West Corridor, which replaces the originally planned streetcar into two possible light rail routes from Belmont and Charlotte Douglas International Airport to Charlotte Center City and continuation along the planned Southeast Corridor to Matthews. The process involves a series of public meetings and various surveys to know where the public stands regarding the West Corridor and how each of the alternative options rank. In January 2019, CATS reaffirmed that the West Corridor would be a continuation of the Lynx Silver Line, from the planned Gateway Station, in Uptown, to Belmont. It was also confirmed that the route would travel along Wilkinson Boulevard, dropping the alternative routing along Alleghany and Tuckaseegee roads. On February 27, 2019, the Metropolitan Transit Commission unanimously approved to merge the West Corridor into the Lynx Silver Line.

Used primarily as a convoy escort, the vessel served in the Battle of the Atlantic. Following the war she placed in reserve before being sold to Belgium and renamed A.F. Dufour. She served with the Belgian Navy until 1966. Design and description The reciprocating group displaced at standard load and at deep load The ships measured long overall with a beam of . They had a draught of . The ships' complement consisted of 85 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 261 The reciprocating ships had two vertical triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . They carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. Service history Royal Canadian Navy Winnipeg was ordered on 12 December 1941. The ship was laid down on 31 January 1942 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company Ltd. at Port Arthur, Ontario and launched 19 September later that year.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 200 She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 July 1943 at Port Arthur with the pennant number J 337. After commissioning, Winnipeg worked up at Pictou before joining the Western Escort Force. The vessel was assigned to the escort group W-7 initially, transferring to W-6 in December 1943. From February to April 1944 the ship acted as the Senior Officer's ship of the escort group. As Senior Officer Ship, the commander of the escort would be aboard her during convoy missions.Burn, p. 242 Winnipeg joined escort group W-5, becoming that group's Senior Officer's ship upon transfer and remained with that group until it was disbanded in June 1945. The ship was placed in reserve at Sydney for a short period before being reactivated and transferred to Esquimalt, British Columbia. There she was paid off into the reserve on 11 January 1946. Belgian Navy As A.F. Dufour After lying in reserve for ten years, Winnipeg was brought back to the east coast in 1956. She was sold to Belgium and entered into service with the Belgian Navy on 7 August 1959 as A.F. Dufour. The ship was reclassified as a coastal escort after entering service. Upon acquisition, the 20 mm anti- aircraft guns were replaced with 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in single mounts.Gardiner & Chumbly, p. 26 In 1960, the ship took part in operations in the Belgian Congo. She remained in service until 1966, when the ship was broken up.

The line is an extension of the Charlotte Area Transit System's Lynx rail system. With two additional phases planned for completion by 2023, the line is ultimately intended to connect the University Park area of west Charlotte with Eastland Community Transit Center in east Charlotte via Uptown Charlotte. It is proposed to follow a primarily east-west path along Beatties Ford Road, Trade Street and Central Avenue, through central Charlotte. In 2006, it was projected to be long with 34 stops and be completed between Rosa Parks Place and Presbyterian Hospital by 2019 at a cost of $211 million. CATS estimated that the completed route would have an average daily ridership of between 14,200 and 16,700 passengers by 2030. The initial , six-stop segment (Phase 1) between then Time Warner Cable Arena (now Spectrum Center) and Presbyterian Hospital opened for service on July 14, 2015. A further segment (Phase 2) from the Charlotte Transportation Center/TWC Arena to French Street, and from Presbyterian Hospital to Hawthorne Lane, is under construction and set to open for service in January 2021. The third and final phase between Hawthorne Lane and Eastland CTC, and from French Street to Rosa Parks CTC, has been planned for completion by 2023 at a cost of $231 million. It was reported in July 2015, however, that the city had no funds to contribute toward the building of the third phase. History Initial plans In June 2006 initial costs for the completion of the Center City Corridor streetcar line were stated at about $250 million. The streetcars would serve as a replacement for both the No. 7 and No. 9 CATS bus routes currently serving Beatties Ford Road and Central Avenue, respectively. With an estimated cost and ridership in place, the Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC) voted on the priority for its construction in November 2006. At its November meeting the MTC voted to prioritize the construction and completion of both the Blue Line Extension to UNC Charlotte and the Red Line commuter rail to Lake Norman over the construction and completion of the Central City streetcar. At this time the MTC also determined that initial engineering studies for the corridor would commence in 2013 with a phased completion by 2023. Although construction was not slated to commence until the mid-2010s, streetcar tracks for the line were installed as part of a streetscape project along the Elizabeth Avenue segment between CPCC and Presbyterian Hospital to be complete by 2009. Although identified as the number three priority by the MTC, by 2008 CATS began to determine means by which to speed up its construction and be operational by 2013. To further expedite the proposed streetcar line, in May 2008, the Charlotte City Council approved $500,000 to study the corridor in terms of an updated cost estimate, economic benefits and the eligibility of the corridor for federal funding. However, in order to complete the line by 2013, CATS has stated that additional capital will be required due to other projects already budgeted and in progress. In the spring of 2010, the Federal Transit Administration awarded the project a $25 million grant. On September 19, 2011, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood formally awarded Charlotte with the grant for a starter streetcar line from Time Warner Cable Arena to Presbyterian Hospital. Construction was started in December 2012, with plans to begin service in 2015. The line was expected to cost $37 million, with the city paying $12 million; however, the city did not state how it will pay for an estimated $1.5 million in operating costs. Construction and opening of Phase 1 In November 2012, the Charlotte city council awarded a $26.3 million contract for construction of the starter segment to a partnership between Balfour Beatty Rail and Blythe Development Company. The groundbreaking for the initial 1.5 mile (2.41 kilometer) segment of the line took place on December 12, 2012 in front of Presbyterian Hospital, with Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Mayor Foxx and other officials in attendance. By May 2014, the initial segment was 45 percent completed. While the line had originally been scheduled to open in March 2015, in January 2015 the opening date was moved to June due to construction errors on the part of the contractor, and was subsequently moved to July 2015. On July 14, 2015, the Phase I section of the Gold Line began service. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation and former mayor of Charlotte, Anthony Foxx, delivered the keynote speech. Foxx had been one of the primary backers of the streetcar project. Phase 2 plans and renaming of line A $119 m. streetcar extension proposed by Mayor Anthony Foxx in early 2012, which would have taken the line to Johnson C. Smith University, was turned down by a majority of the city council; on June 30, Foxx vetoed a revised city budget by the council which would have eliminated the extension. After protracted debate, on May 13, 2013, Ron Carlee, the new Charlotte city manager, said the Center City Corridor would be renamed the CityLynx Gold Line. Carlee said the $126 million extension of the line could be funded without a property tax increase if the city could receive a federal grant for half the estimated cost, possibly through the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts Program. The remaining $63 million could be covered with surplus funds from other city programs. After Carlee's announcement, it appeared likely plans for the extension could finally move forward. On May 15, Bay Area Economics, an independent consultant hired by the city in 2009 to conduct a streetcar economic impact study, reported the proposed second phase could generate 1.1 million square feet of new development for the city by 2035, and nearly $2.4 million in new property taxes. On May 28, the Charlotte city council voted 7-4 to build the Phase 2 extension, setting aside $63 million for the purpose; the line will run from Sunnyside Avenue to French Street. On September 3, it was reported the Gold Line extension had been passed over for a federal TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) grant, intended to cover the remaining $63 million it would cost to build the line. On November 13, the city announced it would apply to the Federal Transit Administration for permission to begin planning the line in detail. If the FTA grants approval in early 2014, the city will apply for a federal Small Starts grant in September 2014, which the FTA will review and hopefully approve in early 2015. On January 27, 2014, the Charlotte city council voted 8-3 to spend up to $12 million on engineering work for the extension. Carlee said the city would have to spend some of the $63 million it had allocated for the extension in May to demonstrate to the FTA that the project was viable. On February 26, the FTA issued its approval for CATS to begin project development for the extension and to apply for the Federal Small Starts grant in September 2014. On September 8, the Charlotte city council voted 7-4 to build the second phase and proceed with applying for the federal grant. As well, the Hawthorne Lane bridge over Independence Boulevard will need to be replaced to handle the weight of streetcars. On June 22, 2015, the Charlotte city council voted 7-4 to approve $7.7 million for further Phase 2 design work. The initial request for construction bids returned two bids in July 2016 that came in over budget, leading CATS to request a second round of bidding the following month. On November 28, 2016, the council awarded a $94 million construction contract to Johnson Bros. Corporation to build the 2.5 miles of trackage in Phase 2, as well as associated road and landscaping work. Construction began in 2017, with completion required by August 31, 2020 under the terms of the federal funding used. Starting on June 3, 2019; CATS replaced streetcar service along the line with a shuttle bus in order to facilitate construction of Phase 2 and make the existing stations taller by a few inches for the new trains to go through. Streetcar service was initially slated to resume in 2020, but was pushed back to 2021 to accommodate the 2020 Republican National Convention. Issues with the construction contractor delayed the opening to January 2021. Rolling stock Gomaco-built car 93 laying over on Trade Street, below the CTC/Arena Lynx light rail station As of July 2015, the line uses three vintage-style replica-Birney streetcars built in 2003–04 by the Gomaco Trolley Company (Nos. 91–93) and transferred from the former Charlotte Trolley system. However, CATS plans to replace those with cars with modern light rail vehicles (similar to those used on the Blue Line) when a planned Phase 2 of the Gold Line opens, projected for 2019. Powered by an overhead catenary system, the streetcars have an operating speed of 16 mph (26 km/h). They are air-conditioned and handicapped accessible. In November 2016, Siemens Mobility was awarded a $40 million contract for six S700 light rail cars and associated parts to service the entire Gold Line route. Fares The CityLynx Gold Line is free for all passengers. Fares will be introduced once Phase 2 is operational. Controversies Criticism The CityLynx Gold Line project has been criticized for its high cost and limited projected benefits for the areas it is intended to serve, though at the present time, the net benefits from future development as a result of the streetcar line are difficult to assess. The line is currently estimated to cost $150 million to build, with an additional $6.2 million a year incurred in operating costs. According to city officials, the cost increase is largely inflation-based. Recent cost-benefit analyses have shown that at a cost of $1.58 per passenger mile (predicted for 2019), it would cost twice as much to operate as either city bus (77 cents/passenger mile, in 2012) or light rail services (68 cents/passenger mile, in 2012), while traveling over a shorter distance. Center City Corridor extension In early 2012, Mayor Anthony Foxx proposed a 2.5-mile (4.02 km), $119 m. extension to the planned Center City Corridor streetcar line, which would have taken the line to Johnson C. Smith University. The proposal was turned down by a majority of the city council; on June 30, Foxx vetoed a revised city budget by the council which would have eliminated the extension. On October 30, further discussion failed to reach any consensus on how best to pay for an extension. Options considered included: charging fares for the streetcar (the city had planned for the streetcar to be free), increasing the special property tax rate charged to property owners inside Interstate 277, soliciting donations from businesses and institutions along the line, such as Johnson & Wales University or using a portion of new property taxes created from development along the line. Other options to raise funds, which would have required approval from the state, included increasing the rental car tax, hotel/motel tax or prepared food and beverage tax, levying a special fee on parking spaces or lobbying for a higher vehicle registration fee. Many city council members stated they did not favor an increase in property taxes as a result of the streetcar extension. In an effort to end the continuing deadlock, on December 10 Foxx proposed two alternative budgets, the smaller of which would eliminate the streetcar extension; however, on December 17 the city council voted to postpone all budget decisions until early 2013. At a meeting in Raleigh on January 31, 2013, Pat McCrory, the newly elected Governor of North Carolina and former mayor of Charlotte, told Charlotte's city attorney and its deputy city manager that state funding for the Blue Line Extension could be at risk if Charlotte persisted with plans to build an extension to the streetcar line. On April 10, 2013, the decision was made to at least temporarily drop the streetcar extension from the budget; however, Carlee said he hoped to have a separate streetcar plan ready to vote on by June 2013. On May 13, Carlee said the $126 million extension, renamed the CityLynx Gold Line, could be funded without a property tax increase if the city could receive a federal grant for half the estimated cost, possibly through the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts Program. The remaining $63 million could be covered with surplus funds from other city programs. After Carlee's announcement, it appeared likely plans for the extension could finally move forward. City council members voted to send the proposal to the Metropolitan Transit Commission on May 22, and with their approval, take a vote on May 28. On May 28, the Charlotte city council voted 7-4 to build the streetcar extension, setting aside $63 million for the purpose.

She worked in Chungju, Korea.Reports of the Boards, by Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. General Assembly, pg. 158 (Online at: https://books.google.com/books?id=1MIQAAAAIAAJ) --Is this the same, just a newer name as Syen Chun, where Wallis says that in 1920 she finally could settle? During the first winter she got severe sinusitis, in the spring of 1919 the terror and violence of the Samil Movement had a toll on her nerves. Edgerton received a lot of encouragement from fellow workers, especially Gerda Bergman, and kept on going. In 1920 she was assigned to her permanent station. By the end of 1922, however, she had to return to America for treatment of a worsening sinus problem. Health would never permit her to return to Korea. Navajo New Testament After she arrived back in the United States she spent some time with her father, who was dying. Her father died in December 1923. The Presbyterian board in early 1924 assigned Edgerton to work at a school in Ganado, Arizona, on a Navajo reservation. It was believed that the climate would help her sinus problem, because of her frail health she also wasn't permitted to go far from medical aid, and so Korea wasn't an option. At the school she noticed that kids weren't allowed to speak Navajo, except for a short time after supper. She learned Navajo however, and increasingly became aware that the Navajo people needed the Bible in their own language. After taking a course at the Summer Institute of Linguistics, she became convinced she could do the work and that God wanted her to. In 1944 she decided to leave the Presbyterian mission and joined Wycliffe Bible Translators. She and Geronimo Martin revised older translations of Luke, Romans, First Corinthians, Revelation, and Mark and completed the New Testament. It was published in 1956 by the American Bible Society. It is the largest piece of Navajo literature, and became an instant bestseller among the tribe. This work also resulted in a revival of the Navajo language, that many had previously sought to extinguish.Wallis, p. 116-121. Apache New Testament After translating the Navajo New Testament, Edgerton learned Apache, and together with Faith Hill translated the New Testament into the Apache language. The Apache New Testament was presented to President Johnson in 1966.Bible Translation Day Manuscripts and translation notes are held at Northern Arizona University.NAU manuscript collection #157 She also helped some with the Hopi and the Inupiat/Eskimo New Testaments.

Life Early life János Donát was born as Johann Daniel Donat in Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Prussia on December 22, 1744. He did his elementary and secondary studies in Prague, Bohemia. Then he went to Marienstern Abbey (today in Mühlberg, Germany) where he learnt to draw.[Michael Kunits (1824)] Life in Vienna (1766-1795) In 1766 at the age of 22 he applied to study at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna where his masters were Johann Christian Brand, Joseph Kreutzinger, Martin van Meytens, Caspar Franz Sambach, Josef Fischer and Franz Edmund Weirotter and he received a qualification for historical painting of portraits and landscapes. He was at that time already so talented that Weirotter exhibited two of his pictures in the Redouten Saale in the royal palace, the Hofburg. After finishing his studies he settled in Vienna. As a young painter he became surprisingly successful. His earliest works were three paintings for the Austrian Mint, several life-sized portraits of the royal pair and aristocrats and also some paintings with religious thematic. Unfortunately the most are unknown, but one of them, a life-size portrait of Joseph II from 1781 can be currently found in the collection of the Louvre Museum.[Zsuzsanna Bakó - Donát János festő munkássága] His oldest known painting is from 1774 of an unknown nobleman and it is today in Ptuj Castle (Ptuj, Slovenia). The positioning of the model, a slightly pivoting strain and the light-shadow play on the face are all following the traditions of the Baroque portrait painting. Four years later, in 1778, was the portrait of Maria Theresa in mourning dress completed. It shows the empress, unlike the representative Baroque royal portraits, in natural environment without emperor symbols. She sits with a classicist vase and a little Putto-sculpture in her decorated garden on a stone bank heading to the viewers. A typical work of the Enlightenment, free from the Baroque motions and emotions. Reserved residence characterizes her. It is a typical topic in the era after the death of her husband, Francis I. In 1779 the city of Teschen (today Český Těšín, Czech Republic and Cieszyn, Poland) asked him to depict the seven ambassadors of the peace conference closing the Silesian Wars. These paintings are in the Muzeum Śląska Cieszyńskiego in Cieszyn. His next important works were the portrait of Putnik Karloviczi Greek metropolitan from 1782, the portrait of the young Moritz, Prince of Dietrichstein from 1788. Pest After moving to Pest in 1810 he painted some of his most noted classicist portraits such as Ferenc Kazinczy in 1812 and Benedek Virág in 1815.DONÁT, János He was also noted for his compositions such as Resting Venus, Orfeus and Euridike, and Proserpina which were paintings of mythological creatures painted after English copper engravings. He died in Pest in 1830. Personal life János Donát and Ferenc Kazinczy were friends. Kazinczy asked him to copy Joseph Kreutzinger's portrait of him. The work was finished in 1812. Ferenc Kazinczy was a good friend of Donát's. They corresponded in Hungarian.[Letters of Kazinczy to Donát nos. 3232, 3283, 3325.] Donát's first wife was Theresia Rössler (1745–1802). In 1809 Donát married Susanna Rieger (30 August 1784 – 27 September 1849), a mulatto 40 years younger than him. Kazinczy called her Marie in his letters to Donát. According to Kazinczy, she was the illegitimate daughter of Carl, the prince of Lichtenstein.[Letters of Kazinczy no. 2355.] Literature * Zsuzsanna Bakó - Donát János festő munkássága References External links *Hungarian art Hungarian painters 1744 births 1830 deaths German painters People from Oder-Spree ","title":"János Donát"},{"id":"14409132","text":"Charles Jogi Shindo is a Professor of United States history at Louisiana State University.

The zosterophylls were among the first vascular plants in the fossil record, and share an ancestor with the living lycophytes. The group has been divided up in various ways. In their major cladistic study of early land plants, Kenrick and Crane placed most of the zosterophylls in the Sawdoniales (which they treated as a plesion). Like other zosterophylls, members of the Sawdoniales bore lateral, reniform sporangia. They branched dichotomously, and grew at the ends by unrolling (circinate vernation). Some had smooth stems, others were covered in small spines; fungal bodies have been reported in some spines. Taxonomy In 1997, Kenrick and Crane placed most of the zosterophylls in the plesion Sawdoniales, characterizing the group as having \\"marked bilateral symmetry\\". Their summary cladogram did not resolve the taxa within the Sawdoniales, other than placing Zosterophyllum divaricatum within the zosterophylls but outside the Sawdoniales. Hao and Xue in 2013 criticized their approach, and placed many of the members of Kenrick and Crane's Sawdoniales in the order Gosslingiales, characterized among other features by the absence of terminal sporangia (i.e. with only lateral sporangia), and hence indeterminate growth. Families In Kenrick and Crane's treatment, the Sawdoniales are divided into four families: * †Gosslingiaceae * †Sawdoniaceae * †Barinophytaceae * †Hsuaceae Hao and Xue place the first two families in their Gosslingiales, but exclude both the Barinophytaceae and the Hsuaceae from the zosterophylls.

Wateree was sent to the western Pacific Ocean to perform towing services; however, during a typhoon, she was damaged beyond repair and lost, with eight crew members missing. Built in California The second ship so named by the U.S. Navy, Wateree (ATF-117) was laid down on 22 September 1943 at Alameda, California, by the United Engineering Company as an ocean tug, AT-117; redesignated a fleet ocean tug, ATF-117, on 15 May 1944; launched on 14 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry B. Wagner; and commissioned on 17 February 1945 at San Francisco, California, Lt. Gilbert E. Perry in command. Pacific Ocean operations After fitting out at San Francisco, Wateree got underway for San Pedro, California, on 4 March. She reported for duty at the Small Craft Training Center on 6 March and, for the next 25 days, trained strenuously. During the first week in April, she conducted more training, this time out of San Diego, California. From 6 to 13 April, the tug underwent repairs at the San Diego repair base. She arrived back at San Francisco on 15 April and, on the 23d, got underway towing three pontoon barges to the forward areas. The ship arrived in Pearl Harbor on 10 May and conducted voyage repairs. On the 22d, she put to sea to rescue a disabled freighter; found the ship on the 24th; took her in tow; and arrived back in Pearl Harbor on the 26th. On 30 May, she stood out of the port once again towing the three pontoon barges. After a month's voyage, which included a five-day stop at Eniwetok between 18 and 23 June and a brief pause at Guam on the 30th, Wateree delivered the barges to Okinawa on 12 July. Two days later, she headed back to Eniwetok, where she arrived on 25 July. She remained there until 15 August, first undergoing some repairs and then providing harbor tug services in the anchorage. End-of-war operations The tug's departure coincided with the Surrender of Japan ending hostilities in the Pacific. She steamed to Kwajalein where she took ARD-29 in tow, bound via Guam for Okinawa. She and her charge departed Kwajalein on 24 August, stopped at Guam from 2 to 15 September, and arrived at Okinawa on 23 September. Six days later, she assisted several tugs with tows in trouble between the Philippines and Okinawa. On 1 October, she encountered Cinnabar (IX-162) adrift with ATR-29 standing by. Wateree took both ships in tow and arrived back in Buckner Bay on 4 October. Trapped by a typhoon When it was ascertained that a typhoon would soon strike the anchorage at Buckner Bay, the tug received orders on 7 October to stand by to render assistance to any ships which got into trouble during the storm. Wateree herself, however, fell victim to typhoon \\"Louise\\" when it hit the anchorage on 9 October. At about 12:20, her starboard anchor was carried away by one of the many ships and barges cast about by the storm. In order to ease the strain on her remaining port anchor chain, she started her engines. Soon, however, she had to weigh anchor in an effort to avoid all the vessels adrift in the anchorage. The wind blew her afoul the anchor buoy for APL-28, and she was drawn in toward that ship. She and APL-28 collided, but the damage was repaired quickly, and she untangled herself from the anchor buoy. Between 15:15 and 15:58, she cleared the APL and attempted to drop her port anchor again. The anchor machinery failed; and, at 15:28, the wind blew her onto a reef and battered out her starboard side before she could be brought clear. At about 15:55, the order to abandon ship went out; and, by 16:10, all crewmen had gone over the side. Soon thereafter, Wateree sank in about 8 fathoms of water. The ship's commanding officer, her executive officer, and six enlisted men were lost. Waterees name was struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1945.

Early life Bennett was born in Griffin, Georgia on April 1, 1917. He was the only child of William Tapley Bennett Sr. (1891–1982) and Annie Mem (née Little) Bennett (1894–1965). His maternal grandparents were Peyton Brantley \\"Mem\\" Little and Julia Elizabeth (née Neal) Little. Bennett attended the University of Georgia where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. After doing graduate work at the University of Freiburg in Germany from 1937 to 1938, he returned to the United States and earned a law degree from George Washington University Law School. Career After graduation from law school, Bennett joined the Foreign Service in 1941. He served as a United States Army intelligence officer during World War II. From 1951 to 1954, Bennett was Deputy Director to the Office of South American Affairs. From 1954 to 1955, he studied at the National War College and for two years after, he served as Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. From 1957 to 1964, he acted as Counselor and Minister at the U.S. Embassies in Rome, Italy, in Vienna, Austria, and in Athens, Greece. President Lyndon Johnson appointed him Ambassador to the Dominican Republic after the previous Ambassador, John Bartlow Martin, resigned after the Kennedy assassination on the very day in which Juan Bosch, then President of the Dominican Republic, was toppled in a coup d'etat. While Ambassador, Bennett \\"advised President Johnson and members of Congress that the revolt was led by Communists\\" and recommended President Johnson intervene with United States troops during the Dominican Civil War. Bennett was heavily criticized for his report and recommendation. Reportedly \\"seeking relief from the tropical heat of the Dominican Republic,\\" Johnson appointed him the Ambassador to Portugal in 1966. He served in that role until Richard Nixon became president in 1969 and he was succeeded by Ridgway B. Knight, who up until that point was the Ambassador to Belgium. Beginning in 1972, he began to serve concurrently as Ambassador to the United Nations Security Council and Deputy United States Representative to the United Nations.

Later career After retiring in 1985 he served as adjunct professor of international law at the University of Georgia. From 1991 to 1992, he served as President of the Atlantic Treaty Association. Personal life On June 23, 1945, Bennett was married to Margaret Rutherfurd White in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Margaret, a Foxcroft School graduate who attended Barnard College and the Institute of Musical Art of the Juilliard School of Music, was the daughter of John Campbell White (the U.S. Ambassador to Peru and Haiti), a granddaughter of Henry White (the U.S. Ambassador to France and Italy), and a niece of Jay Pierrepont Moffat, the U.S. Ambassador to Canada.

The Waterloo Road runs through the community providing a picturesque alternative to Route 210 when travelling between Newcombville and Greenfield.  History   First Peoples and the newcomers  The Michael Wile Road is the new name for the former Veinot Road and reflects the original colonists Michael and Lucy Wile. St. Clair Veinot and his wife Sadie Wile Veinot owned and lived in the Michael Wile home place after Michael and Lucy passed on. The gravesite of George \\"Michael\\" Wile, one of Susannah Fiendel Wile's eight boys; husband to Lucy Salome Hirtle Wile. The gravesite of \\"Lucy\\" Salome Hirtle Wile, one of Michael Hirtle's seven daughters; wife of George \\"Michael\\" Wile. Western Lunenburg County was shared by aboriginal Mi'kmaq people before the first European settlers arrived. In an 1894 interview, George Michael Wile (1809–1895) and his wife Lucinda Hirtle Wile, the first European settlers in the Waterloo area, spoke about the early days of the settlement when \\"Indians\\" camped on a brook in the area, \\"catching otter, mink, and other animals for fur\\" (DesBrisay, 1895). Some time before 1870, when early deeds show transfers of land in the community, the first settlers received large land grants of 50 to 150-acre parcels from Great Britain before and around the time of Canadian Confederation.  Historical perspectives The European roots of the community are predominantly from small German states which are comprised by the Germany of today and from the region known as Montbéliard in eastern France. Waterloo Settlement's first settlers were sons and daughters of second and third-generation German and Montbéliardian immigrants brought to Nova Scotia as loyal citizens to the British crown in 1750–52. The French-speaking Montbéliardians were considered good candidates to emigrate since they were known to be \\"very frugal, as well as strong independent laborers\\" (Withrow, 2002). As for the Germans (and likely the Swiss), Judge Debrisay quotes a number of stereotypes and impressions that developed and existed of the first German immigrants up to 1895, at least 140 years after their arrival. \\"They are a big, square-shouldered, deep-chested race. They do not talk much, but look as though they thought—easy going, and good tempered... they are hearty eaters, but they are not fussy and finikin over their food... so long as the dish is wholesome, and there is sufficient of it, they are satisfied... in the sensuous arts of painting and sculpture, the Germans are poor. In the ennobling arts of literature and music they are great, and this fact provides a key to their character. They are simple, earnest, homely, genuine people. They do not laugh much, but when they do they laugh deep down. They are slow, but so is a deep river... . The Germans believe in themselves, and respect themselves\\".Desbrisay, 1895  Historical significance of the region These German, Swiss, and French settlers arrived just prior to the tumultuous years when Nouvelle France was being defeated by the British, resulting in the first Treaty of Paris (1763). Many Acadians were expelled in 1755 and these German Protestant immigrants initially were the new population sought to outbalance the French and Mi'kmaq influence in the region—both of which were Catholic (Withrow, 2002). There was at least another connection between these Acadians and the Germans. Because there was a food shortage in the Lunenburg area where the German settlers were granted their first land, the British encouraged them to travel to the Acadians' newly seized and vacated land in what is now the Annapolis Valley and herd their abandoned livestock back to Lunenburg. Between July 30 and September 3, 1756, 282 of the settlers were involved in the drive by either retrieving the animals or tending to the chores of those who went.Lunenburg Cattle Drive Three of those surnames involved were later to be prominent Waterloo names: Krause, Vienot, and Weil. The community was also settled by a Black Loyalist by the surname of Lavender. L & E Lavender received a grant of land south of Matthew Lake and farmed it as did the other settlers.Grant map German and Montbéliardian community roots: Wile, Hirtle, Crouse, and Veinot On the horizon is the original drumlin cleared by George \\"Michael\\" Wile and his wife Lucinda \\"Lucy\\" Hirtle. This hill is the one Lucy refers to from the early days of the settlement when she speaks of spreading a quilt between the stumps to place her basket of children on, and then another quilt above them for shade, when she was \\"reaping and doing other work\\". This primary source gives evidence of the use of the name \\"Montreal Settlement\\" in reference to west Waterloo at Long Lake in the 1890s. The origin of this name or even the use of the name is unknown to present Waterloo residents. The first European inhabitant of the community was George \\"Michael\\" Wile (grandson of Frederick \\"Weil\\", who arrived in 1750 on the ship AnnShip listList of passengers on the ship Ann and his wife, Lucinda Salome Hirtle (great granddaughter of Hans Michael Hirtle who came in 1751 on the ship Pearl), Michael Hirtle's daughter from nearby Newcombville. Michael Wile's grant of included the highest drumlin in the area, overlooking Mack Lake (later renamed \\"Matthew Lake\\"), which he cleared to build his home and break up for cropland. Michael was soon followed by George Hirtle (DesBrisay, 1895), who eventually was granted in total in the Long Lake area.NS Government, 1996 According to an 1892 deed, the most westerly portion of the community around Long Lake was called \\"Montreal Settlement.\\"Deed, 1892 The third man to arrive was his brother, James Hirtle, who was granted a total of south of Long Lake and north of the Waterloo Road, also in the Montreal Settlement area. Michael's nephews Absalom (1831–1892) and Henry Wile (1817–1889) soon were granted land in the same area, and respectively. In one example, Charles Tupper, later to become the sixth Prime Minister of Canada, in his role as the provincial secretary granted Absalom Wile of his final 735 in 1858 while Nova Scotia was still a colony. Michael's brothers joined him in the settlement area. George (1804–1880) was granted in the most eastern part of the settlement around Fire Lake and St. George Lake; William (1813–1900) and Isaac (1825–1914) were granted land in the Mack Lake area gaining 194 and respectively and sharing a 200 grant. Grant map Mack Wile (the lake's namesake) was the grandson of William. Through intermarriage with the first settlers, other surnames became prominent in the community such as the Montbéliardian Veinot (from Leopold Vienot who arrived on the ship \\"Betty\\" in 1752Ship ListPhotographs of the Montbeliard monument, Lunenburg and Crouse (Hans George Krause, arrived in 1752 on the 1752 ship Gale or John Jacob Krause, Ship Pearl, 1752).Mission, 1995c.

Note the former school, now community hall, in the background. Susannah Fiendel Wile's (1786–1878) gravesite, Waterloo, Nova Scotia. This grave is within meters of her sons George, Michael, William, Isaac, and David whose grave is unmarked. The most broken-down gravestone in the Waterloo Cemetery is that of Susanna E. Fiendel Wile (1786–1878). She was the wife of Andrew Wile, Sr. (1758–1832). Her gravestone shows a recorded age of 92 years, 8 months. The presence of her grave is a significant link to the 18th century when the town of Lunenburg was a fledgling community and Bridgewater was only an idea. Susanna was the second wife of Andrew Wile, the first of two sons born to John Frederick \\"Weil\\", the progenitor of the Wiles of Nova Scotia. Andrew's oldest son (from his first wife Regina Getson) John Frederick, built the second house built in Bridgewater along with his brother Garrett, and framed by John Vienot (DesBrisay, 1895). With the passing of Regina Getson, Andrew Sr. married Susanna E. Fiendel. She became the stepmother of Andrew's ten previous children, of whom only about half were adult at the time. Susanna had ten more children of her own. It was her step- grandsons, Absalom and Henry who were granted the land in Montreal Settlement. It was her sons Michael, George, William, and Isaac who settled Waterloo Settlement. Her grandson Dean Wile started the Wile Carding Mill in Bridgewater and also donated the land for Brookside Cemetery in Bridgewater. The presence of Susannah Fiendel Wile's grave in the Waterloo Cemetery indicates that she may have spent her last years with her sons and their families in Waterloo Settlement instead of in Wileville where her husband Andrew and she had lived together. Eight Hirtles marry eight Wiles John \\"Michael\\" Hirtle (1786–1840) and his wife Anna Maria Rhuland lived in the nearby community of Newcombville and ran a saw mill with George Hirtle in the early 19th century (Desbrisay, 1895). Michael and Anna Maria's seven daughters all married Wiles—even one of their sons, George Benjamin Hirtle (b. 1814) married one of the boys' sisters, Sophia Dorothea Wile, and was quite likely the second person to come to Waterloo Settlement (Desbrisay, 1895). Michael's daughter, Mary Ann (b. 1810) married Andrew and Susanna Fiendel Wile's oldest boy, John George. George's brother, George Michael, Waterloo's first settler of European descent, married Mary Ann's sister Lucy Salome (b. 1813). William, another brother of George's married Catherine (b. 1819), another sister. David, a younger brother of George married Mary Elizabeth (b. 1816), yet another sister. These brothers' oldest half-brother, John Frederick Wile (oldest son of Andrew and his first wife, Regina Getson), had seven sons, three of whom married the rest of Michael Hirtle's daughters: Henry, John, and James. Henry Wile married Sophia Amelia (b. 1822); John married Sarah Ann (b. 1824); and finally James married Barbara (b. 1826), the last of the seven sisters.Hirtle Genealogy Most of these Hirtle–Wile marriages constituted the first of Waterloo Settlement families. George farmed at the junction of the Waterloo Rd and Chelsea Rd; George \\"Michael\\" on the highest hill overlooking Matthew Lake; William's farm overlooked Frederick Lake to the south; Sophia and George farmed in the Montreal Settlement-Long Lake area; and Henry and Sophia farmed the land overlooking Long Lake. Education This building has served as school and now community center since it was first built in the c. 1860s. George \\"Michael\\" Wile spoke to the beginnings of education in Waterloo Settlement. A Mr. James Dowling's father taught school in Michael's house for a couple of winters, periodically walking the 70-kilometre round trip from his home in Lunenburg. The need to have a real school building for the few students that lived in the settlement was solved with quick action; a new 18 × school building was erected in eight days and on the ninth \\"the teacher and scholars met in it and commenced the school\\". (Desbrisay, 1895) The project was entirely community built from the sawing of the lumber to the framing and interior preparations. By the Act of 1864, Nova Scotia was divided into local school sections (Woods, 1936). As early as 1894, the Waterloo School was one of those sections known as Waterloo School Section No. 92 (Waterloo, 1894). School board meeting minutes from 1895–97 speak to the deliberations over whether to enforce the Compulsory School Act. The motion to enforce the Act was defeated at each of these three annual meetings. Generally during those early years, most of the resolutions put forward involved the school building and maintenance; the letting of contracts for \\"fire making\\" and provision of firewood were common themes (Waterloo, 1894–98). Each year considerable meeting time was spent in the nomination of board members and trustees. Students travelled by foot to school. For those from Montreal Settlement, the four kilometer round trip was difficult in the winter (Hubley, 2002). The last year the Waterloo School operated was 1959–60. After that, Grade 1–8 students were bussed to the Wileville School and Grades 8–12 to Hebbville School. Some teachers who served over the years were Maggie Herman from 1893–1895; Blanche Whitman, 1896–97; D. Marie Sarty, 1929–1931; Roger Sarty, 1934–35; Cora Wile, 1935–36; and Shirley Fraser, 1950-?). School salaries ranged from $100 a year in 1896 to $325 by 1936. In the early 1960s, a K-6 school was built in Newcombville for area students including children from Waterloo. Another education entity in the community was the Department of Agriculture organization known as 4-H. A club was started in the early 1950s in the Waterloo school, mostly as a garden club with approximately five members.Nova Scotia 4-H History - Part 2 - Waterloo In the 1960s, the club amalgamated with the Lapland 4-H Garden Club. Finally in 1971, the clubs separated and the Waterloo 4-H Club was reestablished with 13 members. The members were required to write and make public speeches; enter agricultural exhibits in the South Shore Exhibition;\\"The South Shore Exhibition\\" compete in judging events of agricultural products; and show the handling of cattle and horses in the exhibition rings. Religion The St. Michael's Church in earlier 1900s. Notice the quality of the main road in the foreground. The community has held a variety of religious persuasions with Lutheran and Baptist being the most common. St. Michael's Lutheran Church was organized on March 12, 1889 under the leadership of Rev. F. A. Kohlse. For ten years the congregation met in the hall built on the second floor above of the schoolhouse (the hall was used every fifth Sunday by the Baptists) (Veinot, 2008). In c. 1899, the congregation built and dedicated a church across the road from the school. During the month of July 1939, the church was renovated and redecorated. The members supplied the labor and the many gifts and memorials that were unveiled in a rededication ceremony on July 28, 1939. Rev. Douglas A. Conrad, the pastor of the Waterloo church, hosted the many visitors and guest speakers during the five days of celebration. (Bridgewater, 1939) The continuity of the Lutheran faith is still evident today in the community although change has occurred over the years. This adherence to the faith and a continuing desire for a local place of worship was evident in the results of the vote taken at the Planning Committee (c. 1969) that addressed the potential merger of five regional congregations. During that vote, only 20% of the St. Michael's representatives approved of the merger. Nevertheless, the amalgamation took place with the majority of approval (approximately 51%) of the voting representatives of the five churches. The building of a new All Saints Lutheran Church in Newcombville formalized the future meeting place of the region's Lutherans (Resolutions, 1969). St. Michael's was dismantled in the early 1970s. The church's bell has been permanently mounted next to the cemetery. Language English is the first language of the community and county. As with most regions in the Canada, dialects exist. Some interesting dialectal forms of words and unique phrases are spoken in the community and county at large--sometimes known as \\"Lunenburg English\\". Although these uses are not universal, they are widespread. Some words are spoken without a conventional hard \\"r\\" consonant such as \\"ova\\" (over), \\"hause\\" (horse), \\"aw\\" (our), and \\"ca\\" (car). Others are spoken with an unconventional use of vowels such as \\"tamarra\\" (tomorrow), \\"sure\\" (sure pronounced the shore), and \\"ta\\" (to). Some contractions and word clips have been created to accommodate those missing in the English language such as \\"daren't\\" (dare not), \\"'mon\\" (come on), and \\"'bout\\" (about). Sometimes little-known words are used such as \\"chesterfield\\" (for sofa), or \\"scrooch\\" with \\"oo\\" sounding like foot (scrooch oo's normally pronounced like \\"too\\"—means to bend or cower) to describe the movements of an animal or futile human efforts; or the use of right in \\"right sultry\\" weather as to say it is \\"certainly\\" sultry (where right is used in the fashion of \\"right enough\\" or \\"undeniably\\" right). One phrase, to \\"be short- taken\\" (meaning the sudden and unplanned need to find a restroom), appears to be borrowed from the British phrase, to \\"be taken short\\" or \\"caught short.\\" A number of new words and phrases have found their way into the vernacular as well. For example, cutting wood into pieces or chunks is \\"junking it up\\" (perhaps from \\"chunking it up\\"); standing with one's back toward someone is \\"standing back to\\"; babies sometimes \\"crex\\" (perhaps akin to the Deitsch Grex, meaning a whimper or a creaking sound) and cry (whimper or whine); and \\"squauze\\" as the past tense for squeeze; and a \\"sneaky\\" person is someone who is a picky eater. Longevity The community has shared in the longevity trendCBC article on longevity in Lunenburg County that statisticians say exists disproportionally in the County of Lunenburg compared to other world statistics. Absalom Wile's stepmother, Susannah Fiendel, lived to be 92. One son of Absalom Wile, Wiswell Wile, had a daughter, Ella Hintz (1900–2003) from Wileville who lived to be 103.South Shore Now \\"Motorcycle matriarch dies at 103\\"  Remnants of German culture: yokes and sauerkraut The first German settlers came to Lunenburg County 258 years ago. Little remains of the German language and cultural practices. However, a few German implements and foods linger. The German head yoke is still used for yoking oxen at showmanship pulls and the German claw hoe can still be found in various tool sheds. German sauerkraut is cut from cabbage and turnip. Another food is the Lunenburg sausage made from ground pork and beef, spiced with coriander and stuffed into the entrails of the hog. The pudding version is spiced with summer savory and then cooked (Veinot, 2008). The arrival of modern conveniences The German head yoke. The German head yoke was similar to the Acadian head yoke in that both attached to the head at the horns. The alternative was the New England bow yoke that rested loosely on the necks of the oxen. These two Hereford oxen are about to be led in a summer parade. Here Kate and Lady, a Belgian team, is still worked in the Annapolis Valley. The last draft horse in Waterloo to provide the horsepower for cultivation was Bill, a black Belgian in west Waterloo in 1968. Massey Harris tractors arrived in the community in the 1950s. The power source for most farm work in the community prior to this was either horse or ox teams. The German yoke (narrower and strapped closely to the horns) was used to harness the oxen's power to the horns similarly to the Acadian style of yoke (wider and flatter resting more on the neck). In the major agricultural areas of Nova Scotia, the draft horse eventually replaced the oxen. The last known draft horse to work the land was \\"Bill\\", a black Belgian owned by Ivan Wile. Today oxen and horse teams are a traditional icon of Lunenburg County heritage. \\"Pulls\\" are well-attended events in the South Shore Exhibition at Bridgewater each summer. Electricity did not arrive in Waterloo until the 1950s. The entire line was installed during the winter of 1949–50 and on one day in April at 4:30 PM residents saw all the lights come on in the homes that had been wired. Prior to that, kerosene lamps were used in the house and lanterns with rags in fat or kerosene were used for chores. Within a year of the electric power installation, telephone line was strung as well on the same poles. A \\"party line\\" system was used where a contact was made with another person in the party by turning a handle (or later a dial) on the side or face of the box a certain combination of one or two short or long rings. Privacy was afforded on an honor system where if the line was already in use by someone in the party, the \\"receiver\\" was placed back on the hook and the would-be caller tried later. The \\"dirt\\" road that served the community for over 100 years was paved in the 1980s. Because the road needed proper sloping and drainage, it had been subject to frost heaves and became practically impassable in the spring. More than once school buses became mired in the middle of the road and required towing from other buses or tractors as late as the 1970s. Beginning in 1983, the road was widened, raised, ditched and finally paved in four stages: Highway 210 to the Veinot Rd; Veinot Rd to the Bolivar Rd; Bolivar Rd to Long Lake; and finally Long Lake to the Queens County line by 1987.  Physical features of the land  Drumlins, or little hills formed by glacial action, are a key feature in this and other communities in Lunenburg County. Here on the left is the \\"James Hirtle Hill\\" and on the right is the \\"Michael Wile Hill\\". The image is being taken from the \\"Bolivar Hill.\\" The dominant physical features of the community are cleared drumlins, wetlands known as \\"swamps\\" and three lakes: Frederick Lake, Matthew Lake (earlier Mack Lake, likely after Mack Wile, son of Allan Wile, later named Matthew after Matthew Carver, a landholder near the western edge of the lake), and Long Lake. The drumlins provided the best cultivatable land to the original settlers who grew fodder and commercial crops. One large wetland is known as the Turner Bog. Though the land was too wet for farming and roads, it was granted to the Nova Scotia Central Railway (see more at Halifax and Southwestern Railway) to provide wood for infrastructure and possible line expansion (Cameron, 1999). Living with the land: quilts and stumps The task of clearing the settlement's first land was one of a studied process. The first task was to cut and gather into piles what they called the \\"underwood\\" (now called \\"undergrowth\\") with an axe or a brush hook. The best of the large trees and heavy wood was cut next—often pine and spruce—which were rolled aside until winter for hauling to the mill and cutting for building materials for the house and barn (According to the c.1881 Ambrose Church Map, Waterloo had no less than three saw mills). Michael Wile mentioned the size of \\"rock maple\\" being two and three feet thick and the oak and ash being of \\"immense size\\" (Desbrisay, 1895). Some of this wood was use for firewood and the straighter wood for fence posts. The rest of the larger unwanted wood was left to dry for later burning. When these trees were cut, the choppers \\"were usually very careful to leave the stumps about two feet high but no higher\\" (Martin 1974). This allowed two wheeled carts to pass over them but still left them high enough to catch hold of when being pulled out by oxen. Usually the stumps were left for two or three years until partially rotted when they were more easily pulled from the soil. Lucy, Michael's wife, illustrated this process when she said how she used to \\"take her little children in a big basket to the field where [she] was reaping or doing other work, and spread a quilt in between the stumps and put them on it, and place another quilt above them for shade\\" (Desbrisay, 1895). Once the land was cleared, it was burnt in May and planted immediately. Planting the potatoes, cucumbers, corn and pumpkins was hard work since the soil often had many rocks and roots requiring the most effective tool: a sharp stick. Turnip and grain seed was sown by hand and covered with soil scratched up by the \\"burnt-land harrow\\" made from the crotch of a tree with protruding spikes. This ox drawn harrow was triangular with spikes slanted toward the back so as not to get stuck between the stumps and rocks. For a year or two after the burn, the Wiles and Hirtles would have enjoyed the rich ash-filled, weed-free soil. Michael Wile refers to this kind of land when he said he wore his new moose skin trousers \\"in the burnt land\\" (Desbrisay, 1895). After two or three years, the crops were rotated to another piece of burnt land leaving the depeated soil either for rough pasture or the seeding down to hay (Martin, 1974). Natural resources and economy A Waterloo grower prunes Balsam Fir trees in October, west Waterloo, Nova Scotia. The tree must have \\"three frosts\\" to stabilize the needles before cutting, hauling, baling, trucking, retailing, and finally dressing the tree, which may be marketed as far away as New England or Puerto Rico. canopy that interferes with direct sunlight exposure. In an 1894 interview, Michael Wile refers to his wheat, a crop not planted in recent times. Michael and the other first farmers were first preoccupied with producing bread with their own flour since the cost of imported wheat was prohibitive. Michael Wile said that the first flour he used in the settlement was from his own wheat (According to the c.1881 Ambrose Church Map, Waterloo had two gristmills). The growing of wheat in the county was a difficult undertaking since the climate often didn't permit proper ripening and the quality of the crop sometimes yielded low quality flour. In 1845, a large setback to wheat-growing occurred with the scourge of wheat midge Thecodiplomis mosellana Gehin. The larvae from this microorganism destroyed the grain kernels as their developed (Martin, 1974). Michael also refers to tapping maples \\"easily get[ting] three barrels of sap out of one large maple ... ma[king] two hundred pounds of maple sugar in a season.\\" This tradition has been continued by Michael Wile's ancestors. Wildlife was especially plentiful in the early days of the settlement—especially moose. Michael Wile identified the land as \\"great moose country\\" where the community hunters killed upwards to 10 in a season—some of which weighed 800 pounds (Desbrisay, 1895). Since the mid-20th century wild blueberries have been cultivated on the Isaac Wile Hill and Balsam Fir Christmas trees have been grown in various parts of the community. After the first three autumn frosts which set the needles, the trees are traditionally cut in November. Research is currently being done in Truro, Nova Scotia to develop a tree which will not drop its needles after being cut.\\"Researchers in NS look to create Christmas tree that holds needles longer\\" Dec. 11, 2007 This is key to an industry which exports 80 percentChristmas Tree Council of Nova Scotia of its product to the USA—a market that is steadily become interested in artificial trees that don't drop needles. Much pulpwood and timber has been harvested from the community especially since the Mersey Pulp Mill was built in 1929 in Liverpool, Nova Scotia (Bowater, 2007). Red Spruce, Black Spruce and Balsam Fir are the most common species harvested after it matures in approximately 30 to 40 years. In most cases, the shallow layers of topsoil and grey clay layers beneath the forest do not support a tree's long term growth or promote good drainage in the local area. The community is rich in shale which when blasted and crushed provides various grades of road and building materials. Recreation: continuity and change The community hall was and remains the center of collective recreation. Some of the events have changed and some continue in forms that reflect the current times in Lunenburg County. One popular event from early times until the 1990s was the annual Strawberry Supper, celebrating the county's berry harvest. This event brought the community together to socialize and raise funds for the upkeep of the hall. In the 1940s, tables were set up outside the schoolhouse in the yard. The women worked in the kitchen passing the food out the window to those waiting on tables. The men stood around socializing about the various work projects they were involved in. Some of these event coordinators were Mrs. Lionel Wile, Mrs. Carl Wile, Mrs. Austin Bolivar, Mrs. Veinot, Mrs. Maurice Wile, and Mrs. Ivan Wile. In more recent times, all the serving and dining happened in the hall with visitors often lined up outside waiting for a seat; the serving and organizing was done by relatives of those individuals mentioned above.

It acts as a cholecystokinin antagonist, which blocks both the CCKA and CCKB subtypes. It was used mainly in the treatment of stomach ulcers, although it has now been largely replaced by newer drugs for this application. An interesting side effect of proglumide is that it enhances the analgesia produced by opioid drugs, and can prevent or even reverse the development of tolerance to opioid drugs. This can make it a useful adjuvant treatment to use alongside opioid drugs in the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as cancer, where opioid analgesics may be required for long periods and development of tolerance reduces clinical efficacy of these drugs. Proglumide has also been shown to act as a δ-opioid agonist, which may contribute to its analgesic effects. Proglumide also works as a placebo effect amplifier for pain conditions. When injected visibly to a subject, its analgesic effect is bigger than a similarly administered placebo. When injected secretly, it does not have any effect, whereas standard pain drugs have an effect, even if they are administered without the subject's awareness. The supposed mechanism is an enhancement of the neural pathways of expectation as a result of dopamine and endogenous opioids being suddenly released throughout numerous structures of the brain and spinal cord. The ventral tegmental area is the structure believed to mediate proglumides analgesic and euphoric effects, however dozens of areas with a wide range of physical and psychological functions are implicated in the mediation of the placebo effect (this accounts for proglumides ability to produce physically measurable effects on vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and tidal volume which can not be accounted for by its clinically insignificant δ-opioid affinity.

It is within the Ascension Parish School Board. The current (2013 - present) principal is Marvin Evans. The Associate Principal is Nicole Elmore. There are two Assistant Principals: Michael Hilton and Oneal Robinson. The school mascot is the tiger, and the school colors are red and black. In 1831 there seems to have been a public school in Donaldsonville. This building was situated on the square bounded by Cabahonoose Street (now Railroad Avenue), Opelousas St., Attakapas St.,(now Nicholls Avenue) and the Town Square. It was used continuously as a public school until the beginning of the American Civil War. The organization of the school is unknown, other than that it was conducted by one teacher. No public school was operated in Donaldsonville after the one referred to previously until 1885, when the Ascension Parish School Board authorized the opening of the Academy of Ascension in Donaldsonville. Composing its faculty were the following: L.C. Ferrell, principal, Mrs. C. Keating, Miss Margaret C. Hanson and Miss Willie C. Garnett. Pupil enrollment was in excess of 200. On February 6, 1887, Professor R.N. Sims appeared before the parish school board and reported on the condition of the Ascension Academy. At his request it was resolved, \\"that the superintendent with R.N. Sims be requested to take all the necessary steps to get the permit for the Louisiana State Board of Education to add a High School Department to the Ascension Academy. \\"Seven months later the board received a letter from J.P. Calhoun, State Superintendent of Public Education, empowering the board to \\"consider the Ascension Academy an established public high school of Ascension parish. In the year 1897, twelve years after the first school was in operation, the first high school was established. The faculty consisted of Principal R.N. Sims, and Miss Sudie Robertson, Clarence Thompson, Mamie Armitage, Ida Turner and Celestine Lastrappes. The 1st graduating class to receive state diplomas was a class of seven girls. School growth increased and the old plant was not large enough to accommodate this growth. Realizing that it was imperative that something be done about the matter, at the suggestion of Board President E.N. Pugh, the board decided to make plans for the erection of a new and modern building. The town of Donaldsonville voted a $25,000.00 bond issue and the parish Police Jury approiated a like amount. After other necessary legal steps were taken and completed, a modern brick school building, one of the finest of its kind in Louisiana at that time, was erected on the site of the old Ascension Academy building. The building was dedicated with due ceremony on May 17, 1907, and was ready for occupancy in the fall of that year. Consolidation of schools started in 1916 with the closing of the elementary school at Barton. This was followed by the closing of the Elise school in 1925, the Sacramento School in 1927, and the Smoke Bend school in 1929. In 1970 Lowery High School merged with Donaldsonville High School. DHS has remained the sole public High School on the west side of Ascension Parish. By 1921 continued growth forced the school board to call for a\\"$100,000.00 bond issue for the purpose of erecting, repairing and equipping school buildings in school district No. 7\\". As a result of the election, the original brick building was repaired, and a new one built on a site removed from the original building. Upon its completion in 1925, the new building was occupied by grades one to four. However, in 1927 a change was made, and this building was used by the high school department and the other one by the elementary grades. In 1939, as part of a WPA project, a site was constructed on Lee Avenue. A central building and a gymnasium were constructed. In 1954, a district bond issue was passed for further expansion. An addition was constructed in 1965, the present site of Ascension Parish School Board Head Start. Donaldsonville High School has been involved in interscholastic activities since its early years. As early as 1898 the school sent an exhibit to Nashville, Tennessee, to compete with many other schools. It also entered into competition with other schools of the parish in rallies, the first of which was held in Donaldsonville in the spring of 1908. This practice continued for twenty years but had to be discontinued due to all schools not opening at the same time in order that the children of east Ascension parish could help with the strawberry crop. In 1921 the Sugar Belt Rally, participated in by the schools of Assumption, Terrebone, Lafourche and Ascension parishes, took place in Donaldsonville. Donaldsonville High School has boasted of outstanding athletic teams' boys and girls basketball, boys and girls track, baseball, softball and football. The football team was first established in 1927. State Championships have been earned by the students of Donaldsonville beginning with the 1956 Class B football title under head coach Floyd Boutee. Donaldsonville High School girls' basketball teams have earned state championships in 1987, 1991, 1999 under head coach Alan Marroy. The boys' track teams earned outdoor championships in 1997 and 1998, along with an indoor title in 1998, under head coach Bill Jones. In 1976 construction began on a new Donaldsonville High School site on a tract of land off of La. 1 south. The present site was completed and occupied in the spring of 1977. Formal dedication of the building occurred on April 23, 1978. The present campus is continually being upgraded with the addition of an auxiliary gym, classrooms, a kitchen for the Family and Consumer Science Department, the addition of an athletic fieldhouse, track and baseball/softball complex.

She later served with the Military Sea Transportation Service and the Peruvian Navy as a diving support ship. In Peruvian naval service she was renamed BAP Unanue (ATA-136). Construction and commissioning The ship was laid down on 5 October 1943 at Orange, Texas by the Levingston Shipbuilding Co. as the unnamed rescue tug ATR-101. She was launched on 18 November 1943, redesignated as auxiliary ocean tug ATA-174, and commissioned on 20 July 1944, Lt. A. J. Vetro in command. World War II service ATA-174 departed Orange on 4 August and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia on the 11th. Over the next 10 days, she conducted shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay and then underwent an eight-day, post-shakedown repair period before heading for New York on 2 September. The tug remained at Staten Island for five days and then took departure for the Panama Canal with three open lighters in tow. She made an unscheduled three-day stop in mid-September to evade a hurricane but finally arrived in Cristóbal on 26 September. On the 27th, she transited the canal and reported to the Pacific Fleet for duty. The tug departed Balboa on 10 October towing YC-1131 and YC-1137 to San Diego, arriving on 26 October after a voyage complicated by a steering control failure. Following repairs at San Diego, the ship moved north to San Pedro, California making the voyage on 10 and 11 November. She remained there until 19 November when she took the three open lighters in tow and set a course for Pearl Harbor. The tug arrived in Pearl Harbor on 3 December, remained there for 10 days, and then got underway for the Marshall Islands on 13 December. After a 16-day voyage plagued by mishaps in her main propulsion plant, the tug arrived at Eniwetok Atoll on 29 December. Between 1 and 3 January 1945, she towed YSR-4 from Eniwetok to Kwajalein and, after a six-day stopover, continued on to Manus Island where she arrived on 18 January. On 22 January 1945, she stood out to sea from Manus and set a course for Nouméa, New Caledonia. En route, however, she received orders diverting her to Guadalcanal. The tug arrived at her new destination on 26 January. She served in the southern Solomon Islands for almost two months. Early in February, she conducted diving operations on the sunken wreck of during the investigation of her explosion and sinking. In mid-February, she salvaged six bulldozers from 110 feet of water off Lunga Point. Later, she pulled two grounded submarine chasers off reefs in Skylark Channel. She concluded her duty at Guadalcanal on 22 March when she took ARD-18 in tow for Hollandia, New Guinea. She stopped at Hollandia from 30 March to 2 April and then continued towing ARD-18 to Ulithi where she arrived on 7 April. After an overnight stop, the tug departed on the 8th and set a course for Manus. She reached Manus on 12 April but departed again the next day. The ship made Guadalcanal on the 17th and remained two days. From there, she voyaged via Espiritu Santo to Tutuila, Samoa, arriving at the latter island on 27 April. She made emergency repairs until 1 May on which day she shaped a course for the Russell Islands subgroup of the Solomons with AFD-20 in tow. In the Russells, she added a pontoon barge to the tow and continued on to Manus where she arrived on 20 May. On the 24th, ATA-174 resumed her voyage, this time to Leyte in the Philippines where she arrived on 2 June. The tug remained at Leyte for 15 days and then got underway for Guadalcanal on the 17th. She reached her destination on 27 June but departed again the next day towing via Tulagi to Leyte. After a stop in the Russell Islands and another at Manus, she and her charge arrived in San Pedro Bay on 19 July. On the 23rd, the tug left Leyte and set sail for Espiritu Santo where, after a diversion back to the Russell Islands, she arrived on 10 August. The tug remained at Espiritu Santo until 14 August when she set sail to return to Leyte with YC-812 and YF-366 in tow. She arrived in Leyte on 29 August, delivered her charges, and remained there for a little over a week. On 8 September, the tug headed back to the Solomons by way of Manus. She arrived at Guadalcanal on the 19th and began duty as an air-sea rescue vessel, also towing diesel fuel barges between Tulagi and the Russells. That assignment lasted a little more than a month. On 26 October, she took a former LST in tow for Leyte and arrived there on 8 November. She departed Leyte 11 days later and, after stops at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, arrived in San Francisco on 1 January 1946. For the next month, the tug operated along the west coast, visiting San Diego, Astoria, Oregon, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. On 18 February 1946, she reported for duty at the naval station at Astoria. Decommissioning, MSTS service, and disposal After almost 9 months of active service with the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, she was placed out of commission on 16 January 1947. Berthed with the Columbia River Group, she remained inactive at Astoria until the summer of 1953. During that period, she received the name Wateree on 16 July 1948. On 2 June 1953, she departed Astoria to be transferred to the Commandant, 13th Naval District, who in turn transferred her to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) for duty in Alaskan waters. She was placed in service on 13 August 1953 and served with the MSTS in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest until the spring of 1955. On 14 March 1955, Wateree rejoined the Columbia River Group. She remained inactive until 27 July 1961 at which time she was sold to Peru and renamed BAP Unanue (AMB-136) where is still in service as diving support ship.Maritime Administration Ship Record Detail: Wateree References : External links * Photo gallery at navsource.org Sotoyomo-class tugs Ships built in Orange, Texas 1943 ships World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Sotoyomo-class tugs of the Peruvian Navy ","title":"USS Wateree (ATA-174)"},{"id":"14409352","text":"Jorge Rodríguez Esquivel (born 18 April 1968) is a Mexican former footballer, who played for CD Toluca and Santos Laguna, and Mexican at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

Little known to the public, she played an influential behind-the-scenes role in American progressive politics during the 1990s and 2000s. Her passing at age 52 was publicly lamented by progressive figures such as Michael Tomasky, Joe Conason, and Cenk Uygur. Early life and career Leavey was born on January 1, 1954, to a United States Army soldier stationed in Pisa, Italy, William J. Leavey, and the former Irene Schmitt. She had a brother and a sister, in what was a family of Irish Catholic background. She grew up in Queens, New York City, then her father retired from the military with a rank of lieutenant colonel. He took a job in 1968 as an assistant professor of history at Lock Haven State College, at which point the family moved to Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. She attended Lock Haven High School, where she was named a member of the National Honor Society as a sophomore. She graduated from there in 1971. She then attended Trinity College in Washington, where she graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After college Leavey moved back to New York City, where during the mid-late 1970s she lived in Jackson Heights, Queens and worked as a benefits authorizer for the Social Security Administration's Northeastern Program Service Center in Rego Park, Queens. She subsequently got a job working as an editor at Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich in Manhattan. In 1985 she entered graduate school at Pennsylvania State University, earning a master's in American History in 1989. During this time she served as editor of a Perspectives on film and video ethnographic studies volume for the university in 1988. Political work In the early 1990s she was involved in teaching American history at the university. She also worked for the local public television station, WPSU-TV, in the early 1990s, interviewing candidates running for office and making a documentary about Harris Wofford, a Democratic Party politician who won the 1991 United States Senate special election in Pennsylvania. Leavey came to the Washington, D.C. area in 1993, living in a small apartment in Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. Though she did not have a regular job and had very little money, she managed to become quite well connected within D.C. politics. She was a consultant to Howard Dean during his presidential campaign and worked with Senators Tom Harkin and Harry Reid. She was known for having insider gossip before others, and for having a rare understanding of the personalities and complex rules that govern the Senate. She started a monthly breakfast to connect journalists with figures in liberal politics including Reid, Dean, John Podesta, and Nancy Pelosi. She was a true believe in the progressive movement who focused on doing unglamorous, behind- the-scenes tasks. She was known for baking cookies for everyone from leading politicians to her postal worker. Death and legacy Leavey died of heart disease on December 31, 2006, the day before her 53rd birthday. Her death was likely due to an undiagnosed heart condition that was hereditary in her family (her father had died suddenly at age 54 in 1978.) Because she had no regular job, she lacked health insurance. Had she had health insurance and access to regular medical checkups, she might well have been treated and survived. Her death has been cited by progressive activists as a wake-up call about the lack of resources flowing to dedicated activists who are outside the think-tank sphere. > The irony is that conservative groups, whose leaders are often stereotyped > as stingy and heartless, tend to provide far better conditions for their > troops than progressive organizations do.

The play was first performed on March 28, 1968, at the St. Martin's Theatre. It was directed by Frith Banbury and starred Michael Hordern.The Literary Saloon at http://www.complete- review.com/reviews/stoppt/enterafm.htm#basic It consists largely of material from his 1960 play A Walk on Water. When being interviewed by Giles Gordon in 1968, Stoppard said of Enter a Free Man, \\"I have worked on it a bit over the last year. In fact I wrote a new scene for it about 3 weeks ago while it was on tour, but it is basically the play I wrote in 1960. I mean it is still a play about the same people in the same situation. There is some new stuff in it and I have thrown out certain things. There was some imagery which went bad on me as things do, I suppose about a third of it has been written in at various times over the last few years.\\" Despite this, Enter a Free Man has sometimes been described as Stoppard's first play. Plot George is determined to follow his unrealistic dreams, despite the fact that his behavior becomes a problem for his wife Persephone and his daughter Linda. He even has to borrow money from his daughter, money which he spends at the local pub. George believes he has found a great new idea in reusable envelopes, but of course his plans do not come to fruition. He continues to put his family under pressure just as his daughter has begun searching for her own independence in the form of men. While George threatens to leave and Linda tries, the play concludes with everyone in the same position in which they had begun the story. Stoppard implies that perhaps this is actually, for all of its pitfalls, the best situation. Reception Clive Barnes of The New York Times wrote in 1974, \\"It shows little of the flaunting, dazzling intellectualism that has subsequently become Mr. Stoppard's emblem [...] Yet there is always that wit flicking, out at the audience.\\" Leone Lucille Michel wrote, \\"His ability to create fully developed characters and relationships is limited and he wisely moved away from this type of drama into his own particular type of comedy.\\" References 1968 plays Plays by Tom Stoppard ","title":"Enter a Free Man"},{"id":"14409497","text":"João Luiz Da Ros (born Florianópolis, 7 October 1982), known as Ige, is a Brazilian rugby union player.

Pulgar, means thumb in Spanish, and the name was probably translated directly to English following the ousting of Spain during the Spanish–American War. The name may have arisen as a result of the mountain's profile, which vaguely resembles the tip of a thumb protruding from a clenched fist. The upper reaches of Thumb Peak are populated by species associated with ultramafic soils, including a number of endemics, such as the tropical pitcher plant Nepenthes deaniana, rediscovered on the mountain in 2007 for the first time since its description in 1908 (see external links).Macfarlane, J.M. 1908.

Biography Baikie was born at Kirkwall, Orkney, eldest son of Captain John Baikie, R.N. He studied medicine at Edinburgh, and, on obtaining his M.D. degree, joined the Royal Navy in 1848. He early attracted the notice of Sir Roderick Murchison, through whom he was appointed surgeon and naturalist to the Niger expedition sent out in 1854 by Macgregor Laird with government support. The death of the senior officer (Consul Beecroft) occurring at Fernando Po, Baikie succeeded to the command. Ascending the Benue about 250 miles beyond the point reached by former explorers, the little steamer Pleiad returned and reached the mouth of the Niger, after a voyage of 118 days, without the loss of a single man. The expedition had been instructed to endeavour to afford assistance to Heinrich Barth, who had in 1851 crossed the Benue in its upper course, but Baikie was unable to gain any trustworthy information concerning him. Returning to the UK, Baikie gave an account of his work in his Narrative of an Exploring Voyage up the Rivers Kwora and Binue (1856). In March 1857, Baikie--with the rank of British consul--started on another expedition in the Pleiad. After two years exploring the Niger, the navigating vessel was wrecked passing through some of the rapids of the river, and Baikie was unable to keep his party together. The expedition survivors were not rescued from Africa for a year. The botanist, Charles Barter, who trained at Kew Gardens and was foreman of Regent's Park of the Royal Botanic Society, London from 1851–1857, caught dysentery and died at Rabba, Nigeria in 1859. He is commemorated by the genus Barteria Hook. f. in the Passifloraceae. Baikie determined to carry out the purposes of the expedition. He first considered establishing a British Consular Agency at Kabba, but faced opposition from the local king - possibly because Baikie was against the slave trade, which still provided a generous income for some tribal leaders.Orcadian explorer embarked on an African voyage of discoveryBaikie, William Balfour. Narrative of an Exploring Voyage up the Rivers Kwora and Binue (Commonly Known as the Niger and Tsadda) In 1854. John Murray: Albemarle Street, 1856. (pp. 274, 388, 390, 392)(retrieved from Google Books, 4 Feb 2010) Landing from a small boat, with one or two native followers, at the confluence of the Niger and Benue, he instead chose Lokoja as the base of his future operations, it being the site of the model farm established by the Niger expedition of 1841, and abandoned on the death of most of the white settlers (see Capt. W. Allen, R.N., and T. R. H. Thomson, M.D., A Narrative of the Expedition . . . to the River Niger in 1841, (1848)). After purchasing the site, and concluding a treaty with the Fula emir of Nupe, he proceeded to clear the ground, build houses, form enclosures and pave the way for a future city. In less than five years he had opened up the navigation of the Niger, made roads, and established a market to which the native produce was brought for sale and barter. His settlement grew to include representatives of almost all the tribes of West-Central Africa, and more than 2,000 traders visited the town in its first three years. To the motley commonwealth thus formed he acted not merely as ruler, but also as physician, teacher and priest. He collected vocabularies of nearly fifty African languages, and translated portions of the Bible and prayer-book into Hausa and Arabic. Once only during his residence had he to employ armed force against the surrounding tribes. While on his way home, on leave of absence, he died at Sierra Leone. William Balfour Baikie memorial in St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney Works Baikie's Observations on the Hausa and Fuifuide (i.e. Fula) Languages was privately printed in 1861. His translation of the Psalms into Hausa was published by the Bible Society in 1881. He was also the author of various works concerning Orkney and Shetland. Legacy The plant genus Baikiaea commemorates his name. After Baikie's death, the British government abolished the consulate (1866), but the trading post remained influential. The district where Baikie had worked so successfully was finally secured for the UK through private enterprise some 20 years later. Lokoja became the capital of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. A monument to his memory was placed in the nave of the ancient Cathedral of St Magnus, Kirkwall. The full inscription reads: > \\"William Balfour Baikie, MDRN, FRGS, FBS, FSA (Scot).

Both were produced by cutting a central plug from a Spanish dollar (8 real) coin.

Career Ellis first came to the attention of Bradford City while playing for junior club Trinity Athletic in 1978, as an amateur, before he was taken on as a non-contract player in 1980. He made his debut as a substitute on 11 April 1981 in a 3–3 draw with Wigan Athletic, before signing as a full-time professional the following month. The following season he played 18 league games as Bradford won promotion from Division Four under the guidance of Roy McFarland. McFarland soon left and was replaced by Trevor Cherry, who gave Ellis more league games each season, and he was a regular by the time City won the Division Three title in 1984–85 starting in all but two league games. On the last day of that successful season his day was to turn into a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in the Bradford City stadium fire in a game against Lincoln City. Following promotion, Ellis, nicknamed \\"Mega Star\\", came close to playing in all four divisions when City missed out on promotion to 1987–88 on the final day of the season. But the season also proved to be a personal disaster for Ellis, when his career was nearly ended just after his 26th birthday following a cruciate ligament injury in a 1–1 draw at St Andrews against Birmingham City. Ellis was out injured for more than a year and played just 11 more league games for City in two more seasons. Ellis had been known as a tricky winger who had the ability to beat opposition defenders, and was later given a testimonial match against an Everton team featuring his friend and former teammate Stuart McCall. He moved down the leagues to join Halifax Town and later played in the South African premier league for Hellenic FC in Cape Town. He then came back to England and played a few games for Guiseley scoring the winning goal against Gretna Green on his debut. Ellis then went back to South Africa and worked in the Ajax Academy coaching the u17 team. After once again returning to the UK he started work at Thomas Danby College coaching the u19 team as well as running his own coaching business in the Detroit Area of the United States during the summer. He also combined this with a part-time coaching role in the Huddesfield Town academy where he worked for over 6 years. Ellis also had a short spell bck at Bradford City coaching the under 16s with former teammate John Hendrie and also had a spell as first team coach at Guiseley FC with his former manager Terry Dolan. Ellis founded youth academy RIASA, which is co-owned by David Baldwin.

His memories of her remain lost. Until the end of the chapter Kohanamaru bids farewell to Nanao stating he was glad to see her before he left for a trip with his father, and leaves Nanao. Three years later, Kohanamaru runs into Nanao in the same fashion like the first time they met, and share an accidental kiss at the airport. They switch bodies and Nanao hugs him, happy to see him once again, he hugs her back, showing some evidence that during his absence he regained his memories of Nanao.

Heartbroken that her date left Kohanamaru, thinking it was her. Nanao instantly thought he left because he didn’t like her. Kohanamaru tried to comfort her, in his efforts they accidentally kiss. She learns that she is Kohanamaru is her destined partner, in which she likes Kohanamaru's twin brother Konatsu. It is later revealed that the reason she liked Konatsu wasn’t because of his popularity but because of an incident that occurred when she was a child. She explains that she went to the countryside and met a boy, that boy and her became friends. Nanao reminisced that she watched fireworks with him once and said they were very beautiful. She felt that boy was Konatsu when in truth it was really Kohanamaru. In volume 2, it is revealed she is in the archery club, and has a talent for it. During an archery competition Kohanamaru takes Nanao's place when they kiss again by accident. This event caused Nanao's feelings of Kohanamaru to grow. More evidence suggesting Nanao's feelings for Kohanamaru is shown after her birthday party. When she notices that something was wrong with Kohanamaru. She is more greatly affected after Kohanamaru loses all his memories of her. She then discovers how much she really did love him after his father decides that Kohanamaru will leave with him to travel around the world. At the end, a much older Nanao is seen walking through the airport. It is there she bumps into a man and accidentally kisses him, that man was Kohanamaru. She embraces him, and reminds him about the time they first met. Konatsu Taki Konatsu is Kohanamaru's twin brother. He is very popular at his school, because of his looks, athletics, and smarts. He is also the boy Nanao has a crush on. Konatsu is the only one in his family who cannot switch, but he is also the only one who can return the partners back to normal when they are unable to do it themselves. It is believed that Konatsu did not inherit the ability because of his twin brother, remaining the reason of Konatsu's jealousy towards Kohanamaru Konatsu is a part of a love triangle between Nanao and Kohanamaru, out of jealousy towards his brother for being able to switch, Konatsu tries to steal Nanao away from Kohanamaru, making him Kohanamaru's rival for Nanao's affection. Konatsu later teams up with a girl named Madoka Shishihara, after she threatens him and mentions her interest in Kohanamaru. At the end of volume 2, Nanao reveals that Konatsu for sometime had been planning to move to America and had done so. He later returns and reappears in chapter thirteen. Though Konatsu's personality appears cold and distant, he truly cares for Nanao not just to make Kohanamaru jealous, and he also cares for Kohanamaru a lot as well. Taki Family Katsura Taki - Kohanamaru and Konatsu's mother. Ichitaro Taki - The eldest son, he seems to understand a bit about their families abilities. He also dubs himself a “mama’s boy”. Koharu Taki - The only daughter of the Taki family. Koharu's destined partner is the family cat Kojiro. Minor Characters Madoka Shishihara Madoka is a character that first showed up in chapter six. She has a huge obsession with unexplained phenomena and occultism. She has a crush on Kohanamaru and stalks him as a result. She teams up with Konatsu in order to un-cover the truth behind Nanao and Kohanamaru's ability to switch bodies. By appearance in chapter ten, she also practices the art of witchcraft, when she used a voodoo doll on Kohanamaru when he was in Nanao's body. Aki Ichikawa Known as “captain Ichi” by Nanao. Aki is the captain of the Archery club, she is in the ninth grade and will soon be graduating, and she passes the title of captain onto Nanao. Akane A small girl that Kohanamaru meets in volume 3. Like Kohanamaru she comes from a family with special abilities. Akane tricks Kohanamaru into buying her sweets and taking her places. At the same time, some unusually lucky things happen. At the end of the chapter her family's secret ability is revealed, her family members before her have turned into plants; Akane then turns into a four-leaf clover, which is why all those lucky things happened to Kohanamaru. She later aids Nanao by allowing her to see Kohanamaru one last time before he leaves for his trip with his father. Kikuo Hachiya A boy who is madly in love with Nanao. Though his introduction is short, he still considers Kohanamaru his rival for Nanao's affection. Effects of Body Switching Members of the Taki family (excluding Konatsu) can switches bodies with their fated partner by touching a certain spot. However they can only remain that way until sunset; any longer than that, and the change is permanent. Konatsu the only member of the Taki family that cannot switch, is also the only person that can un-do Nanao and Kohanamaru's transformation by simply kissing either partner. This however only affects Nanao and Kohanamaru and not other members of the family. There is another method to un-do the transformations. Written in a notebook by Kohanamaru's deceased grandmother is a recipe to un-do the transformations. Ichitaro used the recipe in chapter eleven when Koharu failed to switch with Kojiro before the sun set. Another effect of the body switching is that a member of the Taki family who switches with someone who is not their destined partner, will eventually lose all memories of that person. Such is the case when Kohanamaru started to forget Nanao or anything related to her. This could probably only happen because of Nanao's feelings for Konatsu. Though it isn’t impossible to regain their lost memories, as Kohanamaru's father stated: > “True destiny is thick and strong. So if it’s real, this won’t serve it for > good. Let’s watch and see just how strong their destiny is.” External links Metamo Kiss at TOKYOPOP *Metamo Kiss at Kadokawa Shoten (Japanese) Tokyopop titles Fiction about body swapping ","title":"Metamo Kiss"},{"id":"14409649","title":"Paris Hilton discography"},{"id":"14409654","text":"Pirate Radio USA is a 2006 documentary film written and directed by Jeff Pearson, with musical director Mary Jones.

In company with Niagara, , and Trippe under command of Captain Jesse D. Elliott, she sailed into Lake St. Clair on 29 September to cut the supply lines of the British Army attempting to invade western New York.

Disposition Following the end of the war in 1815, Lady Prevost was burned and sunk by the Americans at Erie, Pennsylvania, but was raised later that year and converted into a merchantman. She was sold at public auction late in 1815.

In 1937, NC 242 was extended south as new primary routing to US 701/NC 41/NC 53, near Elizabethtown. In 1940, NC 242 was rerouted at Salemburg north to US 421, its old alignment became Odom Road (SR 1323). Around 1946, NC 242 was extended southwest as new primary routing to NC 410, in Bladenboro.

It is served with almost every meal and many different types are produced domestically. In the Swedish-speaking region of Åland, there are other varieties of bread, the majority of which owe much to Swedish cuisine. Rye bread Sour dough starter mix, the base of most Finnish rye bread Rye bread (Ruisleipä or hapanleipä (lit. sour bread) in Finnish) is a dark, sour bread produced in quantity in Finland, where it is the most popular type of bread. Compared with the more internationally popular German style, Finnish rye-breads tend to be less oily or moist in texture. The most common types of Finnish rye breads are not sweet nor do they contain spices like caraway, unlike Swedish rye breads. As well as traditional breads more modern, softer breads exist as well these days. Limppu Limppu Traditional Eastern Finnish rye bread is called limppu. The closest translation to English would be loaf, but that does not actually describe the round, bulbous bread that is actually known as limppu, and could cause confusion as rectangular loaves are also available and are not called limppu. This bread is dark, sour in taste, dense, heavy and comparatively dryish. Its mouthfeel still remains soft enough to be bitten off easily, and leavening is easily discernible even by eye. This kind of bread was usually produced at steady intervals throughout the year, whereas Western Finnish tradition stressed rare baking sessions combined with long-term storage. Limppu is common in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan due to high levels of Finnish immigration and may be found in many pubs and diners across the peninsula. Reikäleipä Reikäleipä Traditional Western Finnish rye bread (reikäleipä lit. hole bread) is dried near the kitchen ceiling and preserved over the long winter into its many forms. Nowadays this kind of bread is available in all its forms and stages of aging throughout all of Finland, regardless of season. Ruispala Vaasan Ruispala, (lit. rye piece) a brand of rye bread by Vaasan, is Finland's \\"most popular bread\\" according to the company. It is otherwise similar to reikäleipä, but is more consumer-oriented. It comes in single portion size, it mixes condensed rye bread taste with zero-day delivery, it borrows from the German rye bread tradition in keeping a more humid, greasier texture than is traditional in Finland, and it makes the best of the humidity preserving qualities of traditional rye bread by serving each piece of bread as a pre-cut pair of two halves, which protect each other but can still be easily separated. The brand is not without competitors. Two of them are Fazer's Ruispuikulat (a newer competitor), which are oblong in shape instead, and Oululainen's Reissumies (preceding Vaasa's formulation by about a decade), which are round. Both competitors are distinctly more traditional in formulation than Ruispala, mainly changing the size and shape of the traditional rye bread. As rye bread is the staple one in Finland, the competition among the brands remains fierce to this day. Jälkiuunileipä The old tradition was that all bread in the house for the year was baked in a few days, in a large oven that took a long time to cool after being fired. Thus, jälkiuunileipä (lit. \\"after-oven bread\\") could still be baked in the residual heat. The longer baking time in the lower temperature gives it a darker color, higher density and hardness than regular rye bread, comparable to a fruit cake. In addition to the traditional reikäleipä shape, there are also rectangular ruispala-type pieces available. Crispbread Crispbread (näkkileipä in Finnish) are leavened rye breads that are dried into thin crisp. They are sometimes made using sour dough. Crispbread are very common throughout the Nordic countries and if stored properly will not spoil for a long time. Variants of crisp bread are thicker (½ cm), air-containing crisps (called just näkkileipä) and thinner sour crisps (hapankorppu). The most common type, often stereotypically associated with schools and other institutions, is rectangular in shape, e.g. Koulunäkki and Kunto brands. A round shape is another variant. Hapankorppu is rectangular. Wheat bread Because traditionally wheat was not as abundant as rye or barley, wheat is mainly used for baking of pastry, scones, pulla and nowadays is often combined with other types of flour to make things like Karelian pasties and meat pies. There are a few wheat breads in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. Vesirinkeli Vesirinkeli Vesirinkeli (water ring) are small rings of yeast leavened wheat bread; which resemble bagels. They are available in several different varieties in supermarkets. Other breads There are countless varieties of breads throughout Finland and it would be impossible to catalogue them all, however there are some important types which do not fit in other areas, and they are mentioned below. Oat bread Oat rolls and kaurapala Oats (kaura) are the most commonly produced grain in Finland so it makes sense that bread based on oats will be very popular, although not as popular as rye breads. The most common use in bread is in rolls or buns (sämpylä) or in flat soft bread pieces similar to ruispalat or reissumies rye breads. Potato bread The potato, although a late introduction to Finland, features heavily in the diet and has found its way into many kinds of breads. Usually dough made with potato will be very soft and the bread will be moister and fluffier than plain wheat or oat bread. Christmas bread There are several varieties of Christmas breads, however most are made in a similar way to a basic ruislimppu bread however they typically include molasses and other Christmas time flavours like orange, cinnamon, fennel, aniseed and caraway. Korppu Korppu (rusk in English) are hard and crisp, resembling small bread rolls but usually halved and much harder. The sweet versions are often sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. There are also variations of korppu which are totally flat and unleavened, usually made of either rye or oats. The flat ones are called hapankorppu In Finland. Rieska Rye (white) and potato (brown) rieskas Savonian-style ohrarieska served with munavoi (mixture of mashed hard-boiled eggs and butter) Rieska (pronounced ['ries.ka]) is unleavened, usually barley-based, soft flat bread. They are often served warm and buttered and consumed with milk. The most simple rieskas contain only flour, salt, and water, but industrial bakeries usually use yeast as well. Rieskas are baked in the oven but they may be baked on a frying pan (like pancake) or even on a heated stone as well. The most common kinds of rieska are: *Ohrarieska (barley rieska) - by far the most common and traditional variety. *Perunarieska (potato rieska) - another common variety. The dough is made of mashed potatoes. *Ruisrieska (rye rieska) - this kind of rieska is often made without barley flour but rye instead. *Maitorieska (milk rieska) - this is a local specialty and a traditional food in the Ylivieska area of Finland. It is very similar to the plain ohrarieska, but made with milk rather than sourmilk or buttermilk. Barley rieska is a local speciality in northern parts of Finland, especially in Lapland and North Ostrobothnia, but some rieskas are manufactured by major bakery companies and therefore commonly available in grocery stores all around the country. Confectionery Pulla Pulla is a cardamom flavoured, yeast-leavened sweetened bread, often served with coffee. The usual recipe is based on milk, sugar, wheat flour, butter, with yeast and a very small amount of salt as additives, and cardamom or saffron as spices. Pulla is similar, but drier than a brioche, as eggs are not added into the dough. In contrast to other nationalities' sweetened breads, these are not buttered. Pulla, when made into a roll with cinnamon and sugar and cut into spirals before baking, becomes korvapuusti (cinnamon roll). Sokerikorppu A korppu (rusk, see above) is sweetened with sugar and spiced with cinnamon.

An “Indian Census” of 1879 shows his name as Slum.ook. Some contemporary court records show his name as Slumah or Sumah. Newspapers spelled his name in a variety of different ways. who died on the gallows in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, in 1891 was an elderly Katzie First Nations man. Baptized moments before his death he was given the first name \\"Peter\\", a name never used in his lifetime. His unmarked grave is in St. Peter's Cemetery in Sapperton.Baptism and interment records, 1891. He is remembered today because of his alleged knowledge of the location of the Pitt Lake gold deposit that is often referred to as \\"Slumach's Gold.\\"Slumach's Gold: In Search of a Legend, Rick Antonson, Mary Trainer, Brian Antonson, Heritage House, 2007. Biography Slumach entered written history in September 1890, when he shot a “half-breed” known as Louis Bee or Louie Bee at what is now known as Addington Point on the west shore of Pitt River, opposite Sturgeon Creek.BC Attorney General Inquisitions and Inquests 50/90 September 9, 1890, Louie Bee Shot by Slumach Bee and his wife Kitty may be the persons recorded in the 1881 Canada census as “Lewey, indigenous, 27 years and Kitty, indigenous, 40 years, at Cowichan.” There is no other information about Bee. Bee was shot from the shore as he was sitting in a canoe with “Seymour”,of Harrison as the records show a fellow fisherman. There were no other witnesses to the murder.Fred Braches,\\"Murder on the Pitt River,\\" The News, Maple Ridge BC, 27 April 2010. The motive of the murder had probably more to do with liquor rather than, as some have suggested, gold. Both Bee and Seymour had before done hard labour for selling liquor to First Nations people.Daily Columbian, New Westminster, BC, 26 April 1882 and Daily Colonist, Victoria, BC, 10 June 1887. Slumach eluded capture for several months but, with winter approaching, surrendered to authorities.\\"Starved Out: Slumach, the Notorious Murderer of Louis Bee, Quietly Surrendered and in Now in Jail,\\" Daily Columbian, 25 October 1890. Efforts to show that Slumach acted in self- defense failed, and so did the defence's efforts to postpone the trial until the spring, speculating that the elderly man would die in captivity of natural causes and would be spared capital punishment. Slumach was sentenced to death and he was hanged in January 1891.Bench Books 1864-1964, Vol 597, page 19 page 21-28, M.W.T. Drake, Supreme Court, New Westminster - November 1890, etc. and BC Attorney General, Inquisitions and Inquest 6/91 January 16, 1891, Slumach, an Indian Hung by the court. Contemporary newspapers reported the hanging in detail.For instance \\"Paid the Penalty: Slumach, the Murderer of Louis Bee, Pays the Penalty of his Crime,\\" Daily Columbian, 16 January 1891. The Vancouver Daily World commented: “There was much sympathy for Slumach among those who witnessed his execution. It was thought that the Government might, with just clemency, have extended a reprieve to him, for he certainly would not have lived very long in confinement, and the fact that he never ran across law and order in any shape until the latter years of his long life made many hope that he would be allowed to finish his career in the confinement of the penitentiary.”\\"Hanged at Royal City,\\" Vancouver Daily World, 16 January 1891 There may have been feelings of sympathy for the old man at the hanging, but there is only one request for clemency on file and in the time preceding his execution the newspapers and their readers seemed indifferent about Slumach's fate. Pitt Lake gold Many years after his death, stories surfaced that Slumach had discovered rich gold deposits at Pitt lake, and died without revealing the location. Pitt Lake's Lost Gold Mine and Slumach are the topic of numerous newspaper and magazine articles, transcript of most can be found on the Slumach Web site, as well as books and three television documentaries.

Founding of Accion Good Will Tour In 1958 Vice-President Richard Nixon was charged by a mob in Venezuela.New York Times. \\"New Peace Corps Head Joseph Blatchford\\" May 5, 1969. This started Blatchford, then a student at University of California, thinking about what could be done to restore the traditional friendship in the hemisphere. Blatchford's first venture in South America would be a good-will tour of the continent with four of his friends who were jazz musicians using tennis exhibitions and jam sessions as an entree into student communities. Blatchford organized the tour with Ronald K. Dunton, a trombone player, who had organized jazz groups that toured Europe and Mexico while an undergraduate at Dartmouth. Blatchford and Dunton decided to take a year off from school to organize the Latin American tour. The plan was to give afternoon tennis exhibitions and jazz concerts in the evening without admission charges that would be followed by discussions with young people. Blatchford and Dunton did not want any assistance from the government so they canvassed private companies, foundations, and individuals to raise $13,000 of the $15,000 they need for the tour. On March 19, 1959 Blatchford left on a 120-day goodwill tour covering thirteen countries with their first stop in the Dominican Republic. The other members of their tour were Michael Payson, Toshio Nagatani, Donn Dhickering, Robert Shechteman, and Juan Elac.New York Times. \\"Youths Organize a Goodwill Tour\\" by Robert Alden. November 20, 1959. \\"Playing tennis exhibitions, trying to use sports and music as a door opener, handles as they say, to get to know students, politicians, labor leaders. We came back rather critical of American foreign policy and American ways of doing things in these countries,\\" said Blatchford. \\"I saw the conditions and I saw the feeling of frustration that young people in Latin America had about not being able to forge their own futures.\\" Returning from the goodwill tour, Blatchford made the acquaintance of Eugene Burdick, author of the best seller The Ugly American (1958) that stressed the need for \\"personal\\" aid overseas. Burdick became an advisor to Accion. Burdick suggested that Blatchford obtain financial assistance from private enterprise to make a survey of the needs of various countries in Latin America. Arthur K. Watson, president of IBM, financed another trip to South American where Blatchford talked to politicians, labor leaders, and students. The US State Department arranged appointments with officials and the Institute of International Education, a private agency that administers government student exchange programs also provided assistance to Blatchford. Accion sends volunteers to South America In the fall of 1959, Blatchford started rounding up money and volunteers to serve in South America where he started Accion, six months before Sargent Shriver started the Peace Corps. The New York Times reported on March 26, 1961 that Accion was sending volunteers to Colombia in a program designed to provide technical aid to urban centers and rural communities.New York Times. \\"Student Recruits Own 'Peace Corps'\\" March 26, 1961. Blatchford said that over 400 students had applied for the program and that screening would soon begin at the University of California, Stanford University, and the University of California at Los Angeles. After selection has been completed, the group would leave for another course of three months at the University of the Andres, then break into two man teams to serve their communities. Blatchford said the cost of the program would be $125,000 for the first year with half the money already raised and that under the program each volunteer would receive baic expenses plus a stipend of about $1,100 for fifteen months of duty. Blatchford placed his first volunteers in Venezuela in September, 1961. By 1964 Venezuela became the testing ground for Accion's first major project which was to help an urban slum in Venezuela become a self-reliant community. Blatchford first recruited thirty college graduates willing to volunteer overseas. The volunteers lived with families in the barrios, improving their Spanish while familiarizing themselves with problems in the community. The volunteers helped organize projects such as laying water mains, building schools and community centers and starting small businesses. One of their most successful projects was helping a bakery organized in Isaias Medina by twenty women who wanted better and cheaper bread. By 1965 the bakery had become self-supporting. Accion also helped a construction company in the model city of San Tome de Guayana build ten houses as an experiment to increase housing and provide employment for 27 workers.New York Times. \\"Private Peace Corps, Proving Self-Help in Venezuela Leads to Self-Reliance, Moves Toward a World Operation\\" January 28, 1966. The New York Times reported on January 28, 1966 that Blatchford had been invited by business leaders in Rio de Janeiro to help organize activities in Brazil based on the Venezuelan model. The businessmen had raised $100,000 and formed a \\"Centro para Accion\\" (center for action) in the barrios to be known as CARE after its Portuguese initials. Over the next four years, Accion placed more than 1,000 volunteers and staff members on projects in four countries. Blatchford ran Accion for nine years and at one time had 300 volunteers in Latin American and an annual budget of $2 million. Charges of CIA sponsorship retracted On May 23, 1969, Washington columnists Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson charged that the CIA had partially financed Accion and that founding Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver had issued orders in 1962 to Latin American country directors not to associate with anyone from Accion because it was operating under the guidance of the CIA. Fifty Peace Corps staff members in Washington signed a statement asking Blatchford to \\"do whatever is necessary to dispel even the spectre of CIA involvement in the Peace Corps.\\" Blatchford replied that he and Accion had never had any association whatever with the CIA or any other intelligence agency and that former Peace Corps directors Sargent Shriver and Jack Vaughn had both stated that the allegation of the 1962 order for Peace Corps to avoid contact with Accion was groundless. On May 31, 1969 Pearson and Anderson admitted in their column that their charge had been in error and retracted their charge. \\"The inference was based principally on the fact that Accion, founded by new head of the Peace Corps, Joe Blatchford had received $50,000 from the Donner Foundation, a reported CIA conduit,\\" said the article. \\"We now find that there are two Donner Foundations, and that the William H. Donner Foundation, which contributed to Accion has never been a CIA conduit. We regret the error and further state that we are convinced the Peace Corps has no connection, direct or indirect, with the CIA.\\" Peace Corps Director Blatchford (right), third Director of the Peace Corps, meets with the Shah of Iran to discuss Peace Corps programs in Iran in 1970.

In May 1969 Blatchford was appointed Peace Corps director by President Richard Nixon. At Blatchford's confirmation hearings he was questioned closely on his partisan political ambitions but there was no challenge to his qualifications for the post of Peace Corps Director. Blatchford was sworn in on May 5, 1969. \\"Joe Blatchford, throughout his private career, has had a tremendous interest in this kind of activity, particularly in Latin America,\\" said President Nixon at the swearing in ceremony. \\"I am very privileged to have him as a member of the administration in this vitally important function. He has the responsibility, despite his very young years, to come up with new ideas. He has the opportunity to develop new programs and those programs will receive the very highest priority within the administration.\\"\\"Remarks at the swearing in of Joseph H. Blatchford as Director of the Peace Corps by President Richard Nixon\\" May 5, 1969. Serving in the Nixon administration Blatchford was an unusual Nixon appointee. He \\"lives in Georgetown among Democrats instead of at the Watergate with Administration Republicans\\" said a profile in the Peace Corps Volunteer magazine in June 1970. \\"He rides a motorcycle, does impersonations of famous people and has a great nostalgia for San Francisco and its \\"beat\\" period. The three most prominent hangings on his office walls are: a photograph of his swearing-in by President Richard Nixon; a copy of the earth-rising. over-moon picture taken by the Crew of Apollo 8 in 1968; and a psychedelic poster of Bob Dylan. A unique office, but one gets the impression he would rather be out in the field.\\" News photographs showed Blatchford riding a black 180cc Yamaha motorcycle into the lobby of Peace Corps headquarters just a few blocks from the White House.The Peace Corps Experience: Challenge and Change, 1969-1976 by P. David Searles. University of Kentucky Press. 1997. Blatchford had the confidence and support of President Nixon as Peace Corps Director. \\"I was appointed by the President, and serve at the pleasure of the President. But he has given me a free hand to develop the ideas for making the Peace Corps a vital and exciting means of carrying out its original mission in the 1970's,\\" said Blatchford in 1970. \\"He has given me plenty of backing on this: He has met with all our county directors, He met the other day with members of our national advisory group, some of our staff. He's spent a good deal of time with us emphasizing the importance of the Peace Corps, and he's particularly emphasized the importance of having returned Volunteers go to work on the problems of American society. In much of the criticism we've received from members of Congress, he's backed me up.\\" Blatchford used his athletic ability to help forge a working relationship with senior officials in the administration. On May 19, 1970 Blatchford was invited to play tennis with Vice President Spiro Agnew. Agnew was known for \\"beaning\\" his tennis partner but Blatchford came prepared with a motorcycle helmet on the sidelines. As Blatchford crouched close to the net, an Agnew serve, with all its sting, landed \\"smack on the back of his head.\\" Blatchford and Agnew lost 6-1, 6-1 to Senator Javits of New York and Representative Weicker of Connecticut.New York Times. \\"The Veep at Play\\" May 24, 1970. According to a May 1989 Washington Post story by Marci McDonald, the incident prompted Nixon to joke that he should send Agnew into then-war-torn Cambodia armed with a tennis racket.ESPN. \\"Ford: Tennis enthusiast while in White House\\" by Bonnie DeSimone. January 8, 2007. l \\"Untying some Apron Strings\\" Blatchford immediately set about making changes in Volunteer support services, eliminating some, changing others, and consolidating other services. In a memo to Country Directors Blatchford said \\"The decisions reached affect a number of services to the Volunteers which in actuality are restrictions on the Volunteers' freedom to manage their own affairs. The decisions are in keeping with the philosophy that we will eliminate all activities which do not directly promote the Volunteers' ability to satisfy their responsibility to the best counbies.\\" Among the services eliminated were Peace Corps booklockers, the pre-service clothing allowance, and payment for unaccompanied air freight and footlockers. Blatchford also eliminated the requirement that volunteers could not return to the United States during their Peace Corps service for vacations. \\"In principle, the Peace Corps still believes that it is to the Volunteer's advantage, and the advantage of the relationship he must maintain with his host country workers, to vacation within his assigned country or region. At the same time, the restriction on travel to countries such as the US and Europe is undesirable because it discourages Volunteers from assuming full responsibility for important personal decisions relating to Peace Corps service,\\" said the new policy. New directions Blatchford believed that it was time for the Peace Corps to chart a new course called \\"New Directions.\\"New York Times. \\"Decade-Old Peace Corps Charting a New Course\\" by William Borders. November 20, 1970.] Blatchford said the purpose of \\"new directions\\" was to revitalize the Peace Corps by reversing declining trends in both the number of applicants applying to serve as volunteers and the number of requests from host countries for volunteers. \\"College students know our selection process is slow and impersonal and that we sometimes fail to find solid jobs for our volunteers,\\" Blatchford said. Blatchford's first priority was to broaden the pool of people joining the Peace Corps. \\"What's news is that farmers are going to join the Peace Corps, That's different from the public image of the Peace Corps Volunteer as a young liberal arts graduate right out of college,\\" said Blatchford. \\"When I went overseas, I constantly heard the cry from governments, people of all stripes—villagers, village leaders, school teachers and people who worked with the Peace Corps or were in charge of programming them—that, we need a wide diversity of skills.\\" The New York Times reported on September 23, 1969 at Blatchford's first press conference that the Peace Corps intended to recruit 500 union craftsmen, farmers, and vocational educational specialists.New York Times. \\"Plans Detailed by Peace Corps\\" September 23, 1969. Blatchford also wanted to increase minority recruitment. \\"Applications from black colleges are up 70 percent this year. That sounds good. But in absolute numbers, what is it 1 percent to 1.7 percent. That's still not good enough, so we've just set up a special office of minority recruitment,\\" said Blatchford. \\"We have two intern programs now with Shaw and Atlanta, and last fall we did send the first all black group of Volunteers to Kenya, This is the way of the future, Only we've got to put more effort into it. If we do, I think we can recruit 1000 black Volunteers every year. I think we ought to.\\" At Blatchford's first press conference he said that he would move more vigoursly to recruit minorities. College students \\"suspect the Peace Corps is almost lily-white and they are right,\\" Blatchford said. Blatchford also opened the Peace Corps to married couples with children. In his first press conference held on September 23, 1969 Blatchford outlined his plans to place 200 families overseas in a pilot project to attract married technicians. Families had not been permitted to serve overseas previously. \\"For some people the urge to serve may come again at age 30 or 40 and they have children. We will adjust the living allowance so they can serve,\\" said Blatchford, speaking about blue-collar workers with grown children who previously could not serve in the Peace Corps.New York Times. \\"New Peace Corps Head, in Kenya, Tells of Plans\\" May 14, 1969. C. Payne Lucas and Kevin Lowther in their seminal book about the Peace Corps from 1960 to 1977, Keeping Kennedy's Promise, noted that although Blatchford said the Peace Corps could only survive by providing more technically skilled volunteers, the great majority of programs continued to be designed around generalists. \\"Those overseas directors who took New Directions seriously should have spared themselves the trouble. Although Blatchford succeeded in attracting marginally more technically trained people, they were never enough to greatly alter the Peace Corps profile or to fulfill the expectations that New Directions aroused abroad.\\"Keeping Kennedy's Promise by C. Payne Lucas and Kevin Lowther. Peace Corps Press. 1977. Vietnam protests Protests against the Vietnam war continued to affect the Peace Corps under Blatchford's administration just as it had under his predecessor, Jack Vaughn. On March 12, 1970 the New York Times disclosed that twelve volunteers had been separated from the Peace Corps because of their public opposition to the Vietnam war. Blatchford reiterated that the Peace Corps would continue its policy of permitting dissent but not if it was done publicly in the host country. \\"The volunteer can express his dissent,\\" said Blatchford. \\"But he cannot exploit his position.\\"New York Times. \\"Peace Corps Dismisses 12 for Public War Criticism\\" March 12, 1970. Meanwhile, Peace Corps volunteers who had completed their service joined protesters of the Vietnam war in the United States. In May, 1970 more than 100,000 protesters converged on Washington to protest the Kent State shootings and the Nixon administrations incursion into Cambodia. One afternoon a group of returned volunteers came into Peace Corps headquarters and went to the fourth floor which was the Southeast Asia section of the Peace Corps. The returned volunteers, members of an organization called the \\"Committee of Returned Volunteers,\\" forced staff to leave the floor, hung a Viet Cong flag from a window almost within sight of the White House, and took possession of the entire floor for 36 hours. TomRoeser.com \\"The Anti-War Mobilization Hits a Crest in Washington as Insurgents Take Over the Peace Corps Building—May, 1970.\\" April 13, 2007 The New York Times reported on June 3, 1970 that Blatchford received petitions protesting the war signed by hundreds of volunteers serving in South Korea, Panama, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala. In a two-hour meeting in Blatchford's office, dissenting volunteers told Blatchford that \\"the war is apparently being expanded, that this is hurting the Peace Corps and that he should do something to reflect the point of view of the many volunteers who oppose the war.\\" A Peace Corps spokesman said that Blatchford told the volunteers that he approved of their form of protest and promised to refer their petitions to the White House. The petition stated that \\"the President's verbal endorsement of the accomplishments and ideals for the Peace Corps is a hypocritical use of this organization. The government is using us as apologists for policies that run counter to the reasons for our service and the original reasons for the agency's existence.\\"New York Times. \\"Peace Corps Group Petitions for Peace\\" June 4, 1970. Blatchford just like Director Vaughn before him believed that volunteers had every right to protest through the media at home as long as they did not publicly identify themselves with political issues in their host countries. But Blatchford came under intense pressure from above after volunteers submitted an anti-war petition to Vice President Spiro Agnew while Agnew was on an official visit to Afghanistan. Blatchford sent a private memorandum to Republican members in Congress explaining that he had \\"inherited a very difficult situation resulting from Volunteers just out of college with strong, liberal views. We have also had to weed out many members of a hostile staff hired during the past eight years of Democratic administration and unwilling to accept a new administration.\\" Blatchford promised that within a year all volunteers \\"will have been selected by this administration\\" and will have \\"better screening.\\" Action Director Blatchford (bottom right), third Director of the Peace Corps, meets with Peace Corps Volunteers in Tunisia. On January 14, 1971 Nixon made a speech at the University of Nebraska proposing to establish a new \\"volunteer service corps\\" agency in Washington combining the operations of the Peace Corps, VISTA, and other existing volunteer agencies. Nixon also said he would ask Blatchford, \\"one of the ablest young men I have ever known,\\" to head the new organization. Nixon said in his speech that the merger would give young Americans \\"an expanded opportunity for the service they want to give - and it will give them what they not now have offered them - a chance to transfer between service abroad and service at home.\\" In a special memo to staff members and volunteers, Blatchford praised Nixon's announcement as \\"another step in the effort to bring the American citizen into the solution of public problems through long-term service.\\" Merger of Peace Corps into Action On March 24, 1971 Nixon officially requested Congress to act on the plan for merging nine volunteer programs: the Peace Corps; VISTA and a small special program from the Office of Economic Opportunity; Foster Grandparents and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; and the Service Corps of Retired Executives and the Active Corps of Executives from the Small Business Administration. In addition, the Teacher Corps in the Office of Education was also proposed for inclusion but was not included in the first phase of the reorganization plan. The new agency would centralize management of 15,000 full-time and 10,000 part-time volunteers into a new agency with a budget of $176 million, equal to the budgets of the nine present agencies plus $20 million for innovation. Formally the new agency was called \\"Action\\" but officials insisted it would be called \\"Action Corps.\\" The reorganization would take place automatically unless either house of Congress objected within 60 legislative days. In a special message to Congress, Nixon called for still larger future efforts. \\"America must enlist the ideals, the energy, the experience and the skills of its people on a larger scale than it ever has in the past.\\"New York Times. \\"Nixon Submits Plan to Merge 9 Volunteer Programs\\" by Jack Rosenthal. March 24, 1971. Blatchford endorsed the new agency unwilling to question any plan of President Nixon who Blatchford thought supported the Peace Corps. Blatchford believed that combining the Peace Corps with domestic programs like VISTA might shield it from critics of foreign aid by adding VISTA supporters to its constituency. The Peace Corps was isolated and vulnerable and Blatchford thought the Peace Corps \\"would survive better under Action.\\" On June 3, 1971 the Senate gave final congressional approval to Action by a vote of 54 to 29.New York Times. \\"Merger for VISTA Cleared in Senate\\" June 3, 1971. Opposition to the merger was led by liberal Democrats who thought the reorganization would diminish volunteer interest in the various programs and permit the Administration to dismantle VISTA which had been under the Office of Economic Opportunity. On November 20, 1971 the Senate confirmed Blatchford as Director of Action.New York Times. \\"Senate Confirms Blatchford\\" November 21, 1971. Budget crisis at the Peace Corps Historian Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman, in her book All You Need is Love: The Peace Corps and the Spirit of the 1960s, says that Nixon had decided to dismantle the Peace Corps. In July 1970, Nixon instructed Bob Haldeman to get Bryce Harlow on the job of getting the Peace Corps \\"chopped per the president's instructions\\" adding that \\"this has to be done and has to be done now...We can't do it just before the '72 elections and we have to do it after November 1970.\\" Haldeman told subordinates to cut the budget by one-third and noted in his diary that the president wanted the budget cut \\"down far enough to decimate them.\\"All You Need is Love: The Peace Corps and the Spirit of the 1960s by Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman. Harvard University Press. 2000. Two months after the November 1970 elections the plan went into action. Blatchford received the proposed federal budget for FY72 and to his surprise, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had cut the number of Peace Corps volunteers from 9,000 to 5,800 and reduced the Peace Corps' budget from $90 million to $60 million. Blatchford dashed off a memo to John Ehrlichman, special assistant to the President on domestic affairs pleading for preservation of the Peace Corps at its current budget level. \\"It will be quite evident to most Congressmen and to the public that the president's expansion of service opportunities has begun with a 30 percent cut over last year's request for the largest of the merged agencies,\\" wrote Blatchford. Congress had its own plan to cut the Peace Corps' budget. On December 17, 1971 Congress passed a continuing resolution slashing Blatchford's $82 million operating budget by $10 million.New York Times. \\"Peace Corps: Why Are They Picking On Us?\\" January 9, 1972. \\"Our whole budget doesn't amount to half the price of a submarine,\\" said Blatchford. \\"Those characters over at the Defense Department are rolling in dough. They round off their cost estimates to the nearest Peace Corps budget.\\" Blatchford ordered a temporary halt to signing up new volunteers although applications continued to be accepted. Then Blatchford ordered that plans be drawn up for the termination of half of the 8,000 volunteers in the field. The plans would be implemented if Congress failed to restore the Peace Corps' funds. \\"There is a point of no return when we must use the money we have to bring these people back to the United States,\\" said one Peace Corps official.New York Times. \\"Peace Corps, Short of Funds, Plans to Halve Force of 8,000\\" January 5, 1972. It was time for Blatchford to play hardball. Blatchford announced that 2,313 volunteers stationed in thirty-three countries were being brought home. Blatchford cleared the diplomatic cables with the State Department and arranged to send them one minute past midnight on March 7, 1972 for volunteers to return home by April 1, 1972. The removal of Peace Corps volunteers would be an international embarrassment to the United States of enormous proportions. Congressman Otto Passman, a longtime opponent of the Peace Corps, called Blatchford on March 7, the day the cables were to go out, and offered the Peace Corps extra funds if Blatchford would take the heat off. Passman also told Blatchford that the Peace Corps didn't have as many friends in the White House as he thought. According to Historian Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman, Blatchford never suspected that his problems came from the White House and remained convinced that President Nixon was a friend of the Peace Corps. P. David Searles in his book The Peace Corps Experience: Challenge and Change, 1969-1976 says that Blatchford's own assessment of Nixon's support 25 years later is that President Nixon did lose some of his early enthusiasm for the Peace Corps as a result of what Nixon thought of as widespread hostility to the President from Peace Corps Volunteers. However Baltchford also contends that Nixon originally gave more support to the Peace Corps than any President other than Kennedy. Blatchford also credits Republicans in the Senate like Barry Goldwater and Charles Percy for supporting the Peace Corps when Democrat William Fulbright tried to cut the Peace Corps' budget in 1969. Blatchford did sense hostility to the Peace Corps from some of the president's advisors, especially Ehrlichman and Patrick Buchanan, but says it did not hamper his work. Five year rule On November 15, 1971 the New York Times reported that Blatchford had made the decision to rigoursly enforce a 1965 rule that staff and volunteer service in the Peace Corps be limited to five years. About 10 per cent of the total Peace Corps administrative staff including 27 of the 55 country directors were affected by the decision. A total of 93 of the Peace Corps' senior staff will be dismissed as a result of the rule.New York Times. \\"93 in Peace Corps Facing Dismissal\\" by Terence Smith. November 15, 1971. In a memorandum announcing his decision, Blatchford called on staff members with over five years service to \\"relinquish their position so that others may serve.\\" \\"Only in the rarest instances involving senior policymakers who cannot be readily replaced, will there be any deviation from a strict adherence to the spirit of the five-year rule.\\" The move came under criticism from Sargent Shriver, the founding Director of the Peace Corps and originator of the \\"Five Year Rule.\\" \\"The rule should have been enforced across the board from the start,\\" said Shriver. \\"To do it abruptly now is going to create major problems overseas. It's one hell of a job to find 27 competent overseas directors in the course of six months, and these people are the core of the program. Historian Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman in her book All You Need is Love: The Peace Corps and the Spirit of the 1960s says that if the Peace Corps hoped to survive beyond the sixties, it would need to give Republicans a greater stake in its survival. \\"Republicans had to be allowed the spoils of the election - and the Peace Corps, like it or not, was one of them,\\" says Cobbs Hoffman. \\"Shriver and Vaughn, after all, had filled the Corps with Democrats. Still, Blatchford showed a restraint that earned him a few points with old Peace corps staff by agreeing to take on those Republicans with demonstrateble qualifications for the job. Blatchford enforced the five-year rule to a greater extent than Vaughn, but when key staff resigned or had their terms expire he also promoted from within.\\" P. David Searles in his book The Peace Corps Experience: Challenge and Change, 1969-1976 says that the five-year rule required that all staff members leave the Peace Corps not later than the fifth anniversary on the date they were hired and even Shriver observed this rule when he stepped down as the first Peace Corps director on March 1, 1966, five years after becoming director to the day. Searles said that Blatchford saw the five-year rule as one way to help assemble his own team, just as Jack Vaughn had done when he became director in 1966. \\"The loudest and most outraged of political partisanship came in 1971 when Blatchford used an important Peace Corps policy, generally ignored by his predecessor, to terminate nearly one hundred staff members, including twenty-seven country directors. The rule was instituted to ensure that the agency would never suffer the fate of other government bureaucracies: premature calcification resulting from an aged and spent permanent staff.\\" Author P. David Searles says that Shriver's concerns about finding \\"competent overseas directors\\" proved groundless. Resignation Blatchford's remaining tenure as Action Director was uneventful; except for one unusual opportunity to present the Peace Corps through mass media to the American people that occurred on February 16, 1972, Blatchford appeared on the Mike Douglas Show to talk about the Peace Corps while the show was being guest hosted with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.LA Weekly. \\"Marx and Duchamp for Beginners\\" by Michael Simmons. July 22, 1988. Another guest on the same show with Blatchford was one of Lennon's idols, Chuck Berry, who dueted with Lennon on Berry's big hit \\"Memphis Tennessee\\" during the two hour program.WFMU. \\"A Week Imagined\\" After Nixon's overwhelming victory in the Presidential election in November 1972, Nixon called for the resignation of all his appointees. Blatchford recalls telling a colleague at a meeting where the resignations were demanded, \\"But I thought we won.\\" Whether Blatchford would have been re-appointed at Director of Action will never be known because Blatchford accompanied his pro forma resignation with a real one. Blatchford was an enigma in the Nixon administration, a Republican who held ideas that seemed liberal. He had resisted pressure to bust heads when the Committee of Returned Volunteers had occupied Peace Corps Headquarters in 1969 and Nixon's Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman considered Blatchford \\"soft\\" in dealing with dissent. Whatever the outcome, Blatchford had taken himself out of the running and on November 21, 1972 Blatchford announced that he was resigning as head of the Action Corps effective December 31, 1972. A source added that Blatchford had been urged by a number of people to enter the Los Angeles mayoral race.New York Times. \\"Action Director Reported Planning to Resign Dec. 31\\" November 22, 1972. Post governmental career In 1974, Blatchford helped Republican Houston Flournoy campaign for Governor of California.Time Magazine. \\"200 Faces for the Future\\" July 15, 1974. In 1974 Blatchford also looked into the California Senate race but found that money to promote a young candidate was unavailable. \\"Nobody tended to think the Republicans could win this year, even before Watergate,\\" said Blatchford. \\"We've had a Republican administration in the state for eight years, the Nixon Administration in Washington for six. So the tide is going the other way anyway. Watergate is an add-on, another reason to be discouraged.\\"New York Times. \\"Big Republican Names Avoiding Election Contests in California\\" by Christopher Lydon. May 31, 1974. In 1977 Blatchford founded his private law practice, Summit Communications, in the field of international trade. Blatchford has represented \\"flower growers in Costa Rica, cement and toy balloon producers in Mexico, leather handbag exporters in Colombia, school ring binder makers in Singapore, and petrochemicals firms in Argentina.\\"Summit Communications. \\"Background\\" Blatchford is also the co- founder of Caribbean/Latin American Action, a business advocacy group.

Treaster. December 4, 1978. In 1989 Blatchford was the principal lawyer for his firm representing Alfredo Cristiani, the President of El Salvador. Before Blatchford agreed to represent Cristiani, Blatchford assured himself that the President was not associated with any death squad activity that had been imputed to Cristiani's political party, Arena. Blatchford lobbied against a Senate effort to reduce some of the $400 million in annual aid to El Salvador because of the slaying of six priests in El Salvador. \\"I'm confident I was representing a good group of people,\\" said Blatchford.New York Times. \\"Law: Firm's Foreign Ties Could Cost It a Big Client\\" by Neil A.

Medical uses In Japan, ibudilast oral capsules are approved for the treatment of asthma, and for improvement of dizziness secondary to chronic cerebral circulation impairment associated with sequelae of cerebral infarction. Ibudilast ophthalmic solution is indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and hay fever. It may have some use reducing methamphetamine, opioid, and alcohol addiction. Pharmacology Ibudilast has bronchodilator, vasodilator and neuroprotective effects, and is mainly used in the treatment of asthma and stroke. It inhibits platelet aggregation, and may also be useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Ibudilast crosses the blood–brain barrier and suppresses glial cell activation. This activity has been shown to make ibudilast useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain and it not only enhances analgesia produced by opioid drugs, but also reduces the development of tolerance. Pharmacodynamics Ibudilast is principally a PDE4 inhibitor but has also been shown to act as an antagonist at the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This likely plays a large part in its effect, specifically its synergy with opioid drugs, its anti-inflammatory effect, and its own painkilling effect. It is unknown if the PDE4-inhibiting properties potentiate the effects of TLR4 inactivation and/or vice versa, despite that some of their effects are shared, such as inflammation reducing properties. TLR4 antagonists theoretically reverse the increase in pain and inflammation caused by most TLR4 agonists, which includes alcohol & many opiate or opioid drugs.

A longtime mainstay of Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling during the 1960s and early 70s, he engaged in memorable feuds with Sweet Daddy Siki and The Stomper over the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship. He was also a close associate of promoter Stu Hart and remained his top booker for much of his time in Stampede Wrestling.McCoy, Heath. Pain and Passion: The History of Stampede Wrestling. Toronto: CanWest Books, 2005. Career Born in Watts, Alberta, Ruhl was living in nearby Hanna as a cattle grain farmer when he was encouraged to pursue a career in professional wrestling during the mid-1940s. Making his debut in 1946, he appeared with many later Stampede Wrestling veterans while in Stu Hart's Klondike Wrestling during the late 1940s. By 1951, he began wrestling full- time and eventually defeated Al \\"Mr. Murder\\" Mills for the vacant NWA Canadian Championship in Calgary, Alberta on November 13, 1959 (although other sources claim Ruhl won the title in 1955). Continuing to tour North America with the National Wrestling Alliance during the next ten years, including the Arizona and Texas territories as the masked wrestler The Hooded Wasp, he would later win the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship a record six times defeating Sweet Daddy Siki, The Beast, Stan Stasiak, Danny Lynch and Abdullah the Butcher respectively. He would be the last NWA Canadian Heavyweight Champion, holding the title until being forced to surrender the championship due to injury in 1972. Facing Gene Kiniski in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Calgary on July 12, 1967, Ruhl eventually began competing for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion during the late 1960s winning the Stampede North American Championship twice between 1969 and 1970 defeating The Stomper and Abdullah the Butcher respectively. Touring Japan in 1969 and again in 1972, he briefly held the Stampede International Tag Team Championship with Tiger Joe Tomasso in May 1972 although they lost the titles back to Chin Lee & Sugi Sito later that month. Suffering a career-ending injury in 1974 as a result of a head injury sustained in a fight with Carlos Colon, Ruhl retired to farm with his brother Henry and eventually died in Medicine Hat, Alberta on December 21, 1988.

A diagnosis of CUP requires a clinical picture consistent with metastatic disease and one or more biopsy results inconsistent with a tumor cancer CUP is found in about 3 to 5% of all people diagnosed with invasive cancer, and carries a poor prognosis in most (80 to 85%) of those circumstances. The other 15 to 20% of patients, however, have a relatively long survival with appropriate treatment. Signs and symptoms Most cancers typically present as a single primary tumor. Over the course of time—particularly if the primary tumor is left untreated—smaller \\"satellite\\" tumors will appear at other places in the body, a phenomenon known as metastasis. Less commonly, a metastatic tumor is found first; but in most such cases, the primary tumor can then be located via examination and testing. Rarely (3-5% of the time), the primary tumor cannot be found because it is too small, or because it has regressed due to immune system activity or other factors. In such situations a diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary origin (CUP) is made. CUP usually comes to attention because of masses or swellings found somewhere in the body, either by physical examination or on medical imaging performed for another indication. The disease typically develops rapidly, and metastases may occur in places in the body that are otherwise unusual. Comprehensive physical examination is part of the process to identify a possible primary source of cancer; this should include the breasts, lymph nodes, the skin, external genitals, as well as an internal examination of the rectum and of the pelvic organs. The location of metastases may be a clue as to the underlying source, even if this cannot be found on investigations. For instance, a woman in whom there is axillary lymphadenopathy (swelling in the lymph nodes of the armpit) it is likely that the cancer originated in the breast, and men with lymph node deposits in the mediastinum of the chest and/or retroperitoneal space of the abdomen may have a germ cell tumor. Mechanism Cancer of unknown primary source is not a single type of cancer, although researchers have attempted to find a common characteristic that explains why a cancer might spread very early without causing symptoms at the site of origin. It is generally accepted that cancer of unknown primary site exists because the primary tumor is not identified due to clinical or technological inefficiencies, or because the primary tumor regresses or stays dormant after spreading the cancer cells that generate the metastases. This view is widely accepted in oncology; in fact, these cancers are also referred to as occult primary tumors. Because the site of the primary tumor usually dictates the treatment and expected outcome, this view may help create uncertainty and anxiety among health professionals and patients, who may feel that their evaluation has been incomplete. Because stem cells have a natural ability to migrate and also play a key role in cancer development, it has been proposed that a cancer of unknown primary site may form when deregulated, premalignant or cancerous stem cells migrate away from their natural tissue and give rise to a cancer in the new site before or without generating a tumor in their original tissue. Forming a tumor in a tissue is not a prerequisite for stem cells to move away from that tissue. Stem cells can migrate from their natural tissue and initiate a cancer in the new site before generating a detectable tumor in their natural tissue. In this case, the primary tumor could be identified after some time. However, stem cells can also migrate away from their natural tissue without generating a cancer there. In this case, the “primary tumor” would never exist (see Figure). This can explain why the primary site is not identified even on postmortem examination in many patients with these cancers. This view of CUP may provide relief to health professionals and patients. After a detailed imaging and pathologic analysis, oncologists can tell their patients with CUP that metastasis does not always involve the formation of a primary tumor, and that their diagnostic evaluation is complete. Diagnosis In recent years, microscopic and other diagnostic techniques have improved dramatically. However, the tissue of origin can be still determined only about in one in four cases of CUPs with these methods. In some cases, the part of the body where cancer cells are first discovered helps the doctor decide which diagnostic tests will be most helpful. Additional clues which may be helpful in determining the primary site include the pattern of spread, and the cell type, which is based on its appearance under a microscope (histology). The initial work-up of a cancer of unknown primary includes a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with IV contrast. Women with enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) confined to the axillary region with CUP should have a mammogram or ultrasound to evaluate for possible breast cancer. If those imaging studies are normal, then an MRI of the breast may be appropriate. A PET CT scan should be done for squamous cell carcinoma involving lymph nodes of the neck region. For other types of cancer of unknown primary, a PET-CT offers uncertain benefit. The pattern of spread may suggest the location of the primary site. For example, metastatic cancer found in the upper body is more likely to have an origin above the diaphragm, at sites such as the lung and breast. If the metastatic cancer appears first in the lower part of the body, the primary cancer is more likely to be at sites below the diaphragm, such as the pancreas and liver. When the cancer cells are poorly differentiated (that is, they look less evolved than normal cells when viewed under a microscope), the cancer may be either a lymphoma or a germ cell tumor. Lymphomas begin in the lymphatic system. Germ cell tumors usually begin in the ovaries and testes. In patients in whom the primary cancer is eventually found, the lung and pancreas are the most common primary cancer sites. CUP also may be traced to the breast, prostate, colon, or rectum as the primary site. Sometimes, however, even when doctors use very sophisticated methods to try to identify the primary site, the part of the body the cancer cells came from cannot be determined. About 2 to 4 percent of all cancer patients have a cancer whose primary site is never found. Identifying the primary tumor site is important because knowing its location and type often helps doctors plan the best treatment. Treatment that is specific to the suspected type of cancer is likely to be more effective. Still, when diagnostic tests have not identified the primary site, doctors must decide whether the potential benefits of more extensive testing outweigh a patient's discomfort, possible complications, and the financial costs. Immunohistochemical testing  Antibodies may be used to determine the expression of protein markers on the surface of cancer cells. Often the expression of these antigens is similar to the tissue that the cancer grew from, so immunohistochemical testing sometimes helps to identify the source of the cancer. Individual tests often do not provide definitive answers, but sometimes patterns may be observed, suggesting a particular site of origin (e.g. lung, colon, etc.). Immunohistochemical testing suggests a single source of cancer origin in about one in four cases of CUP. However, there is a lack of definitive research data showing that treatment guided by information from immunohistochemical testing improves outcomes or long-term prognosis. Classification CUP may be classified by its appearance under a light microscope. The majority of cancers of unknown primary, about 90%, are adenocarcinomas, with 60% appearing as moderately to well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, while about 30% are poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The term adenocarcinoma refers to cancer that begins in the cells in glandular structures in the lining or covering of certain organs in the body. Common primary sites for adenocarcinomas include the lung, pancreas, breast, prostate, stomach, liver, and colon. The remaining 10 percent are either poorly or undifferentiated malignant neoplasms (5%), or squamous cell carcinomas (5%). Rarely, CUP may appear as neuroendocrine tumors, or mixed tumors, such as sarcomatoid, basaloid, or adenosquamous carcinomas. Management Because CUP refers to many different cancers, treatment depends on where the cancer is found, the microscopic appearance of the cancer cells, the biochemical characterization of the cells, and the patient's age and overall physical condition. In women, who present with axillary lymph node involvement, treatment is offered along the lines of breast cancer. In patients, who have neck lymph node involvement, then treatment is offered along the lines of head and neck cancer. If inguinal lymph nodes are involved, then treatment may be offered along the lines of genitourinary cancer. If the site of origin is unknown or undiscovered, then the histology of the tumor (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell or mesenchymal) can usually be identified, and a probable origin may be assumed. When this is possible, then treatment is based on the type of cell and probable origin. Based on histological subtype, combination chemotherapy may be selected. A combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is often used. Advances techniques such as FISH and tissue of origin testing may also be employed. Germ cell tumors often carry abnormality of chromosome 12, which if identified, directs treatment for metastatic germ cell tumors. No method is standard for all forms of CUP, but chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and surgery may be used alone or in combination to treat patients who have CUP. Even when the cancer is unlikely to be cured, treatment may help the patient live longer or improve the patient's quality of life. Radiation may be used to shrink a variety of local tumors. However, the potential side effects of the treatment must be considered along with the potential benefits. In CUP to secondary neck nodes, surgery followed by external beam radiotherapy is sufficient. For CUP with an unfavorable prognosis, treatment with taxanes may provide a slight survival benefit. The uncertainties and ambiguity inherent in a CUP diagnosis may cause additional stress for the patient. Prognosis Most people with cancer of unknown primary origin have widely disseminated and incurable disease, although a few can be cured through treatment. With treatment, typical survival with CUP ranges from 6 to 16 months. Survival rates are lower in cases with visceral metastatic disease, ranging from 6 to 9 months. Survival rates are higher when the cancer is more limited to lymph nodes, pleura, or peritoneal metastasis, which ranges from 14 to 16 months. Long-term prognosis is somewhat better if a particular source of cancer is strongly suggested by clinical evidence.  Epidemiology  CUP sometimes runs in families. It has been associated with familial lung, kidney, and colorectal cancers, which suggests that these sites may often be the origin of unidentifiable CUP cancers. UK Around 9,800 people were diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary in the UK in 2011, and around 10,625 people died from the disease in 2012.  History  From 1980 to 1990, definition of unknown primary cancer was based on imaging results. Subsequently, research on immunohistochemistry allowed for the classification of cancer of unknown primary into sub-types. From 2000 to 2010, tailored therapies began to evolve, targeting specific subtypes of unknown primary.

After the conclusion of the South African War, Blignaut served as member of both the legislative council and the Legislative Assembly of the Orange River Colony. He was also a member of several state commissions.This article is predominantly based on the information derived from and sources mentioned there. Biography Family Blignaut was a member from an old Cape family, the son of Johannes Jeremias Cornelis Blignaut and Johanna Emerentia de Villiers. He was named after his grandfather Pieter Jeremias Blignaut, a burgher of Stellenbosch, who married 25 October 1801 with Maria Dorothea de Villiers. Blignaut himself was married twice, first with Caroline Erskine (1850 - 11 February 1883), and after her death with Ms. C.J. Steyn, sister of President Steyn. From his two marriages Blignaut had six children. Early life and career Blignaut went to the State School in his birthplace Paarl, where he subsequently attended the Gymnasium (Grammar School). After his exams Blignaut went to Cape Town, where he joined the colonial administration. In 1861 he passed the examination for the State Service Certificate of the Cape Colony and in 1862 he moved to the Orange Free State. Here he was appointed to the position of clerk to the Landdrost and Justice of the Peace of Philippolis (17 September 1862). At the time, civil, judicial, and military administration were still very much in the same hand. In view of Basotho threats, President Brand ordered the reorganisation of the Orange Free State defence, and the formulation of clear regulations for the different Volunteer Corps, which were administered by the Landdrosts' offices. For Philippolis Blignaut and J.G. Fraser attended the conference. Blignaut held the position of clerk for four years, from 12 January 1865 working in that position in Fauresmith. Here he was promoted to Landdrost on 25 October 1866 and another four years later, on 28 September 1870 he was transferred to Kroonstad in the same position. Government Secretary P.J. Blignaut, 1890s When Government Secretary Höhne died in April 1879, Blignaut was asked to fill the position and was appointed as such by the State President on 20 May.Muller, Hendrik P.N., Oude tyden in den Oranje-Vrystaat. Naar Mr. H.A.L. Hamelberg's nagelaten papieren beschreven. Leiden: E.J. Brill 1907. 258. Blignaut held the position of Government Secretary for twenty-one years, first through a period of growing economic prosperity for the country, and then through the South African War (Second Boer War). In both periods Blignaut showed himself an efficient and dedicated civil servant, with a keen eye for both home and foreign affairs. Already in 1880 Blignaut was entrusted with the difficult task of mediating between the British and the Transvaal. In later years Blignaut was regularly charged with difficult tasks. Blignaut had a sociable and open personality, which made him popular with both the burghers of the Orange Free State and the civil servants, who showed their high regard at his 30-year jubilee, in 1892. Blignaut also had the full confidence of the Volksraad and the three State presidents he worked with. The length of his tenure made that he became one of the most knowledgeable persons in the Orange Free State where affairs of the state were concerned. In view of all these qualities, Blignaut was the natural candidate to fill the position of Acting State President when President Brand suddenly died in 1888 and after the unexpected resignation of President Reitz in 1895.For dates see South Africa on Worldstatesman.org. When war broke out in October 1899, and British troops stood to conquer Bloemfontein in March 1900, Blignaut organised the removal of the government to Kroonstad, including the state archives. Afterwards he stayed with the government in the field, moving from place to place. In January 1901, gravely ill, he was issued with a laissez-passer to travel to his farm Secretarispan near Bloemfontein, where he stayed for the remainder of the war, effectively on leave from his position as Government Secretary. His wife, C.J. Steyn, was also active in the war. She set up a Ladies' Committee, initially to supply Boer prisoners of war with clothes, and later also to look after the welfare of the women and children in the British concentration camps. British service After the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902, Blignaut quickly adapted to the new political situation. Where his counterpart in the South African Republic, State Secretary Reitz, signed the treaty, but on principle did not want to take the oath of allegiance to the British government, Blignaut did so without qualms within a week, on 6 June 1902. Perhaps his months of illness and contact with the British authorities during the last phase of the war influenced Blignaut's thinking about the future of the Orange Free State and his own position therein. The British government almost immediately appointed Blignaut as member of the Central Repatriation Committee for the Orange River Colony, that was charged with the repatriation and resettlement of the thousands of Free Staters who had fled their homes, were incarcerated in concentration camps, and had been in the field to fight the war. The Central Repatriation Committee was part of the Treaty of Vereeniging. Privately, Blignaut pointed the administration of the Orange River Colony at the poverty and destitution of many white Free Staters, arranging for employment opportunities to be created for them. In 1903 the British government appointed him to the legislative council of the colony, and in 1907 after the return to responsible government, Blignaut became a member of the Legislative Assembly. A better civil servant than politician, his impact on the proceedings of these two institutions was limited. His expertise was put to better use with his appointment as delegate to the South African Customs Conference of 1903 and as member of the Central Committee of the Conference of Landdrosts in Bloemfontein. In 1909, while still working, Blignaut got septicaemia and despite a successful operation, he died the day after in his residence. He was a South African Freemason. He was buried in Bloemfontein with a Freemason's ceremony, conducted by the members of the Rising Star Lodge, of which he had been a member.

Ligands  Decay accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a regulatory protein of the complement cascade, interacts with the first and second EGF-like domains of CD97; chondroitin sulfate B with the fourth EGF- like domain; α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins with an RGD downstream the EGF-like domains; and CD90 (Thy-1) with the GAIN domain. N-glycosylation of CD97 within the EGF domains is crucial for CD55 binding.  Signaling  Transgenic expression of a CD97 in mice enhanced levels of nonphosphorylated membrane- bound β-catenin and phosphorylated Akt. Furthermore, ectopic CD97 expression facilitated RhoA activation through binding of Gα12/13 as well as induced Ki67 expression and phosphorylated ERK and Akt through enhancing lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) signaling. Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE; a plasma membrane component) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) use heterodimeric LPAR1–CD97 to drive Gi/o protein–phospholipase C–inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling and induce [Ca2+] in breast cancer cells.  Function  In the immune system, CD97 is known as a critical mediator of host defense. Upon lymphoid, myeloid cells and neutrophil activation, CD97 is upregulated to promote adhesion and migration to sites of inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that CD97 regulates granulocyte homeostasis. Mice lacking CD97 or its ligand CD55 have twice as many granulocytes as wild-type mice possibly due to enhanced granulopoiesis. Antibodies against CD97 have been demonstrated to diminish various inflammatory disorders by depleting granulocytes. Notably, CD97 antibody-mediated granulocytopenia only happens under the condition of pro-inflammation via an Fc receptor-associated mechanism. Finally, the interaction between CD97 and its ligand CD55 regulates T-cell activation and increases proliferation and cytokine production. Changes in the expression of CD97 have been described for auto-inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The expression of CD97 on macrophage and the abundant presence of its ligand CD55 on fibroblast-like synovial cells suggest that the CD97-CD55 interaction is involved in the recruitment and/or retention of macrophages into the synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis. CD97 antibodies and lack of CD97 or CD55 in mice reduced synovial inflammation and joint damage in collagen- and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis. In brain tissue, CD97 is undetectable in normal white matter, and expression of CD55 is fairly restricted to the endothelium. In pre-active lesion, increased expression of CD55 in endothelial cells and robust CD97 expression on infiltrating leukocytes suggest a possible role of both molecules in immune cell migration through the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, soluble N-terminal fragment (NTF)s of CD97 are detectable in the serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Outside the immune system, CD97 is likely involved in cell–cell interactions. CD97 in colonic enterocytes strengthens E-cadherin-based adherens junctions to maintain lateral cell-cell contacts and regulates the localization and degradation of β-catenin through glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and Akt signaling. Ectopic CD97 expression upregulates the expression of N-cadherin and β-catenin in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells leading to enhanced cell-cell aggregation. CD97 is expressed at the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the peripheral sarcolemma in skeletal muscle. However, lack of CD97 only affects the structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not the function of skeletal muscle. In addition, CD97 promotes angiogenesis of the endothelium through to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins, which contributes to cell attachment.  Clinical significance  CD97 expression in cancer was first reported for dedifferentiated thyroid carcinoma and their lymph node metastases. CD97 is expressed on many types of tumors including thyroid, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, colorectal, and oral squamous carcinomas as well as glioblastoma and glioblastoma-initiating cells. In addition, enhanced CD97 expression has been found at the invasion front of tumors, suggesting a possible role in tumor migration/invasion, and correlated with a poorer clinical prognosis. CD97 has isoform-specific functions in some tumors. For instance, the small EGF(1,2,5) isoform promoted tumor invasion and metastasis in gastric carcinoma; the small EGF(1,2,5) isoform induced but the full length EGF(1-5) isoform suppressed gastric carcinoma invasion. Forced CD97 expression induced cell migration, activated proteolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and enhanced secretion of the chemokines interleukin (IL)-8. Tumor suppressor microRNA-126, often downregulated in cancer, was found to target CD97 thereby modulating cancer progression. CD97 can heterodimerize with the LPAR1, a canonical GPCR that is implied in tumor progression, to modulate synergistic functions and LPA- mediated Rho signaling. It has been shown that CD97 regulates localization and degradation of β-catenin. GSK-3β, inhibited in some cancer, regulates the stability of β-catenin in cytoplasm and subsequently, cytosolic β-catenin moves into the nucleus to facilitate expression of pro-oncogenic genes. Because of its role in tumor invasion and angiogenesis, CD97 is a potential therapeutic target. Several treatments reduce CD97 expression in tumor cells such as cytokine tumor growth factor (TGF)β as well as the compounds sodium butyrate, retinoic acid, and troglitazone. Taken together, experimental evidence indicates that CD97 plays multiple roles in tumor progress.

It lies approximately from Glasgow, and from the border with England. It had a population of 4,009 at the 2001 census. The town came to international attention in December 1988 when the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 crashed there following a terrorist bomb attack aboard the flight. History Lockerbie has existed since at least the days of Viking influence in this part of Scotland in the period around 900. The name (originally \\"Loc- hard's by\\") means Lockard Town in Old Norse. The presence of the remains of a Roman camp to the west of the town suggests its origins may be even earlier. Lockerbie first entered recorded history in the 1190s in a charter of Robert de Brus, 2nd Lord of Annandale, granting the lands of Lockerbie to Adam de Carlyle.\\"Document 3/106/9 (Annandale, no. 2 )\\", People of Medieval Scotland website. It appears as Lokardebi in 1306.\\"Lockerbie\\", Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 11 August 2016. About to the west of Lockerbie on 7 December 1593, Clan Johnstone fought Clan Maxwell at the Battle of Dryfe Sands. The Johnstones nearly exterminated the Maxwells involved in the battle, leading to the expression \\"Lockerbie Lick.\\" Lockerbie's main period of growth started in 1730 when the landowners, the Johnstone family, made plots of land available along the line of the High Street, producing in effect a semi-planned settlement. By 1750 Lockerbie had become a significant town, and from the 1780s it was a staging post on the carriage route from Glasgow to London. Perhaps the most important period of growth was during the 19th century. Thomas Telford's Carlisle-to-Glasgow road was built through Lockerbie from 1816. The Caledonian Railway opened the line from Carlisle to Beattock through Lockerbie in 1847 and later all the way to Glasgow. From 1863 until 1966 Lockerbie was also a railway junction, serving a branch line to Dumfries. Known as the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway, it was closed to passengers in 1952 and to freight in 1966. The town is served by Lockerbie railway station. Lockerbie had been home to Scotland's largest lamb market since the 18th century but the arrival of the Caledonian Railway increased further its role in the cross-border trade in sheep. The railway also produced a lowering in the price of coal, allowing a gas works to be built in the town in 1855. High Street, Lockerbie  Hallmuir Prisoner of War Camp  About south of Lockerbie along the C92 road to Dalton are the remains of Hallmuir prisoner-of-war camp. After the Second World War, this camp housed Ukrainian soldiers from the Galician Division of the Waffen SS. They built a chapel from converted army huts. It was listed in 2003 as a Category B building. The chapel remains in use, currently holding Ukrainian services on the first Sunday of every alternate month.  Pan American 103 bombing  The remains of Pan American Flight 103 in Lockerbie Lockerbie is known internationally as the place where, on 21 December 1988, the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 crashed after a terrorist bomb on board detonated. In the United Kingdom, the event is often referred to as the \\"Lockerbie disaster\\" or the \\"Lockerbie bombing\\". Eleven residents of the town were killed in Sherwood Crescent, where the aircraft's wings and fuel tanks plummeted in a fiery explosion, destroying several houses and leaving a large crater, with debris causing damage to other buildings nearby. All 259 people on the flight also died. The 270 total victims were citizens of 20 different nations. The event remains the deadliest terrorist attack and aviation disaster in Britain. Lockerbie Academy, the town's high school, became the headquarters for the response and recovery effort after the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster. Subsequently, the academy, in cooperation with Syracuse University of Syracuse, New York, US, which lost 35 students in the bombing, established a scholarship at the university. Each year, two students spend one academic year at Syracuse University as Lockerbie Scholars before they begin their university study. The rector of Lockerbie Academy, Graham Herbert, was recognised in November 2003 at Syracuse University with the Chancellor's Medal for outstanding service. A former student of the Academy, Helen Jones, was killed in the 7 July 2005 London bombings. In her memory, a new scholarship was set up, awarding £1000 towards further education to aspiring accounting students from the Academy. Notable buildings, architecture and people Much of Lockerbie is built from red sandstone. There are several imposing buildings near the centre, including the Town Hall, finished in 1880, with its clock tower. A little to the north of the centre is the Dryfesdale Parish Church, with its brightly decorated interior. The name Dryfesdale comes from the local river, the Dryfe Water, which joins the River Annan a little to the west of the town. In 1887 local architect F.J.C Caruthers was commissioned to work on the Town Hall steeple His design was a mixture of Jacobean and Baronial, and included a cupola which was not favourably received. Dryfesdale Lodge Visitors' Centre, formerly a cemetery worker's cottage, was opened on 25 October 2003 after extensive renovation work funded by the Lockerbie Trust and is maintained with grant assistance from Dumfries & Galloway Council. There are two exhibition rooms in the Lodge and also the Dryfesdale Room that is used as a quiet room for visitors to reflect. A permanent exhibition room displays ten history panels depicting Lockerbie's past stretching from its prehistoric origins to 1988's terrorist attack and beyond. In the cemetery grounds nearby is the Lockerbie Memorial Garden of Remembrance. Lockerbie war memorial, \\"Tower\\" chip shop, and town hall, 2006 Lockerbie House was built in 1814 for Sir William Douglas, 4th Baronet of Kelhead and Dame Grace Johnstone and their children; Mary, Catherine, Christian, Henry Alexander, William Robert Keith Douglas, Charles Douglas, 6th Marquess of Queensberry and John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry. It was inhabited at one time by several different members of the Douglas family through the generations. Such family members include both Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquis of Queensberry PC (son of John Douglas) and his wife Caroline Margaret Clayton (daughter of General Sir William Robert Clayton MP) and their children British mountaineer Lord Francis William Bouverie Douglas, Lady Gertrude Georgiana Douglas, John Sholto Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig and later the 9th Marquess of Queensberry, Clergyman Lord Archibald Edward Douglas and the twins Lord James Douglas and Lady Florence Dixie (who married Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie, 11th Baronet.) John Sholto Douglas was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast. In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club, now the Amateur Athletic Association of England. The following year the club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches. The rules had been drawn up by John Graham Chambers but appeared under Queensberry's sponsorship and are universally known as the \\"Marquess of Queensberry rules\\". Lockerbie House is an important establishment within Lockerbie, in the past having owned most of the land and housing within the town mainly through the Johnstone Baronets and Douglas family. Like much of Lockerbie this Georgian house is built of old red sandstone and contains approx. 40 bedrooms, situated within of secluded woodland and gardens, several outbuildings including a gatehouse, a walled garden, croquet lawn, orchards, helipad and a hunting dog pen. The property up until recently also possessed a large stable block but that has since been partly converted into a house with the remaining stables used by a local riding school. Due to the vast size of the property it has frequently been used as a country house hotel in order to help pay for its maintenance and/or provide a prosperous business. The house is now owned by outdoor pursuits company Manor Adventure, and serves as a centre for school activity courses and family adventure holidays. Steven's Croft power station opened in 2008 just to the north of the town. It is the largest biomass-powered electric generator in the UK. Sport Located across the road from Lockerbie Academy, Lockerbie Ice Rink was built in 1966 and is one of the oldest indoor ice rinks in the United Kingdom. In curling it has given rise to World and European Champions and Olympians in the adult, senior and junior disciplines. The town's senior football club is Mid-Annandale, who compete in the South of Scotland Football League. The club play at the recently refurbished King Edward Park.

This seminal book built on his earlier work on the role of glucuronic acid in the metabolism of borneol. Biography Williams was born in Abertillery, the first of five children of Richard Williams, a coalminer, and Mary Ellen (née Jones), a teacher. He grew up speaking Welsh and English. His initial schooling was at Gelli Crug Junior School, from where he gained a scholarship to Abertillery County School. This was followed by University College, Cardiff where he studied chemistry and physiology, and was awarded a BSc in 1928. An opportunity arose for Williams to undertake research with Dr John Pryde at the Physiology Institute, Cardiff, where he worked on elucidating the structure of glucuronic acid. This work formed part of his PhD thesis; he was awarded the degree in 1932. After postdoctoral research at Cardiff he was appointed Lecturer in Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham in 1934. Here, Williams further developed his ideas concerning the metabolism of foreign compounds. His 1938 paper on detoxication of phenol in the rabbit proved to be the first in a series, culminating in Part 77 twenty years later. He was awarded a DSc at Birmingham in 1939. In 1942 Williams was appointed Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry in the University of Liverpool. He expanded his researches, aided by postdoctoral students and collaborators. One study, supported by the MRC, was into the metabolism of TNT, which revealed the formation of the hydroxylamine derivative, 2,6-dinitro-4-hydroxylaminotoluene, a highly toxic substance, which probably accounted for the toxicity of TNT itself. In January 1949, aged 39, Tecwyn Williams took up a new appointment, as the first Chair of Biochemistry at St Mary's Hospital Medical School. During this phase of his career he visited the National Institutes of Health as a Visiting Scientist, where he became interested in spectrophotofluorimetry and the work of Robert Bowman. He returned with a spectrophotofluorimeter, for several years the only one in the UK, and used it for elucidating the relation between chemical structure and fluorescence.For example His hope that the technique would become widespread and important was not fulfilled: gas chromatography was to become universally much more useful. Williams had a particular interest in Nigeria and in 1968 a link was established between St Mary’s and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Ibadan. The Professor of Biochemistry at Ibadan was Olumbe Bassir a former student of Williams at Liverpool. The two worked with the Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas to form the link, which allowed the exchange of teaching staff and the development of joint research programmes, and through which Williams developed an undergraduate teaching programme in drug metabolism. He was awarded a DSc by Ibadan in 1974. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1967. His application citation read: \\"The researches of Williams have been largely responsible for laying the foundations of biochemical toxicology. He has worked on the metabolism of aliphatic alcohols, alicyclic hydrocarbons, benzenes and alkylbenzenes, sulphonamides, drugs of a wide variety, heterocycles, and organotin compounds. He is especially known for his work on fluorescence and his studies on thalidomide in which he has shown that none of the twelve breakdown products which he identified is teratogenic.

Chemokine receptor-like 1 is a G protein-coupled receptor for the chemoattractant adipokine chemerin and the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid-derived specialized pro-resolving molecule, resolvin E1 (see Specialized proresolving mediators#EPA-derived resolvins (i.e. RvE)). The murine receptor that shares almost 80% homology with the human receptor, is called Dez.  Tissue distribution  CMKLR1 shows wide RNA expression profile but is notably high in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, macrophages, cardiomyocytes, adipocytes and endothelial cells.  Function  Activating CMKLR1 by an agonist mobilizes intracellular calcium and causes the activation of several other signaling cascades like the ERK1 and NF-κB. Initial studies of CMKLR1 suggested that it might have a role in the inflammatory pathways. Its cognate ligand, chemerin was found in joint aspirate from rheumatoid arthritis and absent in aspirate from degenerative arthritis. CMKLR1 expression by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages also helped foster this idea. In vitro chemotaxis assays showed it to be utilized in attracting these cells. As an adipokine receptor it has a role in adipogenesis and adipocyte maturation. It seems also to have a role in peripheral insulin resistance. Also studies using the mouse zymosan model and chemerin peptides showed that these peptides suppressed and helped resolve the peritonitis in mice. The same model showed that this particular molecule enhances macrophage efferocytosis (phagocyting apoptotic cells).  Receptor antagonist CCX832  CCX832 is an orally active molecule used as a tool compound in experimental pharmacology. It antagonises the effect of CMKLR1. It is listed on the Guide to Pharmacology database as the only example of a CMKLR1 antagonist. Its chemical structure is undisclosed. The substance was originally developed for use as a pharmaceutical drug against inflammatory diseases by ChemoCentryx, a pharmaceutical firm based in California, in alliance with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

He was first to postulate a chain reaction mechanism and that explosions are branched chain reactions, later applied to the atomic bomb. Early life Max Bodenstein was born in Magdeburg on 15 July 1871 as the eldest son of Magdeburg merchant and brewer Franz Bodenstein (1834–1885) and his first wife Elise Meissner (1846–1876). Education In 1888, Max Bodenstein enrolled at the University of Heidelberg at the age of 17 to study chemistry with Carl Remigius Fresenius. On 25 October 1893, he received his PhD thesis: \\"Über die Zersetzung des Jodwasserstoffes in der Hitze\\" (On the degradation of hydrogen iodide in hot temperature), with Victor Meyer as his supervisor at the University of Heidelberg. Following graduation, Bodenstein received two years of additional training in Berlin-Charlottenburg and Göttingen. Bodenstein studied organic chemistry and catalysis in flowing systems and discovered diffusion controlled catalytic reactions and photochemical reactions with Karl Liebermann at the Technical University of Berlin-Charlottenburg, and physical chemistry with Walther Nernst at the University of Göttingen.Oxford University Press, A Dictionary of Scientists, 1999, Oxford Paperbacks, Career In 1896, Max Bodenstein returned to the University of Heidelberg, where he studied decomposition of hydrohalic acids and their formation. In 1899, he habilitated with the theme: \\"Gasreaktionen in der chemischen Kinetik\\" (Gas reactions in chemical kinetics). In 1900, Max Bodenstein became Lecturer at the physicochemical institute of Wilhelm Ostwald at University of Leipzig. In 1904, he was appointed as Titularprofessor at the same institute. In 1906, he became associate professor at the University of Berlin and department head at the physicochemical institute of Walther Nernst. In 1908, he decided to change to the University of Hannover where he was appointed ordinary professor in electrochemistry and director of the electrochemical institute. He also became professor of physical chemistry in 1911. In 1923, he returned to Berlin where he accepted to be ordinary professor of physical chemistry and director of the physicochemical institute after the retirement of Walther Nernst. He kept these positions until he retired in 1936. Max Bodenstein was also member of the \\"German Atomgewichtskommission\\" (German Commission of Atomic Weights) and co-editor of the journal \\"Physikalische Chemie\\" (Physical chemistry). Contributions Max Bodenstein is considered to be one of the founders of chemical kinetics. He started by detailed experimental work on the formation of hydrogen iodide. His technique was to mix hydrogen and iodine in a sealed tube, which he placed in a thermostat and held at a constant high temperature. The reaction eventually reached an equilibrium, at which the rate of formation of hydrogen iodide was equal to the rate of decomposition to the original reaction (H2 \\\\+ I2 ≡ 2HI). The equilibrium mixture of hydrogen, iodine, and hydrogen iodide was frozen by rapid cooling, and the amount of hydrogen iodide present could be analyzed. Using different amounts of initial reactants, Bodenstein could vary the amounts present at equilibrium and verify the law of chemical equilibrium proposed in 1863 by Cato Maximilian Guldberg and Peter Waage. His work, published in 1899, was one of the first equilibrium investigations over an extended temperature range.M. Bodenstein, Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie (1899) 29, 295–314 Bodenstein also investigated in photochemistry, being first to demonstrate that, in the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine, the high performance could explain by means of a chain reaction. Future inventor of the gas chromatograph, Erika Cremer worked with Bodenstein at this time and wrote her dissertation on the hydrogen-chlorine chain reaction in 1927. He explored in great detail the reaction mechanism of reaction between hydrogen and chlorine.M. Bodenstein, W. Dux, Photochemische Kinetik des Chlorknallgases. Z. Phys. Chemie (1913) 85, 297–328 With this research, he contributed to the understanding in light-induced chemical chain reactions and thus contributed to the photochemistry. In his kinetic studies,M. Bodenstein, Eine Theorie der photochemischen Reaktionsgeschwindigkeiten, Z. Phys. Chem. (1913) 85, 390–421 he used the quasi-steady state approximation to derive the rate equation of the reaction. When an overall reaction is subdivided into elementary steps, Bodenstein's quasi-steady state approximation neglects the variations in the concentrations of reaction intermediates by assuming that these will remain quasi-constant. These reactive intermediates can be radicals, carbenium ions, molecules in the excited state, etc. Victor Henri wrote in 1902: \\"M. Bodenstein to whom I owe much valuable advice\\",V. Henri, Théorie générale de l’action de quelques diastases, C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. (1902) 135, 916–919. in particular on the kinetic description of the invertase enzyme. Thus, Bodenstein contributed to early research in enzyme kinetics. According to Henri and a later paper by Bodenstein himself,M. Bodenstein, Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit und Katalyse im Jahre 1908, Z. Elektrochem. (1909) 15, 329–397. in 1901 or 1902, he suggested the enzyme-kinetic rate law v = V S / (mS + nP). Henri corrected this into v = V S / (1 + mS + nP) (both written in modern notation; S, substrate concentration, P, product concentration). The Bodenstein number (Bo), a dimensionless number that is often used to describe axial mixing in so-called axial-dispersion models for tubular reactors, is named after him. It represents the ratio between the convective transport to the transport by axial diffusion. Awards and fellowships Nernst/Bodenstein commemorative tablet In 1924, Max Bodenstein became fellow of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences. In 1925, he became fellow of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and in 1933 fellow of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. On 21 November 1936, he was awarded the \\"August Wilhelm von Hofmann votive medal\\" from the \\"German Chemical Society\\" (Deutsche chemische Gesellschaft). In 1942, he also became fellow of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. Furthermore, he became honorary doctor of science of Princeton University and Dr.-Ing. E.h. (honorary doctor of engineering). On 13 September 1983, a tablet commemorating Max Bodenstein and Walther Nernst was unveiled at the Physicochemical Institute of the University of Berlin, Bunsenstraße 1, Berlin-Mitte.Image of commemorative tablet Personal life In 1896, Max Bodenstein married Marie Nebel (17 February 1862 – 8 October 1944), daughter of the lawyer Frederick Nebel and Mary Busch, in Heidelberg. They had two daughters: Hilde (in 1897) and Elsbeth (in 1901). Max Bodenstein died in Berlin on 3 September 1942. His tomb is at the cemetery , no. J13/14). References Sources *Chemische Kinetik.

CRF2 receptors are type 2 G protein- coupled receptors for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that are resident in the plasma membranes of hormone-sensitive cells. CRH, a peptide of 41 amino acids synthesized in the hypothalamus, is the principal neuroregulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and downstream effectors such as adenylate cyclase. The CRF2 receptor is a multi-pass membrane protein with a transmembrane domain composed of seven helices arranged in a V-shape. CRF2 receptors are activated by two structurally similar peptides, urocortin II, and urocortin III, as well as CRH. Properties The human CRHR2 gene contains 12 exons. Three major functional isoforms, alpha (411 amino acids), beta (438 amino acids), and gamma (397 amino acids), encoded by transcripts with alternative first exons, differ only in the N-terminal sequence comprising the signal peptide and part of the extracellular domain (amino acids 18-108 of CRHR2 alpha); the unique N-terminal sequence of each isoform (34 amino acids in CRHR2 alpha; 61 amino acids in Hs CRHR2 beta; 20 amino acids in CRHR2 gamma) is followed by a sequence common to all isoforms (377 amino acids) comprising most of the multi-pass transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic domain of 47 amino acids. CRHR2 beta is expressed in human brain; CRHR2 alpha predominates in peripheral tissues. The N-terminal signal peptides of corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 and CRHR2 beta are cleaved off in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield the mature receptors. In contrast, CRHR2 alpha contains a unique pseudo signal peptide that is not removed from the mature receptor. In adenylate cyclase activation assays, CRH-related peptides are 10 times more potent at stimulating CRHR2 beta than CRHR2 alpha and CRHR2 gamma, suggesting that the N-terminal sequence is involved in the ligand-receptor interaction.

It belongs to the D1-like receptor family along with the D1 receptor subtype.  Function  D5 receptor is a subtype of the dopamine receptor that has a 10-fold higher affinity for dopamine than the D1 subtype. The D5 subtype is a G-protein coupled receptor, which promotes synthesis of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase via activation of Gαs/olf family of G proteins. Both D5 and D1 subtypes activate adenylyl cyclase. D1 receptors were shown to stimulate monophasic dose-dependent accumulation of cAMP in response to dopamine, and the D5 receptors were able to stimulate biphasic accumulation of cAMP under the same conditions, suggesting that D5 receptors may use a different system of secondary messengers than D1 receptors. Activation of D5 receptors is shown to promote expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and increase phosphorylation of protein kinase B in rat and mice prefrontal cortex neurons. In vitro, D5 receptors show high constitutive activity that is independent of binding any agonists.  Primary structure  D5 receptor is highly homologous to the D1 receptor. Their amino acid sequences are 49% to 80% identical. D5 receptor has a long C-terminus of 93 amino acids, accounting for 26% of the entire protein. In spite of the high degree of homology between D5 and D1 receptors, their c-terminus tails have little similarity.  Chromosomal location  In humans, D5 receptor is encoded on the chromosome 4p15.1–p15.3. The gene lacks introns and encodes a product of 477 amino acids. Two pseudogenes for D5 receptor exist that share 98% sequence with each other and 95% sequence with the functional DRD5 gene. These genes contain several in-frame stop codons that prevent these genes from transcribing a functional protein.  Expression   Central nervous system  D5 receptor is expressed more widely in the CNS than its close structural homolog dopamine receptor D1. It is found in neurons in amygdala, frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, cerebellum, and midbrain. Dopamine receptor D5 is exclusively expressed by large aspiny neurons in neostriatum of primates, which are typically cholinergic interneurons. Within a cell, D5 receptors are found on the membrane of soma and proximal dendrites. They are also sometimes located in the neuropil in the olfactory region, superior colliculus, and cerebellum. D5 receptor is also found in striatal astrocytes of the rat basal ganglia. The receptors of this subtype are also expressed on dendritic cells and T helper cells.  Kidney  D5 receptors are expressed in kidneys and are involved in regulation of sodium excretion. They are located on proximal convoluted tubules, and their activation suppresses the activity of sodium-hydrogen antiporter and Na+/K+-ATPase, preventing reabsorption of sodium. D5 receptors are thought to positively regulate expression of renalase. Their faulty functioning in nephrons can contribute to hypertension.  Clinical significance   Learning and memory  D5 receptor participates in the synaptic processes that underlie learning and memory. These receptors participate in the formation of LTD in rodent striatum, which is opposite to the D1 receptor involvement with the formation of LTP in the same brain region. D5 receptors are also associated with the consolidation of fear memories in amygdala. It has been shown that M1-Muscarinic receptors cooperate with D5 receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors to consolidate cued fear memory. It is suggested that these G protein-coupled receptors redundantly activate phospholipase C in basolateral amygdala. One effect of the activation of phospholipase C is deactivation of KCNQ channels. Since KCNQ channels conduct M current that raises the threshold for action potential, deactivation of these channels leads to increased neuronal excitability and enhanced memory consolidation. D5 receptors may be required for long-term potentiation at the synapse between medial perforant path and dentate gyrus in murine hippocampal formation.  Addiction  = Smoking = Polymorphisms in the DRD5 gene, which encodes dopamine receptor D5, have been suggested to play a role in the initiation of smoking. In a study on the association of four polymorphisms of this gene with smoking, a statistical analysis suggested that there may exist a haplotype of DRD5 that is protective against initiation of smoking.  ADHD  Dinucleotide repeats of DRD5 gene are associated with ADHD in humans. 136-bp allele of the gene was shown to be a protective factor against developing this disorder, and 146-bp allele of DRD5 was shown to be a risk factor for it. There exist two types of the 146-bp allele of DRD5, a long and a short one. The short dinucleotide repeat allele is associated with ADHD, but not the long one. Another allele of DRD5 that is moderately associated with ADHD susceptibility is 150 bp. In a rat model of ADHD, low density of D5 was found in the hippocampal pyramidal cell somas. Deficiency in D5 receptors may contribute to learning problems that may be associated with ADHD.  Parkinson's disease  D5 receptors may be involved in burst firing of subthalamic nucleus neurons in 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease. In this animal model, blockage of D5 receptors with flupentixol reduces burst firing and improves motor deficits. Studies show that DRD5 T978C polymorphism is not associated with the susceptibility to PD, nor with the risk of developing motor fluctuations or hallucinations in PD.  Schizophrenia  Several polymorphisms in DRD5 genes have been associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia. The 148 bp allele of DRD5 was linked to increased risk of schizophrenia. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms in this gene, including changes in rs77434921, rs1800762, rs77434921, and rs1800762, in northern Han Chinese population.  Locomotion  D5 receptor is believed to participate in modulation of psychostimulant-induced locomotion. Mice lacking D5 receptors show increased motor response to administration of methamphetamine than wild type mice, which suggests that these receptors have a role in controlling motor activity.  Regulation of blood pressure  D5 receptor may be involved in modulation of the neuronal pathways that regulate blood pressure. Mice lacking this receptor in their brains showed hypertension and elevated blood pressure, which may have been caused by increased sympathetic tone. D5 receptors that are expressed in kidneys are also involved in the regulation of blood pressure via modulating expression of renalase and excretion of sodium, and disturbance of these processes can contribute to hypertension as well.  Immunity  D5 receptors negatively regulate production of IFNγ by NK cells. The expression of D5 receptors was shown to be upregulated in NK cells in response to prolonged stimulation with recombinant interleukin 2. This upregulation inhibits proliferation of the NK cells and suppresses synthesis of IFNγ. Activation of D5 prevents p50, part of NF-κB protein complex, from repressing the transcription of miRNA 29a. Because miRNA29a targets mRNA of IFNγ, the expression of IFNγ protein is diminished. D5 receptors are involved in activation and differentiation of T helper 17 cells. Specifically, these receptors play a role in polarization of CD4+ T-cells into the T helper 17 cells by modulating secretion of interleukin 12 and interleukin 23 in response to stimulation with LPS.  Ligands  The D1 and D5 receptors have a high degree of structural homology and few ligands are available that can distinguish between them as yet. However, there is a number of ligands that are selective for D1/5 over the other dopamine receptors. The recent development of a selective D5 antagonist has allowed the action of D1-mediated responses to be studied in the absence of a D5 component, but no selective D5 agonists are yet available. D5 receptors show higher affinity for agonists and lower affinity for antagonists than D1 receptors.

Co-activation of these receptors within the heteromer triggers increase in intracellular calcium. This calcium signaling is dependent on Gq-11 protein signaling and Phospholipase C, as well as on the influx of extracellular calcium. Heteromers between D2 and D5 receptors are formed by adjacent arginines in ic3 (third cytoplasmic loop) of D2 receptor and three adjacent c-terminus glutamic acids in D5 receptor. Heteromerization of 2 and D5 receptors can be disrupted through changes of single amino acids in the c-terminus of the D5 receptor. Dopamine receptor D5 has been shown to interact with GABRG2.  Experimental methods  The high degree of homology between D5 and D1 receptors and their affinity for drugs with similar pharmacological profile complicate distinguishing between them in research. Antibody staining these two receptors separately is suggested to be inefficient. However, expression of D5 receptors has been assessed using immunohistochemistry. In this technique, two peptides were obtained from third exracellular loop and third intracellular loop of the receptor, and antisera were developed for staining the receptor in frozen mouse brain tissue. A method involving mRNA probes for in situ hybridization has been developed, which allowed to separately examine the expression of D1 and D5 receptors in the mouse brain. DRD5 knockout mice can be obtained by crossing 129/SvJ1 and C57BL/6J mice. D5 receptor can also be inactivated in an animal model by flanking the DRD5 gene with loxP site, allowing to generate tissue or animal lacking functional D5 receptors. The expression of D5 receptor in vitro can also be silenced using antisense oligonucleotides.

The Jain Acharya Bhadrabahu, regarded to be the preceptor of Chandragupta Maurya, is said to have been born in Brahmin family of Pundravardhana (or , the region north of the Ganges and west of Brahmaputra in Bengal, later known as Vārendra). Such evidences suggest or Vārendra and regions west of Bhagirathi (called Radha in ancient age) to be seats of Brahmins from ancient times; Rādhi and Varendra are still chief branches of Bengali Brahmins settled in these regions. Medium to large scale migrations of Brahmins from parts of India like Kanyakubja region, Kolancha, southern India and Pushkar in Rajasthan, among other places, occurred from time to time, especially during Pala and Sena periods. According to HC Raychoudhuri the Gupta dyansty originated from the Varendri region. According to the Khalimpur copper plate inscription, the first Pala Emperor Gopala was the son of a warrior named Vapyata. The Ramacharitam attests that Varendra (North Bengal) was the fatherland (Janakabhu) of the Palas.

Constructed early in Bulfinch's career, Franklin Place came after he had seen the possibilities of modern architecture in Europe and had determined to reshape his native city.Roth, Leland M.

Bulfinch's elevation and plan for the Crescent. Bulfinch's drawing of the central pavilion. Elevation and plan. The name \\"Tontine\\" derives from a financial scheme originated by Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, which he introduced in France in the 17th century. Money for the enterprise was to be raised by selling shares of stock to the members of the public, who would later share in the profits from the sale of the homes. It is essentially an annuity, the shares passing on the death of each beneficiary to the surviving partner until all are held by a single shareholder, or being divided among surviving stockholders at the end of a stated period.Contrast with the traditional English leasehold system, in which buyers purchased houses already built by speculative builders and then signed leases with the estate owner. Although this method of financing was in rather wide use in Europe at the time, the Massachusetts General Court refused articles of incorporation and the project ultimately rested on Bulfinch's meager business talent. On July 6, 1793, the Columbian Centinel carried the following notice: The cornerstone was laid on August 8, and the crescent was completed the following year.Columbian Centinel, December 4, 1793. While the houses were complete by autumn 1794, apparently the last were sold in 1796, the sale being delayed by Bulfinch's bankruptcy. Building began with less than 50% of the shares taken up and continued in a discouraging atmosphere created by the prolonged negotiations over the Jay Treaty. Bulfinch completed the project, including its complementary file of four double houses facing across the grass plot (17-24 Franklin Place), but in so doing sacrificed both his and his wife's fortunes. As events proved, the Crescent was far too ambitious an idea for either the man or the times, and he and his family were ruined by his determination to finish it at all costs. However, he was gratified \\"in knowing that not one of my creditors was materially injured, many were secured the full amount, and the deduction on the balance due to workmen did not exceed 10 PC on their entire bills.\\"Bulfinch, Ellen Susan (ed.). The Life and Letters of Charles Bulfinch, p. 99. Boston, 1896. Bulfinch's first attempt to introduce monumental town planning into Boston, the Crescent was an interesting failure, unlike any other building in America. In fact, not even London had a crescent at the time; the architect relied for his model primarily on examples he had seen in BathThe Circus (begun 1754) and the Royal Crescent (begun 1767).—a memory reinforced by a folio of Bath pictures preserved in his library. The Crescent no doubt also owed something to the well-known plan Robert Adam devised for two half circles of connecting houses as an extension of London's Portland Place, as well as certain examples Bulfinch had seen in Paris. In architectural detail, the Crescent recalls the Adelphi Terrace, which Bulfinch knew both as a center of Neoclassical building in London and as the haunt of exiled Tory relatives and family friends. (Adelphi too was a financial disaster, and the Adam brothers saved their project only through a lottery and the sale of their art collections; Bulfinch lacked such resources.) This innovative project for a new and fashionable residential district south of the central business district was located in an undeveloped, unpromising bit of fields and marshlands between Milk Street and Summer Street that consisted in part of a quagmire that Joseph Barrell—Bulfinch's former employer, who had a house on Summer Street—had partially drained and converted into a fish pond in his garden.Whitehill and Kennedy, p. 53. Its western edge intersected today's Hawley Street, and on the east it ended near Federal Street. Until the American Revolution, Boston still had enough space in most locations to accommodate single dwellings with small gardens. However, as land values began to rise, many newer dwellings began to be built with their narrow ends to the street and their entrances on the side. With his long row of attached houses, Bulfinch gambled that wealthy individuals would not mind living in relatively cramped quarters. Knowing that most wealthy Londoners living in garden squares also had country estates, he believed perhaps that potential residents of Franklin Place would also have summer homes with large gardens elsewhere.Goodman, pp. 26-7. Thomas Pemberton described the Crescent at the time of completion as \\"a range of sixteen well built and handsome dwelling houses, extending four hundred and eighty feet in length ... The general appearance is simple and uniform.\\"Pemberton, Thomas. A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston, 1794, p. 250. Boston: 1794. As Bulfinch's elevation shows, the chief feature was a central pavilion, slightly higher than the Crescent's wings, with a large arch that spanned a passageway passing entirely through the structure, an attic story and two secondary pavilions projecting 6' forward from the middle section.Leading through toward Summer Street, the arch gave origin and name to Arch Street. The form was suggested by Queen's Square in Bath, constructed more than half a century earlier by John Wood, the Elder; the arch, with Palladian window, was probably taken from the Market in High Street, Bristol, traditionally attributed to Wood also. However, in style the Tontine Crescent was Neoclassical rather than Neo- Palladian, and its main architectural distinction, three ranges of pilasters rising two stories above an architectural basement,In all, then, these were four-story houses: two residential floors, a basement, and an attic. is taken from the Adelphi. Moreover, the structure contained all the Neoclassical elements of the new Federal style: attenuated pilasters on the central pavilion and two end pavilions that projected forward several feet, swag panels, and delicate fanlights and lunettes.Goodman, p. 29. The plan, which featured two large rooms (about 18' x 18') on each floor offset by a hallway with main and service staircases, was traditional with London row-house builders since the 17th century. Indeed, the Neoclassical façade of the Adam brothers' Royal Society of Arts building in London was another inspiration for the central building.Goodman, p. 27. The houses' brickA material that was a relatively new innovation for Boston dwellings of the period. exterior walls were painted gray to simulate masonryStone was not easily available and consequently very costly; when the Middlesex Canal of 1803 made Chelmsford granite accessible, Bulfinch began at once to use it in his work. Shand-Tucci, p. 11. However, he was also inspired by the painted stucco over brick examples he had seen in London. Goodman, p. 30. and the architectural detail, apparently all of wood, was painted white. Delicate decorative devices were present on the handsome three-floor houses, each 27' wide, but ornament was so restrained that there were no frames around the windows. The identical doorways were spaced two to a porch. Each floor consisted of two large rooms, described by Massachusetts Magazine as \\"spacious and lofty\\", with a hallway on one side containing both the main and service stairways. Once finished, the Crescent received unanimous praise from contemporaries. Asher Benjamin claimed it \\"gave the first impulse to good taste; and to architecture, in this part of the country.\\"Asher Benjamin. Practice of Architecture, preface. Boston, 1833. Massachusetts Magazine called the style \\"the most improved of modern elegance\\" and was especially impressed by the spacious rooms and the attention given to household conveniences: \\"Each house will have annexed to it a pump, rain water cistern, wood house, and a stable, and a back avenue will communicate to all the stables.\\"Massachusetts Magazine, VI (February 1794), p. 67. Bulfinch was also praised for presenting the large room behind the Palladian window above the arch to the Boston Library SocietyFounded 1792; room given 1796. and the attic above to the newly founded Massachusetts Historical Society,Founded 1791; room given 1794. which at the time was lodged in the northwest corner of Faneuil Hall's attic. (Granted, Bulfinch and his partners did realize it might be difficult to find buyers for the two pavilion rooms, potentially unsuitable for residences.) The Library Society remained there until the building's demolition in 1858, when the city paid it $12,000 for its room, while the Historical Society stayed until 1833, moving next to the King's Chapel burying ground because of cramping and fear of fire.Goodman, p. 35. 17-24 Franklin Place Number 19. Benjamin Nutting, ca. 1850. The four double houses in Franklin Place substituted for the northern half of what was planned as a double crescent separated by an oval of grass. This solution, although less aesthetically successful, was dictated by difficulties in acquiring sufficient land adjoining the estate of Thomas Barrell for the execution of the original scheme. It is also evident that Bulfinch's approaching financial ruin precluded the construction of anything so costly as the projected northern crescent. As it was, the architect was hopelessly in debt when he began building on the north side of Franklin Place, probably in December 1794.Jeremy Belknap's sketch of September 20, 1794, shows the completed Tontine Crescent but gives no indication of building on the north side of Franklin Place. The sketch is in Belknap to Ebenezer Hazard, same date, Belknap papers, Massachusetts Historical Society. The earliest reference to the project is in Pemberton's description of the recently completed Crescent: \\"The opposite side is intended to be built in a straight line, and in a varied style of building.\\"Pemberton, p. 250. On October 15, 1795, the eastern half of one of the buildings, Number 22, was sold to John McLean for $8,000, and it is presumed the range of four brick double houses was completed shortly thereafter.C. A. Place. Charles Bulfinch: Architect and Citizen, p. 64. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press, 1968. The entire property, including the houses in the Crescent and the four double ones in Franklin Place, was assessed in the Direct Tax of 1798 at something over $125,000. By that time, five years after the beginning of construction on Franklin Place, all twenty- four properties had been sold and were occupied by the families of prominent businessmen and men of letters.Goodman, p. 32. As the site plan made for the Historic American Buildings Survey shows, the axis of the Crescent and the double houses opposite was along the line of Arch Street with the Franklin Urn serving as a focus. The four double houses were of the same architectural proportions, although the middle pair was somewhat larger in area. The end houses were placed obliquely to the middle ones and thus corresponded to the east and west pavilions of the Crescent; the slight angle helped keep the street openings as wide as possible. The houses on both sides of the street had identical fanlight entrance doors, and despite Pemberton's prediction of variety in architectural treatment, the double houses were quite similar to the opposing Crescent. The major stylistic differences were Bulfinch's exclusive use of swag panels in the Crescent and recessed brick arches in the houses across the way. No floor plan has been discovered but it is presumed the double houses had the traditional arrangement of two rooms on either side of a transverse hallway divided, as in the Crescent, by main and service staircases. The two center units were much larger than the pairs at the ends and included tiny fenced-in front gardens. The row faced south on the enclosed grass plot and was considered at the time the most modern and pleasant range of houses in Boston. Other characteristics Between the Crescent and the double houses was a wrought-iron-fenced semi-oval grass plot 40' wide at its center and about 280' long, with shade trees; it was at the heart of the city's first garden square.Still, perhaps because it was so tiny, it was never mentioned in advertisements for the crescent houses; unlike in London, where the garden was the main selling point, here it was the houses' architectural style. Goodman, p. 31. In 1795, Bulfinch placed a large Neoclassical urn (similar to one executed by Robert Adam) and pedestal in the square's center; he had purchased these in Bath and brought them home from his Grand Tour of 1785-87. Soon after 1858, the urn, which served as a memorial to the late Benjamin Franklin, was moved together with the pedestal to Bulfinch's grave in Mount Auburn Cemetery. While much smaller than its London counterparts, the garden was important for recreation, and its shape echoed that of the surrounding buildings. Also unlike in London, where gated streets allowed entry only to residents, access to the garden was not restricted and it could be enjoyed by visitors to the Library and Historical Societies, as well as by theater- and church-goers.In theory, the deeds reserved the garden \\"for the accommodation, convenience and beauty\\" of residents alone, but this was not de facto the case. Goodman, pp. 31-2. As Massachusetts Magazine observed in 1794, the garden \\"will contribute to the ornament of the buildings, and be useful in promoting a change and circulation of air.\\"At Goodman, p. 31. Also as part of the complex were included Boston Theater (1793), the first theater built in Boston, placed at the northeast end of the square, and Holy Cross Church (begun 1800), the city's first Roman Catholic church, directly opposite the theater at the southeast end. These additional amenities for residents recalled what St Albans had done for St. James's Square, and were a bold move, considering that Puritan Boston had banned theatrical performances until December 1793 and had displayed religious intolerance throughout its history. The Dinner Party, by Henry Sargent, ca. 1821. The Tea Party, by Henry Sargent, ca. 1824. What the social life in Franklin Place was like is suggested by two paintings, now held by the Museum of Fine Arts: Henry Sargent's The Dinner Party (ca. 1821) and The Tea Party (ca. 1824). These probably represent actual parties that took place in Sargent's home at 10 Franklin Place, on the Crescent. Based on Bulfinch's plan, the two rooms depicted in The Tea Party must have been adjoining parlors, most likely on the second floor above the first-floor dining room. The graceful archway connecting the two rooms in the picture is a Neoclassical architectural detail used by Bulfinch to relate the interior of the house to the Palladian window on the Crescent's central building. Despite the rooms' long, narrow configuration, lavish entertainment could still take place, in part because the high ceilings made the rooms seem larger. Bulfinch's drawing of the Crescent suggests that the first- and second-floor windows were of the same height; this is consistent with the interiors shown in the painting and contrasts with London terraces of the period, where the second-floor parlor windows were usually taller. The furnishings that Sargent depicts represent contemporary high-style Boston interiors, in most respects similar to what could be found in London. The dining room in The Dinner Party is quite masculine, with mahogany furniture and large portraits suitable to the gathering of gentlemen, the two parlors or drawing rooms shown in The Tea Party are lighter in feeling, more feminine, and ornamented with many French and Italian decorative objects. The women are adorned with the latest and most expensive fashions of the day—column-like Empire gowns with accompanying shawls.Goodman, pp. 33-4. Demolition and legacy Franklin Street looking west, ca. 1860s. Franklin and Arch Streets, as viewed from where the central pavilion once stood. (Shows extension of Arch Street after the Great Boston Fire of 1872.) Franklin Street, which retains its curve. Notable residents of Franklin Place included John and Judith Sargent Murray, Abby May,Boston Women’s Heritage Trail , James Perkins, merchant and principal donor to the Boston Athenaeum's first building, William Tudor, Jr., founder of Monthly Anthology and the North American Review, and his literary associate Dr. John S. J. Gardiner, rector of Trinity Church. Two women owned houses: Abigail Howard, a founder of the Boston Library Society, and Elizabeth Amory.Goodman, p. 33. While wealthy merchants and prominent men of letters inhabited both the Crescent and the houses across the street, it was the free-standing houses that became the most fashionable, even though they were more expensive and the side yards were very narrow; Bostonians had a deep-seated preference for even the narrow yards of semi-detached houses as opposed to the block of connected houses, two walls in each of which had to be windowless. The pattern held true in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: except for a few houses in the Back Bay, Bostonians at every class level utterly rejected the connected town house block and instead turned back to some version of the 18th- and early 19th-century ideal of the garden lot and free-standing town house.Shand-Tucci, Douglass. Built in Boston, pp. 86, 100. Amherst, Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts Press, 1999, . Shortly after the Crescent's completion, the newly widened Arch Street was extended through the center archway, and other connecting streets were opened to the south and east. The addition of these new streets reflected the growth of the downtown business area immediately surrounding the complex; this long-lasting push by businesses into the area would eventually doom Bulfinch's buildings. After about thirty years, when the Mount Vernon Proprietors were developing an exclusive residential neighborhood on Mount Vernon just to the west of Beacon Hill that was beginning to lure affluent residents farther from the central business district, middle-class residents began to move in. The single-family dwellings were soon converted into boarding houses. The new residents were less concerned with the neighborhood's overall appearance, as seen from late photographs that show the garden overcrowded with small shrubs planted randomly among the trees, and a wood picket fence replacing the original iron posts and chains.Goodman, p. 34. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. noted these changes in The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table, published in 1858 just as demolition was underway: \\"There were the shrubs and flowers in the Franklin- Place front-yards or borders; Commerce is just putting his granite foot upon them.\\" Sears Crescent. The Tontine Crescent and the other houses in Franklin Place were acquired by the city \\"for the public convenience\\" and razed in 1858 to make way for blocks of large stone stores and granite warehouses in Franklin Street.Whitehill and Kennedy, pp. 129, 131. These buildings, along with a single elm remaining from the garden (plus three empty circular pits that once held trees), were destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872.Goodman, p. 36. The graceful curve and unusual width of Franklin Street today below Hawley Street are reflections of the Crescent's ground plan. Architectural descendants include the Sears Crescent near today's Boston City Hall and the façade of the Kirstein Business Branch of the Boston Public Library (built 1929-30), which replicates the entire central portion of the Tontine. Despite residents' general aversion to connected structures, hundreds of brick row houses in the area draw inspiration from the Bulfinch structure, including Worcester and Chester Squares in the South End; West Hill Place and Charles River Square on Beacon Hill; a set of fifteen attached brick and half- timbered town houses on Elm Hill Avenue in Roxbury Highlands originally called Harris Wood Crescent; and a block of fifteen red-brick connected houses on Beacon Street in Brookline, built in 1907.Morgenroth, Lynda. Boston Firsts, p. 110. Boston: Beacon Press, 2007, . An economic downturn meant that subscriptions came too slowly to meet bills, and Bulfinch went bankrupt in January 1796, turning from a comfortable situation as a gentleman concerned with architecture to a laborious life of architectural practice and public service. Financial troubles continued to plague him, such that he spent July 1811 in debtors' prison, but the Crescent and Franklin Place helped transform Boston from an 18th-century town into a 19th-century city.Whitehill and Kennedy, pp. 54-5.

GameSpot, GameRevolution, and IGN all criticized the game's failure to create any sense of being a giant robot on the rampage in a city, as well as the lack of combat depth or replay value. IGN and GameRevolution additionally criticized the Dreamcast version for its extremely poor frame rate, lack of in-game music, and conspicuous game-crashing bugs. Jeff Lundrigan of Next Generation said that the same console version \\"may not be to everyone's taste, but it does offer a different sort of challenge for those so inclined.\\" References External links Slave Zero News 1999 video games Accolade games Action video games Cyberpunk video games Dreamcast games Infogrames games Multiplayer and single-player video games Video games about mecha Video games developed in the United States Windows games ","title":"Slave Zero"},{"id":"14410555","text":"Maske Gruppen is a Norwegian wholesaler that distributes office supplies and healthcare products throughout the country.

It was released for the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and MSX. Plot The death of an Arabian prince's father, the king, shatters three enchanted oil lamps, freeing the three genies trapped within. The genies overrun the palace; to contain them, the prince must reassemble the three broken lamps. The player, in the role of the prince wearing a white thawb and red keffiyeh, must journey into the seven dens of each genie, as each den contains one of the lamp pieces. Gameplay Gameplay alternates between two modes. In the first, the prince maneuvers a flying carpet through a winding tunnel to a genie's den. In practice, this requires the player to direct the carpet over diamond-shaped gates as they appear; failure to do so returns the prince to the beginning of the tunnel. Once in the den, the second mode, the player strikes a gong thrice to summon the genie. The genie draws from a hookah, and blows out a ball of smoke. From the smoke emerges a sequence of tones, which the player must repeat in a call-and-response pattern. In order to play a tone, the player must strike the corresponding gong. If the player strikes the incorrect gong, or strikes the correct gong too early, the genie's magic transports the prince to the beginning of the tunnel. In the seven dens of the first genie, each tone is audible, and manifests as a colored quaver (eighth note) that floats toward the ground. In the seven dens of the second genie, the tone is inaudible, so the player must match the color of the note to the color of the corresponding gong. In the seven dens of the third genie, the tone is audible, but no note appears; the player must recognize the note's pitch, and strike the correct gong. When the player passes the trial, a gateway to another tunnel opens. After passing the musical trials of the three genies, the player navigates one final tunnel to the palace. If the player succeeds, the prince reclaims the palace. Reception Antic in 1986 called Master of the Lamps an \\"offbeat game program with a number of unique elements\\". While stating that \\"it does become a little monotonous\\", the magazine approved of the non-violent gameplay.

Nomenclature note  Confusingly, there are two nomenclatures for FPR receptors and their genes, the first one used, FPR, FPR1, and FPR2 and its replacement (which corresponds directly to these three respective receptors and their genes), FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3. The latter nomenclature is recommended by the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology and is used here. Other previously used names for FPR1 are NFPR, and FMLPR; for FPR2 are FPRH1, FPRL1, RFP, LXA4R, ALXR, FPR2/ALX, HM63, FMLPX, and FPR2A; and for FPR3 are FPRH2, FPRL2, and FMLPY.  FPR3 function  The overall function of FPR3 is quite unclear. Compared to FPR1 and FPR2, FPR3 is highly phosphorylated (a signal for receptor inactivation and internalization) and more localized to small intracellular vesicles. This suggests that FPR3 rapidly internalizes after binding its ligands and thereby may serve as a \\"decoy\\" receptor to reduce the binding of its ligands to FRP1 and FRP2 receptors.  Genes   Humans  The FPR3 gene was cloned and named based on the similarity of the amino acid sequence which it encodes to that encoded by the gene for FPR1 (see formyl peptide receptor 1 for details) The studies indicated that FPR3 is composed of 352 amino acids and its gene, similar to FPR1, has an intronless open reading frames which encodes a protein with the 7 transmembrane structure of G protein coupled receptors; FPR3 has 69% and 72% amino acid sequence identities with FPR1. All three genes localize to chromosome 19q.13.3 in the order of FPR1 (19q13.410), FPR2 (19q13.3-q13.4), and FPR3 (19q13.3-q13.4) to form a cluster which also includes the genes for another G protein-coupled chemotactic factor receptor, the C5a receptor (also termed CD88) and GPR77, and a second C5a receptor, C5a2 (C5L2), which has the structure of a G protein coupled receptor but fails to couple to G proteins and is of debated function.  Mice  Mouse FPR receptors localize to chromosome 17A3.2 in the following order: Fpr1, Fpr-rs2 (or fpr2), Fpr-rs1 (or LXA4R), Fpr-rs4, Fpr-rs7, Fpr-rs7, Fpr-rs6, and Fpr-rs3; Pseudogenes ψFpr-rs2 and ψFpr-rs3 (or ψFpr-rs5) lie just after Fpr-rs2 and Fpr-rs1, respectively. All of the active mouse FPR receptors have ≥50% amino acid sequence identity with each other as well as with the three human FPR receptors. Based on its predominantly intracellular distribution, mFpr-rs1 correlates, and therefore may share functionality, with human FPR3; However, the large number of mouse compared to human FPR receptors makes it difficult to extrapolate human FPR functions based on genetic (e.g. gene knockout or forced overexpression) or other experimental manipulations of the FPR receptors in mice.  Other species  FPR receptors are widely distributed throughout mammalian species with the FPR1, FPR2, and FPR3 paralogs, based on phylogenetic analysis, originating from a common ancestor and early duplication of FPR1 and FPR2/FPR3 splitting with FPR3 originating from the latest duplication event near the origin of primates. Rabbits express an ortholog of FPR1 (78% amino acid sequence identity) with high binding affinity for FMLP; rats express an ortholog of FPR2 (74% amino acid sequence identity) with high affinity for lipoxin A4.  Cellular and tissue distribution  FPL3 is expressed by circulating monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils but not neutrophils; tissue macrophages and dendritic cells.  Ligands and potential ligand-based disease related activities  The functions of FPR3 and the few ligands which activate it have not been fully clarified. Despite its homology to FPR1, FPR3 is unresponsive to many FPR1-stimulating formyl peptides including FMLP. However, fMMYALF, a N-formyl hexapeptide derived from the mitochondrial protein, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6, is a weak agonist for FPR3 but >100-fold more potent in stimulating FPR1 and FPR2. F2L is a naturally occurring acylated peptide derived from the N-terminal sequence of heme-binding protein 1 by cathepsin D cleavage that potently stimulates chemotaxis through FPR3 in monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. F2L thereby may be a pro-inflammatory stimulus for FPR3. Similar to FPR2 (see FPR2 section), FPR3 is activated by humanin and thereby may be involved in inhibiting the inflammation occurring in and perhaps contributing to Alzheimer's disease.

He was an ardent admirer and follower of the Discalced Carmelite charism – but was not of their order – and was a central figure in the spiritual formation of Karol Józef Wojtyła who became Pope John Paul II. He was both the leader and student mentor of his friend's college parish of Saint Stanisław Kostka in the 1940s as well as a small group he ran on the behalf of the Salesians of Don Bosco during the wartime period. His old friend launched the beatification process on 28 April 1997 and titled him as a Servant of God while the confirmation of his heroic virtue at the beginning of 2017 allowed for Pope Francis to title him as Venerable. Life Jan Leopold Tyranowski was born on 9 February 1901 in Kraków to Jan Tyranowski and Apolonia Hrobak. His father had plans for him and directed him to the accounting profession which he studied for. He obtained his high school diploma to enter accounting but this was cut short in 1930 when he suffered from a chronic and debilitating stomach ailment that forced him to quit. He began to work in his father's tailor shop and inherited it after his death; he made this the focus of his life alongside his mother who aided him. When he assumed tailoring his stress reduced and he seemed to become much happier and active in his parish. He liked to be a loner and kept to himself and never married nor had children; he liked taking photos as well as gardening and had an avid interest in science and foreign languages. In 1935 he attended Mass and listened to a sermon a Salesian priest gave that would forever change his life and broaden his spiritual horizons. The priest said in the sermon that \\"it is not difficult to become a saint\\". This had a profound impact on his own thinking on what it meant to be a saint and he aspired for personal holiness. He became an ardent admirer and devotee of Saint John of the Cross and Saint Teresa of Ávila after reading their spiritual writings and soon became enthralled with the Carmelite charism despite never joining them as a religious or secular member. At the end of May 1941, one of the last Salesian priests asked him to assume control of a religious group of men; he accepted this and organized meetings of fifteen teenagers or young adults and called them \\"Living Rosary\\" groups. He continued the meetings in his apartment during the war and aided the Salesians whenever possible during the war due to an extensive number of them being apprehended as prisoners. The Gestapo even once discovered one such meeting but dismissed it as the gatherings of a religious fanatic. It was at these meetings that he first met Karol Józef Wojtyła – the future Pope John Paul II – in February or March 1940 during a retreat at the local parish. Sometime in 1946 he fell ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and suffered great pain over the next several months due to the intensity of the disease that later claimed his life in 1947. He managed to attend Wojtyła's ordination as a priest on 1 November 1946 just a few months before his death. He was first buried at the Rakowicki Cemetery but was exhumed on 26 March 1998 and was buried in the church of Saint Stanisław Kostka that the Salesians of Don Bosco manage in Kraków's district of Dębniki. Relationship with John Paul II The future pope found the man intense to an almost unbearable degree but soon came to see something of profound import in him. Later in life Wojtyła stated: \\"What he tried to teach us was new. He wanted to pull new listeners to this new life\\". The future pope went on to state that Tyranowski made the effort to teach them new things that were unknown to them or what people were unwilling to learn and accept. The future pope was also introduced to the writings of the Carmelite Saint John of the Cross after Tyranowski exposed him to it; John of the Cross would come to be one of the great inspirations in the life of Wojtyla. > He was one of those unknown saints, hidden amid the others like a marvelous > light at the bottom of life, at a depth where night usually reigns. He > disclosed to me the riches of his inner life, of his mystical life. In his > words, in his spirituality and in the example of a life given to God alone, > he represented a new world that I did not yet know. I saw the beauty of a > soul opened up by grace. Mieczyslaw Malinski – a friend of Wojtyła's and a member of Tyranowski's group who later became a priest was also skeptical at first about this religious eccentric but came to accept Tyranowski's teachings as something deep and insightful. Malinski stated later that \\"Jan's influence with [Karol] was gigantic. I can safely say that if it wasn't for him neither Wojtyla nor I would have become priests\\". Wojtyla wrote in May 1949: > This man was not a fiction or a symbol, but a real living person. His name > was Tyranowski. Jan Tyranowski. He lived in Krakow, in Debniki, at 15 Rozana > Street. He was born in 1900 and died in March 1947 ... His family was of a > typical suburban middle class ... It is worth noting that Jan’s demeanor, > for example, the way he wore his watch, his expressions, all of the many > details that reflect the social environment, were totally consistent with > that environment. The entire difference was hidden within, and it was from > within that all his external habits obtained their particular character. Jan > guided his inner life according to the book \\"Mistyka\\" by Father Semenenko. > Later, however, Saint John of the Cross and Saint Theresa of Jesus became > his chief spiritual masters. They were not only his masters, they led him to > discover himself, they explained and justified his own life. Beatification process The Salesians of Don Bosco – whom he aided during World War II – took charge of the cause for beatification. His old friend John Paul II started the beatification cause on 28 April 1997 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled him as a Servant of God. The diocesan process spanned from 30 September 1997 until 15 March 2000 when it closed and it later received C.C.S. validation on 16 November 2001 before the C.C.S. received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2011. The theologians met and approved the dossier's contents on 15 September 2015 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 17 January 2017. The confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to title him as Venerable on 20 January 2017. The current postulator for the cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni while the previous postulator was the Salesian bishop Enrico dal Covolo.

Biography De Neve was born in either 1882 or 1885 in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, the son of Eduard Karel Alexander de Neve, a major in the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, and Johanna Christina Fokker. His father died when De Neve was 9 or 10 years old, and the family moved to the Netherlands. In The Hague, De Neve joined football club Quick. When he joined the Royal Netherlands Army, he started to play football for Velocitas Breda, which was affiliated with the Royal Military Academy of the Netherlands. He moved to HBS Craeyenhout (football club) in 1905, and won the Dutch national football title in his first season back in The Hague. De Neve was part of the first Netherlands national football team, which played for the Coupe Van Den Abeele against Belgium on 30 April 1905. De Neve made the opening goal of the match after 80 minutes., based on An own goal by Dutchman Ben Stom in the 86th minute was the equalizer, and the score was 1–1 after regular time. De Neve scored three goals in extra time, after 106, 117 and 119 minutes, and the final score of the match was 4–1. The Netherlands had won its first match ever, and De Neve had scored all four Dutch goals. He was also in the Dutch squad for a return match in Rotterdam two weeks later, on 14 May 1905. The Netherlands won the match 4–0, with De Neve having scored two goals. De Neve played the third and final international match of his career on 13 May 1906, again against Belgium, this time resulting in a 2–3 loss. De Neve had scored six goals in three caps. He would remain the top scorer of the Dutch national team until 21 March 1909, when Edu Snethlage of De Neve's former club Quick scored the opening goal of a match against Belgium, his seventh goal for the Dutch national team. A knee injury and military service in the Dutch East Indies forced De Neve to end his career as a football player in 1907. He was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant on 27 July 1909, and was honourably discharged from the army two months later. In the same year, his brother Gilles was eaten by cannibals on the island of Sumba in the Dutch East Indies. De Neve worked for several Dutch companies and plantations in the Dutch East Indies, but he struggled to get by. In 1913, he got engaged to Daisy Maud Green in the port of Genoa, Italy. The two got married on 14 August 1914 in Lubuk Sinapeng in the Dutch East Indies. They had one son, Gilles jr. The couple were divorced after 12 years; Daisy Maud and Gilles jr. moved to The Hague, while De Neve remained in the Dutch East Indies. He published his memoirs, entitled Koning Voetbal (\\"King Football\\"), in 1938, on the occasion of the Dutch East Indies taking part in the 1938 FIFA World Cup. De Neve was notified by letter that his only child, Gilles Jr., had died in the crash of his Royal Air Force Supermarine Spitfire in Kent, England in 1941.

In baseball statistics, slugging percentage' (abbreviated SLG) is a measure of the power of a hitter. It is calculated as total bases divided by at bats: SLG = \\\\frac{(\\\\mathit{1B}) + (2 \\\\times \\\\mathit{2B}) + (3 \\\\times \\\\mathit{3B}) + (4 \\\\times \\\\mathit{HR})}{AB} where AB is the number of at-bats for a given player, and 1B, 2B, 3B, and HR are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs, respectively. Walks are specifically excluded from this calculation. Currently, a player needs to accrue an average of at least 3.1 plate appearances for each game his team plays in order to qualify for the title. An exception to this qualification rule is that if a player falls short of 3.1 plate appearances per game, but would still have the highest batting average if enough hitless at-bats were added to reach the 3.1 average mark, the player still wins the slugging percentage championship. The latest example of this exception being employed was in 2007, when Ryan Braun had a .634 slugging percentage, but only 492 plate appearances – 10 short of the 502 necessary. The addition of 10 hitless at-bats would have lowered his slugging percentage to a value that was still better than anyone else in the league, so Braun was the National League slugging percentage champion.

Chemokines also play fundamental roles in the development, homeostasis, and function of the immune system, and they have effects on cells of the central nervous system as well as on endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis or angiostasis. Chemokines are divided into 2 major subfamilies, CXC and CC, based on the arrangement of the first 2 of the 4 conserved cysteine residues; the 2 cysteines are separated by a single amino acid in CXC chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines.

It was originally produced for French television in 1983 by Alain and Daniel Boublil, but which was later also transferred to an English stage version and two other television programs. The story was not always the same as the selection of the chosen songs varied by productions. Productions Original French production The French television production consisted of 12 ABBA songs with new French lyrics by Alain & Daniel Boublil, and the story was based on classic fairy tales like Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Pinocchio, Snow White and others. The cast was made up of children and well known French singers like Fabienne Thibeault, Daniel Balavoine, Plastic Bertrand, Maurice Barrier, Daniel Boublil (as 'Daniel Beaufixe'), Francoise Pourcel (as Marie Framboise), Catherine Ferry, Stéphane Le Navelan, Stéphane Boublil (son of Alain), Clémentine Autain and Emmanuelle Pailly. Anni-Frid Lyngstad, also known as \\"Frida\\", from ABBA was invited to play the part of \\"Belle au bois dormant\\" (Sleeping Beauty), and recorded the song \\"Belle\\" (a cover of ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \\"Arrival\\") as a duet with Daniel Balavoine. Abbacadabra was originally broadcast on the French TV channel TF1 over Christmas in 1983. A soundtrack album, entitled ABBAcadabra: Conte musical, featuring songs and narration from the production, was produced in 1983 as well. According to liner notes on the album cover, arrangements and musical direction were provided by Raymond Donnez and production by Alain Boublil with assistance by Raymond Donnez, Daniel Boublil, and Françoise Pourcel. The album was released by WEA Filipacchi Music in France and WEA Music of Canada in Québec. The album spawned several single releases in France, including \\"Mon Nez Mon Nez\\" by Plastic Bertrand, \\"L'Enfant Do\\" by Stéphane Boublil, and the Frida and Daniel Balavoine duet \\"Belle,\\" which also saw release outside France in a few European countries and Canada. =French musical numbers= * Qu'est-ce que j'vais faire plus tard (What I'm gonna do later) / When I Kissed the Teacher * Délivrés / The Visitors (Crackin' Up) * Abbacadabra / Take a Chance on Me * Mon nez mon nez (My nose my nose) / Money Money Money * Tête d'allumette (Match head) / Super Trouper * Imagine-moi (Imagine me) / I Wonder (Departure) * Carabosse super show / Dancing Queen * Pareils et mêmes (Same and same) / I Let the Music Speak * L'enfant do (Children do) / Fernando * Lâchez mes cassettes (Let go of my tapes) / I'm a Marionette * Belle (Beautiful) / Arrival * Envoyez le générique (Send the theme song) / Thank You for the Music  Original London production  Cameron Mackintosh decided to produce a live-action English stage version of the TV show with lyrics by David Wood, Mike Batt, and Don Black. Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, who wrote the songs in ABBA, contributed with one new song, \\"The Seeker.\\" The musical premiered 8 December 1983 at the Lyric Hammersmith theatre in London, to mixed reviews and full houses for 8 weeks, closing on 21 January 1984. Among the actors were Elaine Paige, Michael Praed, Nigel Harman, Finola Hughes, B.A. Robertson, and Jenna Russell. A couple of singles were released from the show in several European countries. These were produced and arranged by Mike Batt. One featured Elaine Paige's recording of \\"Like An Image Passing By,\\" a cover of ABBA's My Love, My Life, with a B side of Finola Hughes singing \\"When Dreamers Close Their Eyes\\".

The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before returning home and being reduced to reserve in 1907. Recommissioned two years later as part of the Home Fleet, she spent the next five years moving on and off of active service in British waters. Sentinel was assigned to coastal defence duties when the First World War began in 1914, although she was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1915. By 1918 the ship had been assigned to the Aegean. After the end of the war in November, Sentinel was sent to the Black Sea as the British attempted to intervene in the Russian Civil War. The ship returned home in early 1919 and was paid off. She became a training ship from mid-1920 to the end of 1922 and was sold for scrap in early 1923. Design and description The Sentinel- class ships were one of four classes of scout cruisers ordered by the Admiralty in 1902–1903 and 1903–1904 Naval Programmes. These ships were intended to work with destroyer flotillas, leading their torpedo attacks and backing them up when attacked by other destroyers, although they quickly became less useful as destroyer speeds increased before the First World War. They had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew consisted of 289 officers and ratings.Friedman 2009, pp. 100, 294 The ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by a dozen Vickers Express water-tube boilers. The engines were designed to produce a total of which was intended to give a maximum speed of .Chesneau & Kolesnik, pp. 84–85 When Sentinel ran her sea trials, she reached a speed of from for eight hours.McBride, p. 277 The Sentinel-class cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of at .Friedman 2009, p. 294 The main armament of the Sentinel class consisted of ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 18-cwt guns.\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 18 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.Friedman 2011, p. 112 Three guns were mounted abreast on the forecastle and the quarterdeck, with the remaining four guns positioned port and starboard amidships. They also carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two above-water 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ships' protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower had armour inches thick. They had a waterline belt thick. Career Sentinel was laid down by Vickers Limited at their shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness on 8 June 1903, launched on 19 April 1904 and completed in April 1905.Morris, p. 113 She was originally to be named HMS Inchkeith, but was renamed in 1903, prior to launching.Friedman 2009, p. 302 Not long after completion, two additional 12-pounder guns were added and the 3-pounder guns were replaced with six QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns. The ship began her career with the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean in 1906, before being recalled to join the Channel Fleet, and then reduced to reserve in the Home Fleet from 1907. In February 1910 she was recommissioned as the leader of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla at Chatham and refitted there in June.Gardiner & Gray, p. 17 About 1911–1912, her main guns were replaced by nine guns, arranged four on each broadside and the remaining gun on the quarterdeck.McBride, p. 274 After another refit in 1912 at HM Dockyard, Devonport, Sentinel was assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron in 1913 for the annual manoeuvres and was then transferred to lead the 9th Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. The ship joined the 6th Destroyer Flotilla at Dover later that year. After the start of the First World War in August 1914, Sentinel was serving with the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in the Firth of Forth. In 1915 she was temporarily assigned with 6th Light Cruiser Squadron in the Humber to defend against Zeppelin raids, before she was transferred to the Mediterranean and then to the Aegean in 1918.

He is best remembered for his time as Vice-Chairman of Aberdeen F.C., where he was regarded as one of the game's most forward-thinking and innovative characters. He was inducted into the Aberdeen FC \\"Hall of Fame\\" as one of the founding members in 2003. Playing and coaching career Anderson was born and grew up in Aberdeen, and showed promise as a player from an early age. He was capped by Scotland Schoolboys and joined the Junior team Mugiemoss as a teenager. Bill Struth, manager of Rangers, expressed an interest in the young Anderson, but instead he signed for his local team in 1943. Wartime delayed his senior debut until 1948, and his time as a player at Pittodrie coincided with a lean period in the club's fortunes. One of the few highlights of his time there as a player was a Scottish Cup tie in 1950 against Celtic at Parkhead, in which Anderson scored the only goal. This was the first time that Aberdeen had beaten Celtic in a cup tie in Glasgow. During his time as an Aberdeen player, Anderson spent a short period at Hartlepools United, playing only two games for the English club.\\"In the Mad Crowd, A Hartlepool United resource – Chris Anderson According to the Aberdeen official website, Red Web – Aberdeen Hall of Fame: Chris Anderson] (registration needed) he was only denied senior international honours by a knee injury sustained playing against Celtic. In 1953, Anderson was transferred to Arbroath, where he ended his playing career. Anderson was forced to give up the game in 1956 following a series of injuries, but stayed with Arbroath as assistant to the manager, Tommy Gray.A concise post war history of the Red Lichties – 1956–57 The following season, he was appointed chief coach (rather than manager) in place of Gray, and steered Arbroath to promotion in 1958–59. The following campaign in the first division ended in relegation, however, and Anderson was replaced as manager by John Prentice before the end of the season.A concise post war history of the Red Lichties – 1957–58 A concise post war history of the Red Lichties – 1958–59 A concise post war history of the Red Lichties – 1959–60 Educator and Administrator Anderson joined the board of directors at Aberdeen in 1967, and was made vice- chairman three years later. He also had a distinguished career in education, and before his retirement he was secretary of RGIT, a prominent technology college, later granted university status. His OBE was awarded for services to both education and sport, but it is as a football administrator and visionary that he is best known. Anderson's time on the board at Aberdeen coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and he is considered to have been a driving force behind that success. As well as being instrumental in the development of Pittodrie as one of the first all-seater stadia in Britain, he was a prime mover in the creation of the Scottish Premier Division in 1975, a response to the declining attendances of the time. As a member of the Aberdeen board, he was responsible for the appointment of Alex Ferguson as manager in 1978. Ferguson noted that Death Anderson took early retirement from his post at RGIT in 1984, intending to focus more of his energies on running the football club as chairman. However, following an operation to correct a hernia in 1984, he noticed a stiffness in his right side, which was diagnosed as motor neurone disease. He continued to serve on the Aberdeen board in spite of his increasing disability, and was still well enough to attend the 1985 Scottish League Cup Final victory over Hibs. He realised that this would be his last visit to Hampden Park: By the time of the 1986 Scottish Cup Final, later that season, Anderson was unable to move independently, and was only able to communicate with technological assistance. He died 17 days later, at the age of 61. The Chris Anderson Stadium in Aberdeen is named after him.

That is, the theory proposes that certain features of at least some of the poetry may be explained by positing oral-formulaic composition. While Anglo-Saxon (Old English) epic poetry may bear some resemblance to Ancient Greek epics such as the Iliad and Odyssey, the question of if and how Anglo-Saxon poetry was passed down through an oral tradition remains a subject of debate, and the question for any particular poem unlikely to be answered with perfect certainty. Parry and Lord had already demonstrated the density of metrical formulas in Ancient Greek. In Homeric verse, for example, a phrase like eos rhododaktylos (\\"rosy fingered dawn\\") or oinops pontos (\\"winedark sea\\") occupy a certain metrical pattern that fits, in modular fashion, into the six-colon Greek hexameter, and aid the aioidos or bard in extempore composition. Moreover, phrases of this type would be subject to internal substitutions and adaptations, permitting flexibility in response to narrative and grammatical needs: podas okus axilleus (\\"swift footed Achilles\\") is metrically equivalent to koruthaiolos ektor (\\"glancing-helmed Hektor\\"). Parry and Lord observed that the same phenomenon was apparent in the Old English alliterative line: :Hrothgar mathelode helm Scildinga (\\"Hrothgar spoke, protector of the Scildings\\") :Beowulf mathelode bearn Ecgtheowes (\\"Beowulf spoke, son of Ecgtheow\\") and in the junacki deseterac (heroic decasyllable) of the demonstrably oral poetry of the Serbs: :a besjedi od Orasca Tale (\\"But spoke of Orashatz Tale\\") :a besjedi Mujagin Halile (\\"But spoke Mujo's Halil\\") In Parry's view, formulas were not individual and idiosyncratic devices of particular artists, but the shared inheritance of a tradition of singers. They were easily remembered, making it possible for the singer to execute an improvisational composition-in-performance. In addition to verbal formulas, many themes have been shown to appear among the various works of Anglo-Saxon literature. The theory proposes to explain this fact by suggesting that the poetry was composed of formulae and themes from a stock common to the poetic profession, as well as literary passages composed by individual artists in a more modern sense. Larry Benson introduced the concept of \\"written-formulaic\\" to describe the status of some Anglo-Saxon poetry which, while demonstrably written, contains evidence of oral influences, including heavy reliance on formulas and themes Foley, John M.

New York: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1985. p. 42.; Foley cites \\"The Literary Character of Anglo-Saxon Formulaic Poetry\\" Publications of the Modern Language Association 81 (1966):, 334–41 Frequent oral-formulaic themes in Old English poetry include \\"Beasts of Battle\\" Magoun, Francis P. \\"The Oral-Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry.\\" Speculum 28 (1953): 446–67 and the \\"Cliff of Death\\".Fry, Donald K. \\"The Cliff of Death in Old English Poetry.\\" In Comparative Research in Oral Traditions: A Memorial for Milman Parry, ed.

Among the most thoroughly documented themes is \\"The Hero on the Beach\\". D.K. Crowne first proposed this theme, defined by four characteristics: :A Hero on the Beach. :Accompanying \\"Retainers.\\" :A Flashing Light. :The Completion or Initiation of a Journey. One example Crowne cites in his article is that which concludes Beowulf's fight with the monsters during his swimming match with Breca: Those sinful creatures had no fill of rejoicing that they consumed me, assembled at feast at the sea bottom; rather, in the morning, wounded by blades they lay up on the shore, put to sleep by swords, so that never after did they hinder sailors in their course on the sea. The light came from the east, the bright beacon of God. :Næs hie ðære fylle gefean hæfdon, :manfordædlan, þæt hie me þegon, :symbel ymbsæton sægrunde neah; :ac on mergenne mecum wunde :be yðlafe uppe lægon, :sweordum aswefede, þæt syðþan na :ymb brontne ford brimliðende :lade ne letton. Leoht eastan com, :beorht beacen godes; :Beowulf, lines 562–70a Crowne drew on examples of the theme's appearance in twelve Anglo-Saxon texts, including one occurrence in Beowulf. It was also observed in other works of Germanic origin, Middle English poetry, and even an Icelandic prose saga. John Richardson held that the schema was so general as to apply to virtually any character at some point in the narrative, and thought it an instance of the \\"threshold\\" feature of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey monomyth. J. A. Dane, in an articleDane, J. A. \\"Finnsburh and Iliad IX: A Greek Survival of the Medieval Germanic Oral-Formulaic Theme The Hero on the Beach\\".

Oral- Formulaic Theory and Research: An Introduction and Annotated Bibliography, (NY: Garland Publishing, 1985, p. 200 claimed that the appearance of the theme in Ancient Greek poetry, a tradition without known connection to the Germanic, invalidated the notion of \\"an autonomous theme in the baggage of an oral poet\\". Foley's response was that Dane misunderstood the nature of oral tradition, and that in fact the appearance of the theme in other cultures evidenced its traditional roots.

Completed in 1905 the ship was placed in reserve until she was commissioned in 1907 as part of the Home Fleet. She then spent the next seven years moving on and off of active service in British waters. Skirmisher was assigned to coastal defence duties when the First World War began in 1914, although she was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1915 and then to the Aegean two years later. The ship returned home in mid-1919 and was sold for scrap in 1920. Design and description The Sentinel-class ships were one of four classes of scout cruisers ordered by the Admiralty in 1902–1903 and 1903–1904 Naval Programmes. These ships were intended to work with destroyer flotillas, leading their torpedo attacks and backing them up when attacked by other destroyers, although they were rendered obsolete as faster, turbine-engined, destroyers entered service before the First World War. They had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew consisted of 289 officers and ratings.Friedman 2009, pp. 100, 294. The ships were powered by two four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines fed by 12 Vickers-Express water-tube boilers, and driving a pair of three-bladed propellers. The turbines were rated at to meet the required speed of .The Engineer 10 March 1905, p. 240. When Sentinel ran her sea trials, she reached a speed of from for eight hours.McBride 1994, p. 277.

Skirmishers main armour protection consisted of an arched protective deck, covering the full length of the ship, which was thick, while the ship's conning tower was protected by of armour. She also had a waterline belt thick. The scout cruisers were intended to lead and support destroyer flotillas, and their armament was meant to fight destroyers rather than heavier ships. Main gun armament consisted of ten 12-pounder (76 mm) QF guns, arranged three abreast fore-and-aft to give maximum end-on fire for chase engagements and two more guns on each beam. This was supplemented by eight 3-pounder (47 mm) guns. Two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted in above-water mounts, with a single spare torpedo carried.Friedman 2009, pp. 100–101, 294–295. This armament was considered too light, and an additional two 12-pounder guns were added on the ship's beams soon after commissioning, while the 3-pounder guns were replaced by six 6-pounder (57 mm) guns. She was rearmed again in 1911–1912, when the 12-pounders were replaced by nine 4-inch (102 mm) guns.Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, pp. 84–85. Construction and career Skirmisher, the only ship of her name to serve with the Royal Navy,Colledge and Ward 2006, p. 324. was laid down at Vickers, Sons & Maxim's Barrow-in- Furness shipyard on 29 July 1903 and was launched on 7 February 1905. Completed in July 1905 at a cost of about £276,579,Hythe 1912, p. 191. she was initially placed in reserve. In 1907, Skirmisher commissioned as leader of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla based at Dover, part of the Home Fleet. In May 1909 she became leader of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, moving to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth in 1910. She was refitted in 1912, and took part in the 1913 Naval Manoeuvres before joining the 7th Destroyer Flotilla, a patrol flotilla equipped with older destroyers, as leader in July 1913.Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 17.Manning 1961, p. 25. During her early career, her captains included Walter Cowan and William Boyle, both of whom would later rise to the rank of Admiral. Skirmisher remained leader of the 7th Flotilla, based at Devonport, on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War. Following the outbreak of war, the 7th Flotilla moved to the Humber on the East Coast of Britain.Manning 1961, p. 25.Dittmar and Colledge 1972, p. 18. On 15 December 1914, German battlecruisers, supported by the battleships of the main German High Seas Fleet set out on a raid against the coastal towns of Scarborough, Whitby and Hartlepool. While the British had been warned by radio intercepts that the Germans were likely to carry out some sort of action, and sent out forces from the Grand Fleet to intercept, Admiral George A. Ballard, Admiral of Patrols in overall command of all the patrol flotillas, had, owing to poor weather, ordered the forces under his command to remain in harbor until they received explicit orders to sail.Massie 2009, pp. 328–332. On receiving word of the bombardments, Ballard set out from the Humber in Skirmisher at together with eight torpedo boats. Heavy seas forced Ballard to send the torpedo boats back to port, while he searched up the coast in Skirmisher for the German raiders. Skirmisher failed to find the Germans, who had sailed eastwards well before Ballard reached the bombarded towns.Corbett 1921, pp. 22, 41. In May 1915 Skirmisher, still based on the Humber, joined the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron, with duties including patrolling to spot German Zeppelins.Corbett 1921, p. 403. By October 1915, the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron had been broken up, and Skirmisher had joined the Mediterranean Fleet. Skirmisher remained part of the Mediterranean Fleet throughout 1916 and into 1917, joining the Aegean Squadron in September that year. On 20 January 1918, the Turkish battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim (formerly the German ) and light cruiser Midilli (formerly ) made a sortie into the Mediterranean from the Dardanelles. The two Turkish ships attacked and sunk the monitors and in the Battle of Imbros. On hearing of the attack on the monitors, Captain P. W. Dumas, commander of the old pre-dreadnought battleship , in port at the British base of Mudos with Skirmisher, the scout and the light cruiser , ordered these ships to raise steam in preparation to set out against the enemy force. Meanwhile, Vice-Admiral Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz, commander of the Turkish force ordered Yavuz and Midilli to attack Mudros. Both Turkish ships struck mines, with Midilli soon sinking and Yavuz badly damaged. By the time the British ships had left Mudros harbor, Yavuz was re-entering the Dardanelles, protected against surface attack by shore batteries. Skirmisher remained part of the Aegean Squadron until the end of the war. Skirmisher had been ordered to return to home waters by May 1919, and was in reserve at Immingham in the Humber by June. On 3 March 1920 she was sold for scrap to Thos W Ward, of Preston.Dittmar and Colledge 1972, p. 44.

It usually refers to removal of the vocal cord, often for the purpose of treating laryngeal cancer. The word is derived from the Greek, combining chorde and ektome meaning excision. It can be carried out by traditional surgical techniques or, increasingly, by carbon dioxide laser. CO2 laser cordectomy has allowed the treatment of glottic carcinoma as a day case procedure. The procedure has also been carried out by veterinarians to reduce the volume of incessant barking by dogs. In humans, this type of operation is usually done by Otolaryngologists. Prior to surgery, the patient must be informed of serious, debilitating, and permanent consequences of surgery, most notably the loss of speaking capacity with severity correlating to the portion of vocal cords removed. A patient will be incapable of producing most vocal sounds following total cordectomy, although certain primal deep guttural screams may still be produced, with the patient almost always retaining the ability to speak in whispers. There is little no chance of a patient recovering their voice following a complete or near- complete cordectomy as the procedure literally removes the organs responsible for vocal utterances, and patients with a less-than-entire cordectomy will always lose some or most of their vocal range (again corresponding to the section and amount of removed vocal cords). Doctors are encouraged to explore alternative communication technologies with patients (such as voice-boxes, whisper-amplifying devices, and text=to-speak software) prior to determining the acceptability of the procedure. Patients should be made to understand that the procedure is absolutely permanent and their vocal capacity (with current technology) will never recover to its range prior to the surgery, and patients with small percentages of cord removals will experience disproportionately severe loss of vocal range compared to the loss suffered by patients who have undergone a near-entire cordectomy procedure.

She was married to the Croatian magnate Mladen III Šubić, Prince of Bribir from noble Šubić family. They ruled from Klis Fortress in Dalmatia. After Mladen III Šubić's death, she ruled as his widow over Skradin and Klis. Krka monastery In 1345, Krka monastery was mentioned for the first time as the endowment of princess Jelena. Klis and Skradin Krka monastery After the death of Prince Mladen III (1348), the Dalmatian cities of Klis and Skradin were ruled by Jelena, in the name of their son Mladen IV. She had many opponents, beginning from 1351. Firstly, from the wife of Paul III, Catherine Dandolo from Venice, then Jelena Šubić, the mother of Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia. The mother of Tvrtko was openly supported by King Louis I of Hungary, although Louis I in reality wanted these cities for himself. In 1355, the Republic of Venice sent an offer to buy the cities from her, but as she refused, and was unable to defend the cities from the many pretenders, she asked her brother Emperor Stefan Dušan for aid. Dušan sent Palman to Klis and Đuraš Ilijić to Skradin. The cities were subsequently given up, after the inhabitants showed unreadiness and some non-decisive fighting, with Đuraš ceding Skradin to Venice after the death of Dušan (December 20, 1355). Dušan had sought a flotilla from Venice for his planned campaign on Constantinople, and had ordered Đuraš to cede Skradin if it was unable to be defended. Klis was subsequently ceded to the Hungarians by Palman without conflict. Palman took Jelena with him, but Mladen IV stayed as a political hostage.

They are considered to have died at Gabii. According to tradition, Getulius was the husband of Saint Symphorosa.St. Getulius – Catholic OnlineCATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Saint Symphorosa Getulius is a name meaning \\"of the Gaetuli\\", which was a tribe of North Africa.San Getulio Legends and burial According to his legend, Getulius was a native of Gabii in Sabina. Getulius was an officer in the Roman army who resigned when he became a Christian. He retired to his estates near Tivoli. Caerealis was an imperial legate sent to arrest him but was converted to Christianity by Getulius. Primitivus was another officer sent to arrest him, but he was also converted. Amantius was Getulius' brother. According to his Passio, all four men were tied to a stake and set alight. However, the fire did not harm them, so they were brutally clubbed and then beheaded. According to the Roman Martyrology, Getulius was killed on the Via Salaria and is called the father of the Seven Martyrs and the husband of Symphorosa. His companions are called Caerealis, Amantius, and Primitivus. They were imprisoned, thrown into the flames but emerged unharmed, and then beaten to death with clubs. The legend further states that Saint Symphorosa buried them in an arenarium on her estate. Their seven sons (not to be confused with the seven sons of Felicity of Rome) are named specifically. According to their legend, each of them suffered a different kind of martyrdom. Crescens was pierced through the throat, Julian through the breast, Nemesius through the heart, Primitivus was wounded at the navel, Justinus was pierced through the back, Stracteus (Stacteus, Estacteus) was wounded at the side, and Eugenius was cleft in two parts from top to bottom. The Martyrology of Ado states: consumati sunt beati Martyres Gethulii in fundo Capriolis, viam Salariam, ab urbe Romam, plus minus miliario decimotertio, supra flumium Tiberim, in partem Savinensium. By Capriolis, viam Salariam, Ado is referring to a place on the Tiber River later known in the Middle Ages as the Corte di San Getulio (today part of Montopoli di Sabina), because a church was built here that originally held some of the saint's relics. In 867, Abbot Peter of Farfa moved these relics to his abbey in a solemn ceremony. However, Getulius' relics are also considered to lie in Rome. Veneration The façade of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria There was previously a church of San Getulio at Teramo. Getulius' relics are purported to be at Rome, in the principal altar of the church of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria. The relics of his purported wife St. Symphorosa and their seven sons were transferred to the Church of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria at Rome by Pope Stephen II in 752. A sarcophagus was found here in 1610, bearing the inscription: Hic requiescunt corpora SS. Martyrum Simforosae, viri sui Zotici (Getulii) et Filiorum ejus a Stephano Papa translata. They were placed in a glass urn during the pontificate of Pius IV, who placed the relics in an urn of glass. In 1584, part of his relics were donated by Gregory XIII to the Jesuits, and these relics are found in a chapel near the Villa d'Este. Some relics were taken to Jesuit colleges in India and Spain (June 25, 1572). On September 26, 1587, to prevent further distribution, Mariano Perbenedetti, governor of Rome, enclosed the rest of the relics at Sant'Angelo in a sarcophagus of marble. This same sarcophagus also holds relics of Cyrus and John.

In 2015-16 the factory of \\"Jermuk Mayr Gortsaran\\" founded in 1951 was acquired by the Jermuk Group. History The area of Jermuk was first mentioned in writing in 189 AD, when the Jermuk fortress was built, with the eponymous town being founded some time later. According to historical records, Jermuk was the summer residence of the Armenian princes of the neighbouring province of Syunik. The first surveys of the area around Jermuk (including the composition and properties of its mineral waters) were made in 1830 by the Russian geologist and engineer G.

This taxonomy of this order is not clear, but it may belong to Meridiungulata (along with Notoungulata, Litopterna, Pyrotheria and Xenungulata). In turn, Meridungulata is believed to belong to the extant superorder Laurasiatheria. Some scientists have regarded the astrapotheres (and sometimes the Meridiungulata all together) as members of the clade Atlantogenata. However, recent collogen and mitonchodrial DNA sequence data places at least the notoungulates and litopterns firmly within Laurasiatheria, as a sister group to the perissodactyls.  Description  Astrapotherium magnum skull Their lophodont molars and tusk-like canines became extremely large and ever-growing in later astrapotheres. The upper molars lack an ectocingulum and are dominated by well-developed ectoloph and protoloph. Additional lophs formed in some derived taxa. They had lower molars with two cross-lophs, including a high protocristid, and eventually became almost selenodont. As a result, their dentition is similar to notoungulates, but it seems to have evolved independently. The cheek teeth are similar to rhinocerotoids, including similar microstructure, which indicate they had the same function. Postcranially, astrapotheres are relatively robust and more or less graviportal but have slender long bones, most notably in the hindlegs, suggesting they were amphibious. In order to support their proboscises and large heads they had relatively long and massive necks in relation to the rest of the vertebral column. Their feet are pentadactyl with short and stout podial and metapodial bones. Most characteristic for the order are the flat astragalus, equipped with a short neck and a flat head, articulating with both the navicular and cuboid bones; and their calcaneus with its enlarged peroneal tubercle. Three families are recognized: Eoastrapostylopidae from the late Paleocene, Trigonostylopidae from the Paleocene-Eocene, and Astrapotheriidae from the Eocene-Miocene. The Brazilian, Itaboraian Tetragonostylops and the Argentinian, Riochican Eoastrapostylops are the oldest astrapotheres. The latter, with its low-crowned and lophoselenodont cheek teeth, is considered the most primitive astrapothere. Trigonostylopids are distinct from other astrapotheres in their ear anatomy but are included in the order because of otherwise similar characters. Antarctodon is one of few eutherian mammals, as well as one of the last known terrestrial vertebrates, found in Antarctica. Skull of Granastrapotherium The most famous member of the order is undoubtedly Astrapotherium, a long elephant-like beast that had lost its upper incisors and developed ever-growing canine tusks. They had lost their anterior premolars, resulting in a gap between their tusks and the hypsodont cheek teeth. The short and retracted nasal bones indicate a moderately developed proboscis. The small Eocene Trigonostylops lacked such retracted nasals and probably also a proboscis. Other astrapotheriids, such as the Casamayoran Scaglia and Albertogaudrya, were between a sheep and a tapir in size and already the largest South American mammals.  Classification  Trigonostylops There is no scientific consensus regarding the classification within Astrapotheria. For example, originally described Tetragonostylops as a trigonostylopid but Soria 1982 and 1984 transferred the genus to Astrapotheriidae and concluded that the remaining two genera in that family, Trigonostylops and Shecenia, form a basal collateral branch within Astrapotheriidae. According to , Trigonostylopidae (including Eoastrapostylopidae) is the stem group of Astrapotheriidae. * Astrapotheriidae .

He is the hunchbacked assistant of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, and the grandson of Igor, the original assistant of Frederick's grandfather, Victor Frankenstein.  Character  Igor wants to follow in his grandfather's footsteps and live up to the legacy of hunchbacks throughout history who have served the Frankenstein family. Sadly, his desire to serve his new master is not always matched by a sufficient amount of practical know-how.  1974 film  In the original film, the character is the lab assistant Herr Falkstein assigned to Dr. Frederick Frankenstein. When he meets the Doctor, he takes it as a given that he will work for him. (\\"My grandfather used to work for your grandfather... of course, the rates have gone up.\\") Marty Feldman added another comic twist to his character, by deliberately swapping which side the hump on his back was located; when Doctor Frankenstein asked him about it, Igor replied simply: \\"What hump?\\" Wilder had written the role specifically for Feldman.

It is a one-way bridge carrying road traffic from the 13th arrondissement to the 12th arrondissement. Another one-way bridge further downstream, Pont d'Austerlitz, carries traffic in the opposite direction. History In 1986, the Council of Paris (Conseil de Paris) decided to construct a new bridge between the Pont de Bercy and the Pont d'Austerlitz in southeast Paris, to imitate the design of the Pont d'Austerlitz. The aims of this project were three in number: (1) to ease the traffic on the Pont d'Austerlitz, the most heavily trafficked bridge in the capital; (2) to connect the new Bibliothèque nationale de France (also known as the François Mitterrand Library) to the district of Bercy on the Right Bank of the Seine; and (3) to establish a direct link between the Gare de Lyon and the Gare d'Austerlitz. A Europe-wide competition was held in 1987 to determine the best project design. At the conclusion of the competition, the concept set forth by Louis Arretche and Roman Karasinski was chosen for the bridge. The rationale for this choice was that it did not detract from the aesthetic exterior of the Viaduc d'Austerlitz, a structure further downstream, and that it discreetly preserved the existing view of the river. Bridge structure The bridge has a single steel deck measuring 270 m long and 35 m wide, and the shape of which resembles an aircraft wing. It is supported by two concrete piers. Linking each pier to the deck are two conical steel frames shaped like upside-down tents. The bridge roadway (not including footpaths and cycle lanes) is 18 m wide and carries four lanes of northeast-bound traffic from the Left Bank to the Right Bank. Two cycle lanes to the upstream side of the bridge and two footpaths, one on each side of it, permit unmotorized traffic to cross.

Formulation The Critical State concept is an idealization of the observed behavior of saturated remoulded clays in triaxial compression tests, and it is assumed to apply to undisturbed soils. It states that soils and other granular materials, if continuously distorted (sheared) until they flow as a frictional fluid, will come into a well-defined critical state. At the onset of the critical state, shear distortions \\\\ \\\\varepsilon_s occur without any further changes in mean effective stress \\\\ p', deviatoric stress \\\\ q (or yield stress, \\\\ \\\\sigma_y, in uniaxial tension according to the von Mises yielding criterion), or specific volume \\\\ u: :\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial p'}{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_s}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial q}{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_s}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_s}=0 where, :\\\\ u=1+e :\\\\ p'=\\\\frac{1}{3}(\\\\sigma_1'+\\\\sigma_2'+\\\\sigma_3') :\\\\ q= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(\\\\sigma_1' - \\\\sigma_2')^2 + (\\\\sigma_2' - \\\\sigma_3')^2 + (\\\\sigma_1' - \\\\sigma_3')^2}{2}} However, for triaxial conditions \\\\ \\\\sigma_2'=\\\\sigma_3'. Thus, :\\\\ p'=\\\\frac{1}{3}(\\\\sigma_1'+2\\\\sigma_3') :\\\\ q=(\\\\sigma_1'-\\\\sigma_3') All critical states, for a given soil, form a unique line called the Critical State Line (CSL) defined by the following equations in the space \\\\ (p', q, v): :\\\\ q=Mp' :\\\\ u=\\\\Gamma-\\\\lambda \\\\ln(p') where \\\\ M, \\\\ \\\\Gamma, and \\\\ \\\\lambda are soil constants.

History In an attempt to advance soil testing techniques, Kenneth Harry Roscoe of Cambridge University, in the late forties and early fifties, developed a simple shear apparatus in which his successive students attempted to study the changes in conditions in the shear zone both in sand and in clay soils. In 1958 a study of the yielding of soil based on some Cambridge data of the simple shear apparatus tests, and on much more extensive data of triaxial tests at Imperial College London from research led by Professor Sir Alec Skempton at the Imperial Geotechnical Laboratories, led to the publication of the critical state concept . Roscoe obtained his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineeringOxford Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970, entry on Roscoe, Kenneth Harry, pp 894-896 and his experiences trying to create tunnels to escape when held as a prisoner of war by the Nazis during WWII introduced him to soil mechanics. Subsequent to this 1958 paper, concepts of plasticity were introduced by Schofield and publa classic text book . Schofield was taught at Cambridge by Prof. John Baker, a structural engineer who was a strong believer in designing structures that would fail \\"plastically\\". Prof. Baker's theories strongly influenced Schofield's thinking on soil shear. Prof. Baker's views were developed from his pre-war work on steel structures and further informed by his wartime experiences assessing blast-damaged structures and with the design of the \\"Morrison Shelter\\", an air-raid shelter which could be located indoors . Original Cam-Clay Model The Original Cam-Clay model is based on the assumption that the soil is isotropic, elasto-plastic, deforms as a continuum, and it is not affected by creep. The yield surface of the Cam clay model is described by the equation : f(p,q,p_c) = q + M\\\\,p\\\\,\\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\frac{p}{p_c}\\\\right] \\\\le 0 where q is the equivalent stress, p is the pressure, p_c is the pre-consolidation pressure, and M is the slope of the critical state line in p-q space. The pre-consolidation pressure evolves as the void ratio (e) (and therefore the specific volume v) of the soil changes. A commonly used relation is : e = e_0 - \\\\lambda \\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\frac{p_c}{p_{c0}}\\\\right] where \\\\lambda is the virgin compression index of the soil. A limitation of this model is the possibility of negative specific volumes at realistic values of stress. An improvement to the above model for p_c is the bilogarithmic form : \\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\frac{1+e}{1+e_0}\\\\right] = \\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\frac{v}{v_0}\\\\right] = - \\\\tilde{\\\\lambda} \\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\frac{p_c}{p_{c0}}\\\\right] where \\\\tilde{\\\\lambda} is the appropriate compressibility index of the soil. :Cam-clay yield surface in p-q space. Cam- clay yield surface in principal stress space. Modified Cam-Clay Model Professor John Burland of Imperial College who worked with Professor Roscoe is credited with the development of the modified version of the original model. The difference between the Cam Clay and the Modified Cam Clay Roscoe K.H. and Burland J.B., 1968, On the generalised stress-strain behaviour of ‘wet’ clay, Eng. plasticity, Cambridge Univ. Press, 535-609 (MCC) is that the yield surface of the MCC is described by an ellipse and therefore the plastic strain increment vector (which is perpendicular to the yield surface) for the largest value of the mean effective stress is horizontal, and hence no incremental deviatoric plastic strain takes place for a change in mean effective stress (for purely hydrostatic states of stress). This is very convenient for constitutive modelling in numerical analysis, especially finite element analysis, where numerical stability issues are important (as a curve needs to be continuous in order to be differentiable). The yield surface of the modified Cam-clay model has the form : f(p,q,p_c) = \\\\left[\\\\frac{q}{M}\\\\right]^2 + p\\\\,(p - p_c) \\\\le 0 where p is the pressure, q is the equivalent stress, p_c is the pre-consolidation pressure, and M is the slope of the critical state line. :Modified Cam-clay yield surface in p-q space. Modified Cam-clay yield surface in principal stress space. Critique The basic concepts of the elasto-plastic approach were first proposed by two mathematicians Daniel C. Drucker and William Prager (Drucker and Prager, 1952) in a short eight page note. In their note, Drucker and Prager also demonstrated how to use their approach to calculate the critical height of a vertical bank using either a plane or a log spiral failure surface. Their yield criterion is today called the Drucker-Prager yield criterion. Their approach was subsequently extended by Kenneth H. Roscoe and others in the soil mechanics department of Cambridge University. Critical state and elasto-plastic soil mechanics have been the subject of criticism ever since they were first introduced. The key factor driving the criticism is primarily the implicit assumption that soils are made of isotropic point particles. Real soils are composed of finite size particles with anisotropic properties that strongly determine observed behavior. Consequently, models based on a metals based theory of plasticity are not able to model behavior of soils that is a result of anisotropic particle properties, one example of which is the drop in shear strengths post peak strength, i.e., strain-softening behavior. Because of this elasto-plastic soil models are only able to model \\"simple stress-strain curves\\" such as that from isotropic normally or lightly over consolidated \\"fat\\" clays, i.e., CL-ML type soils constituted of very fine grained particles. Also, in general, volume change is governed by considerations from elasticity and, this assumption being largely untrue for real soils, results in very poor matches of these models to volume changes or pore pressure changes. Further, elasto-plastic models describe the entire element as a whole and not specifically conditions directly on the failure plane, as a consequence of which, they do not model the stress-strain curve post failure, particularly for soils that exhibit strain-softening post peak. Finally, most models separate out the effects of hydrostatic stress and shear stress, with each assumed to cause only volume change and shear change respectively. In reality, soil structure, being analogous to a \\"house of cards,\\" shows both shear deformations on the application of pure compression, and volume changes on the application of pure shear. Additional criticisms are that the theory is \\"only descriptive,\\" i.e., only describes known behavior and lacking the ability to either explain or predict standard soil behaviors such as, why the void ratio in a one dimensional compression test varies linearly with the logarithm of the vertical effective stress. This behavior, critical state soil mechanics simply assumes as a given. For these reasons, critical-state and elasto-plastic soil mechanics have been subject to charges of scholasticism; the tests to demonstrated its validity are usually \\"conformation tests\\" where only simple stress-strain curves are demonstrated to be modeled satisfactorily. The critical-state and concepts surrounding it have a long history of being \\"scholastic,\\" with Sir Alec Skempton, the “founding father” of British soil mechanics, attributed the scholastic nature of CSSM to Roscoe, of whom he said: “…he did little field work and was, I believe, never involved in a practical engineering job.” .In the 1960s and 1970s, Prof. Alan Bishop at Imperial College used to routinely demonstrate the inability of these theories to match the stress-strain curves of real soils. Joseph (2013) has suggested that critical-state and elasto-plastic soil mechanics meet the criterion of a “degenerate research program” a concept proposed by the philosopher of science Imre Lakatos, for theories where excuses are used to justify an inability of theory to match empirical data. Response The claims that critical state soil mechanics is only descriptive and meets the criterion of a degenerate research program have not been settled. Andrew Jenike used a logarithmic- logarithmic relation to describe the compression test in his theory of critical state and admitted decreases in stress during converging flow and increases in stress during diverging flow. Chris Szalwinski has defined a critical state as a multi-phase state at which the specific volume is the same in both solid and fluid phases. Under his definition the linear-logarithmic relation of the original theory and Jenike's logarithmic-logarithmic relation are special cases of a more general physical phenomenon.

The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB. Basic Books. p. 362. . He defected in West Berlin in 1961. Early biography Born to a family of villagers not far from Lviv, Stashynsky completed his early education in 1948 and studied to become a teacher at the Lviv Pedagogical Institute. Stashynsky's family were supporters of the anti-Soviet Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). His three sisters were members of the organization. In 1950, he was arrested for traveling without a ticket on public transportation to Lviv from his village. After agreeing to act as an informer, he was released. Through his sisters, he infiltrated the workings of the UPA and forwarded information to the MGB. In 1953, he was sent to Kiev to continue studies in espionage. In 1954, he was sent to East Germany under the name Josef Lehmann where he perfected his knowledge of German. In 1956, he often traveled to Munich where he began to perfect his false identity. Assassin Stashynsky received the instructions to carry out the assassination directly from the headquarters of the KGB in Moscow. At that time, Alexander Shelepin was Chairman of the Committee for State Security of the Council of Ministers. The assassination was known to and approved by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Nikita Khrushchev. In 1957, the KGB trained the 25-year-old Stashynsky to use a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed cyanide capsule. The gas was designed to induce cardiac arrest, making the victim's death look like a heart attack. Stashynsky used the weapon to kill Lev Rebet in 1957. On 15 October 1959, he used an improved version of the same gas gun to assassinate Stepan Bandera in Munich. Stashynsky was honoured by Moscow with the Order of the Red Banner by Shelepin for his work and given his final assignment to kill Yaroslav Stetsko. Stetsko, also living in Munich, was a prominent anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalist leader and also the President of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations. He was to be assassinated in 1960, but it could not be perpetrated for reasons which have not been clarified. Defection Stashynsky met and fell in love with an East German woman, Inge Pohl, in 1957. At first his bosses tried to persuade him not to marry a foreigner, but he persisted. However, the KGB demanded that Pohl become a Soviet citizen and KGB agent. Although he was unhappy with the arrangement, Stashynsky nevertheless agreed as it was the only way he could marry Pohl. After they were married, the KGB bugged their Moscow apartment and heard them express anti-Soviet sentiments. The KGB would not let the couple travel abroad together out of fear of defection, which the couple was indeed planning. In 1961, Inge returned to East Berlin to give birth to their son, Peter, but Stashynsky was unable to visit them. In August, Peter suddenly developed a fever and died at four months old. The KGB relented after the family tragedy and allowed him to travel to East Berlin for the baby's funeral. Against KGB orders, Stashynsky took his Joseph Lehmann identity card with him to East Germany, as well as other documents that would confirm his identity as a KGB agent. On 13 August 1961, hours before their son's funeral, Stashynsky and his wife fled on foot from her parents’ home in Dallgow, walking to the town of Falkensee to avoid any KGB agents that would intercept them at the Dallgow train station. They took a taxi to East Berlin, where he used the Lehmann identity card at a checkpoint. They then traveled to West Berlin via train, where he defected to U.S. officials at a police station. The CIA was suspicious of Stashynsky, who was flown to Frankfurt for interrogation, and dubious of his claims that he had assassinated Rebet and Bandera. The CIA was unaware that Rebet had been murdered, and Stashynsky's account of his assassination of Bandera was inconsistent with what the U.S. knew of his death. The CIA had concluded that Bandera had been poisoned by someone close to him, and Stashynsky's claim of shooting him with a poison spray gun seemed farfetched. They concluded that Stashynsky \\"would not be valuable operationally as a double agent, that he was not a bona fide defector and the individual he purported to be.\\" After three weeks, the CIA – believing Stashynsky to be useless – handed him over to West German authorities, which now began to investigate him for the two murders. At first, the West German police were also suspicious of his stories, but after interrogation and visits to the two murder sites, where Stashynsky re-enacted the killings, authorities determined that Stashynsky was telling the truth. After Stashynsky's defection, the Soviet government tried to avert negative exposure. On 13 October 1961, the Soviet Union arranged a press conference in East Berlin where Soviet secret service agent Stefan Lippolz blamed the murder on the cashier of Bandera's own organization, Dmytro Myskiv, who had since died. However, it was established that Dmytro Myskiv was not in Munich when Bandera was assassinated but was in Rome at the time. Stashynsky was put on trial for the two murders in October 1962, and sentenced to eight years in prison. Explaining what motivated him to kill Rebet, Stashynsky told a court that he had been told that Rebet was \\"the leading theorist of the Ukrainians in exile,\\" since \\"in his newspapers Suchasna Ukrayina (Contemporary Ukraine), Chas (Time), and Ukrayinska Trybuna (Ukrainian Tribune) he not so much provided accounts of daily events as developed primarily ideological issues.\\" According to West German Intelligence chief Reinhard Gehlen, > ...Bohdan Stashinskyi, who had been persuaded by his German-born wife Inge > to confess to the crimes and take the load off his troubled conscience, > stuck resolutely to his statements. His testimony convinced the > investigating authorities. He reconstructed the crimes exactly as they had > happened, revisiting the crumbling business premises at the Stachus, in the > heart of Munich, where Lev Rebet had entered the office of a Ukrainian exile > newspaper, his suitcase in his hand. And he showed how the hydrogen cyanide > capsule had exploded in Rebet's face and how he had left him slumped over > the rickety staircase.

In 1966, Stashynsky was released from prison early on parole, and was reportedly handed over to the CIA. Bohdan Stashynsky and Inge Stashinsky were given new identities and provided asylum by South Africa in 1984.

She was used by the Union Navy as an escort gunboat in support of the Union Navy, mostly in various parts of the Caribbean, such as in Haiti, where her role was to protect American citizens. She was sold to the Haitian government in 1865 after becoming unseaworthy because of leaks.  Constructed in New York City, commissioned in 1864  Galatea was built at New York City in 1863 by J. B. and J. D. Van Dusen, Master Builders; she was launched in about late March 1863. Galatea was purchased by the Navy 31 July 1863 from the Neptune Steamship Co.; and commissioned 29 January 1864, Comdr. John Guest in command.  Supporting Union Navy control of the Caribbean  Galatea departed New York 21 February 1864 for service as a unit of the West India Squadron. Based at Cap-Haïtien in Haiti, where she arrived 29 February, she provided convoy protection in the West Indies to California mail steamers plying between New York City and Aspinwall (Colón, Panama). She had twice returned to New York City for repairs by 10 November 1864 when she was assigned with two other ships to convoy California mail streamers from Cap- Haïtien through the Windward Passage, between the islands of Nacassa and Mariguana.  Developing seawater leaks in her structure  During this cruise leaks developed which made Galatea unfit for arduous convoy duty. Remaining on station at Cape Haitien, she cruised to Key West, Florida, for provisions and dispatches and afforded protection to American citizens in Haiti until convoy service was discontinued in June 1865.  End-of-war decommissioning and sale to Haiti  Galatea arrived New York City from Cap- Haïtien 1 July 1865; decommissioned 12 July; and was sold to the Haitian government 15 August. Renamed Alexandre Pétion, on 20 September 1868, she attacked the rebel ships and at Petit-Goâve. Liberté was sunk; Sylvain was set afire and abandoned by her crew.

He wrote over 60 compositions for orchestra, band, choir and opera. Nixon received multiple awards and honors for his works, many of which contain a feel of the rhythms and dances of the early settlers of his native state of California. Biography Nixon was born and raised in California's Central Valley towns of Tulare and Modesto. Nixon attended Modesto Junior College from 1938-1940 where he studied clarinet with Frank Mancini, formerly of John Philip Sousa's band. He continued his studies at UC Berkeley, majoring in composition and receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1941. His studies were then interrupted by almost four years of active duty in the Navy during World War II, serving as the commanding officer of an LCMR in the Atlantic. Following the war Nixon returned to UC Berkeley, first receiving a M.A. degree and later a Ph.D. His primary teacher was Roger Sessions. He also studied with Arthur Bliss, Ernest Bloch, Charles Cushing, and Frederick Jacobi. In the summer of 1948, he studied privately with Arnold Schoenberg. From 1951 to 1959, Nixon was on the music faculty at Modesto Junior College. He was then appointed to the faculty at San Francisco State College, now San Francisco State University, in 1960 and began a long association with the Symphonic Band, which premiered many of his works. Most of Nixon's works are for band, but he has also composed for orchestra, chamber ensembles, solo piano, choral ensembles, as well as song cycles and an opera. His most popular and most-performed work is Fiesta del Pacifico, a piece for concert band. Nixon received several awards including a Phelan Award, the Neil A. Kjos Memorial Award, and five grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. He was elected to the American Bandmasters Association in 1973, the same year he won the association's Ostwald Award for his composition Festival Fanfare March. In 1997, Nixon was honored by the Texas Bandmasters Association as a Heritage American Composer. At his death, he was Professor Emeritus of Music at San Francisco State University. His students at San Francisco State University include Kent Nagano. Nixon died on October 13, 2009, from complications from leukemia at Mills Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame, California.Joshua Kosman, \\"SFSU Composer Roger Nixon Dies\\", San Francisco Chronicle (October 17, 2009) Selected works ;Stage * The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky, Opera in 4 scenes (1967); libretto by Ray Benedict West, Jr. adapted from the short story by Stephen Crane ;Orchestra * Air for Strings for string orchestra (1948) * Mooney's Grove Suite (1964, revised 1967) * Three Dances (1962) * Overture ;Concertante * Concerto for violin and orchestra (1950s) * Reflections for flute and band (1965) * Elegiac Rhapsody for viola and orchestra; initially composed as a separate work, used as movement II of the Viola Concerto * Concerto for viola and orchestra (1969) * Two Elegies for solo cello and cello ensemble (1978, 1984) ;Concert band * Music of Appreciation (1944, premiered 1992, published 1994) * Elegy and Fanfare-March (1958, revised 1967) * Fiesta del Pacifico (1960) * Prelude and Fugue (1961) * San Joaquin Sketches (1962, revised 1982) * Nocturne (1965) * Reflections (1965) * Centennial Fanfare-March (1970); composed for the centennial of the founding of Modesto, California * A Solemn Processional (published 1971) * Festival Fanfare-March (1971); received the 1973 Ostwald Award of the American Bandmasters Association * Psalm (1972, revised 1979) * Music for a Civic Celebration (1975) * Pacific Celebration Suite (1976) * Chamarita!

Originating in England, it is played particularly in the South of England, although it is played at League and County level in East Anglia, the Midlands and the North. There are also a few players in Eastern Townships, Quebec, Canada. Despite the name, carpet bowls is not just a trivial indoor game played at home. There is a formal English Carpet Bowls Association, and although the ECBA is relatively small, the game itself is played in many village halls up and down the country. Around the turn of the century there were more than 1,000 clubs. In accordance with the village hall background, the bowls mat is smaller at around 30 x 6 feet, and the inventors clearly paid less emphasis upon trying to maintain all the rules of the Mother game. For instance, Carpet Bowls dispenses with the notion of a 'ditch' and various sometimes complex rules associated with it. Bowls are delivered from an space at the front of the carpet and must avoid an 18-inch circular block placed in the centre of the carpet. The Jack is 2.5 inches in diameter (the same as for Indoor Bowls) and is placed on a centre line 3–6 feet from the end of the carpet. Aficionados of Carpet Bowls are keen to point out that, because a bowl must be delivered within the 18-inch delivery area whilst not standing on the carpet, it is rare for players to attempt to \\"break up the head\\" (attempting to spoil the end by delivering a forceful bowl that knocks the bowls and jack randomly). Carpet Bowlers regard this as a point of superiority over Indoor Bowls and Short Mat Bowls, as Carpet Bowls is really a game that relies heavily on the art of quality drawing woods and less on power and fortune. Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk compete each year in the Eastern Counties Championship and also play each in an Eastern Counties League. Suffolk have been the most successful side in recent years. The National Championships take place each year at the Potters Leisure Resort in Norfolk. Bedfordshire The clubs that participate in the Bedfordshire County Carpet Bowls League (Premier Division and Division One) are: Barton, Billington, Clophill, Cople, Cotton End, Gravenhurst, Haynes, Lilley, Maulden, Slip End, Toddington, Turvey and Wootton. Essex Essex County Carpet Bowls Association was formed in 1983. The original founding clubs included: Bradwell on Sea, Elmdon, Fyfield, Goldhanger, Great Easton, Great Horkesley, Purleigh, Stisted, Tolleshunt Knights, Weeley & Wrabness. Of these, Fyfield, Purleigh & Stisted are definitely still going strong. Today, there are over 100 clubs competing for the Essex County league and cup championships.

L. Stine House, or L.L. Stein House, is a historic house in Woodward, Oklahoma. It has also been known as the Bradbury Home. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 as \\"L.L. Stein House\\". It was deemed significant for its association with L.L. Stein, who was one of the original 5,000 or so land-run settlers of Woodward and was a prominent banker, and for it being one of few surviving homes built by pioneer settlers in the town, and for being the only large Classical Revival style building in Woodward. With The House was built in 1916 by architect U. G. Charles of Wichita, Kansas for L. L. Stine, an early banker in Woodward. The house is a three-story brick which was picked out of the Sears Catalog. Stine was the owner of Woodward's First National Bank which was built on the corner of 8th and Main in 1901. Fifteen years later he built the elaborate mansion that is known today as the Stine-Bradbury House. Mr. L.L. Stine & his wife separated, There was a small fire in the house, so Mr. Stine moved into a smaller house next to the Large house. The house was purchased after a small fire by Mr. & Mrs. Harold B. Bradbury in 1935 with their Daughter Mary Vivian and 10-year- old son Harold Madison. H.B. Bradbury owned the Bradbury Produce Company. Mr. & Mrs. H.B. Bradbury cared for Mr. Stine until he passed. The Bradburys had purchased a few items from the Stine Auction. Both Mr. & Mrs. H.B. Bradbury died in the house. Their Son, Harold Madison, Wife Maudie Lea Bradbury & two daughters lived in the house while caring for Mr. H.B. Bradbury before he died. The House is a Classical Revival building and is the only large Classical Revival building in Woodward. The house was listed on the National Register of Historical Places on October 7, 1983, by Mr. & Mrs. H.M. Bradbury, remained in their family until 1994.

Commissioners must be between the ages of 12 and 23.  Creation  In 1995, community members lobbied the Board of Supervisors to create a youth commission. When this effort failed, local activists worked with then- Supervisor Angela Alioto to place the creation of a youth commission on the November 1995 ballot. After failing to garner enough support from the Board of Supervisors, local activists with the help of then-Supervisor Angela Alioto placed the creation of a Youth Commission on the November 1995 ballot.San Francisco Youth Commission official website The measure passed with over 60 percent of the popular vote, and the San Francisco Youth Commission was created. The first Youth Commissioners were sworn into office in April 1996.  Appointments  The San Francisco Youth Commission has seventeen members. Each of the eleven members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors appoints one Commissioner. The remaining six Commissioners are appointed by the Mayor. Five of the Mayor's appointments are \\"diversity appointments,\\" made after the Supervisors' picks to ensure that the Commission is representative of the City's diverse youth population. Commissioners must live in San Francisco. Interested youth must submit a written application and complete individual and/or group interviews in the spring preceding their term of service. Returning Commissioners must reapply in order to serve multiple terms. After interviews are completed, Youth Commission staff make non-binding recommendations of prospective Commissioners to the Supervisors and Mayor. Supervisors may appoint Commissioners from outside of their district.  Accomplishments  As of 2015, the San Francisco Youth Commission has been in existence for nineteen years. During this time, it has advised the Mayor and Board of Supervisors on a variety of issues via public resolutions and statements. Healthy Kids In 2004, the Youth Commission successfully expanded \\"Healthy Kids,\\" San Francisco's universal health care system for children, to include 18- to 24-year-olds.Mayor's Office Press Room This preceded the City's expansion of universal health care to all residents, signed by Mayor Gavin Newsom in 2007. Reports The Youth Commission issues annual reports. In addition, the Commission has issued three special reports: San Francisco Youth Commission's Report on Sexual Assault & Harassment in San Francisco Schools Youth Commission's Education Committee Report on the State of San Francisco Schools Youth Commission's Housing Committee Report on the State of San Francisco's Youth Housing & Homeless Issue Transitional Youth Task Force/Interagency Council (From the Youth Commission's website.) > In 2005, the Youth Commission authored a resolution advising the Mayor to > evaluate the special needs of transitional young adults.

Two-thirds of the > Task Force's members are adults; the remaining one-third are young adult > advocates who have been involved with foster care, juvenile justice, mental > health, special needs, alternative education, or other city systems relevant > to transitional youth. Mayor Newsom allocated $500,000 in the FY2007 budget > to form an official Interagency Council, which works with City departments > who serve young adults to address gaps in available supportive services. The Task Force drafted 16 policy recommendations based on information gathered from focus groups involving over 100 youth across a range of systems. In 2007, the Task Force transformed into the Transition Age Youth San Francisco initiative (TAYSF) in order to implement these recommendations. TAYSF recently joined forces with the Workforce Investment Board of San Francisco Youth Council to address issues of workforce development for transition-age youth that the Task Force had identified through their community-based research. Skateboarding Task Force Due to increased tension between the San Francisco Police Department and local skateboarders, the Youth Commission created a Skateboard Task Force to work towards providing legal venues for youth to skate.Youth Commission: Skateboarding Task Force In 2003, Matt Gonzalez included creating skate parks in his official platform.Matt Gonzalez for Mayor: Prioritizing the City's Youth Youth Recognition Day > In 2001, former SFYC Chair Anthony E.

The first of his Pellucidar pastiches, it was first published by Ace Books in 1976. Set in Edgar Rice Burroughs' imaginary interior world of Pellucidar, the book features a species of intelligent flying reptiles (Mahars) invented by Burroughs in his first Pellucidar novel, At the Earth's Core. Holmes' human protagonist, Christopher West, was named in honor of his own son, Christopher West Holmes.Martin, John. \\"John Eric Holmes: Mahars of Pellucidar and Red Axe of Pellucidar\\". Plot West is an associate of Dr. Kinsley, who has developed a teleportation beam that can also see events taking place 200 miles below the surface. When they see people about to sacrifice a beautiful woman, Christopher obtains a pocket knife and a red fire axe and has himself beamed down to rescue the woman. Due to his unusual weapon, West becomes known as Red Axe among the stone-age human beings of Pellucidar. The story deals with West's efforts to free his new-found friends from the tyranny of the Mahars. The region visited by West is apparently an area of Pellucidar different from that in which Burroughs set his stories, from which the Mahars were driven at the end of the second book in the series, Pellucidar. Evidently there are other locales in which the reptiles are dominant. Therefore, West never runs into any of Burrough's human Pellucidarian characters, such as David Innes, Abner Perry, Dian the Beautiful, Ghak the Hairy One, or any of the others. Sequel John Eric Holmes wrote a sequel to Mahars of Pellucidar called Red Axe of Pellucidar, the publication of which was blocked by the Burroughs estate, despite its previous authorization of Mahars. Ready for print in 1980, it only saw publication much later in a limited private edition issued in 1993. A planned third book, to be called Swordsmen of Pellucidar, was never written.

She made her first appearance on-screen on 21 June 1995 and left after three years in May 1998.Deutsche Dailys.de (1) (German) Lahnstein returned to the role in 2001, where she was seen from 24 April to 5 October.Deutsche Dailys.de (2) (German) She came back another three years later and reappeared on 16 April 2004.Das Erste.de - Return 2004 (German) Lahnstein left the show for a short time, while being on contract, from June 2005 to March 2006 and from March to December 2007 during the pregnancy of her two children. She left again in December 2009 and returned in April 2010. Creation Introduction Only months after the show started, then 21-year-old Miriam Lahnstein was cast in the role of Tanja Wittkamp. A blonde beauty, who comes home from boarding school to see that her parents are broke and have to sell their stud farm. Aristocrat Christoph von Anstetten buys most of the horses, one of them Tanja's favorite. Jan Brandner sees the young woman crying over her lost and gets Christoph to promise that Tanja is always welcome to Castle Friedenau to visit her horse. For Tanja the ticket in a new world, where money rules and you can have a lot of influence. It doesn't take Tanja long to show her true colors, starting schemes and love affairs out of calculation and her own interest. Over the years In the beginning, Tanja starts off with little schemes and using people to get what she wants. That sort of changes, when Tanja murders her second husband and former stepson Rajan Rai to get the fortune of her first husband Ben von Anstetten. With her first murder committed it seemed that the end of Tanja is near. The soap villain murders two other characters, Cleo Winter and Tim Sander, before leaving the show. Tanja returns three years later to make several attempts to murder again - but without a success. After a plane crash, Tanja seems to be dead, but shows up three years later, in 2004, very much alive. Without further explanation it is mentioned that Donald Rush, who Tanja works for, cleared her criminal record and the authorities have no evidence whatsoever against Tanja, in spite of a few witnesses from her past being still alive. Tanja murders again in her first year back, putting the blame on one of the murders on Bernd von Beyenbach. Even though Bernd has an alibi, Tanja is never connected to the murder. Miriam Lahnstein then had to leave the show due to her first pregnancy, which led to making the character of Tanja pregnant as well. Actress and character return to the show nine months later with Tanja in a convent. She tries to maintain the pretense that she had changed, but it doesn't take long before she returns to her old self. But now with the character having a little son, Tanja is depicted as being less extreme and is not involved in any subsequent murders; the executives wanted to bring out the human aspect of her character and present her as both mother and villain. One year after her return, Miriam Lahnstein was expecting her second child which led to her leaving the show once more. This time without an on-screen pregnancy. Instead Tanja kidnapped her son and then faked her own death with the help of Adrian Degenhardt. In the following months Adrian had several telephone conversations with Tanja. A few of them with Miriam Lahnstein's voice. Tanja returned from the dead in December 2007 and is arrested for the first time for faking her death and kidnapping her son. But Tanja blackmails Ansgar von Lahnstein, the child's father, and gets off with only a suspended sentence. In fall 2008, TPTB wanted to show the human side of Tanja once again and opened up about Tanja's childhood with the presence of her mother. The result was an explanation that Tanja had to undergo psychiatric care for two years, after her father blamed her for the death of her younger brother, Thomas. The storyline received varied feedback from viewers. Some argued the show should stop trying to portray Tanja more humanely, while others welcomed the added dimension to the character. The critique of one-dimensionality has been oft fought by the character and seems to have been the justification for showing Tanja as a mother and a woman with a tragic past. One year after Tanja's past was revisited, the writers struck a balance that allowed them to use both sides of the character. She is now portrayed as a mother and a woman with a troubled past, knows how to use her sex-appeal to her advantage, is cunning and should not be crossed because she will do anything, even kill, to get what she wants. At the start of 2011, Tanja is shown to be vulnerable, when she develops feelings for Sebastian von Lahnstein. Tanja seems to be honest towards him and lets him know why she seems so messed up.Tanja's tortured soul To Sebastian, Tanja even admits that she doesn't want her kids to be anything like her. Personality Tanja starts off as a shy young woman who has just lost her favorite horse after her parents declare bankruptcy. But she soon begins to show her true self. She is manipulative and unhindered in securing her best interest. With her natural beauty, Tanja has the men in her corner and can use them at will to carry out her grand schemes. Tanja idolizes the life of the rich and famous. In order to attain her ideal life - one in which she has a high public profile without any concern over money, she marries into the aristocratic Anstetten family and later into the von Lahnstein family. When Tanja returns as a mother in 2006, her priorities have changed. She puts her son first wanting him to have everything she had always wanted for herself and is ready to do everything in her power to ensure just that. Tanja's vulnerable side is shown in the story about her childhood, when she had similar protection for brother as she has now for her son and had to deal with her mother's alcoholism, an issue shortly visited in 1996. In 2011, Tanja talks to Sebastian about her troubled childhood, saying that she has to either fight or drown. Sebastian might be actually the first man Tanja every really loved. He also eventually becomes the first man to whom Tanja ever confessed her murder of Tim Sander.

Description This species can reach a length of SL. The dorsal fin has seven to nine soft rays, the pectoral fin eleven to fourteen and the anal fin twenty-seven to thirty-two. There are thirty-two to thirty-four scales along the lateral line. Coloring is very vivid, especially in the males. They are a tan/brown, with green and blue iridescence, more noticeable in the males. Adult males' gill plates are adorned with metallic scales that range from sky blue to gold, depending on the lighting. They have a black spot on the base of their caudal fins which are lanceolate in shape. Females have a hyaline band near the outer edges of their anal and caudal fins.  Distribution and habitat  Betta pallifina is only known from clear forest streams in the upper Barito River basin in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. These streams have soft sandy or leaf-litter bottoms with dense marginal plants and patches of aquatic vegetation. The water temperature in which these fish are found is typically 77-79 °F (25-26 °C), with the pH ranging from 6.6-7.4.  Reproduction  Betta pallifina are a mouthbrooding species of betta. The male is the caretaker, holding the fry in his mouth for up to three weeks. In captivity, these fish are very easy to breed. During spawning, which can take several hours, the male embraces the female. Fertilized eggs are gathered into the male's mouth and he retreats to brood the fry when spawning is complete. Parents do not predate the fry when they are released.  Care  Betta pallifina are relatively undemanding when it comes to care of bettas. They tolerate harder water conditions than most of their relatives. They adapt quickly to life in captivity. They should be kept in species-only tanks; one pair can comfortably occupy a 24-inch tank (60 centimeters), while two pairs should be kept in a 30-inch tank (75 centimeters). The tank should have many hiding places, plants, and driftwood. pH should be kept in the range of 6.6-7.4, though a level that is under or over this is fine if kept stable. Feeding is easy, as they will readily take most foods offered. As for any fish, it is recommended that the tank is cycled to prevent ammonia or nitrites from harming the fish. Water current caused by a filter does not cause problems with Betta pallifina, since they come from forest streams and can handle current better than most species of Betta. They will eat a large variety of live foods, such as white worms (Enchytraeus albidus), grindal worms (Enchytraeus buchholzi), wingless fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and brine shrimp. Captive fish will readily take pelleted and flake foods, as well as frozen and freeze dried foods, though these should be soaked prior to feeding. Fry should be fed baby brine shrimp, microworms, or infusoria.

The ICB was defined based on advice from marine biologists, and following review by European Union fisheries ministers of the Common Fisheries Policy, as a means to safeguard the \\"biological sensitivity and commercial importance\\" of the waters around Ireland. Irish coastline  Location  Extended from Irish territorial waters, and comprising an area of more than 100,000 km², the ICB stretches from Waterford Harbour to Slyne Head, and follows the 200 metre bathymetric contour line along its western side. Fishing by certain vessels and vessel types is restricted in this area, and vessels over 10 metres long are required to report their catch and movements to the Irish Fisheries' patrol. The Irish Naval Service is tasked with enforcing the special protection measures.  Background  The Irish Conservation Box replaces a previous protection zone - known as \\"the Irish Box\\" - which was a larger rectangular 50-mile zone around the whole coast of the island of Ireland and included waters reaching to the western coasts of Scotland, England and Wales. Under the (original) Irish box mandate, important spawning and nursery areas for many stocks were protected by - for example - limiting fishing in the zone to no more than 40 foreign vessels at any one time. Because of common and \\"free-movement\\" policies of the EU, certain countries expected access to the zone in the long-term. As a result, there was ongoing lobbying by Spanish and Portuguese politicians of the Committee on Fisheries to remove the limits, and it was effectively abolished in late 2002. As part of a 2003 review of the Common Fisheries Policy, and after intense negotiations on a proposal by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Fisheries Council accepted the position that protection of biologically sensitive areas was critical to a conservation policy. The renewed Irish Conservation Box regulations came into force in 2004.

Biography  Grave in Aşiyan Asri Cemetery Yahya Kemal was born Ahmet Âgâh on December 2, 1884 in Skopje, then in the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He wrote under pen names such as Agâh Kemal, Esrar, Mehmet Agâh, and Süleyman Sadi. He came from a prominent family, whose roots could be traced back to the Ottoman court, and he was educated at various private schools. As he was about to start his higher education, severe disagreements between his parents kept him away from school for some time. When he tried to return to school, he was turned away because it was too late into the semester. His absence from school coincided with the oppressive regime of Abdülhamit II (reigned 1876–1909), and Yahya Kemal got involved various anti-regime movements. To avoid getting arrested, he went to Paris in 1903. During his time abroad, he met other exiled Turkish intellectuals, politicians and writers. He traveled extensively in Europe, and was exposed to various cultures. He developed a fondness for literature and was influenced by the French romantic movement. He eventually decided that he wanted to write poetry, and he first studied the historical works of the French Parnasse poets. Consequently, he sought out a way to revitalize Turkish Divan poetry in order to create smooth and pure poetic lines. Yahya Kemal’s poetry is influenced by music, because he composed with concepts borrowed from Turkish music. While explaining the inner rhythm of the poetic language, he used musical terms such as Tınnet, which denoted the musical value of the sounds or words that pace a line of poetry. For Yahya Kemal this was the only method for creating internal harmony. He states, \\"Poetry is akin to music. Poetry is not made of couplets, but poetry is melody.\\" For the most part, he was consistent and practiced what he preached; in his poetry, music and meaning go hand-in- hand. The central thought that runs through Beyatlı’s poems and prose is that the Turkish nation is fashioned with the sweat and tears of the heartland. Even his love poems featured stylized historical and cultural values. Another peculiarity that can be perceived in Beyatlı’s poetry is the almost feminine sensibility that he displayed towards Islam. His explanation for this is that his father spent very little time with him, and that his first lessons in religion came from long hours spent talking with his mother. Yahya Kemal grew up in a household where hymns and chants were sung, where values of the past were kept alive, hence in his poems he used religion and esthetics together. Writing about the loss of Ottoman lands like Salonica, Manastır, Üsküp and Prishtina he wrote: > When I pass my youth in Balkan towns I felt a yearning with every breath I > took. Byron's sad melancholy rules my heart then. In youth's daydreams I > roamed the mountains Breathed the free air of Rakofça's fields. I felt the > passion of my raiding ancestors Every summer, for centuries, a run to the > North That has left a thundering echo in my breast. While the army was in > defeat, the whole country in mourning A conqueror's thought entered my > dreams every night Feelings of melancholy, a sad remnant of the flight.\\" When he returned to Istanbul in 1912, Yahya Kemal was already known as a master poet, and the change of regime in the country provided him with opportunities in various high level governmental positions. By 1915, he was to know Halide Edip Adivar as well as Yusuf Akçura, both renowned Turkish authors. In the same year, he also worked closely together with Ziya Gökalp at the Istanbul University, where he was nominated a professor for the History of Western Literature upon the recommendation of Gökalp. Koroglu, Erol (2007). p.93  Political career  After the foundation of Turkey, Beyatlı became a member of parliament for the provinces of Urfa (1923-1926), Yozgat (1934), Tekirdağ and Istanbul (1943). After the Surname Law came into effect in 1934, he adopted the surname \\"Beyatlı\\". In 1926, he was appointed ambassador to Poland, where he remained until 1929.

It follows illegal immigrants of different nationalities struggling to achieve legal status in Los Angeles: dealing with the border, document fraud and extortion, the asylum and green card process, work-site enforcement, naturalization, the office of counter-terrorism, and the clash of cultures. The film is based on Kramer's similarly titled 1995 short film. He produced the film alongside Frank Marshall. Plot After immigrant Mireya Sanchez is deported, ICE / Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Max Brogan takes care of her little son and brings him to the boy's grandparents in Mexico. Later the woman is found dead near the border. Brogan returns to the grandparents to tell them the bad news. Taslima Jahangir, a 15-year-old girl from Bangladesh, presents a paper at school promoting that people should try to understand the 9/11 hijackers. The school principal reports this to authorities. FBI agents raid the home and ransack the girl's room, reading her diaries and a school assignment on the ethics of suicide; they criticize her room as \\"too austere\\" and note that she has an account on an Islamic website. The profiler says this makes her look like a would-be suicide bomber. Taslima is not charged for this, but it turns out that she stays in the United States illegally. She was born in Bangladesh and brought to the United States at age three. Taslima's continued presence jeopardizes her chances and puts at risk her two younger siblings, who are US citizens because they were born in the country. Denise Frankel, the immigration defense attorney, suggests that instead of the whole family's being deported, Taslima can leave for Bangladesh with her mother while the rest of the family stays in the U.S. Cole Frankel, an immigration examiner/officer, gets into a car accident with Claire Shepard, an aspiring actress from Australia. Realizing that she is in the country illegally, Cole makes an arrangement with Claire whereby she will have unlimited sex with him for two months in exchange for a green card. When Cole eventually says he wants to leave his wife for Claire, she makes it clear that she holds him in contempt and is only sleeping with him for the green card. In a moment of clarity, Cole exempts Claire from completing the two months and arranges for her to get her green card in the mail. Special Agents from the ICE / Office of Inspector General eventually confront Claire about the suspiciousness in her immigration paperwork, and she admits to the sexual arrangement she had with Cole and leaves the country \\"voluntarily\\". Cole is arrested by ICE/OIG for corruption. His wife Denise Frankel adopts a little girl from Nigeria, who has already been in the detention center for 23 months. Brogan has a colleague, Hamid Baraheri. His sister, Zahra, is having sex with a married man, Javier Pedroza. The Baraheri family does not approve. Hamid's brother Farid plans to scare the couple, but things get out of hand: he shoots both of them, and goes to Hamid, who helps him hide the evidence. Brogan slowly suspects Hamid's involvement as the film progresses. Javier Pedroza worked in a copy shop and made extra money by providing counterfeit immigration papers. Claire had previously paid him for false papers before she had made her arrangement with Cole. But when Javier was killed, the authorities discovered her documents among his belongings, leading the immigration team to examine Claire's case more closely. South Korean teenager Yong Kim is about to be naturalized with the rest of his family, but he has started to hang out with a bad crowd and ultimately participates in a convenience store robbery to \\"pop his cherry\\" with his gang. Hamid happens to be at the same convenience store and kills the other robbers but (due to his own guilt over his involvement in his sister's death) lets Yong Kim go free. Gavin Kossef, Claire's boyfriend and an atheist Jewish musician from the United Kingdom, pretends to be a religious Jew in order to get a job at a Jewish school, which allows him to stay in the U.S. When reporting to an immigration office, the immigration examiner/officer makes him demonstrate his familiarity with the Jewish religion in front of a rabbi visiting for other purposes - Kossef chants poorly but the rabbi gives his approval. After the test, in private, the rabbi requires Kossef to bring his \\"wonderful\\" voice to temple and to take lessons from him to eliminate the deficiencies in his knowledge. Brogan investigates the murder of Zahra Baraheri and her boyfriend. He finds proof of Farid's guilt in the murders and Hamid's guilt in the cover- up. Disgusted by the brothers' actions he turns the evidence over to the Los Angeles Police Department. The LAPD arrests Farid for two counts of murder and Hamid as an accessory to two murders after the fact.

The film was featured a scene in which an Iranian is murdered by her brother in an honor killing. Following complaints that the plotline was unrealistic and offensive, the killing was presented as an intended beating-up which got out of hand, removing the dialogue referring to \\"honor\\" and \\"family honor\\". Additionally, Sean Penn filmed scenes as an immigration cop. However, his scenes were cut due to the controversy over the honor killing plot, though producer Harvey Weinstein later claimed that Penn's agent requested his scenes be cut out of the film. Release Although the film was shot in 2007, it was not released until 2009, and even then only in a limited theatrical run. The film's original running length was 140 minutes, but the film's producer (who had final cut privilege) was convinced to edit the film down to 113 minutes when Harvey Weinstein threatened to release the film straight to DVD and bypass a theatrical release altogether. In many countries outside of the US, the film went straight to DVD anyway. The film was distributed in the United States by MGM and The Weinstein Company. It was given a limited theatrical release on February 27, 2009, and ultimately grossed less than US$500,000 in North America, and just over US$2.5 million internationally. The film has reportedly made another US$1.7 million in U.S. DVD sales. Reception The film received generally negative reviews. Review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes reports that 16% of 106 critics gave the film a positive review, for an average rating of 4.1/10. The site's consensus reads that: \\"Crossing Over is flagrant and heavy-handed about a situation that deserves more deliberate treatment, and joins its characters with coincidences that strain believability.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 38 based on reviews from 31 critics indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

An outfielder with a strong throwing arm, he played an active part in the beginning of professional baseball in Japan.Albright, Jim. \\"Japan's Top Players,\\" BaseballGuru.com. Accessed Mar. 7, 2014. Nakajima attended Waseda University, where he starred in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. He began his professional career in 1936 with the Japanese Baseball League, as a charter member of the Tokyo Kyojin. An excellent curveball hitter who used all parts of the field, in 1938 he was the first in Japan to become a triple crown player, as he compiled a .361 batting average, with 10 home runs and 38 RBI for the fall season. In addition, he was named league MVP for that season.Johnson, Daniel E. (July 2006). Japanese Baseball: A Statistical Handbook, p. 21. McFarland & Company. In 1941, Nakajima was named the Kyojin player-manager and he led his team to the JBL championship. He was again the team's player-manager in 1946-1947, and in 1949, when he led them (now known as the Yomiuri Giants) to another championship. During his time with the Kyojin/Giants. Nakajima led the league in homers twice, average once, and RBI four times. In 1950, with the reorganization of the JBL into Nippon Professional Baseball, Nakajima and a number of other veteran players were sent from the Giants to the Taiyo Whales to compensate for that team's lack of players. Nakajima ended his career in 1951 as player-manager of the Whales, but they struggled to a 19–26 record under his leadership, and he was replaced before the end of the season. Nakajima was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963, just the third player inducted. He died April 21, 1987.

It is high. there are steps on the hill (Dala) which has nine hundred and ninety nine foot steps (999) In the seventh century, the hill was the site of a community that engaged in iron-working. it is recalled to be the Tsumburbura shrine from 700 CE up until the credo's collapse as a result of Islam dominance later in the 13th century. kano was originally known as Dala, after the hill. History The hill is a crucial part of the history of the city of Kano. It is believed that Barbushe, a man of great stature and might who hunted elephants with his stick and carried them on his back to the hill, resided there hundreds of years ago. It said that there, Barbushe built a shrine to worship a deity called Tchumburburai who is believed to have been worshipped by the Hausa people at the time before the arrival of Islam. The only person that was allowed access to the shrine was Barbushe and anyone that entered it without his permission is said to have died tragically. Barbushe never descended from Dalla except on the two days of Idi. When the days drew near, the people that lived in the vicinity of the hill came from all over with animals to sacrifice with the hopes of gaining favor with Tchumburburai. This also has ties to the Bayajidda legend in Hausa folklore which is an account of a stranger believed to have been from Baghdad, who arrived in the future Hausaland, married into an existing ruling family, and fathered the rulers of the seven city-states which were to make up that elastic, but successful confederation known as the Hausa Bakwai. Despite the hill being a symbol of paganism and idol worship, it still kept its significance after the arrival of Islam. The power of the sacred hill was so fixed in early Hausa tradition that as late as 1819, the second Fulani Muslim ruler used to the hill as a spiritual summit where he would combine his prayers of forty days and perform them at the top of the hill, thus gathering assurance of victory in war. The old \\"pagan\\" center energized prayers sent up to Allah. Dalla hill was the center of power around which all rituals revolved. There, the ancestor figure, leader of the race, first lived. There, he had his wives and seven children. It was there that the first event took place, and it was to Dalla that te descendants must return again and again.

After recording two albums as Twytch, the band changed their name to Hell Within and released Asylum of the Human Predator through Lifeforce Records in 2005. After extensive touring across the United States and lineup changes, the band released Shadows of Vanity in 2007. Hell Within was previously signed to Thorp Records. History  1998–2003  Hell Within began when vocalist Matt McChesney joined the band Twytch in 2002.  2003–2005  At this time, European metal label Lifeforce Records was seeking to sign bands under their new American branch. After much regional success, Twytch's album Hatred found its way into the hands of Lifeforce German rep Stefan Ludicke, who offered the band a recording contract. By now, the band had outgrown the name Twytch and wanted something more original and heavy-sounding. They agreed on the name Hell Within. In an interview with Decibel Magazine, the band discusses what led to the name change.Decibel Magazine In April 2005, Hell Within's first worldwide release, Asylum of the Human Predator, was delivered. First print editions contained a DVD of behind-the-scenes video of the band on tour. These have sold out, are now sought-after by collectors. The album's lead single was \\"Bleeding Me Black.\\" An accompanying music video was produced by Ian McFarland of Killswitch Productions. On July 22, 2005, the opening track from Asylum of the Human Predator, \\"Godspeed to Your Deathbed,\\" reached No. 1 on the Comcast Music Choice network, beating out such bands as Nevermore, As I Lay Dying and A Life Once Lost.LIFEFORCERECORDS.com > We Are The Enemy In the fall of 2005, Hell Within embarked on the International Extreme Music Festival tour with bands such as Nightrage, Atrocity, Leaves' Eyes, Lilitu, Manntis and God Dethroned. During the tour Hell Within played to audiences all across North America in places such as the legendary CBGB in New York City.  2006–2011  After returning from the IEMF tour, Hell Within went through several changes, not only in the band lineup, but musically as well. Longtime drummer Bubba Joyce resigned, and was replaced by Derek Jay, formerly of Trauma Concept. In the fall of 2006, production on Hell Within's second full-length album Shadows of Vanity went underway. It was at this time that creative differences between the members became apparent. Making matters confusing was that vocalist Matt McChesney did guest vocals on The Autumn Offering's new album, since they were without a vocalist at the time. Rumors were swirling amongst fans that McChesney was no longer in Hell Within. On June 24, 2007, as production was wrapping up on Shadows of Vanity, McChesney released an even more bewildering statement to blabbermouth.net: \\"I'm devoting 100% of my time, for the immediate future, to The Autumn Offering. I am not leaving Hell Within.\\" However, the damage was done. Hell Within found a new vocalist and publicly introduced Brian Roy on July 16, 2007. Sensing that the screaming style of vocals was a trend and wishing to jump on a new bandwagon, Hell Within decided to embark upon a throwback sound reminiscent of late 80's thrash. Reviews for Shadows of Vanity were generally good. The album was produced by John Ellis and mixed by Mark Lewis of AudioHammer Studios (Trivium, Bury Your Dead, God Forbid.) Tartarean Desire claimed the album was \\"... a breath of fresh air... With amazing solos, tight and insane music.\\" Tartarean Desire - Hell Within - Shadows Of Vanity - review by Jason Thomas Weiss A tour in 2008 included support acts such as Deathbeat and Sikend, both of whom were fans of Hell Within for years. In October 2009, Hell Within announced that they had signed with Thorp Records and would be releasing a new album in the Spring 2010.

The derivation of the Madelung equations is similar to the de Broglie–Bohm formulation, which represents the Schrödinger equation as a quantum Hamilton–Jacobi equation. Equations The Madelung equations are quantum Euler equations: : \\\\partial_t \\\\rho_m + abla\\\\cdot(\\\\rho_m \\\\mathbf u) = 0, : \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf u}{dt} = \\\\partial_t\\\\mathbf u + \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla\\\\mathbf u = -\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\mathbf{ abla}(Q + V), where : \\\\mathbf u is the flow velocity, : \\\\rho_m = m \\\\rho = m \\\\psi^2 is the mass density, : Q = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{ abla^2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho}} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\frac{ abla^2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_m}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_m}} is the Bohm quantum potential, : V is the potential from the Schrödinger equation. The circulation of the flow velocity field along any closed path obeys the auxiliary condition \\\\Gamma \\\\doteq \\\\oint{m\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{l}} = 2\\\\pi n\\\\hbar, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}.. The Madelung equations are derived by writing the wavefunction in polar form: : \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\rho_m(\\\\mathbf{x}, t)} e^{\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} S(\\\\mathbf{x}, t)}, and substituting this form into the Schrödinger equation : i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x},t) = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{-\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V(\\\\mathbf{x},t) \\\\right] \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{x}, t). The flow velocity is defined by : \\\\mathbf{u}(\\\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\mathbf{ abla} S, from which we also find that : \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\rho_m \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi} [\\\\psi^*( abla\\\\psi) - \\\\psi( abla\\\\psi^*)], where \\\\mathbf{j} is the probability current of standard quantum mechanics. The quantum force, which is the negative of the gradient of the quantum potential, can also be written in terms of the quantum pressure tensor: : \\\\mathbf{F_Q} = -\\\\mathbf{ abla} Q = - \\\\frac{m}{\\\\rho_m} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf p_Q, where : \\\\mathbf p_Q = -(\\\\hbar/2m)^2 \\\\rho_m abla \\\\otimes abla \\\\ln \\\\rho_m. The integral energy stored in the quantum pressure tensor is proportional to the Fisher information, which accounts for the quality of measurements. Thus, according to the Cramér–Rao bound, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is equivalent to a standard inequality for the efficiency of measurements. The thermodynamic definition of the quantum chemical potential : \\\\mu = Q + V = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_m}} \\\\widehat H \\\\sqrt{\\\\rho_m} follows from the hydrostatic force balance above: : abla \\\\mu = \\\\frac{m}{\\\\rho_m} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf p_Q + abla V. According to thermodynamics, at equilibrium the chemical potential is constant everywhere, which corresponds straightforward to the stationary Schrödinger equation. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation are free energies, which differ from the internal energies of the system. The particle internal energy is calculated as : \\\\varepsilon = \\\\mu - \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf p_Q) \\\\frac{m}{\\\\rho_m} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{8m} ( abla \\\\ln \\\\rho_m)^2 + U and is related to the local Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker correction. In the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator, for instance, one can easily show that the zero-point energy is the value of the oscillator chemical potential, while the oscillator internal energy is zero in the ground state, \\\\varepsilon = 0. Hence, the zero point energy represents the energy to place a static oscillator in vacuum, which shows again that the vacuum fluctuations are the reason for quantum mechanics.

She was the sister ship of the San Jacinto and the San Bernard. In 1840, San Antonio was part of the Texas Navy flotilla led by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore which was dispatched to assist Yucatecan rebels that had taken up arms against Mexico. In February 1842, while re-provisioning in New Orleans, the crew of the San Antonio mutinied and the Lieutenant was killed. This was the only mutiny in the history of the Texas Navy. That fall, the San Antonio sailed for Campeche and was never heard from again. Background of the Texas Navy The Texas Navy was officially formed in January 1836, with the purchase of four schooners: Invincible, Brutus, Independence, and Liberty. These ships, under the command of Commodore Charles Hawkins, helped Texas win independence by preventing a Mexican blockade of the Texas coast, seizing Mexican ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to its army, and sending their cargoes to the Texas volunteer army. Nevertheless, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country. By the middle of 1837, all of the ships had been lost at sea, run aground, captured, or sold. With no ships to impede a possible invasion by Mexico, Texas was vulnerable to attack. In 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar responded to this threat by forming a second Texas Navy. Unlike Sam Houston, Lamar was an ardent supporter of the Texas Navy and saw the urgent need for its continuation. The second Texas Navy was placed under the command of Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, an Alexandria Academy graduate who was recruited from the United States Navy. One of the ships of this second navy was the San Antonio, along with her sister ships, the San Jacinto and San Bernard. History of the San Antonio Pennant of the San Antonio Originally built as one of the Baltimore clippers at the Schott and Whitney shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland and called Asp, she was one of the smallest of a class of schooners and brigs built specifically for the slave trade between 1820 and 1850. A group of six schooners, including La Amistad was built in Baltimore around 1836. They were identified as being \\"[p]urposely built and fitted out for use in the slave trade by the United States Consul General in Havana\\", and Asp was typical of the class. On patrol and carrying dispatches On 26 June 1840, the San Antonio sailed from Galveston with the rest of the flotilla under the command of Commodore Edwin W. Moore. After a two-month cruise, San Antonio returned to Galveston with James Treat, who had unsuccessfully sought diplomatic recognition for Texas from the Mexican government. For the rest of 1840, San Antonio patrolled Texas waters, conducting surveying and cartographic operations and suppressing smuggling. Joining the flagship Austin and her sister ship San Bernard, San Antonio set sail for the Yucatan again on 13 December 1841. The flotilla reached Sisal on 6 January 1842, but she returned to Galveston on 31 January with dispatches from Commodore Moore. Texas Secretary of War and Marine George Washington Hockley sent orders to Moore by way of the San Antonio for him to return to Galveston immediately with the ships. But the San Antonio called first at New Orleans to land the survivors of a shipwreck and to procure supplies for the fleet. Mutiny On 11 February 1842, with the principal officers of the schooner on shore, a number of seamen who had been drinking demanded they be allowed to go ashore. The Officer of the Watch, Lieutenant Charles Fuller, ordered the marine guard to defend the ship, only to have the sergeant of marines, Seymour Oswald, strike him on the head with a tomahawk. Fuller drew his Colt revolver, and in the melee that followed, Fuller was shot dead and his body was beaten with muskets and cutlasses. Two midshipmen were also injured, and another lieutenant was locked below deck. The mutineers fled from the ship, but they soon were apprehended by the United States revenue cutter Jackson and placed in the New Orleans jail. Two of the mutinous sailors were returned to the ship, while the rest remained in New Orleans, pending extradition. The schooner San Antonio with all her sails set Final voyages From New Orleans the San Antonio sailed for the Cayos Arcas where San Jacinto had wrecked, and from there to Sisal. Commodore Moore dispatched her to pick up Thomas S. Lubbock, a survivor of President Mirabeau B. Lamar's Santa Fe expedition, who had escaped his captors and made his way to Yucatan. The ship then rejoined the fleet at New Orleans on 1 July. Moore dispatched the schooner to Yucatán about 1 October 1842 by way of Galveston and Matagorda to attempt to raise funds for the fast-failing Texas fleet. She never reached Campeche, however, but was lost at sea. Fate of the Mutineers The state of Louisiana refused to extradite most of the sailors accused of mutiny and killing Lieutenant Fuller. Furthermore, many witnesses had gone down with their ship when it was lost in October. Nevertheless, Commodore Moore tried those hands aboard his flagship in April 1843. Three were sentenced to lashes, and four were sentenced to death. They were hanged from the yardarm of the Austin on 26 April 1843. Sergeant Oswald escaped jail in New Orleans and was never brought to justice, and Frederick Shepard, a mutineer who was spared because he testifying against the others, was killed in action three weeks later in the Naval Battle of Campeche.

It is also partnered with the Environment Oregon Research & Policy Center, its sister 501(c)(3) organization.  History  Environment Oregon was created in 2007 to house the Oregon State Public Interest Research Group (OSPIRG, a local affiliate of the Public Interest Research Group) environmental programs. OSPIRG was started by students at the University of Oregon, inspired by Ralph Nader, who did a speaking tour of college campuses in the early 1970s.Marcello, Patricia Cronin (2004). Ralph Nader: A Biography. Greenwood Press .  Campaigns  An Environment Oregon job poster in Portland As of 2014, Environment Oregon was working on a campaign to stop the Bybee timber sale outside of Crater Lake National Park. Critical wildlife habitat surrounding Crater Lake is under threat from bulldozers, backhoes and chainsaws. Around the park, logging companies are pushing to clearcut thousands of acres of forest—land that shelters the headwaters of the Rogue and Umpqua rivers, which are critical for maintaining healthy runs of Steelhead, Coho and Chinook salmon. In response to these threats, Environment Oregon is calling on Congress to create a new fully protected wilderness area that spans over 500,000 acres of wilderness and creates a 75-mile wildlife corridor. After discussing the campaign face-to- face with over 60,000 Oregonians, in 2013, the organization delivered over 10,000 public comments to the United States Forest Service to support stopping the sale. In 2012, Environment Oregon launched a campaign to encourage development of 250,000 solar roofs in Oregon by 2025. In July 2012, the group released a new report, \\"Solar Works for Oregon,\\" which outlines the sun's vast potential to provide power, protect the environment, and create jobs for Oregonians. The report revealed that Oregon could feasibly develop enough electricity from rooftop solar in the next decade to power 250,000 typical Oregon homes—or all the homes in Portland. Oregon could also produce 30 times as much solar energy as it does today— preventing 3.8 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution, the equivalent of taking 730,000 cars off the road. Environment Oregon has also worked to promote awareness of and measures to address Oregon's connection to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. In 2012, they successfully helped promote legislation to ban plastic bags in Portland, Corvallis and Eugene. In 2007 Environment Oregon campaigned for renewable energy and for Measure 49, a ballot measure regarding land use planning.  Membership  Environment Oregon works with the Fund for the Public Interest to conduct its fundraising and membership development campaigns, employing dozens of canvassers and callers who contact Oregonians door-to-door, on street corners and over the phone. Facing criticism for its recruitment and employment practices, in 2009 the fund was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by current and former canvassers.

The bombing took place on 31 May 1991 and left three soldiers killed and 14 people wounded, four of them civilians. Background The bombing took place at a time when the Northern Ireland Office arranged multi-party talks (known as the Brooke/Mayhew talks) on the future of Northern Ireland.

The character was portrayed by actor Joscha Kiefer from November 26, 2007 to October 13, 2009.Das Erste.de – First appearance The part was recast with Sebastian Schlemmer who took over the role on October 19, 2009.Recast Sebastian Schlemmer – Debut episode Storylines Background Sebastian is born as the second child of Ludwig von Lahnstein and his wife Madeline. He grows up in the United States, after Ludwig's father Dietrich disproved of Madeline, who was employed as a maid of the Lahnstein family. Ludwig never forgave his father for not accepting Madeline and also broke ties with his brother Johannes. When Madeline murders an influential businessman in Patagonia, Ludwig takes the blame and is arrested for the crime. Believing their father has died in a sailing accident, Sebastian and his siblings become attached to Ludwig's best friend Adrian Degenhardt as a father figure. As Madeline dies after a long illness, Adrian becomes their legal guardian and takes care of the children's education. Sebastian's older brother Hagen suddenly leaves the family after both of his parents apparently died and Sebastian becomes a strong man who tries to hold the family together. Adrian enables Sebastian to study at Harvard University, where he becomes an attorney at law. Return to Königsbrunn In 2007, Sebastian returns to Düsseldorf to visit Adrian, who puts his business around destroying Johannes for taking his great love Francesca. Sebastian runs into Jana von Lahnstein as her car breaks down. He helps her and even wants to ask her out as she replies that she's married, but would like to see him again as a friend. Jana wants to give him her number, but as soon as Sebastian realizes her last name, Sebastian shows no interest in her any longer and leaves a confused Jana behind. Sebastian decides to help Adrian with his war against Johannes and the Lahnstein family because of what Ludwig told his family. According to Ludwig, Johannes was responsible for cutting him out of Dietrich's will and also sided with his father, when Ludwig decided to be with Madeline. Not knowing who he is, Sebastian outs himself on a charity event at Königsbrunn as Ludwig's son; leaving Johannes and his family shocked. Johannes tries to talk to his nephew, but it does not take long for them to fight about the past. In the end, Johannes warns Sebastian about Adrian and tries to make him understand that this man will only use him to his own advantage. Sebastian laughs at Johannes' warning and tells him all about what Adrian did for him and his siblings after his parents have died and Johannes was nowhere to be seen. With Johannes and Sebastian being at odds, Johannes' daughter Carla decides to pay her cousin a visit. Carla realizes that Sebastian is a good man and they enjoy having breakfast together. But as the conversation shifts to Johannes, Sebastian does not want to hear what Carla has to say. He tells her that it was great to see her again and it would be nice to talk again as long as Johannes is not the subject. Carla decides to talk to her father about what happened all those years ago. Johannes tells his daughter the story of Ludwig and Madeline and Dietrich's disapproval. But he eventually makes it clear that he did not side with his father and even tried to stay in contact with Ludwig. All the letters he wrote him back then came back unopened and unanswered. Carla uses these letters to tell Sebastian the truth and the young lawyer realizes that Johannes is not the bad person Ludwig made him out to be. But before he can speak to Johannes, his uncle goes on a business trip from which he never returns as his plane goes down over the Atlantic. Sebastian leaves Adrian with his plan for revenge alone, but tries to stay neutral between him and Lahnsteins. This eventually becomes a problem when Sebastian receives a call from Tanja von Anstetten, former lover of his cousin Ansgar, meant for Adrian. Sebastian finds out that Tanja is supposed to be dead after committing suicide as a result of her son's death. He finds out that Tanja faked not only her own death, but also that of her son and Ansgar's Hannes and that Adrian helped them. Sebastian sides with the Lahnsteins and, with the help of Carla and her brother Leonard, tries to get Hannes returned to Ansgar. After that the bond between Adrian and Sebastian slowly breaks, even though Sebastian realizes that both sides have their share of dark secrets. Between heaven and hell Sebastian is not sure about staying in Düsseldorf, but changes his mind when he meets Lydia Brandner. He immediately falls in love with her and is happy when Lydia feels the same way. But as soon as they could be happy together, Lydia, who's working for the Department of Children's and Young Peoples' Affairs, first case is to decide the custody battle between Ansgar and Tanja over Hannes. As Lydia's boss makes it clear that a relationship with a member of the Lahnstein family would be highly inappropriate and she would risk her job, Lydia forbids herself from seeing Sebastian. But he is not ready to give up on her and plans a romantic dinner, where they share their first kiss. As Lydia's job keeps getting in their way, she breaks up with him. Sebastian is heartbroken and finds comfort in Lydia's mother Katja, which ends in sleeping with her. Katja and Sebastian both agree that no one ever can find out about that night they spent together, especially after Lydia shortly after changes her mind and reunites with Sebastian. Things go from bad to worse when Katja finds out that she's pregnant and either her husband Matthias or Sebastian is the father. As Lydia finds out the truth she leaves Sebastian again and tries to move on with Sebastian's best friend Jens Kramer. Sebastian and Jens are at a crossroads with their friendship as Jens is disgusted with what Sebastian has done to Lydia. Jens and Lydia become a couple, while Sebastian cannot forget about Lydia. In the meanwhile, Jens becomes obsessed with Lydia and tries to have her all to herself; manipulating her friends, bugging her family's house and getting her in trouble at her job. Sebastian suspects Jens of his doings and tries to catch him. Jens realizes that Sebastian is a constant danger to his relationship to Lydia and kidnaps him. Lydia is questioning Sebastian's disappearance and eventually finds out all about Jens. As Sebastian can be rescued she realizes that she's still in love with Sebastian and that she has almost lost him. The two reunite once again and Sebastian comforts Lydia as her mother died after giving birth to a baby girl. With the paternity still in question, Sebastian and Matthias decide after long fights to take a test. The men are shocked when it turns out that Sebastian is Christina's father and decide to keep it a secret to secure Sebastian and Lydia's future together. The happy-again couple gets married when Lydia is in for a shock. When Christina has an accident, the truth about her paternity comes to light. Lydia is heartbroken and feels once again cheated not only by Sebastian but also by her father Matthias. Sebastian and Lydia separate for a little while before reuniting with Sebastian's promise that Matthias will be raising Christina. But Sebastian's feelings for his daughter are strong and he uses every chance he gets to be close to her. As Sebastian is planning to take legal actions against Matthias, his marriage with Lydia is yet in danger again. His undeniable feelings towards his daughter, and having to work overtime hours, puts a drift between Lydia and Sebastian. This leads Lydia to start an affair with Ansgar. When Sebastian finds out about the affair, he's outraged and sees his marriage lying in ruins. Lydia has to confess that she has fallen in love with Ansgar, which puts an end to her marriage with Sebastian. Return from the dead and the forgotten son In late 2009, the truth about Ludwig comes out, when Sebastian's siblings Helena and Tristan get him out of prison and return with him to Königsbrunn. At first everyone is happy to see Ludwig, but Sebastian starts to raise questions. He wants to know what kept his father from his family all those years, while he took care of his siblings. Ludwig tells his children that he went to prison to protect Madeline and not wanting his children have to live with a father behind bars. Even though Sebastian accepts Ludwig's decision, he is not sure how to deal with his father. As Ludwig becomes the head of the family's company because of Carla's absence, he and Sebastian have more and more confrontations with each other. In 2011, Ludwig is diagnosed with leukemia and as none of his children or other family members are a match for a kidney transplant, the family opens up about Hagen for the first time in years. They eventually find him in the Netherlands, where he handles with diamonds. While Ludwig is happy to see his son and is rescued by him, Hagen's siblings are not so forgiving. First of all Sebastian, who will never forgive Hagen for leaving him with his siblings alone. Helena, Tristan and Rebecca can forgive Hagen in the end, but Sebastian sees in him an irresponsible hypocrite. As Ludwig starts to put his trust in Hagen, he also starts a sibling rivalry and damages his relationship with Sebastian even more. Moving to a darker side Hurt over Lydia's affair with Ansgar, Sebastian starts teaming up with Tanja. He handles her divorce from Ansgar, which leaves her with a lot of cash. When Sebastian's divorce from Lydia, who's pregnant with Ansgar's child, becomes finalized, her feelings for Ansgar seem already starting to reduce because of his schemes against the people around him. Sebastian spends one last passionate moment with Lydia and tells her that a part of him will always love her. In the meanwhile, Sebastian's affair with Tanja resulted in her being pregnant as well. As Lydia leaves Königsbrunn to start over in New Zealand, she writes Sebastian a letter where she once again apologizes for her affair and that she wished things had turned out differently. Tanja realizes that Sebastian still loves Lydia and is determined to keep things between them as business partners after they joined Lahnstein Enterprises. But soon Tanja is confronted with her feelings for Sebastian, while he learns more about Tanja and starts to see her in another light. When he finds out that Tanja has fallen in love with him, he first tries to use her feelings as he fears that Tanja might eventually skip town with his child, knowing what she's capable of after faking Hannes' death. He even proposes to her, but Tanja turns him down several times, before finally accepting. Eventually Sebastian really starts to understand Tanja and comforts her, when she's confronted with her father's abuse. As Tanja keeps having hallucinations about her dead father, she accidentally shoots Sebastian thinking he's her father. Ludwig captures the accident on tape and wants to use it against Tanja, if necessary. Sebastian later demands to give the tape back into his hands, while Tanja has no idea that the tape even exists. When she finds it in Sebastian's belongings, she's heartbroken and breaks off her engagement with Sebastian. Before going on a business trip to Paris, Tanja tells Sebastian that she never ever wants to see him again and he will never know his child. Sebastian, who truly loves Tanja, is determined to win her back whatever it takes. After a reconciliation, the pair marries. Shortly afterward, they have a daughter, Emma von Lahnstein, who Sebastian delivers while they are trapped in an elevator.

The album, released after a successful English tour in early 1972,\\"Q Rock Stars Encyclopedia\\" by Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, Dorling Kindersley, 1999 marked the comeback of Sedaka after a 10-year absence from the charts. Three singles were lifted from the album, \\"Beautiful You\\" (UK No. 43), \\"That's When the Music Takes Me\\" (UK No. 18; US No. 27), and \\"Dimbo Man\\". The album's title track, \\"Solitaire\\", later became a hit single for Andy Williams (1973) and The Carpenters (1975). The album was produced at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, England, with the musical support of Graham Gouldman, Lol Creme and Kevin Godley who - together with the album's recording engineer Eric Stewart - would shortly become the successful pop band 10cc. Sedaka opted to record at Strawberry after meeting Gouldman in New York and discovering his association with Stewart, Godley and Creme. The trio had recorded the single \\"Umbopo\\", which Sedaka liked, under the band name of Doctor Father. His work with the four British musicians proved to be a pivotal influence on their collective decision to forge a career as a band. Gouldman recalled: \\"It was Neil Sedaka's success that did it, I think. We'd just been accepting any job we were offered and were getting really frustrated. We knew that we were worth more than that, but it needed something to prod us into facing that. We were a bit choked to think that we'd done the whole of Neil's first album with him just for flat session fees when we could have been recording our own material.\\"Graham Gouldman interview, \\"Record Collector\\", 1984 Sedaka recorded one more album with the band members, The Tra-La Days Are Over. Conspicuously absent from the Solitaire album was any work by Sedaka's long-running songwriting partner Howard Greenfield; Sedaka had by this point begun another partnership with Phil Cody, and both Sedaka and Greenfield had concluded that their collaboration had run its course. The track \\"Better Days Are Coming\\" was reworked by Sedaka as the Japanese opening theme for the 1985 anime series Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam. The revised song became . This version was later translated back into English with new lyrics and retitled \\"Go Beyond the Time\\" by Richie Kotzen. The Solitaire album was not released in the US initially, but eventually it was issued after Sedaka regained his popularity in his home country in 1974-75 with the release of the album Sedaka's Back. In West Germany, the album was released on the budget label RCA International, simply titled Neil Sedaka. In 2010, BGO Records re-released the album on CD.

High school Granger was a star quarterback and pitcher for Orangefield High School in Orangefield, Texas. In 1990, his senior year, he led the Orangefield Bobcats to the state semifinals with a 23–6 record. Also an outstanding hitter, he still holds the Texas state record for longest hitting streak (42 games). In football, he was named the #6 Texas high school prospect in the class of 1990 by the Austin American-Statesman, and the #2 quarterback overall. Still owns the Orangefield 400m school record with a sub 50 second performance. College In two seasons for Texas A&M; Granger had a record of 16–6 with 251 strikeouts in 220 innings during his first two seasons. In 1993, he broke the Aggie record with 150 strikeouts and broke Roger Clemens' Southwest Conference career strikeout record. He was the College Station Regional MVP in the College World Series, and was all-SWC as well as being named a first team All-American. Granger was a finalist for the Golden Spikes award and also pitched for Team USA in international play. He also played quarterback for the Texas A&M; Aggies football team, and was briefly the starter. Highlights included a 4 TD performance against Tulsa playing in place of an injured Bucky Richardson in 1991. Granger engineered two memorable last- minute drives in 1992. After being pulled from the season opening Disneyland Pigskin Classic game against Stanford for a weak passing performance, he returned to throw a game-tying pass to tight end Greg Schorp. On a subsequent drive, he scrambled 33 yards to the Cardinal 29 yard line to set up a game- winning field goal by Terry Venetoulias as the Aggies prevailed 10–7. Granger led the Aggies to a 4-0 start that season, and top 5 early season ranking. Later against Texas Tech, Granger escaped a sack on a third-and-eight at the Raiders' 42-yard line and hit Schorp with a first-down pass that set up another Venetoulias game-winning field goal as time expired. Professional career Granger was drafted in the 1st Round (5th overall pick) of the 1993 MLB Draft by the Kansas City Royals. He was only 21 when he broke into the majors with the Royals in September of that same year after only 7 impressive starts at single-A Eugene in which he struck out 56 batters in only 36 innings. He began the 1994 Season at AA Memphis and was called up to the big leagues for two respectable (but not overpowering) starts in May. Although he had dominated at the minor league level, it was clear that he needed some finesse to complement his impressive velocity, and the Royals kept him at AA Wichita in 1995. Granger was moved to the bullpen the following season and made a smooth transition, compiling an impressive 2.34 ERA for the AAA Omaha Royals. He was once again hit hard in 15 relief appearances for the major league club. In December 1996, Granger was traded with Jeff Wallace, Joe Randa, and Jeff Martin to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Jeff King and Jay Bell. Granger began the 1997 season with the Pirates, but was shelled in 9 relief appearances and sent down to AAA Calgary, where he struggled for the rest of the season. It was his last major league action. Granger spent the next three seasons struggling in the minor leagues for five different clubs in four different organizations. He even attempted to resurrect his career with the Long Island Ducks, but ultimately retired from baseball. Although he was a phenomenal two-sport college athlete and was able to play four seasons in the major leagues, he did not end up being the major-league All-star that some envisioned him becoming, instead a cautionary tale against rushing players to the major leagues.

Starring Academy Award winning actress Kim Hunter and James MacArthur, it was based on the teleplay Deal a Blow by Robert Dozier.  Plot  Teenage delinquent Hal Ditmar is the son of a wealthy film producer, Tom Ditmar. Hal lives with his mother and father yet does not work and contributes nothing to the household. Hal gets into an argument in a theater, which ends with Hal hitting the theater manager. Neither the police nor Hal's father believe his claim that he acted in self-defense; however, when Mr. Ditmar discusses the matter with Sgt. Shipley, the police consider the delinquent act more serious than does the father. Mr. Ditmar takes Hal home and berates him. The next day, Hal is teased at school and considered a bad influence by other parents. Because his father won't believe him, Hal questions his father's love for him; however, Hal's mother tells him that his father once told her Hal was the only thing he did love, implying that Mr. Ditmar did not love her. At dinner, Mr Ditmar tells Hal the police want to see Hal the next day, but does not tell him why. At bedtime, Mrs. Ditmar tells Mr. Ditmar she has considered separation for five years. Mr. Ditmar tells her he loves her, but she leaves the bedroom. The next day, the police offer to keep Hal's transgression out of juvenile court if he will confess. Hal refuses. The theater manager drops the charges because of Mr. Ditmar, and to give Hal a break. Asked to at least apologize, Hal arrogantly refuses. Mrs. Ditmar apologizes for Hal and promises no more trouble. Mr. Ditmar learns of Hal's surly behavior at the police station and threatens to ground him. Hal explodes telling his father that he doesn't even know him and only talks to him when he's upset with him. Prohibited from driving, Hal leaves on his bicycle. Mrs. Ditmar tells her husband that he only sees Hal at dinner and Hal doesn't even know his father loves him. Hal goes to the movie theater and apologizes to the theater manager, but wants the manager to explain to Mr. Ditmar that it was self-defense. The manager refuses and the two begin scuffling which ends with Hal hitting the manager once again. Back at the police station, Hal explains to Sgt. Shipley what happened, but doubts he will believe him. Sgt. Shipley questions the manager about the first assault. The manager admits Hal acted in self-defense, but denies the second assault was self-defense. Sgt. Shipley doesn't believe the manager; and asks Mr. Ditmar why he didn't believe Hal the first time. Mr. Ditmar says he didn't think believing Hal was important, and realizes he was wrong. Mr. Ditmar tells Hal about the manager's admission, and tells Hal he's glad he hit the manager and not him.

She was the sister ship of the San Jacinto and the San Antonio. In 1840, San Antonio was part of the Texas Navy flotilla led by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore which was dispatched to assist Yucatecan rebels that had taken up arms against Mexico. Returning to the Yucatan in 1841, San Bernard assisted in the capture of three Mexican prizes. Upon return to Galveston, San Bernard was driven ashore and was not repaired. When Texas joined the United States in 1846, San Bernard was transferred to the United States Navy and then sold for $150. Background of the Texas Navy The Texas Navy was officially formed in January 1836, with the purchase of four schooners: Invincible, Brutus, Independence, and Liberty. These ships, under the command of Commodore Charles Hawkins, helped Texas win independence by preventing a Mexican blockade of the Texas coast, seizing Mexican ships carrying reinforcements and supplies to its army, and sending their cargoes to the Texas volunteer army. Nevertheless, Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent country. By the middle of 1837, all of the ships had been lost at sea, run aground, captured, or sold. With no ships to impede a possible invasion by Mexico, Texas was vulnerable to attack. In 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar responded to this threat by forming a second Texas Navy. Unlike Sam Houston, Lamar was an ardent supporter of the Texas Navy and saw the urgent need for its continuation. The second Texas Navy was placed under the command of Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, an Alexandria Academy graduate who was recruited from the United States Navy. One of the ships of this second navy was the San Jacinto along with her sister ships, the San Jacinto and San Bernard. History of the San Bernard Pennant of the San Bernard Originally built as one of the Baltimore clippers at the Schott and Whitney shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland and called Scorpion, she was one of the smallest of a class of schooners and brigs built specifically for the slave trade between 1820 and 1850. A group of six schooners, including La Amistad was built in Baltimore around 1836. They were identified as being \\"[p]urposely built and fitted out for use in the slave trade by the United States Consul General in Havana\\", and AScorpion was typical of the class. On patrol and carrying dispatches On 26 June 1840, the San Bernard sailed from Galveston with the rest of the flotilla under the command of Commodore Edwin W. Moore. After a season of patrolling off the Texas coast to intercept smugglers and to engage in surveys and cartography, Lt. Crisp and the San Bernard delivered Texas agent James Webb to Veracruz, arriving on 31 May 1841 but were refused landing rights by port officials. San Bernard remained off the coast of Veracruz until the end of June and then sailed for the Yucatan. While crossing the Bay of Campeche, her topmast was carried away and she was compelled to return to Galveston, reaching port on 20 June 1841. Capturing prizes Joining the flagship Austin and San Antonio, San Bernard set sail again for the Yucatan on 13 December 1841. The flotilla reached Sisal on 6 January 1842, For the next couple of months, she participated in the capture of the Mexican merchant vessels Progreso, Dolorita and the Dos Amigos in April 1842. Off Tampico, Lt. Crisp and San Bernard were ordered back to Galveston to deliver dispatches and reports. San Bernard did not return to Commodore Moore and the rest of the Texas fleet until 24 April 1842. Beached and rotting At the end of this cruise San Bernard returned to Galveston in early September. The ship was badly worm-eaten. Despite authorization to have her repaired in New Orleans, no funds were provided to pay for the work by the Minister of War and Marine. Later that month, the San Bernard was driven ashore by a gale, and lacking the $500 required to refloat her and have her repaired she became a deserted hulk in Galveston harbor. Transfer to the U.S. Navy When Texas was annexed by the United States, the San Bernard and Austin were transferred to the United States Navy, on 11 May 1846. When the United States fleet found no place for San Bernard, she was sold for $150. Commanders of the Vessel The San Antonio was commanded by: * Lt. A.C. Hinton, September—November 1839 * Lt.

Its fossils are found in rocks dating from the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages; it thus lived between about and million years ago. Like other sawfish-like rays from the Mesozoic, it probably did not survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event; there are a few remains from the Paleogene but these seem to have been reworked from Late Cretaceous deposits. (2002): Schizorhiza: a unique sawfish paradigm from the Difunta Group, Coahuila, Mexico. Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Geológicas 19(1): 16-24 [English with Spanish abstract]. PDF fulltext  Taxonomy  Due to its unique rostral teeth, Schizorhiza is placed in the monotypic subfamily Schizorhizinae. Despite formerly being classified within a family of extinct sawfish-like rays known as Sclerorhynchidae, phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ischyrhiza, Schizorhiza, and Onchopristis form a distinct clade that groups closer with the extant family Rajidae, which contains the true skates, possibly rendering the suborder Sclerorhynchoidei paraphyletic.

Before Time, Lewisville, 1993 Description Schizorhiza is unique among all \\"saw-snouted\\" Elasmobranchii in that its rostral teeth did not fall off as they are replaced. Rather, they remain in place, with the new teeth under them, until they are worn off. Thus, the rostrum's edge had a continuous serrated cover of tooth enamel. Full-grown rostral teeth measured less than in Sclerorhynchidae, let alone sawfishes, at 1–2 cm tall and 4–8 mm wide. They had a small triangular or rhomboidal shape at the tip, with sharp cutting edges, and a long forked peduncle, each lobe of which divides into four lobelets proximally. The new teeth developed inside the peduncular fork; the scientific name Schizorhiza - meaning \\"split root\\" - refers to the shape of the rostral teeth. The oral teeth were very small (about 1.5-2.5 mm high and 1–2 mm wide), with a large and recurved central point and keels at the side that formed tiny secondary points. Paleoecology It lived in the Tethys Ocean between about 30° northern and southern latitude, and apparently was a successful species that ranged widely. Its fossils have been found in northern and central Africa, Iraq, Italy, Texas (United States), Coahuila (Mexico) and Bolivia. As its rostrum seems to be well-adapted for slashing and of little use for digging, it is presumed that this species did not share the whip-like tail of the similar, bottom-dwelling Sclerorhynchus, but apart from the peculiar rostrum must have looked not too different from one of the sawfishes of today, regardless of whether they were very close relatives or not. Its total length was about 1.5 meters. Its habitat was apparently shallow or epicontinental seas, as evidenced by its associated fauna, the cartilaginous fish Pseudocorax, Scapanorhynchus texanus and Serratolamna serrata, and the molluscs Cymprimera, Ethmocardium, Eutrephoceras, Platyceramus vanuxemi, Sphenodiscus and Turritella vertibroides.

O. Box 1142 at Fort Hunt Park P.O. Box 1142 was a secret American military intelligence facility that operated during World War II.World War II Vets Honored For Top-Secret Work, NPS Digest. The American Military Intelligence Service had two special wings, known as MIS-X and MIS-Y. The MIS-X program focused upon the escape and evasion activities of American POWs in Europe. MIS-Y's core duty was to interview the Prisoners of War (POWs). They were known by their codename, the mailing address \\"P.O. Box 1142.\\"Dvorak, Petula, 2006-08-20, World War II secret interrogators break their silence, Washington Post. Notable prisoners housed at the facility included rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, spymaster Reinhard Gehlen, and Heinz Schlicke, inventor of infrared detection. German U-Boat commander Werner Henke was also a prisoner but was fatally shot when he tried to escape by climbing the fence. P.O. Box 1142 was based in Fort Hunt, Virginia, formerly part of George Washington's farmlands. German scientists, submariners and soldiers were questioned. P.O. Box 1142 obtained valuable intelligence from German POWs and also communicated with Allied POWs overseas. The camp was in violation of the Geneva Convention (P.O. Box 1142 was closed in 1946; the Geneva Convention was not ratified until 1949) because the Red Cross was not notified of the transfer or location of the prisoners, but according to the surviving wardens, torture was not used. The work done at Fort Hunt contributed to the Allied victory of World War II. It also led to advances in scientific technology and military intelligence that directly influenced the Cold War. In October 2007, a group of the former intelligence workers gathered for the first time since the war's conclusion, and a flagpole and plaque recognizing their contributions were dedicated on the original grounds. The camp was started in 1942; the majority of the camp facilities were bulldozed in 1946. The post commanders were: Col. Daniel W. Kent (1 July 1942–21 October 1942); Col. Russell H. Sweet (21 October 1942–1 February 1943); Col. John L. Walker (1 February 1943–18 July 1945); and Col. Zennas R. Bliss (18 July 1945–post closure).  Operation Paperclip  PO Box 1142 was one of a number of secret internment facilities commissioned by the United States with the goal to exploit the German scientists recruited as part of Operation Paperclip in Europe. In order to prevent scientists specializing in rocket and other sensitive technologies from falling into Communist hands, the United States became determined to prevent the Soviet Union from seizing scientists with this information prior to the end of the war. The U.S. Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency was responsible for sponsoring the operation and took a specific focus on the scientists who had worked on Hitler's V2 Rocket program.  Interrogation process  As many of the former prison guards and interrogators at PO Box 1142 have started to grow old and information become declassified, the substantial amount of information learned at PO Box 1142 has started to come to light. Between 1942 and 1946, the military interrogators at the camp questioned more than 3,400 prisoners with more than 500 of these being scientists that came to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. During these interviews, significant information regarding German advances in rocketry, jet technology, weapons systems, and acoustic torpedoes was discovered. The United States was able to take this information and develop an effective acoustic torpedo countermeasure. The former interrogators say they did not use physical torture, however they did use psychological tricks, like threatening to turn the prisoner over to the Soviet NKVD. National Park Service Ranger Brandon Bies interviewed over 70 former interrogators from PO Box 1142 on this topic and said: \\"To our knowledge, no. There was no torture here. This is a question that was asked in every interview the National Park Service conducted, and we have found no evidence that there was anything remotely resembling torture that happened here.\\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-wwii-camp-interrogators-say-torture- wasnt-needed/  Later reception  In 2001, the German historian Sönke Neitzel found about 150,000 pages of interrogation reports and bugged room conversations made in Trent Park and Fort Hunt. He analysed them together with Harald Welzer, a social psychologist. They published several books about their results: * Abgehört: Deutsche Generäle in britischer Kriegsgefangenschaft 1942-1945.

There is also evidence that it can serve as a peptide hydrolase in the production of cat pheromone precursors. Cauxin has a mass of 70 kilodaltons and is composed of 545 amino acids. The protein can also exist as a multimeric protein complex connected by disulfide bonds with a mass of 300-350 kilodaltons. This is its primary form in non-reducing conditions. The proximal tubules of epithelial cells in the kidney express cauxin. This protein is secreted into the urine from the renal tubular cells. The gene for the protein is also found in several other mammalian genomes in various organs. However, the only mammals that have cauxin present in urine are cats. It is also the first carboxylesterase to be found in urine. Cauxin has been shown to hydrolyze 3-methylbutanol-cysteinylglycine (3-MBCG) in the urine into felinine which then slowly degrades into the putative, sulfur-containing cat pheromone 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol (MMB). This pheromone is used to mark territory with urine. Neutered male cats have less cauxin in their urine than do intact males. Intact males also have higher levels of cauxin than females and higher levels than kittens. This, in addition to cauxin's role in pheromone production, suggests that it is also involved in sexual signaling. Cauxin or its homologs are present in many cat species. These homologs are highly conserved and also exist as multimers. However, the cauxin concentrations in urine seems to vary depending on the species with larger species generally having lower concentrations in urine than smaller domestic cats. This is likely a result of decreased reliance on felinine, due to the existence of additional, more complex signaling molecules that are present in the urine of larger cats. Cauxin is also present in the seminal fluid of cats and several other mammals, including sheep, pigs, cattle, rams, boars, rats, and mice. The cauxin found in seminal fluid is produced by epidydimal cells. The concentration in seminal fluid is much lower than its concentration of urine. The role of cauxin as an esterase allows it to hydrolyze specific monoacylglycerols, suggesting that it is involved in lipid transfer and metabolism. It is also theorized to play a role in fertilization. Cauxin protein from feline urine was reported in 2008 to act as a nucleator for struvite crystals, in an in vivo system containing magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate ions. Thus, this protein may act as one cause for feline urinary stones. Decreased cauxin concentration of urine is also a marker of tubulointerstitial nephritis in cats, a common illness in older domestic cats. This is due to damage to the tubular cells where excreted cauxin is produced.
