Origins Initially conceived as part of an ambitious project to quantify non-tariff trade barriers (NTBs) spearheaded by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)‚Äôs International Economic Affairs (IEA) department led by Nicholas E. Hollis, vice president and manager,ICTN evolved from a coalition of twenty five industrial trade associations, representing such diverse sectors as the American Paper Institute, the Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, the General Aviation Manufacturers, National Electrical Manufacturers Association and many others, which supported the NAM‚Äôs study approach for NTBs. The association coalition emerged from a series of conferences organized by Hollis in 1972 under the chairmanship of Samuel E.

Hollis recognized the ICTN could not maintain momentum and its budget commitments in such an environment and returned stateside after arranging for a freelance journalist, accredited before the Palais des Nations (United Nations) for press briefings to forward reports to ICTN subscribers.

ICTN did not realize some of its earlier representational dreams, but it proved unique as the first industry-wide coalition of its kind to focus attention on the MTN process- and the need for greater US industry participation in global commercial development.

Early Development IIAC-TN was launched as a project of NAM‚Äôs Task Force on NTBs chaired by Samuel E.

It was written by co-creator Steven Moffat, and directed by Paul McGuigan. The episode was based on \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The episode depicts Sherlock Holmes' (Benedict Cumberbatch) confrontation with Irene Adler (Lara Pulver), a dominatrix who has compromising photographs taken with a female member of the royal family. The photographs are stored inside her mobile phone, along with other valuable information which makes her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password. Besides referring to the Doyle short story, the episode title names Belgravia, a district of London adjacent to the grounds of Buckingham Palace. After its broadcast on BBC One, the episode was given consolidated figures of 10.663 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, pre-watershed. Plot Continuing the ending of \\"The Great Game\\", Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and John Watson (Martin Freeman) are confronting Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott). Moriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers. Holmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved. One day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet Mycroft (Mark Gatiss) in Buckingham Palace. Mycroft reveals that Irene Adler (Lara Pulver), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the royal family. The authority wants to retrieve Adler's smartphone, which contains those photographs. Holmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. As Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously. Suddenly several CIA operatives led by Neilson (Todd Boyce) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe. Holmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes. On Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone. Considering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon. Indeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler. Later, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death. Holmes followed them and learns this, too. Meanwhile, Neilson's team holds Mrs. Hudson (Una Stubbs) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson. Adler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted. She asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from MOD. Sherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be airline seat allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan. A government official brings Holmes to Heathrow. Mycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the Coventry myth. However, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled. Adler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone. However, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \\"SHER\\", so that words on the screen together reads \\"I AM SHER-LOCKED\\". Now without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down. Some months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a witness protection programme in America. Holmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \\"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\\", suggesting her death. After Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler. Sources and allusions Statue of Sherlock Holmes in Edinburgh. \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" alludes to this 'classic' image of Holmes created by illustrator Sidney Paget. The episode is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", and also alludes to several other adventures. There are humorous references to numerous famous Holmes stories, such as \\"The Greek Interpreter\\" (in this episode, the \\"Geek Interpreter\\"), \\"The Speckled Band\\" (in the episode, the \\"Speckled Blonde\\"), \\"The Naval Treaty\\" (in the episode, \\"The Navel Treatment\\"), \\"The Illustrious Client\\" and \\"The Priory School\\". One of Watson's blogs is titled \\"Sherlock Holmes Baffled\\", the same title as a 1900 silent film, the first depiction of Holmes on film. Watson reveals his middle name to be Hamish, a nod to Dorothy Sayers' theory. Moriarty's text message to Mycroft of \\"Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me,\\" is the same as his note to Holmes in the epilogue of \\"The Valley of Fear\\". As Holmes opens Adler's safe, he says \\"Vatican cameos\\", a reference to a mystery that is mentioned in The Hound of the Baskervilles. Production Lara Pulver decided to audition for the role of Irene Adler when she read the script shortly after wrapping on the espionage series Spooks, in which she had played Erin Watts. She was cast after meeting Steven Moffat and reading with Cumberbatch. Pulver told website Digital Spy that Moffat \\"had written such a multi-dimensional role that I literally immersed myself in his writing. Everything else went out the window for me, research-wise, other than [the dominatrix angle]. Literally, if you search my computer, you'd think I was a porn star or something!\\" She says that she found the initial vulnerability when filming the nude scenes \\"empowering\\" because she was unable to \\"hide behind anything ‚Äì there's no mask. This is me, in the flesh! By the end of take two, it wasn't an issue.\\" Musician Eos Chater worked as Benedict Cumberbatch's violin coach for this episode. Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist. To achieve this, Chater was positioned on set so that she could synchronise her playing with his. She says, \\"On set I need to see him; to play when he lifts his violin and stop when he stops. And he needs to see me; to copy my bowings, to ghost what I'm doing. In one scene I have to stand outside on two boxes on a scissor lift, watching him while he watches me out of the window.\\" Broadcast and reception \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" was first broadcast on BBC One on Sunday, 1 January 2012. It received preliminary overnight figures of 8.75 million viewers, with a 30.9 per cent audience share. It is Sherlock's highest rated episode since the show's first episode, \\"A Study in Pink\\", which attracted 7.5 million. The episode won BBC One the timeslot, having drawn more viewers than Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince on ITV1. When consolidated final ratings are factored in, the episode saw an increase of almost two million viewers, totalling 10.663 million viewers, making it the fifth most viewed programme for the week. \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" also saw significant viewings on the catch-up internet television service BBC iPlayer, with more than 800,000 seeing the episode within 24 hours after its original broadcast, eventually becoming the most-watched programme of 2012 in May with over 2.5 million requests. The episode was later repeated on the digital channel BBC Three on Saturday, 7 January 2012 from 7pm, which did not censor the nude scenes despite being shown pre-watershed. The repeat was seen by 883,000 viewers. The British Board of Film Classification has awarded the episode a 12 certificate for \\"moderate sex references, violence and threat\\". The episode, which is accompanied by an audio commentary by Cumberbatch, Moffat, Gatiss, Pulver and Vertue, was released with the remainder of the second series in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray on 23 January 2012. In the United States, the episode premiered on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) on 6 May 2012 as part of Masterpiece Mystery!. It was seen live by 3.2 million viewers, and was considered a success by the service as it doubled their average primetime ratings. Critical reception Critical reaction to the episode was largely positive. The Independents Neela Debnath observed a \\"constant stream of comedy that ran alongside the suspense\\", while Tom Sutcliffe, also for The Independent, commends Moffat's \\"real poignancy\\" and how \\"barely a minute passes without a line that's worth making a note of\\". Sutcliffe continues to praise \\"lovely performances and great writing\\", and that \\"the whole thing is filmed with such invention\\". Sarah Crompton, for The Telegraph, asserts that \\"Cumberbatch is utterly credible as a man who lives entirely in his cerebellum with little regard for the world outside, make Sherlock the perfect depiction of Holmes for our times\\". Radio Times writer David Brown agreed, stating that adaptation has the \\"heartbeat of Conan Doyle's original\\". Crompton further argues that the frequent allusions to the Holmes canon shows how Sherlock \\"revels in its own cleverness\\". Chris Harvey, also for The Telegraph, wrote, \\"We'll be lucky if there's a drama that's as much fun all year, so explaining that it was good, seems somehow superfluous\\". The Guardians Sam Wollaston says that Conan Doyle's original story has \\"been Moffatised as well as modernised. He starts off parallel but then wanders off left and right, into international terrorism and CIA plots and complicated conspiracy theories. It's very complicated, I find at times.\\" Wollaston later called it \\"a bit of a confusing mish-mash\\". In its otherwise positive review, Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery suggests that \\"the resolution to the 'Scandal' case is perhaps a little too far-fetched\\". Controversy Following the episode's broadcast, the tabloid Daily Mail reported that Irene Adler's nude scene early in the episode had been met with disapproval from some viewers; The Guardian claimed that there was \\"no mystery about the Mail's reaction\\", observing that the paper was \\"so outraged by the scenes\\" that it illustrated its story \\"with a big blow-up picture on page 9\\". Following the broadcast, a BBC spokesman said: \\"We're delighted with the critical and audience response to the first episode, which has been extremely positive, and have received no complaints at this stage.\\" As of 4 January 2012, the BBC had received 102 complaints \\"relating to inappropriate scenes broadcast before the Watershed\\", although \\"it could not tell when the complaints had been made, or how many came before and after the Daily Mail story\\". The regulator Ofcom also received 20 complaints about the episode, but they decided that it didn't warrant investigating. Jane Clare Jones, a doctoral student of feminist ethics writing in her blog on The Guardians website, criticised episode writer Steven Moffat's representation of Irene Adler, arguing that her sexualisation was a regressive step. She writes, \\"While Conan Doyle's original is hardly an exemplar of gender evolution, you've got to worry when a woman comes off worse in 2012 than in 1891.\\" Jones argues that while Conan Doyle's Adler was a \\"proto-feminist\\", Moffat undermined \\"her acumen and agency ... Not-so-subtly channelling the spirit of the predatory femme fatal [sic], Adler's power became, in Moffat's hands, less a matter of brains, and more a matter of knowing 'what men like' and how to give it to them ... Her masterminding of a cunning criminal plan was, it was revealed late in the day, not her own doing, but dependent on the advice of Holmes's arch nemesis, James Moriarty.\\" However, Laura Pledger of Radio Times listed Adler as a strong female television character, writing, \\"Not since Scarlett O'Hara has a woman employed quite so many feminine wiles in pursuit of her ultimate goal ‚Äì and with such chutzpah it feels churlish to criticise.\\" Moffat rejected any suggestion that he or Conan Doyle's creation harboured sexist views, labelling the allegation \\"deeply offensive\\", and misguided in that the critics had assumed that he was \\"presenting the characters as the way it is and the way it ought to be\\". But, he says, both Adler and Sherlock \\"are clearly defined as deranged ‚Äì it's love among the mad. He's a psychopath, so is she.\\" In another interview with WalesOnline, Moffat says: > I think it's one thing to criticise a programme and another thing to invent > motives out of amateur psychology for the writer and then accuse him of > having those feelings. I think that was beyond the pale and strayed from > criticism to a defamation act. I'm certainly not a sexist, a misogynist and > it was wrong. It's not true and in terms of the character Sherlock Holmes, > it is interesting. He has been referred to as being a bit misogynist. He's > not; the fact is one of the lovely threads of the original Sherlock Holmes > is whatever he says, he cannot abide anyone being cruel to women ‚Äì he > actually becomes incensed and full of rage. Moffat stated through Twitter that he didn‚Äôt feature more bisexual to Adler, saying, \\"We don‚Äôt acknowledge you on television 'cos you‚Äôre having FAR TOO MUCH FUN. You probably don‚Äôt even watch 'cos you‚Äôre so BUSY!\\" His statement was criticized by prominent members as a prejudiced comment.https://cherwell.org/2015/02/20/its-time-to-say-bi-to-the-straight- and-narrow/ Accolades In May 2012, the episode won three British Academy Television Craft Awards. Moffat was awarded the Best Writer category for his work on the episode. In the meantime, Charlie Phillips was awarded in Editing: Fiction and the sound team (John Mooney, Jeremy Child, Howard Bargroff, Doug Sinclair) won Sound: Fiction. The episode managed to win all three Craft categories it was nominated for. The episode was nominated for 13 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Miniseries or Movie. Benedict Cumberbatch was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for his portrayal of Sherlock and Martin Freeman was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for his portrayal of Watson. Moffat and Paul MacGuigan were also nominated for their writing and directing respectively. In May 2013, the episode won the Edgar Award for Best Episode in a TV Series.

Origins In the wake of OPEC‚Äôs second oil price shock (coordinated price increase) during the early days of the Carter Administration- which resulted in an enormous surge of petro-dollar wealth transfer to oil producing nations, including several in the Mideast/North Africa region, interest in improved mechanisms to nurture business and cultural understanding accelerated. Armed with high-level industry contacts and well-regarded in Middle East circles following the NAM Mid-East Industrial Mission of November 1974, Nicholas Everett Hollis visited the region on several occasions during the 1977-79 period ‚Äì in both official and private capacities - and met with leading officials such as Dr. Zaki Mustafa of the Saudi-Sudanese Red Sea Commission, Dr. Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's famous petroleum minister, Soliman Al-Solaim, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Commerce, Sheikh Mohamed Abakhail, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Finance and others‚Äîand began advancing the proposal for a regular dialogue mechanism. In late 1978 Hollis prepared a proposal for a US-Saudi Business Council while visiting Jeddah ‚Äì and the idea received encouragement from US Ambassador John West and others, including US Treasury officials connected with the Joint Economic Commission, who had worked with Hollis during his tenure at AID's reimbursable development program (RDP) Later, the proposal was refined and broadened to include other Arab countries in coordination with the existing US-Arab Chamber of Commerce (New York) and the Saudi Chambers of Commerce. The concept was formally incorporated on March 9, 1979 with the immediate assignment of managing a large Pan Arab mission program visiting the United States, including conferences in New York, Washington and Chicago and promotion for a new, $175 million investment program initially subscribed out of the United Arab Emirates- called the General Arab Investment Company (GAIC) designed to stimulate joint ventures between US corporations and Arab partners in the Mideast. GAIC became the forerunner of the Arab Investment Company (TAIC) which today is owned jointly by 17 Arab states with capital in excess of US$800 Million. The high-powered eighty man Arab delegation was led by Dr. Burhan Dajani, secretary general of the General Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, Sheikh Ismail Abudawood, chairman of the Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry with financial leaders such as Saif Ghurair (representing H.E. Rached Ben Said Al-Maktoum of Dubai/UAE) and others in the wings. Senator Randolph hosts breakfast at Capitol.

November 16, 1979. Sources: Courtesy of US-Arab Business Roundtable In organizing the Washington portion of the mission program, Hollis encountered a series of logistical, scheduling and political hurdles which ultimately required persuasive skills and a high degree of luck to overcome. For example, during the final hours of the New York program Hollis was forced to procure private corporate jets to fly delegates to the Nation's capital since their departure from New York was delayed beyond the last shuttle by a United Nations reception quietly slipped into the schedule well after the Washington program of workshops and appointments had been set. Without the intervention of corporate friends, the Arab delegates would have been forced to miss early morning meetings at the US Capitol- possibly the high point of their visit. Hollis utilized corporate sponsors of USABR to scramble two jets and delivered a leadership group from the delegation in the early hours of November 16, 1979. Later, that morning, after a breakfast hosted in the Capitol by U.S. Senator Jennings Randolph (D-WV) which included other prominent colleagues (i.e. Senator Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX), Senator Charles H. Percy (R-IL), Representative John Brademas (Majority Whip- D-NY), Representative Gillis Long (D-LA) and others) the Arab leaders were ushered into a private meeting with then Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd (D-WV). It was a significant meeting as Byrd had recently been dispatched as President Carter's envoy to visit Saudi Arabia and the news wires were buzzing over the Administration's decision to freeze Iranian financial assets in the wake of the US Embassy seizure in Tehran on November 4. The US Capital was in a high state of alert. Later, that morning Hollis led the Arab group to a meeting at the US Treasury with Undersecretary Anthony Solomon and then reconvened with sixty business leaders at the Hyatt Hotel for a luncheon and afternoon workshop. The luncheon was chaired by William L. Wearly, chairman of Ingersoll Rand and John C.Marous, president of Westinghouse Electric International. Dr. Burhan Dajani, secretary general of the General Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce and Sheikh Abudawood spoke for the Arab delegation . Considerable discussion focused on the General Arab Investment Company (GAIC). The U.S. Department of State was represented by Ambassador Joseph W. Twinam, a deputy assistant secretary in the Near Eastern and North Africa Bureau. The Washington USABR meeting was featured in an article in the Christian Science Monitor on November 30 testifying to the below-the-radar approach which steered the program to success against enormous odds. Later, a beleaguered Mohamed Baghal, executive director of the US Arab Chamber of Commerce(USACC) (and a co-incorporator of USABR) would personally express appreciation of the Arab delegation to Hollis in Chicago. USABR had been designated by name in the delegation working paper as a vehicle for joint venture facilitation with GAIC. The USABR debut had been a good one. Roy Lidicker's academic article, ‚ÄúPolitical Power and the Arab Oil Weapon‚Äù was published in 1988 and delves into the economic rationale behind the USABR, and the ramifications of the changing economic strategy in the Middle East. Later, Hollis utilized USABR to advance a special agricultural conference organized in Alexandria, Egypt for July 7‚Äì10, 1980. After a series of planning meetings at the law firm of Patton Boggs & Blow, Hollis assumed leadership of the US business delegation to the conference. Working with Richard Lyng of the American Meat Institute (later Reagan's Secretary of Agriculture) and Clifford Cox, vice chairman of Greyhound Corporation, Hollis fielded a twenty-man delegation, attracted House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-WA) and played a galvanizing role coordinating the academic and government participation as well. The conference entitled ‚ÄúThe Economic Challenges of Peace: Agriculture and Economic Transition in Egypt‚Äù proved highly successful. A highlight of the program was a private meeting with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in his garden outside Alexandra. The Nobel Peace prize winning statesman was gracious and relaxed with his astounded guests who had come to the estate expected to have tea with Mrs. Gihan Sadat. Presentation before General Union of Arab Chambers (Kuwait) USABR also figured prominently in a number of follow-up activities including the October meetings of JECOR at the Treasury Department with Saudi leaders seeking to activate the US-Saudi Business Council proposal. Later in 1981 Hollis received a coveted invitation to address the General Union of Arab Chambers in Kuwait‚Äîpossibly the only American ever to receive this honor. On February 3, Hollis delivered a speech entitled ‚ÄúEnterpreneurship and Voluntary Business Groups: The Role of Chambers of Commerce in Economic Development‚Äù which was translated into Arabic and circulated widely in the Arab world. The speech also received considerable local media attention. Hollis drew on his experience with the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and history to provide his presentation. USABR's success had been precariously balanced between rival groups of the Arab chambers of commerce- where cooperation was difficult to obtain or sustain over any period ‚Äì particularly among the US Arab chamber groups ‚Äìwhere rivalry was often destructive. Hollis once compared his predicament to the legendary T.E. Lawrence (\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\") trying to cobble alliances in the Near East during World War I. USABR dissolved, its functions subsumed with the rise of a separate non-profit, the Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER) which concentrated on agricultural and energy development and based its annual meetings from Geneva, Switzerland (after 1980). Another non-profit association, the National Council on US-Arab Relations, formed in 1983, began serving various bilateral/regional functions in the ongoing dialogue. The Agri-Energy Roundtable (AER), convened delegates from energy-surplus countries. A supporter of Hollis, U.S. Senator Jennings Randolph (D-WV) chaired the annual conferences for 7 years (1981 ‚Äì 1987). The AER, received accreditation from the United Nations as a non- governmental organization in 1985.

Background Berthe Petit had wished to enter religious life, but in December 1888, her confessor advised her that her vocation was not to enter a convent, but to stay at home at care for her parents. Petit then prayed to the Blessed Virgin that someone be called to the priesthood in lieu of her aspirations to enter religious life.Eucharistic Adoration for the Sanctification of Priests and Spiritual Maternity, Congregatio Pro Clericis, 2007 Life Decorsant was born in Saint-Quentin, Aisne, France, in 1866. He trained as a lawyer in Paris, where he attained the degree of Doctor of Law. An officer in the reserves, he thereupon broke his engagement to be married and decided to study for the priesthood in Rome. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy and theology and returned to Paris, where he was ordained on 9 July 1893 in the chapel of the Institut Catholique de Paris. After serving fifteen years as a curate in Vincennes, France, Decorsant resigned due to overwork and failing health. In 1908, he made a pilgrimage to Lourdes where he first encountered Berthe Petit. He then left for Brussels, where he took up residence in a convent guest-house. He devoted his time to preaching and giving retreats. Under the supervision of Redemptorist Father Masselis, Decorsant became Petit's spiritual director. When Petit was granted the privilege of a private oratory, he became her chaplain.The Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary, (A Nun of Kylemore Abbey, trans.), Lulu.com, 2004 Petit reported revelations regarding the establishment of a devotion to the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary.

It was Klassen‚Äôs first book as both author and illustrator. The book was published by Candlewick Press in September 2011. It is notable for its dark ending.  Plot  A bear laments his lost hat, and sets off to find it. He asks a fox and a frog if they‚Äôve seen it, but neither has. The bear then asks a rabbit who is wearing a red pointy hat. The rabbit answers negatively and defensively, ending ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me any more questions.‚Äù The bear then moves on to ask a turtle, a snake, and an indeterminate creature. None have seen the hat. A deer comes upon the despondent bear and asks him what his hat looked like. Upon recollecting that his hat was red and pointy, the bear snaps to a realization and runs back to the rabbit. He accuses the rabbit of stealing his hat. After a page turn, we see the bear sitting on a rustled patch of ground, wearing the red pointy hat. A squirrel enters and asks the bear if he‚Äôs seen a rabbit wearing a hat. The bear answers negatively and defensively, implying he ate the rabbit and ending with ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me any more questions‚Äù. The squirrel exits, leaving the hatted bear sitting alone.  Reception and awards  The book achieved considerable commercial success, spending 48 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Pamela Paul praised the book in review for The New York Times: \\"it is a wonderful and astonishing thing, the kind of book that makes child laugh and adult chuckle, and both smile in appreciation ... [it is] a charmingly wicked little book and the debut of a promising writer-illustrator talent.\\" According to the Chicago Tribune, \\"the joy of this book lies in figuring out the explicit plot from the implicit details in the pictures.\\" There has been some discussion of the ending over the appropriateness of a character killing another without repercussion in a children's book. A bookseller, who \\"need[ed] to go on record as saying I LOVE this book\\", reported that some customers love it until they turn the last pages. It made the Kate Greenaway Medal shortlist, and was a Geisel Award honor book.  Adaptations  An animated version of I Want My Hat Back was produced by Weston Woods Studios and Bigfott Studios in 2013. The film was adapted, directed, and animated by Galen Fott. Jon Klassen provided the voice of the deer. It was a nominee for the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival.

Pigford (April 4, 1922 ‚Äì February 27, 2010) was a professor and the founding chairman of the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. The scope of his career in nuclear engineering consisted of reactor design, nuclear safety, fuel cycles, and radioactive waste management. He is credited for having an influential voice in nuclear policy. Pigford was generally well respected by scientists and environmentalists alike because of the expertise he brought to the subject and his objectivity. He was considered a pro-nuclear advocate, but only if done so in a safe way.In Memoriam Thomas Pigford, nuclear safety proponent, dies Early years Pigford graduated magna cum laude from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1943. He served in the Navy during World War II, and was later asked to join the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while still completing his doctorate. Pigford helped to establish the Nuclear Engineering Department at MIT. Marriage and family Pigford married his first wife Catherine Kennedy Cathey and had two daughters, Cynthia and Julie Pigford. Catherine died in 1992. Two years after the death of his first wife, Pigford married his second wife Elizabeth Hood Weekes in 1994. He had two stepdaughters from his second marriage, Janvrin Deler and Laura Weekes.Thomas Pigford, influential voice in nuclear policy, dies at 87 Career As a chemical engineer, he co-authored the book \\"Nuclear Chemical Engineering\\" published in 1958 and 1983 which outlined methods that the government used for harvesting plutonium from reactor fuel to be used in bombs. This text was critical because it was considered to be the first in the field. He won the John Wesley Powell Award for his contribution to the United States Geological Survey.John Wesley Powell Awardees Three Mile Island accident Pigford was appointed to a commission in 1979 to study the Three Mile Island accident in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The commission reported that certain operators lacked proper training which led them to turning off certain safety systems. With these safety systems off, a simple malfunction turned into a larger problem that destroyed the nuclear core. Pigford was very critical of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for their technical errors and the alarmist response. \\"Every technology imposes a finite degree of risk upon society, both in its routine operation and in the occurrence of accidents. The essential question is the trade-off between the risks and the benefits. The commission neither received any evidence nor reached any conclusions that the risks of nuclear power outweigh its benefits.\\"Deceased--Thomas H. Pigford Chernobyl disaster Seven years after the Three Mile Island incident, a nuclear reactor in Chernobyl, Ukraine exploded and spewed a cloud of radioactive material across Europe. Pigford was appointed by the secretary of energy to a committee for evaluating the safety implementations of a similar reactor in Hanford, Washington. Pigford concluded that the plant, which was being used to make plutonium for nuclear bombs, was less safe than the American commercial nuclear reactors. He rejected safety measures proposed by the department, claiming that they would be no help at all. Immediately after this revelation, the department closed the reactor.Thomas H. Pigford, Nuclear Engineer, Is Dead at 87 Proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository Pigford served on the EPA panel in the mid-1990s to help advise the agency on what standards should be put in place for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. The EPA eventually decided that the government should have the power to assume how to use the land in the area in future millenniums. Pigford was critical of the EPA for permitting higher levels of radiation contamination in the water supply for farmers because of their assumption that the land would only be used by subsistence farmers, \\"They end up with such a less stringent result that cannot be defended. That‚Äôs bad for the project; it‚Äôs bad for the country.\\" Death In 2001, Pigford was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and was treated for nine years. He died from complications of the disease on February 27, 2010 at his home in Oakland, California.

Stewart Kyd, 1794 engraving. Life A native of Arbroath, Forfarshire, he went at the age of fourteen from Arbroath grammar school to King's College, Aberdeen. Abandoning a design of entering the church, he settled in London, and was called to the bar from the Middle Temple. He became a friend of Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke, whose political opinions he admired. In November 1792 he joined the Society for Constitutional Information. On 29 May 1794 he was arrested and examined by the privy counsel but was soon discharged. On 4 June he was again summoned before the counsel, and three days later was committed to the Tower on a charge of high treason, with Hardy, Tooke, and ten others. On 25 October all the prisoners were brought up for trial before a special commission at the Old Bailey, but after the acquittal of Hardy, Tooke and John Thelwall, the attorney-general declined offering any evidence against Kyd, and he was discharged. In June 1797 he defended Thomas Williams, a bookseller, who was indicted for blasphemy in publishing Tom Paine's The Age of Reason. His speech was printed during the same year.

AER conducts international conferences, regional seminars and workshops, trade missions and technical assistance for the formation of autonomous indigenous counterpart associations.Agri-business Council, www.agribusinesscouncil.org/aer.htm Origins Undertaken as a conference project in mid-1979, the agri-energy concept evolved into an independent forum following a New Orleans meeting held February 7‚Äì9, 1980 which attracted business and government leaders from energy-surplus nations. The first conference benefited from the Carter Administration‚Äôs Soviet grain embargo - announced weeks earlier - which created unprecedented congestion at the Port of New Orleans.

Among the corporate sponsors was the chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation- Dr. Armand Hammer. AER was formally incorporated in March 1980 by Nicholas Everett Hollis as a non-profit association. Hollis had conceived organized and conducted the New Orleans conference. and recognized the potential for a forum. Later, AER produced a publication entitled ‚ÄúThe Agri-Energy Roundtable 1980- U.S. Agribusiness and the Energy-Rich Nations: Partners for Agricultural Development in the ‚Äò80s‚Äù. The document featured themes of trilateral development Hollis had championed while in the State Department as well as a compilation of papers presented at the conference Hollis also used contacts in the Mid-East to advance the AER and helped organize an Egyptian agricultural conference in Alexandria in July. Building a multilateral forum Determined to broaden AER's international profile, Hollis mobilized European contacts and began organizing a program in Switzerland with encouragement from US Senator Jennings Randolph and Dr. Armand Hammer. These plans were also advanced in the Arab world following a speech before the General Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce on February 3 in Kuwait. During AER's Geneva conference April 27‚Äì29 at the Intercontinental Hotel Senator Randolph presided over a gathering which included Occidental Petroleum's president A.

Years later the same issues pitting the US, Europe and the emerging nations would resurface to frustrate trade negotiations, leading to the collapse of the Doha Round (July 2008) In June AER attended the UN World Food Council ministerial meetings at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia as a non- governmental organization representing the private sector. In July AER organized a two-day seminar on agricultural technologies in partnership with the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) at Stratford-upon-Avon, July 4‚Äì6.Agri-Energy Report: ‚ÄúGeneva and Stratford-upon-Avon Updates‚Äù, Summer 1984Brochure ‚ÄúEmerging Agricultural Technologies- New Dimensions For Food Security, Stratford-upon-Avon (in cooperation with the Royal Agricultural Society of England), July 4‚Äì6, 1984 Hollis used his participation at these annual UK events to solidify high level industry support throughout the Commonwealth. AER primary sponsors in the UKLetter, Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman National Coal Board to N.E. Hollis, AER January. 31, 1984 included Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) plc, Taylor Woodrow plc,., Paterson- Zochonis, Prudential Bache Trading, Universal Leaf Tobacco and others. Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman of the National Coal Board and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs chief industrial advisor, was instrumental in generating support for AER in the UK MacGregor had been a close Hollis ally as a founding member of the US-European Business Council at the Versailles conference of March 1972. During this same period the subcommittee on counter-trade began meeting in London under the chairmanship of Andreas Calice of Prudential-Bache Trading in response to the recognition that debt was choking trade with much of the Third World. West African outreach In late 1984 Hollis was invited to visit Nigeria at the inspiration of several sponsors who had hoped to organize an African regional conference in Lagos. This effort was pursued for eighteen months but was suspended when it was determined that local sponsors could not assure a conference success. The campaign did spark interest in establishing an indigenously supported counterpart Agri-Energy Roundtable/Nigeria. Competition for public funding Shortly after retiring his Senate seat, Jennings Randolph assumed the chairmanship of AER and visited AID Administrator M. Peter McPherson to request program assistance to enable the Roundtable to develop its task force and subcommittee activities for more substantive focus in various agro-food processing, distribution, technology and finance sectors. This approach would have insured greater private sector participation as well which appealed to the Reagan Administration.Letter -Michael Deaver, Assistant to the President (Reagan) to Senator Jennings Randolph, September 26, 1984 However, just as the AID interest in the proposal seemed to gel, a reorganization at the White House undercut higher level encouragement at a critical juncture and AID's Bureau for Science and Technology (S&T;) itself underwent a sharp downsizing- which effectively left AER's proposal shelved and unnoticed. It is worth noting that AID was under pressure to terminate its ongoing support for a USDA backed group called the Joint Agricultural Consultative Committee (JACC) after internal reviews cited poor performance and other issues. JACC was considered competitive with AER. AER staff pulled out of the quicksand of AID meetings and produced a Sixth annual International Agriculture Forum in Geneva, June 2‚Äì5, 1985. Senator Randolph introduced James Ingram, executive director of the World Food Programme and presided over a gathering which featured representations from nearly forty countries. A letter from President Reagan was read to the conferees.Letter- President Ronald Reagan to AER delegates, Sixth Annual IAF, May 26, 1985 AER opened a Geneva office, staffed by Carl Bjertnes and Brooks Ford. Participation at UN World Food Council Meetings AER fielded a small delegation to represent private enterprise at the UN World Food Council ministerial conference in Paris (June 10‚Äì13) led by Gustavo de los Reyes. AER celebrated its new status as an officially accredited non-governmental organization before the United Nations. Following these meetings, Hollis met with James Callaghan, former UK prime minister at the Royal Show and Callaghan agreed to help advance AER in the Commonwealth. Callaghan had been familiar with AER through Lord Walston, a former Labour minister for development and one of the UK's leading agriculturalists. Self-help Solutions for Africa‚Äôs Food Security AER continued its campaign for the private sector, self-help solutions in Africa- as contrasted with famine relief programs of Bob Geldof which captured the public imagination with video and musical appeals linked with the Ethiopian tragedy.Farming News, Skill is Still the Best Form of AID‚Äù, Anthony Rosen, June 21, 1985 However AER had difficulty finding a suitable base from which to launch an African operation. Nonetheless, in September 1985 AER hosted a Washington seminar on Africa and later Hollis revisited Nigeria where a workshop was conducted in Lagos aimed at mobilizing broader support for a West African regional conference. Texaco‚Äôs director on the AER board, Jean Poupeau- had pioneered a cassava farm demonstrating how a multinational oil company could contribute directly to a nation‚Äôs food security- by using its gas station network to distribute basic foodstuffs.(See TexAgri, Ltd) Later that year AER‚Äôs Hollis was invited by U.S. Representative Mickey Leland (D-Texas) to serve as an advisor to the House Select Committee on Hunger. In the spring of 1986 AER began suffering a serious subscription/dues decline triggered by declining commodity prices, the retirement of key corporate supporters, and competitive forces led by Orville Freeman‚Äôs JACC. Although JACC collapsed in mid-1986, Freeman joined the Agriculture Council of America (ACA) from which he launched more broadsides. Significantly, a key ACA contributor was Freeman‚Äôs old friend, Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). ADM had been a contributing sponsor to AER but expressed dissatisfaction over AER‚Äôs refusal to actively promote ethanol and withdrew its support. International program momentum AER‚Äôs international programming continued to generate momentum overseas. AER pursued public funding after receiving an invitation from Philippine Agriculture Minister Ramon Mitra to organize a conference in Manila.Agri-Energy Report: Philippine Government Invites AER Mission/Conference, Summer/Fall 1986Letter- Ramon V. Mitra, Minister of Agriculture and Food/Philippines to N.E.

Whelan, former Canadian minister of agriculture and president of the UN World Food Council, and Lord Harry Walston of the UK House of Lords also on the program. ‚Äù. Organizationally, the AER board of directors and committee of honor gathered cohesion around Senator Randolph while other subcommittees similar in structure to the counter- trade/finance subgroup began to take shape.Countertade Outlook, Vol. VIII, No. 23, July 17, 1985 A strong outreach aimed at attracting Soviet high-level AER participation orchestrated from ICI and the US Embassy in Moscow produced no results.Letter- Curtis W. Kamman, Charge d‚ÄôAffaires, US Embassy Moscow to Hon. Jennings Randolph, AER, April 23, 1985 ( Re: Soviet participation in AER) Philippine initiative broadens to ASEAN and South Asia In the summer AER was invited by Philippine Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez (former vice president under Ferdinand Marcos) to organize an agribusiness program during the state visit of newly inaugurated Philippine President Corazon Aquino to Washington in September. This program at the Madison Hotel was accomplished so successfully that Agriculture Minister Ramon Mitra invited AER staff to visit Manila and organize an ASEAN wide conference featuring Philippine agro- industry investment potentials. Hollis traveled to Manila in October and secured pledges from USAID/Philippines to provide seed grant funding for the conference. On this trip Hollis also visited Hong Kong and India and began discussions aimed at starting an AER counterpart association in Bombay (Mumbai). Early in 1987 AER received a request from the chairman of a competitive association ‚Äì The Agribusiness Council (ABC)‚Äîto form an alliance, The New York based ABC wanted a Washington presence and more international programming scope. After protracted negotiations and board approvals, a management services agreement was worked out whereby AER would assume day-to- day staff management of the Council which became a de facto U.S. affiliate of the international AER network. AER overcame a funding logjam (working with Vice President George Bush's intervention) and proceeded to organize a conference at the Manila Hotel (May 24‚Äì27).Manila Standard (Editorial) ‚ÄúA Meaningful Conference‚Äù Celso Al-Carunungan, May 25, 1987 (Manila, Philippines) and resulted in the formation of an indigenous, free-standing AER/Filpinas ‚Äì the first international affiliate of AER under the elected leadership of Celso Al.

Late in the year AER accepted an invitation to visit the Persian Gulf for the purpose of organizing a regional Roundtable. Hollis also visited India and the Philippines conducting board meetings and briefing the counterpart groups at each stop. In March AER partnered with a new sponsor, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Office of Biomass and launched a special Subcommittee on Renewable Energy Technology. The two-day event at the Mayflower Hotel was chaired by John Shields of the TVA and included representatives of two dozen leading companies interested in renewable energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and others primarily in relation to agriculture. Enthusiasm dropped a few weeks later when Shields resigned, claiming budget cuts would downsize TVA's commitment to biomass energy.

In mid August AER met in London to finalize plans for the Gulf regional conference in UAE and to conduct meetings with the London-based non- conventional finance subgroup. Plans were announced for the formation of a new sub-group on transport/distribution related to agro-food systems. In October AER combined with ABC to host a conference in St. Louis on the effects of the great North American drought on U.S. agricultural reliability and the transportation system. One of the sessions on high technology in agriculture attracted such interest that participating AID and USDA officials pledged funding for a sequel to be conducted by ABC on the more specialized theme of non-feed industrial uses for agriculture, biotechnology and other related themes.

The aim was to consolidate and rehabilitate ABC using the organization of a large conference on new agricultural technologies. The idea had sprouted during the St. Louis conference and hinged on a grant pledge which AID's S&T; Bureau had dangled. In July Hollis resumed travels to New Delhi, conducting a workshop at the Oberoi Hotel with Indian business leaders, including Lala Bansidhar of DCM, S.K. Birla of Birla Industries and others (July 6). Hollis also briefed political leaders including Najma Heptulla and the Speaker of India's Parliament Bal Ram Jakhar. The aim was to jump start AER/India which had languished under weak leadership in Mumbai with an All- India format. Hollis also visited Colombo for talks on sparking a counterpart association in Sri Lanka with allies developed via previous Geneva conferences. A key element was the potential USAID use of local currencies generated from the sale of US commodities under the Food for Peace program (described in a White House encouragement cable on November 3, 1987- see UNCLAS State 342248) Growing AER recognition with international donor agencies was signaled with an invitation to UNDP‚Äôs African Leadership Forum at General Obasanjo‚Äôs farm in Ota, Nigeria.Letter- General Olusegun Obasanjo, chairman, African Leadership Forum to N.E.

Eventually PAA turned to Europe's funding agency for agriculture (FAPA) for support. For its part, USDA coordinated an aggressive effort ‚Äìboth from Washington and Warsaw, to undercut the Polish program, and later utilized the threat of withholding agricultural support services to the US Embassy in Vilnius in a separate campaign to suffocate interest in an initiative aimed at forming an agribusiness association in Lithuania (2002).Memo, US-Lithuaniam, Bilateral Working Group April 6, 2000 Vilnius EU/NB talking points \\"Agribusiness Councils\\" April 3, 2000Protocol Memo, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, Alan Larson to H.E Algirdas Rimkunas Deputy Minister Foreign Affairs/Lithuaniam May 31, 2000Electronic mail, Matthew Christ/US Embassy Vilnius to State/Baltic Affairs Office Re: NGO Proposal, November 16, 1999 Developments USG agencies, including USAID, USDA and the Department of State, also continued to request ABC proposals for planned agribusiness association development, formatted around the AER model, particularly in Indonesia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, and Bulgaria, but these government initiatives were not sustained. More recently, US government proxy groups have sought to enlist ABC for training and/or briefings for incoming agricultural groups many of which apparently have requested ABC involvement in their visit planning (e.g., Azerbaijan (Ganja) Agribusiness Association- March 2003, Albania Agribusiness Council-October 2003, Georgian Agribusiness Association Workshop- January 2015, Eurasian Agribusiness Association Seminar- March 2015).

When she finally stood up to him, Appa Rao burned her face with sulphuric acid. She died soon afterward, following which Appa Rao forced Puppy to follow in her mother's steps. Appa Rao has taken a loan from Baba Sab and the only way to repay it is to make Puppy dance. But Puppy does not give up and continues meeting Shakthi. Appa Rao meets the younger brother of Baba Sab (Ahuti Prasad), who joined him after completing his term for robbery and he was arrested due to Shakthi. Baba Sab doesn't know Shakthi's identity. Appa Rao instantly recognizes Shakthi and explains everything to Baba Sab. Chote goes to Shakthi's house and tries to rape Jyothi as revenge. Shakthi averts this and kills Chote.

Cherry Street is carried over the waterways of the Port Lands by Toronto's only two lift bridges . A smaller one where it crosses the Keating Channel and a larger one where it crosses the channel to the turning basin. Its northern terminus is at Eastern Avenue. A co-linear street, named Sumach St., continues north. It crosses Front St., Mill St., Lake Shore Boulevard, Commissioners Street and Unwin Ave. After crossing Unwin, it continues another 200 metres south to Cherry Beach, where it ends in a roundabout. According to The Canadian Entomologist Cherry Street, between Unwin Ave. and the Keating Channel was the first recorded site of termite infestation in Ontario. In 2012, the Toronto Transit Commission started to construct the first segment of a new streetcar line beside Cherry Street, from King Street 700 metres south to Lake Shore Boulevard. This initial segment is projected to cost $90 million CAD. Original plans called for the line to extend further south into redeveloped portlands. That extension pushed the budget for the line to $300 million CAD. The intersection of Cherry and Front streets is being described as the future gateway to the \\"Canary District\\", 200 acres of former light industrial land being redeveloped into a residential area. During the 2015 Pan American Games and Parapan American Games thousands of athletes were housed in a temporary athlete's village just east of the intersection of Cherry and Front streets. Temporary pavilions were built on a large vacant lot on the southwest corner of Cherry and Front which served as the athlete's dining area, as well as a temporary bus marshaling yards for the fleet of rented buses which carried athletes to their venues. In early plans, athletes would have ridden a streetcar to Union Station to make connections to the games' scattered venues. However, the streetcar's opening was delayed until after the games were over. The apartments that housed the athletes were made available only partially complete. Since the athletes dined at central cafeterias completing the apartment's kitchens was postponed. That way the rooms intended to serve as kitchens could be used as an additional bedroom. Other fittings, like hardwood floors that could be damaged by the spikes on sports shoes, were installed after the games were over. The TTC announced the streetcar's route in 2016.

During Tang Dynasty   Background  It is not known when Yang Shihou was born, but it is known that he was from Jingou (Êñ§Ê∫ù, in modern Fuyang, Anhui). In his youth, he served as a soldier under Li Hanzhi, who was then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan).New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 23. After Li Hanzhi lost his own territory and became a subordinate of Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) in 888,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Li Hanzhi gave, as a tribute to Li Keyong, about 100 elite soldiers, and Yang was one of the soldiers thus sent to join the Hedong army. However, Yang did not distinguish himself while serving under Li Keyong. Later, after he was accused of crimes, he fled to Li Keyong's archenemy Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Zhu made him an officer in the Xuanwu army and the prefect of Cao Prefecture (ÊõπÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong).  Service under Zhu Quanzhong  The first campaign that Yang Shihou was recorded to have clearly participated in was against Zhu Quanzhong's erstwhile vassal Wang Shifan the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), who rose against Zhu in 903Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. and subsequently received aid from Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in the form of an army commanded by the general Wang Maozhang. Subsequently, though, Wang Maozhang realized that the Huainan/Pinglu joint army was badly outnumbered by the main Xuanwu army, commanded by Zhu himself, and therefore retreated with the Huainan army. Zhu sent Yang Shihou to give chase, and while Yang was able to defeat and kill Wang Maozhang's rearguard commander Li Qianyu (), Wang Maozhang's main strength was able to withdraw. Subsequently, Zhu left Yang in charge of sieging Pinglu's capital Qing Prefecture while he himself returned to Xuanwu's capital Daliang. Yang pitched his camp at Linqu (Ëá®Êúê, in modern Weifang) while claiming that he was heading for Mi Prefecture and leaving the supplies at Linqu; when Wang Shifan, believing that Yang had left for Mi, attacked, he fell into Yang's trap and suffered heavy casualties, with his brother Wang Shike () captured by Yang; when the army from Pinglu's Lai Prefecture, Yang also defeated them and almost completely slaughtered them, and thereafter maintained a chokehold on Qing Prefecture. Wang Shifan thereafter sent an emissary to offer to surrender to Yang, and Zhu accepted the surrender.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. For this victory, Yang was made the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu).History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 22. In 905, Zhu, displeased that Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit (Âø†Áæ©, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei) was in close communications with two of his enemies ‚Äî Yang Xingmi and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) ‚Äî sent Yang Shihou to attack Zhongyi, with Zhu himself commanding the follow-up troops. Yang Shihou quickly captured seven of Zhongyi's prefectures ‚Äî Tang (ÂîêÂ∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), Deng (ÈÑßÂ∑û, in modern Nanyang, Henan), Fu (Âæ©Â∑û, in modern Tianmen, Hubei), Ying (ÈÉ¢Â∑û, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), Sui (Èö®Â∑û, in modern Suizhou, Hubei), Jun (ÂùáÂ∑û, in modern Shiyan, Hubei), and Fang (ÊàøÂ∑û, also in modern Shiyan) ‚Äî and then rendezvoused with Zhu just north of the Han River. Under Zhu's orders, Yang built floating bridges across the Han, allowing Zhu's army to cross. When Zhao's army put up a defense on the southern bank of the Han River, Yang defeated him and advanced to his capital Xiang Prefecture (). Zhao thereafter abandoned Xiang Prefecture and fled to Huainan. Zhu commissioned Yang as the acting military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, i.e., Zhongyi, reverting to an older name) and ordered him to attack Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), ruled by Zhao's brother Zhao Kuangming. Zhao Kuangming, hearing of Zhao Kuangning's defeat, fled to Xichuan, and Zhao Kuangming's officer Wang Jianwu () surrendered to Yang. Zhu made He Gui the acting military governor of Jingnan and Yang the full military governor of Shannan East.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.  During Later Liang   During Emperor Taizu's reign  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Tang's last emperor, Emperor Ai, yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. In 909, Emperor Taizu recalled Yang Shihou from Shannan East, commissioning him as the commander of the forces preparing to attack Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), which was then ruled by Later Liang's archrival Jin (i.e., the state ruled by Li Keyong's son and successor Li Cunxu). He sent Wang Ban () to Shannan East to serve as acting military governor in Yang's absence. (As Yang departed Xiang Prefecture, he warned Wang Ban that certain officers, including one Wang Qiu (), were unruly and might mutiny in his absence; Wang Ban took no precautions, however, and later in the year Wang Qiu assassinated Wang Ban and rebelled, but the rebellion was quickly put down.) Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. Soon after Yang departed Xiang Prefecture, though, before the army could be launched to attack Lu, Liu Zhijun the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), rebelled against Emperor Taizu and submitted to Li Maozhen the Prince of Qi. Emperor Taizu thereafter sent Yang, assisted by Liu Xun, to attack Liu Zhijun. Liu Xun quickly captured Tong Pass, and when Yang advanced to Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan as well), Liu Zhijun's subordinate Nie Shang () surrendered it to Yang. Liu Zhijun panicked, abandoned Zhongwu's capital Tong Prefecture (), and fled to Qi territory. Yang subsequently attacked the former imperial capital Chang'an, which Liu Zhijun had seized and turned control over to Qi troops; he circled around to the city's west side and fought into the city, defeating Qi troops and retaking the city. For his contributions, Emperor Taizu gave him the title of acting Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies). Later in the year, Li Maozhen sent Liu Zhijun to attack Later Liang's Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). As part of the operation, Li Maozhen asked Li Cunxu to attack Later Liang's Jin (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) and Jiang (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) Prefectures. Li Cunxu sent his general Zhou Dewei to do so and followed Zhou himself. Yang, however, defeated Zhou, and forced the Jin forces, which were then sieging Jin Prefecture, to withdraw. Emperor Taizu subsequently made him the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). In 910, Qi and Jin jointly attacked Later Liang's Dingnan Circuit (ÂÆöÈõ£, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Dingnan's military governor Li Renfu sought aid from the Later Liang imperial government, and Emperor Taizu sent Yang and Kang Huaizhen () to head west to attack Qi, but even before they headed west, Emperor Taizu sent the officers Li Yu () and Liu Wan () to head toward Dingnan's capital Xia Prefecture (). When Li Yu and Liu Wan arrived there, the Qi and Jin forces withdrew. Thereafter, Emperor Taizu sent Yang and Li Si'an () to Ze Prefecture (Êæ§Â∑û, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi) to make new preparations to attack Lu Prefecture. Soon thereafter, though, with Emperor Taizu sending Wang Jingren to head a task force, with Han Qing () and Li Si'an serving under Wang, to prepare to forcibly seize vassals Wushun Circuit (Ê≠¶È†Ü, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei, also known as Zhao and Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), he sent Yang back to Zhenguo Circuit. When Wushun's military governor Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao found out about the Later Liang plan ‚Äî i.e., when the Later Liang officers Du Tingyin () and Ding Yanhui () seized Wushun's Shen () and Ji () Prefectures (both in modern Hengshui, Hebei) by trick ‚Äî both he and Wang Chuzhi the military governor of Yiwu turned against Later Liang and allied themselves with Jin. A joint Jin/Zhao/Yiwu army, under Li Cunxu, thereafter defeated Wang Jingren in spring 911 at Boxiang (ÊüèÈÑâ, in modern Shijiazhuang) and crushed the Later Liang army; Li Cunxu then postured to attack south, heading toward Later Liang's Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). Emperor Taizu removed the title of commander of the northern armies from Wang and bestowed it on Yang, sending him to Heyang Circuit to collect the fleeing troops. After he did, he headed north toward Xing Prefecture (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), where the Later Liang general Wang Tan () was under Jin/Zhao siege, and Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture (), also under Jin/Zhao attack. When Yang's army reached those two prefectures, the Jin/Zhao army withdrew (as Li Cunxu was concerned Liu Shouguang the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) would attack him from the rear). Emperor Taizu subsequently stationed Yang with 30,000 men at Xing Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. He also made Yang the military governor of Xuanyi Circuit (ÂÆ£Áæ©, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). After Liu Shouguang declared himself emperor of a new state of Yan in late 911, Li Cunxu sent Zhou to attack Yan, along with the Zhao officer Wang Deming and the Yiwu officer Cheng Yan (). Liu Shouguang sought aid from Later Liang, and in spring 912, Emperor Taizu, wanting to avenge the defeat at Boxiang, headed north himself and ordered, as part of the operations, Yang and Li Zhouyi () to siege Zaoqiang (Ê£óÂº∑, in modern Hengshui). After Zaoqiang fell, Yang, under Emperor Taizu's orders, slaughtered the entire population. Emperor Taizu then sent Yang to Xiu County (Ëì®Á∏£, in modern Hengshui) to help He Delun () in sieging it. During the siege, however, the Jin general Li Cunshen launched a surprise attack on the main Later Liang army under Emperor Taizu with only 500 men but pretending to be a much larger army under Li Cunxu, causing Emperor Taizu to panic and withdraw back to Tianxiong Circuit.  During Zhu Yougui's reign  Later in the year, after Emperor Taizu returned to then-capital Luoyang, his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, believing that he was about to designate an older adoptive son, Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo, as his heir, assassinated him. Zhu Yougui then blamed the assassination on Zhu Youwen and executed him, and then claimed imperial title. At that time, Yang was still at Wei Prefecture. He had long had designs on taking the circuit over from its young military governor Luo Zhouhan, but did not dare to do so while Emperor Taizu was alive. Hearing that Emperor Taizu was dead, he acted, killing Luo's chief of staff Pan Yan (), and then taking over the circuit. Zhu Yougui, not daring to challenge him, made him the military governor of Tianxiong and Luo the military governor of Xuanyi. Once Yang took over Tianxiong, he began to disregard Zhu Yougui's orders. Zhu Yougui feared him, and therefore wanted to test him by summoning him to Luoyang. While Yang's own staff members believed this to be a trick, Yang himself was not apprehensive of Zhu Yougui, believing Zhu Yougui to be incapable of acting against him. He went to Luoyang to meet Zhu Yougui, who conversed with him humbly and awarded him much treasure, before sending him back to Tianxiong. Around the same time, Wang Deming attacked and captured Zongcheng (ÂÆóÂüé, in modern Xingtai); Yang laid an ambush for him at Tangdian (ÂîêÂ∫ó, in modern Xingtai), however, and defeated him. Soon after taking the throne, Zhu Yougui began to lose control over the army, and his younger brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun, who was then at Daliang, began to conspire with his brother-in-law Zhao Yan and his cousin Yuan Xiangxian against him. At Zhao's advice, Zhu Youzhen sent a secret emissary to Yang to solicit his support. Yang initially was inclined to refuse, believing that as someone who had already pledged loyalty to Zhu Yougui that he should not turn against Zhu Yougui, but his subordinates pointed out that Zhu Yougui had committed patricide and did not deserve loyalty; they also pointed out that Yang would be putting himself in a difficult position if Zhu Youzhen succeeded anyway. Yang therefore agreed, sending his officer Wang Shunxian () to Luoyang to discuss the details further with Zhao and Yuan. In spring 913, Yuan rose with the palace guards and surrounded the palace; Zhu Yougui committed suicide. Zhu Youzhen then claimed the throne at Daliang and moved the capital there. (He also changed his name to Zhu Zhen.)  During Zhu Zhen's reign  Zhu Zhen created Yang Shihou the Prince of Ye and gave him the honorary chancellor title Zhongshu Ling (); he further showed Yang respect by not referring to him by name, but only by his offices. It was said that from this point on, Yang became extremely arrogant, refusing to submit revenues to the Later Liang imperial government any more and building an elite Yinqiang Xiaojie Corps (), wanting to again build Tianxiong into an effective independent realm. Later in 914, with Liu Shouguang in dire straits under siege by the Jin/Zhao/Yiwu army, Yang headed north with Liu Shouguang's brother Liu Shouqi (), pillaging Zhao territory. This failed to save Liu Shouguang, however, as his capital You Prefecture () fell to Li Cunxu later in the year, ending Yan. After Li Cunxu annexed Yan lands, he then headed south with Wang Rong, Zhou Dewei, and his cousin Li Sizhao the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered at Lu Prefecture) to attack Xing Prefecture. When Yang advanced to try to save Xing Prefecture, however, the Jin/Zhao army withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. Yang died in spring 915, and was given posthumous honors. (After his death, Zhu Zhen would try to curb the Tianxiong army's power by trying to divide it into two circuits, with disastrous results ‚Äî with the Tianxiong army kidnapping He Delun (whom he made the military governor of Tianxiong) and forcing He Delun to submit to Jin, leading Later Liang's losing the remainder of its territory north of the Yellow River.)

Shelby occupied Northeast Arkansas, well behind Union Army lines. In early June 1864, General Shelby commissioned Colonel Thomas Hamilton McCray, among others, to begin raising regiments in Northeast Arkansas. By June 13, Shelby reported to General Sterling Price that McCray's efforts were bearing fruit. Colonel McCray's efforts led to the recruitment of at least three regiments, the 45th, 46th and 47th Arkansas Infantry Regiments. These 40-series regiments consisted mostly of conscripts, and absentees from existing units, organized around a small cadre of veterans detailed from infantry regiments, which were expected to be idle during the fall and winter of 1864.Howerton, Bryan R.: \\"Re: Wm.

However, when General Sterling Price received authorization to conduct a campaign in Missouri that fall, several of the new regiments were mounted in order to accompany him. As a result, the 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th, and 48th were officially mounted infantry regiments instead of cavalry regiments. They were rarely referred to in contemporary reports and orders by numerical designation.

Its war record is mixed. It was hampered due to lack of ammunition, food, blankets weapons, and uniforms. It also was hampered by leadership who were used to operating as Infantry, and several of the men were conscripts, and deserters. Colonel Baber was captured in the fight near Independence, Missouri, on October 22, 1864. Upon Colonel Baber's capture, Lieutenant Colonel John W. Clark assumed command of the regiment. Major George R. James was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and Captain C. J. Wasburn, who had previously commanded Company A, was advanced to the rank of Major. According to John Edward's \\"Shelby and his Men\\", and the book \\"Action Before Westport\\", the crossing of the Little Blue on the afternoon and evening of the 21st of October 1864 was met with fierce Federal resistance. Elements of Fagan's Division (which the 45th belonged to) were trying to protect the crossing and Price's very long train. Cabell's brigade was ordered to protect the train in order to allow Fagan's troops to concentrate on forcing the crossing. Somewhere during that time frame Colonel Baber was captured, however the records are not clear as to exactly when or how Colonel Baber was captured. Colonel Baber was sent first to Alton prison and then transferred to Camp Douglas. While a prisoner of war, Colonel Baber wrote letters on behalf of the enlisted prisoners requesting blankets. :Price's Missouri Raid, Arkansas-Missouri-Kansas, September‚ÄìOctober 1864 :Battle of Fort Davidson (September 27, 1864)United States.

Thompson's command was widely dispersed throughout northeast Arkansas, more for reasons of available forage than anything else. About a third of his men refused to surrender. Shelby's Missouri Brigade, along with elements of Green's and Jackman's Missouri Brigades, lit out for Mexico. Some Missouri units disbanded rather than surrender their colors. Many men simply went home.

While most the men on the Jacksonport parole lists actually served in the 45th Arkansas regiment during the war, some were attached to various companies in the regiment solely for the purpose of surrendering. A few probably never saw any service except marching with their relatives and neighbors to Jacksonport to receive the paroles, which were thought to provide the former confederates with some degree of protection from later arrest or capture.

This novel is a sequel to her debut novel A Golden Age and spans the year from 1984 to 1985, with occasional flashbacks to the aftermath of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. It is a story about faith and family shadowed by a war. The family that has taken active part in the war of independence has now to face the challenges of peace, within and outside. Plot summary The central characters of the novel are Maya and Sohail. While A Golden Age tells their story before and during the liberation war of Bangladesh, The Good Muslim tells their story a decade after the war. In 1984, Maya returns home after almost a decade of absence and finds her beloved brother Sohail completely transformed. She still has the same revolutionary zeal, but Sohail has resorted to religiosity in its puritanical form and has become a charismatic religious leader, reflective of Bangladesh under the regime of General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the President and dictator of Bangladesh who has promoted Islam over secularism. The ideological difference between Sohail and his sister creates a deep-seated schism in their minds. This difference is the central conflict in The Good Muslim. They have charted their own ways, opposite to each other's, of moving forward in the shadow of the tortuous history. Maya is a liberal-minded ‚Äòvillage doctor‚Äô who helps women victims of war. She performs abortions so that the women who had conceived as a result of rape do not have to carry the stigma. Thus she witnesses misery all the time, everywhere. Sohail's way of being a good Muslim is altogether different from his sister's. He has embraced an extreme version of Islam as defined by the Tablighi Jamaat, which shuns the joyful life filled with music, friends and liberal values. Sohail wants to send his son to a madrasa and, as a result, a conflict ensues between them and comes to a devastating climax.https://www.academia.edu/9156080/Review_of_The_Good_Muslim Critical reception Initial reviews for the Good Muslim are mostly positive. Valerie Miner of the Los Angeles Times said \\"The Good Muslim brims with gripping narrative, absorbing history and Shakespearean moral conundrums ... a timely drama about the unpredictable effects of religious zealotry and political violence as well as a keen examination of survival and forgiveness.\\" Praising the novel, The Guardian said \\"Powerful and ambitious, The Good Muslim more than fulfills the promises of Tahmima Anam's celebrated debut, A Golden Age\\". In a starred review Publishers Weekly said praising the narrative technique of Anam that in a \\"gripping and beautifully written\\" novel, \\"from historical, political, and social tragedy, Anam has fashioned a mesmerizing story capturing a culture and a time\\". According to Ophelia Field of The Daily Telegraph, this second part of Anam's \\"projected trilogy\\" which begins with A Golden Age \\"confirms Anam as one of our most important novelists.\\" A reviewer in a review that appeared in the e-journal Transnational Literature published from the Flinders University, Australia comments: ‚Ä≥Anam has successfully handled a grim theme with consummate skill. The novel is full of strong emotional undercurrents and intense passions. At times, it is too real and looks like a memoir rather than work of fiction. However, it will find a pride of place in any discussion on how individuals‚Äô reactions to war and violence may differ in an attempt to find solace and reconcile with the self. It also offers a case study of one who has turned into a fundamentalist, or allegedly so, which is significant especially at a time when the world has been witnessing a rise in fundamentalism of various hues in many countries doomed to be war zones.‚Ä≥http://dspace.flinders.edu.au/jspui/bitstream/2328/25909/3/Good_Muslim.pdf It was shortlisted for the 2013 DSC Prize for South Asian Literature.

Samuel Rose, 1836 engraving by John Henry Robinson, after Sir Thomas Lawrence and W. Harvey. Life He was born at Chiswick, Middlesex, on 20 June 1767, the second and only surviving son of Dr. William Rose (1719‚Äì1786). Samuel was educated for a time at his father's school, and from 1784 to January 1787 at Glasgow University, living in the house of Dr. William Richardson, and gaining several prizes. He also attended the courts of law at Edinburgh, and was on friendly terms there with Adam Smith and Henry Mackenzie. On 6 November 1786 he entered Lincoln's Inn, and, after reading with Serjeant Praed from 1787 to 1790, was called to the bar in 1796. He went the home circuit, attended the Sussex sessions, was ‚Äòencouragingly noticed‚Äô by Lord Kenyon, and appointed counsel to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Rose was delicate from early life, and suffered from tuberculosis. He was engaged by William Hayley to defend William Blake at the quarter sessions at Chichester, from the charge of high treason brought against him by two soldiers. On 11 January 1804, Rose in court suffered a seizure. The defence was successful, but he never recovered from the attack. He died of consumption at his residence in Chancery Lane, London, on 20 December 1804, and was buried in the church of St Andrew, Holborn; some lines were written on him by Hayley. Friend of Cowper In 1787, when travelling from Glasgow to London, Rose went a few miles out of his way to call on William Cowper, at Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire. The main object of the visit was to convey to the poet the thanks of some of the Scottish professors for the two volumes which he had published. He developed a strong relationship with Cowper, and many letters passed between them. Rose was with Cowper in August 1788, when he transcribed for the poet his version of the twelfth book of the Iliad, and paid him subsequent visits, the last being in March and April 1800. He found many subscribers to Cowper's Homer, and in October 1793 he took Sir Thomas Lawrence to Weston Underwood, to paint the poet's portrait. The royal pension of ¬£300 per annum to Cowper was made payable to Rose, as his trustee, and George Canning in 1820 called him \\"Cowper's best friend\\". Works The miscellaneous works of Oliver Goldsmith were collected by Rose and published in 1801, 1806, 1812, and 1820 in four volumes. The memoir prefixed was compiled under the direction of Thomas Percy, but additions were made to it by Rose and others; Percy subsequently made resentful accusations against Rose. Rose edited in 1792 an edition of the Reports of Cases by Sir John Comyns, and in 1800 Sir John Comyns's work Digest of the Laws of England, in six volumes, of which the first was dedicated to Lord Thurlow. He contributed to the Monthly Review, mainly on legal subjects, and is said to have assisted Lord Sheffield in editing Edward Gibbon's minor works. Family He married, at Bath, on 3 August 1790, Sarah, elder daughter of William Farr, M.D., a fellow student of Goldsmith. She survived him with four sons. Cowper Rose, R.E., the second child and the poet's godson, for whose benefit Hayley published in 1808 Cowper's translations of the ‚ÄòLatin and Italian Poems of Milton,‚Äô was the author of ‚ÄòFour Years in South Africa,‚Äô 1829,. The youngest son, George Edward Rose, born in 1799, was English professor at the Polish college of Krzemieniec, on the borders of the Ukraine, from 1821 until his retirement was compelled by the persecution of the Russian officials in 1824; he translated the letters of John Sobieski to his queen during the battle of Vienna by the Turks in 1683, and made researches for a history of Poland. He died at Odessa on 22 October 1825.

When flooded they form an important site for breeding waterbirds. Description The wetlands lie between the towns of Moree and Mungindi in the Moree Plains Shire near the state border with Queensland. They consist of the inland floodplain of the Gwydir River that splits into the Gingham and Big Leather water courses and creating, when fully flooded, a 1021 km2 wetland some 45 km west of Moree. The extensive wetland area is a good example of an inland terminal delta. The floodwater extends for about 95 km through a series of natural and constructed channels and swamps. Once a closed system, since the building of the 1364 GL Copeton Dam, water flows have been controlled by the State Government water authorities to the detriment of the wetlands. Despite the consequent reduction of the wetland area from about 1000 km2 to 100 km2, it is still one of the most significant waterbird breeding sites in Australia.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Gwydir Wetlands. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-01-02. The wetlands are contained in the pastoral properties of 'Lynworth' and 'Yarrol', and in parts of 'Boonoke' and 'Old Dromana', with the surrounding land being important as providing feeding habitat for waterbirds. Birds The wetlands have been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support more breeding waterbirds than any other Australian site when they adequately flooded. Of more than half a million nesting waterbirds the wetlands may hold over 1% of the world populations of Australian white (up to 160,000 birds) and straw-necked ibises (up to 230,000), nankeen night herons (up to about 100,000) and intermediate egrets (up to about 45,000). Other waterbirds that have bred in the area in relatively large numbers include royal and yellow-billed spoonbills, little and great egrets, and glossy ibises. Australasian bitterns, Australian painted snipes and painted honeyeaters have been recorded. Ramsar site Some 800 ha of the privately owned Gwydir wetlands were designated on 14 June 1999 as a Ramsar site as a wetland of international importance. The federal government bought the property, which was the largest privately owned wetlands in New South Wales, for A$10 million. The plan is to create a new national park as the wetlands provide habitat for 160 species of birds amongst four endangered ecological communities.

This occurs when the number of wins paired with losses of higher-ranking teams in the league or division needed in order to reach first place in the division or a wild card spot (where applicable) exceeds the remaining number of games to be played. The concept of being \\"eliminated from playoff contention\\" is applicable to sports leagues and programs where qualifying requires a first-place finish or at-large bid (i.e., a \\"wild card\\" spot). It does not apply to certain sports leagues, often (but not always) for some high school and college-level sports where all teams participate in the playoffs or conference tournament, regardless of record. It also does not strictly apply to those sports that do not have a postseason or whose postseason criteria are too subjective to determine until the selectors make their decisions (this is especially true in American college sports, where teams in the five most lucrative and reputed athletic conferences are regularly awarded invitational bids to postseason tournaments even if they would otherwise have been eliminated had they been in a mid-major conference). Definition When a sports season is reaching its conclusion, ranking watchers, such as the media, keep track of which teams have clinched divisions and playoff berths, and what teams close to this point must accomplish in order to achieve this ahead of the season's conclusion. Often, a team that has won a championship (such as a conference or divisional championship) is automatically granted a postseason berth, regardless of record, and there are still teams remaining in contention for one or more \\"wild card\\" or \\"at-large\\" playoff berths. At the same time, the poorer performing teams face the prospect of elimination before and sometimes long before the season is over. Elimination occurs when, regardless of the outcomes of all unplayed games on the league schedule, the eliminated team is unable to qualify for advancement to the playoffs. In exceptional cases, such as forfeits against a leading team, an \\"eliminated\\" team may be chosen to advance in their stead. The term \\"elimination\\" when used in the sense of the regular season differs from elimination when used in the postseason. In the postseason, a team is said to be \\"eliminated\\" or \\"knocked out\\" when it is defeated by another team it is playing in a round of the postseason, thereby ending the team's season. But a team eliminated during the regular season continues to play the remaining games on its schedule as a lame duck, and the value to the team's coaches and players in seriously contesting these games may vary (see below). In both cases, elimination prevents the team from further pursuing the league championship. Effect on rest of the season History In the early days of organized sports, clubs were essentially gate-driven enterprises that depended on ticket sales for most of their revenue. Elimination from contention to reach the postseason (or, if there was no postseason, to win the league championship) often served to seriously diminish interest in the team's remaining schedule from their fan base. Compounding this issue was that sports leagues in this era generally operated on the principle that a visiting team was entitled to a percentage of the gate receipts. If this cut was insufficient to meet the costs of making the trip, the visiting team would often be reluctant to travel, let alone play, especially if they were also out of championship contention. Often, especially in the early days of baseball, team owners deemed it more profitable to forfeit scheduled league games in order to play more lucrative exhibition contests. The establishment of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs in 1876 was the first serious effort to eliminate this practice, as the NL adhered to a strictly-enforced policy of expelling teams that refused to honor scheduling commitments. Further to this, in the early days of the NL, the league had (and often enforced) a policy of moving games to an opponent's stadium in the event that the paid attendance fell to the point where visiting teams would be left unable to meet their expenses to make the trip. The most notorious case of this came in 1899, when the Cleveland Spiders recorded the worst season in Major League Baseball history. At the time, games moved to opponents' stadiums were recorded as road games, and with paid attendances in Cleveland being anemic, the Spiders had 35 of their 77 home games moved. They finished with 101 road losses, a record that cannot be broken under modern MLB scheduling rules, and the Spiders folded after the 1899 season. Modern era While a team that has been officially eliminated must still play its remaining games, the team's behavior may differ from one that is striving for the postseason or has already clinched the playoffs. And among those \\"eliminated\\" teams, the teams' behavior will vary. Oftentimes a team would be eliminated from clinching a division title, home field advantage or other postseason advantages but the wildcard or lower-seeded spot might still be attainable thus some teams may play with an effort to win in order to choose its first-round opponents. When the team is eliminated entirely from postseason contention it does not need to worry about winning to qualify for the postseason, and the urgency to win may be lower. As a result, coaches may give playing time to backup and other lesser players who would not be used when a win is urgent, thereby giving them some real-game experience in an attempt to develop them. This is especially true at the high school and college levels, especially if a coach sees a number of players that are \\"promising\\". Former starters (such as seniors on a high school or college team) will often still be asked to play a role in helping develop their younger teammates, but their roles may be different than before. Additionally, a team may take greater risks during the remaining games in order for players to master new skills or try plays a coaching staff believes will help them win in the future. And if a team has many younger players the coaching staff will sometimes play different combinations of players to see which ones work best together, another building block for future seasons. Some teams eliminated from the playoffs before the trade deadline will hold a \\"fire sale\\", where they trade away many of its veteran players, especially expensive star players, to other teams for less expensive and usually younger players. Teams usually have a fire sale for financial reasons. The term \\"fire sale\\" is generally thought of as different from merely \\"rebuilding\\" a team, because during a rebuilding process, teams often obtain players who are already in the major leagues or who are close to being major-league-ready, while retaining at least some of their key veterans (such as a franchise player) while also getting players from their minor league system; most rebuilding teams have few veterans remaining to jettison in the first place. On the other hand, trades in a fire sale often bring a team draft picks and prospects who have little to no major-league experience in their sport, in exchange for proven, experienced veterans. The term \\"fire sale\\" also comes from the perception that the team is trying to get rid of all its players. Getting rid of veterans and stars with high salaries does reduce the payroll which saves the team money for the remainder of the season. Often, an eliminated team will now have the opportunity to play the role of spoiler ‚Äì that is, possibly eliminate one or more teams from contention that had a chance to make the playoffs (especially if they were \\"on the bubble,\\" or holding one of the lowest qualifying positions while still in contention and, as a result, their own qualification depends on the outcomes of other games and/or other teams' performances) or ‚Äì if the opponent is in the playoffs, cause them to get a lower seed in the elimination tournament and/or lose home field advantage they had already provisionally secured. Pride and opportunity also play into eliminated teams still striving to achieve victory on multiple occasions. These teams often want to go down swinging ‚Äì that is, play their best even if there isn't a realistic chance they can defeat, much less compete with, future opponents. Sometimes, teams will still have to play an opponent they have a good chance of defeating, even if the opponent has made the playoffs: The teams may match up well on the field and have comparable playing ability, despite a disparity in win-loss records; the other team has players who are unavailable (starters are resting, key players are injured or suspended, etc.); or the opponent is from a lower division and, even with the opponent's excellent win-loss record, the team with the losing record can rather easily outmatch the opponent and, although with some work, readily achieve victory. For cases such as a divisional or geographical rivalry, a losing team nearly always puts in effort against their rival as it would be considered bad form by the fans of either team, along with the players and outside observers to not play with a full effort against a team which is considered the rival most identified with by a team. Other reasons eliminated teams still try hard to win include achieving an improvement over the previous year's record, attempting to finish the season with a winning record (especially if winning the final game is needed to achieve that goal), or the team wants to avoid the stigma of a last place finish or worse, if they have yet to win, a winless season. For teams in sports that have been eliminated from a wild-card berth but qualifying is still possible by winning a conference tournament, the objective might be to win as many games as possible to try to earn as high of a seed as possible for the conference tournament, thereby increasing their chances of making the playoffs after all. Teams that operate as for-profit operations may still be compelled to put a competitive product on display, to ensure fans continue to attend the games and purchase tickets. This is less of an issue at the major professional levels, where a greater portion of revenue comes from television rights fees that are locked into contracts years in advance. In league systems that operate using promotion and relegation, even if a team may be eliminated from a postseason tournament, it may have to continue to play at a competitive level (for instance in the Premier League, one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table), and to avoid being relegated to a lower league (and thus lose a significant amount of revenue). In some cases, a team with a bad losing record may attempt to achieve the worst record in the league in order to attain a high draft pick. This is sometimes referred to as \\"tanking\\" the remainder of the season, and is sometimes done by putting players on the field that are too young and/or inexperienced to realistically be expected to win many games. In response to such practices, the National Hockey League and National Basketball Association both impose a draft lottery to discourage teams from deliberately tanking the rest of their season for a higher draft pick. The injection of random luck into the draft process can have the unintended consequence of depriving a team that is legitimately deprived of talent the opportunity to acquire a top prospect (this is especially true of the NHL, where because players are drafted at a younger age compared to the NFL or NBA and must typically complete junior and minor league development before reaching the majors, there is typically only one NHL-ready prospect in any given draft). Conversely, if the team is planning on making changes to its roster or coaching staff as a result of the poor performance, it may do so during this time in order to give new players and coaches some experience and try to keep players ‚Äì those who may be sought by other teams ‚Äì with their team.Basketball for Dummies ‚Äì Richard Phelps, John Walters, Tim Bourret ‚Äî Google Books Result. Retrieved May 1, 2012. An eliminated team's coach and/or general manager may be expected to be fired shortly before or once the season ends, even if they are under multiyear contracts. This is if they are blamed for the team being out of contention for the postseason, due to the general manager's poor draft picks and/or disappointing signings, coach's poor tactics, etc. Also the coach or/and general manager is seen as a poor fit or otherwise does not relate well with others ‚Äì players and other coaches, the media, his superiors and so forth ‚Äì and a change in leadership is apparently forthcoming or desired. Often, there will be rumors of a coach and/or manager departure ‚Äì often by dismissal or forced resignation (also known as \\"by mutual consent\\") ‚Äì with said rumors often beginning several games before the end of the season. Often the team will dismiss the coach and/or manager once the team is eliminated from reaching the postseason, rather than waiting for the conclusion of the season, as this cuts short the coach/managers' \\"lame duck\\" status and clears the way for new hires. In that case, an interim coach and/or interim manager will be appointed to see out the remainder of the season, though their predecessors may still remain on the club payroll as a \\"special advisor\\" until their contracts expires. Coaches and managers can be released with less financial consequences to their team, compared to players who are often under guaranteed contracts making them somewhat costly to buy out. Still, in some cases, a team with a losing record ‚Äì or one that has yet to win ‚Äì may not even try to win and/or play very poorly in the remainder of their games; in other words, they \\"quit\\", even against other teams that are eliminated and/or have performed exceptionally poorly during the season. Here, the philosophy might be that the current season is best forgotten once concluded, and that with changes (sometimes wholesale) during the off-season things will be better in the future. Often, these cases arise when: * Team or player morale is poor. * A coach or general manager is seen as a poor fit or otherwise does not relate well with others ‚Äì players and other coaches, the media, his superiors and so forth ‚Äì and a change in leadership is apparently forthcoming or desired. Often, there will be rumors of a coach and/or manager departure ‚Äì often by dismissal or forced resignation (also known as \\"by mutual consent\\") ‚Äì with said rumors often beginning several games before the end of the season. This will be true, even at the high school level. Dismissal of the coach or manager once the team is eliminated from reaching the postseason, rather than waiting for the conclusion of the season, also cuts short their \\"lame duck\\" status and clears the way for new hires. In that case, an interim coach and/or interim manager will be appointed to see out the remainder of the season, though their predecessors may still remain on the club payroll as a \\"special advisor\\" until their contracts expires. * With most or all preseason goals ‚Äì and new and adjusted goals made as the season progresses ‚Äì no longer achievable, the team no longer sees any value or worth in their remaining games, even if some of those games are considered by others to be \\"winnable.\\" * In sports where there is a high rate of injury, the risk of going onto the field for a meaningless game, and subsequently suffering a serious injury, outweighs the mostly nonexistent benefits. (See also: resting the starters) * The team is protesting against the league. In 2003, St. Bonaventure University's basketball team protested sanctions the NCAA levied against the team (the NCAA stripped the team of all their wins and barred them from the 2003 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament for having a transfer student with inadequate academic credentials on the squad) by outright forfeiting the last two games of the season. Spoiler effect Teams eliminated from playoffs can affect other teams in the league as they play, often having a spoiler effect on teams still in contention for playoff spots. For example, a baseball team that is ten games out of contention for a playoff berth could defeat a team that has a playoff berth several times. This could cause the would-be playoff team to be passed by in the rankings by the team directly behind it before the final positions at the end of the season are determined. In individual participant sports, such as automobile racing, a racer with no hope of obtaining a championship title could prevent a racer with a chance at the title by defeating them, preventing the contending racer from earning critical points toward winning the title. Instead, the title would go to the contender directly behind him in the rankings, provided that second-tier racer is close enough to surpass and they win their own competition.  Examples  For example, on the final day of the 2011 Major League Baseball regular season, the already long eliminated Baltimore Orioles defeated the Boston Red Sox, who had been seen all season as contenders for the playoffs. This Red Sox loss, combined with a Tampa Bay Rays win over the AL East winner and Red Sox rival New York Yankees, knocked the Red Sox out of the playoffs in favor of the Rays.Orioles rally for win, help keep Red Sox out of playoffs ‚Äì The Bangor Daily News Retrieved May 1, 2012. On the same day, the NL East champion Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Atlanta Braves, and the Braves loss, combined with the St. Louis Cardinals victory over the NL Central rival Houston Astros, eliminated the Braves from the postseason. In a testament to the Giants-Dodgers rivalry, the 1982 Los Angeles Dodgers knocked the 1982 San Francisco Giants out of playoff contention on the second to last day of the season. With the Dodgers needing one more win to tie the lead for the division, the Giants defeated the Dodgers on the final day to eliminate their rivals from contention, much to the delight of the fans at Candlestick Park. On the second-to-last day of the 2015-16 NHL regular season, the long- eliminated Ottawa Senators defeated the Boston Bruins, who were in playoff contention for the entire season; this result, combined with a win by the Philadelphia Flyers over their in-state rival, the Pittsburgh Penguins, knocked the Bruins out of the playoffs in favor of the Flyers. On the final matchday of the CONCACAF qualification tournament for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Trinidad and Tobago, who have long been eliminated from qualifying from the World Cup, defeated the United States, who were overwhelming favourites to qualify; the loss by the United States, combined with wins by Panama over Costa Rica and Honduras over Mexico, not only eliminated the United States from World Cup contention for the first time in 32 years, but also meant that Panama qualified for their first-ever World Cup. On the final day of the 2017 NFL season, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Baltimore Ravens. This Ravens loss, combined with a win by the Buffalo Bills over the Miami Dolphins, not only knocked the Ravens out of the playoffs, but also meant that the Buffalo Bills qualified for their first postseason appearance since 1999. That same day, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Seattle Seahawks. This Seahawks loss, combined with a win by the Atlanta Falcons over the Carolina Panthers, eliminated the Seahawks from the postseason. When the 2019‚Äì20 NBA season resumed on July 31, 2020, the 22 teams who had the best regular-season records qualified for an eight-game seeding tournament that determined the sixteen participants for the league's playoff tournament. A Phoenix Suns win over the Dallas Mavericks on the second-to-last-day of the season caused the San Antonio Spurs to be eliminated from the playoffs for the first time since the 1996‚Äì97 season.

Mainstream Publishing,  Early life  John Tarrant was born in Shepherd's Bush, London, in 1932. During the Second World War, with his father away on active service, his mother died of tuberculosis. John and his younger brother Victor (born 1934) were raised in a children's home in Kent until his father was demobilised at the end of the war. In 1947 his father remarried, and the family moved to Buxton in the Peak District in Derbyshire.  Sporting career  In 1950, at the age of 18, John took up boxing in Buxton, and earned a total of ¬£17 at prize-fights in his local Town Hall.Amazing Story of the Ghost Runner, Derby Telegraph, 11 December 2011, Retrieved 14 September 2015 He did not much enjoy boxing, but found during his training that he had a talent for long-distance running. Accordingly, he gave up boxing the following year and turned his sights to training for the marathon, hoping to compete at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. In 1952 John applied to join the Salford Harriers in order to register with the Amateur Athletic Association of England. On being asked whether he had ever played sport for money, he chose to answer honestly and declared his brief career in prize-fighting. Due to the strict amateur code enforced at the time, he was immediately banned from competition for life. Despite this setback, he continued to train, and (with the assistance of his brother Victor) began to gatecrash races to which he was officially refused entry, often out-performing recognised champions of the day. Nicknamed \\"The Ghost Runner\\" by the Press, his popularity eventually led to a relaxation of the ban against him: from 1958 he was permitted to compete nationally, but would remain ineligible to be selected for his country, and hence never competed at the Olympic Games. In the 1960s he turned to ultra-marathons, and set world records for 40-mile and 100-mile distances.Salford Herald, Issue #5 (December 2007) . Accessed on 3 January 2012 In 1967 he became the first man ever to win the season's grand slam in Britain's four principal ultra-marathons (the London-to-Brighton, Isle of Man, Exeter-to-Plymouth, and Liverpool-to-Blackpool).

Five Bedouin IDF soldiers from the Desert Patrol Battalion were killed in the attack and six others were injured, and the outpost was totally destroyed. Two Palestinian militants were also killed during the attack.  Preparations for the attack  Long before the attack occurred, Palestinian militants drilled an 800 meters long tunnel which began from a hidden location within Palestinian homes located near the security fence between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. From there the tunnel went under the border fence and reached a small Israeli military outpost located between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The militants planted 1.5 metric tons explosives directly below the outpost.  The attack  On Sunday, 12 December 2004, at c. 17:45 pm, the militants detonated two powerful explosions in two different locations, within a few minutes of each other. These explosions caused extensive damage and injured 11 soldiers. Immediately after the explosions, two Palestinian militants stormed the outpost and began opening fire at the Israeli soldiers stationed at the outpost. The attackers managed to kill two IDF soldiers before they were killed themselves. Rescue Forces were summoned to the site assisted by helicopters, whom attempted to rescue the wounded. At this point a third explosion occurred within the outpost, which was an apparent attempt to get casualties among the rescue forces although it didn't cause any casualties or injuries. Due to the continuous heavy barrage of mortar fire, the IDF rescue forces were only able to rescue the injured after a long while.

He finds out that there are oil wells near Attamadugu village. Sangliyana (Mohan Raj), a businessman, offers him a large bribe & tells him to capture those oil wells but Vijay refuses to yield and warns Sangliyana. Vijay reaches Attamadugu and starts work. Rajeswari Devi (Manjula), a greedy, cruel & crooked woman is the head of Attamadugu, whose word is a law for the villagers. In fact, the property that she is enjoying belongs to her brother Jaya Chandra (Murali Mohan), who is a drunkard. Rajeswari Devi keeps him locked in a room and treats his daughter Lakshmi (Madhurima) as a servant. Vijay always gives a tough fight to Rajeswari Devi and teases her daughter Nirmala Devi (Nagma). But somehow Vijay feels that Lakshmi is his own sister. Meanwhile, Rajeswari Devi joins hands with Sangliyana and they make a plan to kill Vijay. Lakshmi overhears their plan and informs Vijay before they attack him, thereby protecting Vijay. Rajeswari Devi decides to punish Lakshmi by arranging her marriage with another servant. Vijay stops this event and scolds Rajeswari Devi. Then, Rajeswari Devi says that no one will marry Lakshmi because her mother is a prostitute and shows her a photograph, which crushes Vijay, because that photograph belongs to none other than his mother Shanta. Vijay returns to his hometown and asks his mother why she is living like a widow when her husband is alive. Then she reveals the past. Jaya Chandra was the original arbitrator of the village and was treated as God by villagers. Rajeswari Devi was jealous of his popularity and eager to usurp his authority. So, she tricked Shanta and accused her of having an extramarital affair in front of the villagers. Hence, Jaya Chandra pronounced the judgment that she should be widowed by removing her wedding chain (Mangalsutra), bangles and sectarian mark (Bottu). Shanta tried to commit suicide, but Vijay saved her and both of them left the village. Now, Vijay decides to teach Rajeswari Devi a lesson. Meanwhile, Nirmala Devi also comes to know the truth and starts loving Vijay. With her help, Vijay plays the same game with Rajeswari Devi and makes her admit the injustice she had done to his mother in front of everyone. Jaya Chandra also feels remorseful and all of them go to bring Shanta back home. At the same time, Sangliyana kidnaps her. Finally, Vijay kills Sangliyana. In the attack, Jaya Chandra is injured and he gives the sectarian mark to Shanta with his blood. Rajeswari Devi also realizes her mistakes, apologizes to everyone and the film ends with the marriage of Vijay and Nirmala Devi.

It was founded by Pernille Buch-R√∏mer in the belief that schooling with like-minded children makes it possible for the highly gifted pupil to develop adequate social skills. Thus the main point of Mentiqa is to care for the well-being of its pupils, which is made possible through the acceptance of the highly gifted pupil's special behaviour and way of thinking. This means that concepts such as inclusiveness and differentiated teaching are defined through a fundamental idea that treating children equally is treating them differently.  Mentiqa schools  In Denmark, congregated schools for highly gifted pupils occur only as private initiatives. Therefore, Mentiqa schools are private schools established and run by parents of highly gifted pupils. The first Mentiqa-school was established in S√∏borg, a suburb of Copenhagen, in 2004.

While journeying to a nearby town after a fight with her mother, who won't allow her to spy like her father, Aly is kidnapped by pirates and sold as a slave to the Balitangs, a noble family of the Copper Isles. As a slave and maid, she soon discovers and gains access to a rebel conspiracy within the Balitang household, and takes charge as the rebellion's spymaster. At the end of the series she chooses to become the Royal Spymaster for the Isles. She marries Nawat Crow, and conceives triplets with him by the conclusion of the second book. Their names are Ochobai and Ulasu (girls) and Junim (boy). Aly is quick, observant, and a skilled knife-wielder. She inherited the magical Sight from her father and its power from her mother. It enables her to see if a person is lying or an immortal, different types of magic, seeing far off things as if they are right in front of her, and a variety of other things. Aly is flirtatious and vivacious by nature, but also knows how to curb her witty tongue when needed. She grows from the immature girl she is at the beginning of the series as she finds her place in life and her true calling. Despite the seriousness of her task at the Copper Isles, Aly is usually cheerful and her lighthearted attitude endears her to the other Raka‚Äîeven though they are sometimes exasperated by her. Her training under her father taught her a variety of useful skills, including lock-picking, hand-to-hand combat (though she loves knives the best), moving silently, observation, and code writing/breaking. She becomes the teacher to her \\"Pack,\\" a group of elite spies that she utilizes for special missions. They call her \\"Duani,\\" or boss lady (a sign of respect, despite all being older than her), and she treats them with affection, crying bitterly when some don't survive the overthrowing of the Luarin.

He is originally a friend of the Balitangs, but at the end of Trickster's Choice he murders Duke Mequen and is killed by Sarai. Very ambitious and impulsive, he is well liked but not trusted. Despite being raised in the dangerous Jimajen family, he has not learned to curb his tongue. He is also a womanizer and deeply in debt. Even while he courts Sarai, he sleeps with a different maid every night. Aly mentions that he's the kind of man who would \\"have her in his lap\\" if she looked at him the right way, so she keeps her distance. He once courted Duchess Winnamine, but claims that it would have been a \\"marriage of convenience,\\" to Sarai. Dunevon Rittevon King Oron's youngest child, who becomes King after Hazarin. He is only five years old, but is killed in a magically created storm caused by the mages commanded by the boy-king's regents, Princess Imajane and Prince Runbinyan. Dunevon is characterized as a boy who is being forced to grow up too fast. Neglected by the regent, he is forced to stamp everything they propose and then placated with sweets and other rich treats that are harmful to children. Due to this pampered yet unloving treatment, Dunevon can act extremely spoiled, though Tabur Sibigad, does his best to treat him like a regular boy. Oron Rittevon King of the Copper Isles at the beginning of the series, mentally unstable. It is because of his delusions that the Balitangs are exiled. He and his family are said to have a record of producing a mad child every couple generations, as shown with Princess Josiane in the Song of the Lioness series. He dies in Trickster's Choice, and names his first-born son, Hazarin, as heir. His children all hate each other due to the fact that he, afraid that if they were united they would overthrow him, made their childhoods a constant competition between them.

More stable than his wife, Rubinyan's weakness is his greed for more land, which leads him to allow his wife to imprison powerful nobles such as Duke Nomru, who then becomes a part of the Luarin conspiracy. Despite this weakness, Rubinyan is intelligent, practical, and brave. When the rebels attack, he leads his men into battle rather than fleeing or staying behind. Due to Aly's efforts, he and his wife start to have marital problems, though his cool-headed way with Imajane makes breaking them up a difficult task for Aly. Hazarin Rittevon King Oron's oldest remaining son, who becomes King after his father's death, before dying of an apoplexy. His ghost reveals to Aly that he hates the Rittevon power games, and he is glad to be free of them. Hazarin thinks that Bronau is the smartest man in the world, and is given to strange drugs and rich foods. Imajane Rittevon Jimajen King Oron's only remaining daughter, wife of prince Rubinyan, and regent to King Dunevon, Imajane is described as very beautiful, but in a cold, icy way. She is very cold and power-hungry, and slightly mentally unstable. Coldly calculating, she is intelligent but given to passionate jealousies, and Aly uses this to drive a wedge between Imajane and her husband. When she suspects a woman having an affair with her husband, she sends the lady home \\"covered in bruises.\\" When the rebellion succeeds, she jumps to her death from her balcony rather than be captured and executed or exiled.  Raka Rebellion  Ulasim Dodeka Free raka servant, head footman to the Balitang family and general of the raka conspiracy, Ulasim is Junai's father and Ochobu's son. He dies killing Prince Rubinyan in the rebellion. A good friend to Aly, he suspects her secret throughout Trickster's Choice, but grows to respect and like her, though he berates her for not acting professionally when Nawat goes off to fight in the war. He sort of acts as her surrogate father in the absence of George Cooper. Tall, broad, and muscular, he is well into being middle-aged, (his daughter is in her late twenties), and yet as strong as ever. He is both respectful to his mother and fully aware of her irritable nature and qualities. Ulasim is trusted by the Balitang family, and sometimes treats them like equals despite being their footman. Chenaol The Balitang's full-raka cook, a leader in the revolution. She provides the revolution with weapons, and is extremely skilled with weapons herself, able to \\"tell good steel from bad at a glance and send any knife to the heart of any target.\\" Warm and friendly, she is Aly's first friend among of Balitang servants and keeps any of the Raka from bothering her because of her white skin. At the end of the duology, she refuses to take a higher position, saying that her place is in the kitchen, and \\"if anyone wants to talk weapons, they can finds [her] there.\\" Despite this, she is seen ordering weapons and arguing with Fesgao about the number of knives she can give him. She is one of the only core Raka rebellion members to survive and hear Aly's confession about her past. When she learns that Aly is the daughter of Tortall's unofficial spymaster and the Lioness, her reaction is extremely anti-climatic. She claims that Aly has already proven her loyalties before storming off to berate the delivery boys for getting her flower with rocks stitched at the bottom, and threatening to \\"take blood.\\" Fesgao Yubinu A raka, head of the Balitangs' men-at-arms and the military leader of the rebellion. Quiet and commanding, he becomes a good friend to Aly. A skilled soldier and fighter, he can also be quite good at espionage. Once, in order to show Aly a secret way into the Royal Palace, he pretends to be her lover so that they won't draw suspicion. He too is one of the only core Raka rebellion members to survive and becomes a very important man as a result. Like Chenaol, he reacts well to Aly's confession of her past. Ochobu Dodeka Ulasim's mother and head of the rebel raka mage network known as the Chain. She and her fellow mages agree to aid the raka conspirators in The Trickster's Choice. Extremely powerful, she originally hates all Luarin but grows to accept, (though never love), some, such as the Balitangs and Aly. Ochobu is a fierce woman with a cutting tongue. An extremely powerful mage, she rides into battle despite her age and throws her entire life into her spells. As a result, her heart bursts and she dies. She is generally considered to be \\"The Wise One\\" in the Prophecy. Aly eventually gets her to think about what she plans to do with the Luarin after the rebellion, and Ochobu admits that she knows that it's impossible to drive them all away, (due to most of the population being mixed- bloods). Ysul Second-in-command of the rebellion's raka mage network known as the Chain, assumes command after Ochobu's death. He is mute, but communicates with hand-signals and has just as much power as Ochobu. Junai Dodeka A raka woman who acts as Aly's bodyguard. She is Ulasim's daughter, and dies in the fighting when the rebellion takes place. Though she treats Aly with a professional, closed-off attitude at first, she eventually warms up to Aly enough to express some emotion. Junai worked as a caravan-girl (guard), for a long time and is a very skilled fighter. She is also able to pass herself off as a man when the situation arises. Proud and defiant, she almost gets herself killed by meeting the eyes of a Luarin guard. When both Dove and Aly yell at her afterwards for being stupid and risking her life, she gives one of her rare smiles before wryly promising to try to be more careful. She is a member of Aly's Pack. Lokeij Raka slave, chief hostler for the Balitangs, killed in the fighting at Tanair. He is sharp, suspecting Aly's secrets, though he never acts upon them. He is able to ride like a young man, bareback, despite his age.  Balitang Family  Mequen Balitang Duke, fourth in line to the throne, father of Sarai, Dove, Petranne, and Elsren, married to duchess Winnamine. His first wife, Duchess Sarugani, was a member of the raka nobility and descended from the original raka royal family. Mequen is fair, and very noble. He never mistreats his servants, and doesn't allow anyone else to do so. His sense of nobility and fair play gets him killed, for he refuses to mistrust Bronau when the prince comes to him after being exiled. He treats Aly and the other slaves well, and is a genuinely good man. His people love him, and his death is partly why Aly decides to stay in the Copper Isles. Winnamine Fonfala Balitang Luarin duchess married to Duke Mequen. Has two children by Mequen: Petranne and Elsren. Was the best friend of Mequen's first wife, Duchess Sarugani, and was briefly courted by Prince Bronau Jimajen before her marriage to the duke. Winnamine is gentle and gracious, but can also be very resilient and strong. She learns to use the bow and gains her stepdaughters' trust and respect. Dovasary Balitang (Dove) Dove is the younger of Duke Mequen Balitang‚Äôs two half-raka daughters by his first marriage. She is quiet, observant, and very intelligent. Dove is also extremely mature, mingling with people of all classes and instinctively knowing how to behave before the royal family and court. Much more patient than her sister, Sarai, she understands the wisdom of waiting to speak and has a variety of intellectual interests and talents, including astronomy and chess. Dove is also skilled with the bow. Saraiyu Balitang (Sarai) Sarai is the beautiful but impetuous eldest daughter of Duke Mequen Balitang. She is stubborn about certain things, and not as calm as her sister Dove. Sarai is much more openly passionate than Dove, and less patient. She speaks her mind even when it endangers herself and her family, but understands her duty to her family. Though she has talent with swordplay, she refuses to continue with it after killing Bronau in Trickster's Choice. She disgraces her family by eloping to Carthak with Zaimid Hetnim rather than marry King Dunevon. Sarugani Temaida Balitang First wife of Duke Mequen, and mother to Sarai and Dove. Before her death from a riding accident, was a member of one of the few remaining full-raka noble families and the last of the raka royal line. She is described as having \\"too much heart and not enough head,\\" as well as a brilliant rider and best friends with Winnamine Fonfala, despite her status as a Raka and Winnamine's status as a luarin. Nuritin Balitang Duke Mequen's bossy and overbearing luarin aunt; head of the Balitang family and the luarin conspiracy. She is extremely sharp and aware of the dangers and instability of the Rittevan court, skillfully navigating the Balitang family so that it is never humiliated and always one step ahead. Petranne Balitang Duke Mequen's third, and only full-blood, luarin daughter. She is Elsren's sister and loves to hear Aly tell stories about Tortall. Elsren Balitang Duke Mequen's youngest luarin child and heir to Dunevon's throne as a result of Mequen's death. He is killed in the same storm as Dunevon. In Trickster's Choice, Aly is responsible for looking after him and Petranne, and though he is disobedient at first, he grows to love her and enjoy her stories.  Others  Ferdolin Tomang A high-ranking luarin noble, and one of Sarai's many admirers. He is shown to be impulsive and rude boy who treats the Raka like an inferior race, though one of Sarai's friends point out his \\"lovely muscles.\\" He loses an eye during the Raka rebellion and seemingly grows more mature. Kyprioth the Trickster Chief of the trickster gods, former patron of the Copper Isles, sea god for the oceans around the Copper Isles. Overthrown by his brother Mithros and sister the Great Mother Goddess 300 years prior to the beginning of the series, he enlists Aly to help him get it back. The Raka rebellion is the physical manifestation of his battle with his siblings, as the gods get power from their servants' victories. Though he seems humorous and light-hearted, Kyprioth can be very intense and is a menace when enraged. His presence is enough to send anyone with Raka blood to their knees. Nawat Crow A crow who turned himself into a man. He has a romantic relationship with Aly through most of the series, but does not truly find his place in the world of men until near the end of Trickster's Queen. Nawat is shown to be extremely innocent, not knowing the proper decorum for human beings. He is extremely attractive and popular with women, as well as gifted with physical abilities that are beyond any humans. For example, he can keep up with a horse by running and leap ten feet up into a tree, as well as catch arrows, spears, and knives. He works as a fletcher and a warrior, as well as Aly's main link to the crows. At the end of the series he and Aly are married and are expecting a baby. Taybur Sibigat Head of the King's Guard. He aids the raka conspiracy after the death of King Dunevon, whom he loved with all his heart. Taybur is handsome, extremely quick, and much like a male counterpart of Aly. He suspects she is a spy but does not know of the Raka rebellion, and because of his rivalry with Topabaw does not turn her in. They develop a lightly flirtatious friendship based on their ability to relate on an intellectual level. Both are seen to enjoy their banter extremely. At one point before the King's death he discovers the Darking she left in the Dunevon's room and informs her that he does not care if she spies on him but desires a place where Dunevon can cry and rage unobserved. This shows that he views his devotion to the King much more than his Duke Lohearn Mantawu A.k.a. Topabaw, a Crown spymaster who is executed by the regents as a result of Aly's spy work. He is shown to be cruel, sloppy, and ruthless. He has been spymaster so long that most people don't remember a time before him.

The restriction enzyme belong to a larger class of enzymes called exonucleases and endonucleases. Exonucleases remove nucleotide from ends whereas endonuclease cuts at specific position within the DNA. The concept is used in molecular biology, especially in cloning or when subcloning inserts DNA into vector DNA. Such ends may be generated by restriction enzymes that cut the DNA ‚Äì a staggered cut generates two sticky ends, while a straight cut generates blunt ends.  Single-stranded DNA molecules  A single-stranded non-circular DNA molecule has two non- identical ends, the 3' end and the 5' end (usually pronounced \\"three prime end\\" and \\"five prime end\\"). The numbers refer to the numbering of carbon atoms in the deoxyribose, which is a sugar forming an important part of the backbone of the DNA molecule. In the backbone of DNA the 5' carbon of one deoxyribose is linked to the 3' carbon of another by a phosphodiester bond linkage. The 5' carbon of this deoxyribose is again linked to the 3' carbon of the next, and so forth.  Variations in double-stranded molecules  When a molecule of DNA is double stranded, as DNA usually is, the two strands run in opposite directions. Therefore, one end of the molecule will have the 3' end of strand 1 and the 5' end of strand 2, and vice versa in the other end. However, the fact that the molecule is two stranded allows numerous different variations. Blunt ends The simplest DNA end of a double stranded molecule is called a blunt end. Blunt end otherwise called as non cohesive restriction enzyme. In a blunt-ended molecule both strands terminate in a base pair. Blunt ends are not always desired in biotechnology since when using a DNA ligase to join two molecules into one, the yield is significantly lower with blunt ends. When performing subcloning, it also has the disadvantage of potentially inserting the insert DNA in the opposite orientation desired. On the other hand, blunt ends are always compatible with each other. Here is an example of a small piece of blunt-ended DNA: 5'-CTGATCTGACTGATGCGTATGCTAGT-3' 3'-GACTAGACTGACTACGCATACGATCA-5' Overhangs and sticky ends Non-blunt ends are created by various overhangs. An overhang is a stretch of unpaired nucleotides in the end of a DNA molecule. These unpaired nucleotides can be in either strand, creating either 3' or 5' overhangs. These overhangs are in most cases palindromic. The simplest case of an overhang is a single nucleotide. This is most often adenosine and is created as a 3' overhang by some DNA polymerases. Most commonly this is used in cloning PCR products created by such an enzyme. The product is joined with a linear DNA molecule with a 3' thymine overhang. Since adenine and thymine form a base pair, this facilitates the joining of the two molecules by a ligase, yielding a circular molecule. Here is an example of an A-overhang: 5'-ATCTGACTA-3' 3'-TAGACTGA-5' Longer overhangs are called cohesive ends or sticky ends. They are most often created by restriction endonucleases when they cut DNA. Very often they cut the two DNA strands four base pairs from each other, creating a four-base 5' overhang in one molecule and a complementary 5' overhang in the other. These ends are called cohesive since they are easily joined back together by a ligase. For example, these two \\"sticky\\" ends are compatible: 5'-ATCTGACT \\\\+ GATGCGTATGCT-3' 3'-TAGACTGACTACG CATACGA-5' They can form complementary base pairs in the overhang region: GATGCGTATGCT-3' 5'-ATCTGACT CATACGA-5' 3'-TAGACTGACTACG Also, since different restriction endonucleases usually create different overhangs, it is possible to create a plasmid by excising a piece of DNA (using a different enzyme for each end) and then joining it to another DNA molecule with ends trimmed by the same enzymes. Since the overhangs have to be complementary in order for the ligase to work, the two molecules can only join in one orientation. This is often highly desirable in molecular biology. Frayed ends Across from each single strand of DNA, we typically see adenine pair with thymine, and cytosine pair with guanine to form a parallel complementary strand as described below. Two nucleotide sequences which correspond to each other in this manner are referred to as complementary: 5'-ATCTGACT-3' 3'-TAGACTGA-5' right A frayed end refers to a region of a double stranded (or other multi-stranded) DNA molecule near the end with a significant proportion of non-complementary sequences; that is, a sequence where nucleotides on the adjacent strands do not match up correctly: 5'-ATCTGACTAGGCA-3' 3'-TAGACTGACTACG-5' The term \\"frayed\\" is used because the incorrectly matched nucleotides tend to avoid bonding, thus appearing similar to the strands in a fraying piece of rope. Although non-complementary sequences are also possible in the middle of double stranded DNA, mismatched regions away from the ends are not referred to as \\"frayed\\". Discovery Ronald W. Davis first discovered sticky ends as the product of the action of EcoRI, the restriction endonuclease.The Gruber Foundation Homepage  The Gruber Foundation Strength Sticky end links are different in their stability. Free energy of formation can be measured to estimate stability. Free energy approximations can be made for different sequences from data related to oligonucleotide UV thermal denaturation curves. Also predictions from molecular dynamics simulations show that some sticky end links are much stronger in stretch than the others. References * Sambrook, Joseph; David Russell (2001).

Iran describes it as a competitor with the S-300 missile system. It is manufactured by the Iranian Defence Ministry in cooperation with unspecified local manufacturers and universities. https://en.mehrnews.com/amp/141451/ The system was formally unveiled during a ceremony attended by the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on 22 August 2019,https://en.mehrnews.com/news/149156/VIDEO-Iran-unveils- Bavar-373-air-defense-systemhttps://www.foxnews.com/world/iran- bavar-373-missile- systemhttp://president.ir/en/110888https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/08/22/604153/Iran- missile-system-Bavar373-President-Rouhani-Defense-Minister-Hatami and was declared operational the same day.https://en.mehrnews.com/news/149156/VIDEO- Iran-unveils-Bavar-373-air-defense-system History After the Russian ban on exporting S-300 to Iran (which was lifted in 2015), Iran decided to develop a similar system domestically: \\"We have planned to build a long-range air defence missile system similar to S-300. By God's grace and by the Iranian engineers' efforts, we will reach self-sufficiency in this regard.\\" It was later revealed that the name of the system will be Bavar 373. Bavar meaning \\"believe\\" and 373 which is the Abjad number of prophet Muhammad's name. Farzad Esmaieli, commander of Khatam-ol-Anbia Base told Iranian media that the development of this system started by the direct order of supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei when the first information about cancellation of S-300 contract was revealed and Iranian personnel were still being trained in Russia on it. He said the project was in the stage of prototype designing and that it was not going to suffer from the weak points of the S-300. He continued that in the area of detection and radars, a very good point was reached and defense ministry was working on two or three missiles each for a different range and altitude. He said that the design was complete, all the parts were going to be manufactured inside the country and it had a good ability to detect and intercept enemy aircraft. According to Iranian military sources, the system is much more capable than S-300P class.http://www.janes.com/article/42790/iran- reveals-its-bavar-373-sam The first prototype was built on 22 November 2011. Iran announced that the system was designed and built by defense ministry, domestic industries and some Iranian universities. Esmaieli said that Iran doesn't even think about S-300 anymore as Bavar-373 was much more capable. Iranian sources suggest that the Bavar 373 will be mobile, with four missiles loaded on each mobile truck launcher. The Iranian defense ministry is due to equip the country's Armed Forces with a new long-range air-defence system by 21 March 2013, a senior Iranian military official announced on Saturday August 25, 2012. On 3 September 2012, Farzad Esmaili said that the development of the system was now 30 percent complete.\\"Iran completes 30 percent of missile defense system, says military official.\\" Reuters, 3 September 2012. On 1 January 2013, the same commander announced that the sub-systems of the homemade air-defense system are being tested in laboratory. Esmaili updated his estimate in February 2014 and said the system would be ready by the end of 2015. On 21 August 2016 Iran revealed components of Bavar-373. According to Janes international: \\"Bavar-373 displayed on 21 August is clearly a unique Iranian system that appears to reflect extensive investment in its ability to develop phased array radars\\". The system shows vertical, rectangular launch canister with details suggesting a hot launch system, unlike cold launch used in system such as S-300. On 16 August 2019, the Iranian MOD said the Bavar 373 was ready to be delivered to the Iranian armed forces. On August 22, 2019, Iran unveiled the Bavar-373 during a ceremony in the presence of President Hassan Rouhani, Defense Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami and other senior military officials. Iranian state-run media stated that the \\"missile defense system is 'much better' than the US Patriot system and its Russian counterpart S-300.\\" and that \\"the system is a competitor to Russia‚Äôs S-300 missile system\\", a Russian missile defense system developed over four decades ago that is scheduled to be phased out in favor of the superior S-400 and S-500. According to the Iranian defence chief, the Bavar-373 \\"can detect targets or planes at more than 300 km, lock it at about 250 km, and destroy it at 200 km\\". Design Bavar-373 parades in front of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during Islamic Republic of Iran Army Day In April 2015, Iran unveiled some of Bavar's subsystems, which include the Fakour commanding and smart control system which has the ability to collect information from all sources relevant to air defence, including passive and active military radars (such as the Mersad), signal surveillance, missile systems and commanding and control systems. The Rasoul advanced communications system is for encoding information, connecting the country's infrastructure and transferring radar information from the battle scene to commanding centres. Bavar-373 will utilize Sayyad-4 missile, which are contained in two rectangular launch canisters. No formal information was given about this missile but it appears from news photos that Sayyad-4 is similar to Sayyad-3 in wings and control surfaces, however it varies lightly in frontal shape.http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/363390 The canisters containing the Sayyad-4 missiles are to be carried on the Zoljanah 10√ó10 truck. Bavar-373 uses a phased array radar for tracking aerodynamic targets and ballistic missiles in medium to long ranges, mounted on the ZAFAR heavy truck. One of the radars used in Bavar-373 is Meraj-4 (Ascension), a phased array radar with range of 450 km which uses fuzzy logic techniques to spot targets. Meraj can track up to 200 targets simultaneously. Specifications acquisition radar on an 8x8 truck Bavar 373 system is capable of detecting up to 100 targets, tracking 60 of them and engage with six concurrently.https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2019/08/26/2083852/army- commander-lauds-iranian-air-defense-systems Bavar has an S-Band acquisition radar for detection, and a (shorter-range) X-Band fire control radar for missile guidance. Both are supposedly Active Electronically Scanned Array radars.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beware-u-air-force-iran-083000826.html Bavar is said to be able to detect targets or planes at more than 300 km, lock it at about 250 km, and destroy it at 200 km.https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/08/22/604153/Iran-missile-system- Bavar373-President-Rouhani-Defense-Minister-Hatami Bavar 373 is said to resist electronic warfare and electromagnetic bombs.

He is considered as one of the \\"three Fathers\\" (the main instigators/ commanders) of the Cry of Nueva Ecija, along with Pantaleon Valmonte and Manuel Tinio. Early life Llanera studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He then became a Cabeza de barangay and later, a Gobernadorcillo for two terms in the town of Cabiao. He married his first wife, Salome Siapoco, in 1877. Philippine Revolution As soon as the news about the Revolution reached Nueva Ecija and Bulacan, men were mobilized on September 1, 1896. Among the leaders were Mariano and his son Eduardo Llanera, Mamerto Natividad, Alipio Tecson and Manuel Tinio. Llanera used his own flag: a dull-looking black flag, with the single white letter K and the skull and crossbones symbol. It was said that Andr√©s Bonifacio himself ridiculed the flag and called it Llanera's Skull. Llanera's Battle Flag \\"Bungo ni Llanera\\": The flag used by Mariano Llanera in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija (in Casa Real Museum, Malolos City). Llanera was far right at the back of Pedro A. Paterno (front left) and Emilio Aguinaldo (front right) Llanera gathered with him around 3,000 men, including Tinio and his men, mostly armed with bolos, and bamboo spears. Only few had guns. Of the 3,000 who volunteered, 500 determined men were chosen for the attack. Led by a brass band of Cabiao named Banda Makabayan De Cabiao, the force came in two separate columns from Cabiao and Gapan City and converged in Sitio Pulu, which was 5 kilometers from San Isidro. Despite having only 100 rifles, the rebels furiously held siege the Spaniards in the Casa Tribunal, the arsenal, and other government buildings. Capt. Joaquin Machorro, commander of the Guardias Civiles, was killed on the first day of battle. The Spanish authorities hastily organized a company of 200 armed civilian Spaniards and mercenaries the following day and attacked the overconfident insurgents, driving the latter away from the government center. The next day, more Spanish reinforcements arrived. It forced the poorly armed rebels to retreat, leaving behind 60 dead. The Spaniards went in hot pursuit of the insurgents, forcing those from Cabiao to flee to Pampanga, and those from Gapan to hide in San Miguel de Mayumo in Bulacan - San Miguel, Bulacan. The insurgents from San Isidro fled across the river to hide in Jaen, Nueva Ecija. The relatives of those who were recognized were driven away from their homes by the colonial authorities. The Spaniards‚Äô relentless pursuit of the rebels forced them to disband and go into hiding until January 1897. After Bonifacio's death in May 1897, he was designated lieutenant general. He was with Emilio Aguinaldo when the latter, along with 35 more revolutionaries, was exiled to Hong Kong on December 23, 1897 in accordance to the Pact of Biak-na-Bato. Llanera was the first person from the left at the third row Philippine-American War When the Philippine-American War broke out, he was in the Philippines and was assigned by Gen. Antonio Luna as lieutenant general in Manila. On February 23, 1899, Llanera and his troops was with Luna's forces when the latter staged a counterattack in Caloocan to prevent the Americans from invading further north. The counterattack, however, was only partly successful because the Kawit battalion refused to move. Llanera was later caught by the Americans during the same year. He was deported to Guam on January 16, 1901 with Artemio Ricarte and 30 more military officers of the Revolution. He returned to the Philippines in February 1903 in response to the demand of the people of the United States. Death and legacy In 1919, he married his second wife, Feliza Balajandia. He died in his hometown (Cabiao) on September 19, 1942. The General Llanera Memorial Lodge No. 168, established in 1963 at Gapan City, was named in honor of him. The General Mariano Llanera Day, a commemoration of Llanera's attack against the Spaniards on September 2, 1896, was celebrated in Nueva Ecija - Cry of Nueva Ecija.

It was commissioned by the Philharmonia Orchestra, which gave the premiere of the symphony at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 2 February 1978, with Simon Rattle conducting. Character and materials In his First Symphony, Davies addresses both the Beethoven model of the symphony and Sibelius's reinterpretation of it . Davies began work on what would become his First Symphony in 1973: a commission by the Philharmonia Orchestra intended to be performed the next year, resulting in a single-movement work of moderate length, provisionally titled Black Pentecost. However, the composer withdrew this score before it could be performed, feeling that it was not complete and needed to extend beyond the already-finished movement. In order to increase his understanding of large-scale orchestral composition, Davies analysed a number of other composers' works, and cites Sibelius's Fifth Symphony, the opening of Schumann's Second Symphony, and the first movement, \\"Don\\", from Pierre Boulez's Pli selon pli as precedents for specific moments of the composition. As the work evolved, Davies came to the conviction that it \\"could mark the possibility of a beginning of an orchestral competence\\", and so decided to designate it a Symphony. The pitches, note values, and longer time-spans are shaped and transformed by magic squares. Several plainsongs occur, and are transformed from one into another. The overall tonal centre is F, with a \\"modal dominant\\" of D . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for piccolo (doubling alto flute), two flutes (second doubling second piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, timpani, four percussionists (playing marimba, tubular bells, flexatone, glockenspiel, and crotales), harp, celesta, and strings. Analysis The symphony is in four movements: # Presto ‚Äì Allegro molto ‚Äì Allegro sempre # Lento ‚Äì Andante con moto ‚Äì Allegro moderato ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Allegro vivo ‚Äì Presto ‚Äì Poco meno presto # Adagio ‚Äì Pi√π lento # Presto After brass and pizzicato strings introduce the basic harmonies of the movement, the symphony proceeds as an allegro movement with \\"a ghost of a sonata form somewhere behind it\\", though there are no distinct first and second themes, and development is replaced by processes of transformation . The second movement is a lento that turns into a scherzo, beginning with a statement of the plainsong Ave maris stella in the alto flute. It has D as its tonic, and a modal dominant of F . The third movement is the slow movement proper, and has as its tonic the previous movement‚Äôs modal dominant, F, and the corresponding modal dominant A/B and becomes an invocation of the \\"extraordinary, almost unearthly, treeless winter land and seascape of the Orkney island\\" where the composer lives . The finale parallels the tonal shape of the first. It reaches a climax with an emergence of the \\"Ave maris stella\\" material in the form found in Davies's composition of the same title . The silences broken by jabbed chords at the end of the movement refers to the endings of the Fifth Symphonies of both Beethoven and Sibelius. The relationship to Beethoven is expressed exclusively in terms of rhythm . Discography * Peter Maxwell Davies: Symphony. Philharmonia Orchestra, Simon Rattle (cond.).

Thomas Pilkington, 1812 engraving by Robert Dunkarton. Early life He was son of Thomas Pilkington of Northampton, by his second wife, Anne Mercer, and grandson of John Pilkington of Oakham in Rutland. He came to London at an early age, and became a successful merchant. He was a member of the Skinners' Company, and served the office of master there in 1677, 1681, and 1682. Representative of the City of London Pilkington was an early Whig politician of the Exclusion Crisis, and was returned as one of the four City of London members to the short Parliament which met on 6 March 1679. In the course of the debate Pilkington expressed a wish that James, Duke of York might return from abroad, so that he might be impeached for high treason. He was again returned to the parliament of 1680. On 14 December in the same year he was elected alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without. In June 1681 the citizens obtained a victory over the court interest, on the election of Pilkington and Samuel Shute as sheriffs, after a hotly contested poll, by a large majority over the court candidates, Ralph Box and Humphrey Nicholson. The election gave offence to the king; but Pilkington entertained at his house the Duke of Monmouth, Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, and other leaders of the whig party. Meanwhile, the lord mayor, Sir John Moore, who led the court faction in the city, gave similar entertainments to its chiefs at his house in Fleet Street. Roger North claimed in his Examen that, on the trial of the Earl of Shaftesbury for high treason (24 November 1681), Pilkington showed great partiality in returning the grand jury, and was reprimanded by the judges. In March 1682 Pilkington himself was tried at the Southwark assizes on a slight charge of libel, when the jury brought in a verdict of ¬£800 damages for the plaintiff. Pilkington appealed on the ground of excessive damages, and eventually the case came before the House of Lords, by whom the judgment was confirmed 3 June 1689. At the election of new sheriffs on midsummer day 1682, Pilkington and his fellow-sheriff Shute, who presided, defeated, by an exceptional exercise of their authority, the Lord Mayor Sir John Moore's efforts to secure the election of the court candidates, Dudley North and Ralph Box. The Lord Mayor on the following day attended with a deputation to inform the king that the sheriffs had behaved riotously. A privy council was summoned, the sheriffs were ordered to appear, and were accused of riotous conduct. Their trial, together with that of Ford Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Warke, Alderman Henry Cornish, Sir Thomas Player, Slingsby Bethel, and others, took place on 16 February 1683. They were found guilty on 8 May, and were fined on 26 June for various sums amounting to ¬£4,100, Pilkington's fine being ¬£500. (This judgment was later reversed by the House of Lords on a writ of error on 17 July 1689.) Pilkington's shrievalty closed on 28 September 1682, when the outgoing sheriffs declined to entertain, according to custom, the lord mayor at dinner. The alleged riots fomented by Pilkington and Shute were made in part the ground for suspending the city's charter by the quo warranto of 1683. On laying down his office, further difficulties confronted Pilkington. James, Duke of York had already brought against him an action of scandalum magnatum. He was charged with refusing to accompany a deputation of the corporation on 10 April 1682 to pay respect to the Duke on his return from Scotland, and with saying, in the presence of Aldermen Sir Henry Tulse and Sir William Hooker, that the Duke had burned the city, and was then coming to cut the citizens' throats. Damages were laid by the duke at ¬£100,000. The cause was tried on 24 November 1682 in Hertfordshire, and the jury decided against Pilkington for the damages claimed. Pilkington thereupon surrendered to his bail, was committed to prison, and resigned the office of alderman, to which Sheriff North succeeded. After an imprisonment of nearly four years he was released by the king's order towards the end of June 1686. On the flight of his old enemy, then King James II, and the arrival of the Prince of Orange in 1688, Pilkington enjoyed the royal favour. He was elected alderman of Vintry ward on 26 February 1689, and was restored to his former place and precedence in the court of aldermen. He was also returned as one of the city representatives in parliament. On the sudden death of Sir John Chapman, Lord Mayor, on 20 March 1689, Pilkington was elected for the remainder of the year. On 10 April 1689 he was knighted by the king; on Michaelmas day he was elected Lord Mayor for the next year; and at his installation banquet entertained the king and queen William and Mary, with George and Anne, the Prince and Princess of Denmark. The pageant was written by Matthew Taubman, the city poet. The act which reversed the judgment in quo warranto (14 May 1690) directed that a Lord Mayor and the principal city officers should be elected on 26 May, and should continue in office until the date at which the tenure of the office customarily determined in the following year. Accordingly, Pilkington and Sir Jonathan Raymond, a tory, were returned by the livery to the court of aldermen, who for the third time elected Pilkington Lord Mayor. At the beginning of December 1690 the common council complained in a petition to the House of Commons that the lord mayor and court of aldermen had encroached upon their privileges. The matter was contested in parliament, and after heated discussions a motion for the adjournment of the debate was carried on 11 December by a majority of 197 against 184. Death Pilkington did not long survive his third mayoralty, dying on 1 December 1691. His town residence was in Bush Lane, Scott's Yard, Cannon Street (London Directory, 1677). A portrait of Pilkington is preserved at Skinners' Hall, and is reproduced in Wadmore's 'History of the Skinners' Company.' There is a contemporary engraving (1691) by Robert White, from a painting by Linton, and another by Robert Dunkarton, representing him in puritan costume. Family Pilkington married Hannah Bromwich of London, by whom he had two sons.

In 1912, he was called to military service. He was seriously wounded at Charleroi during the First World War and taken prisoner.

He returned to France in 1919 and rejoined the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He won first prize in the Prix de Rome in 1921, and the international competition for the construction of the Palace of Justice in Cairo. He built several buildings in Alexandria with the College of Christian Schools and the Coll√®ge Saint-Marc. In 1922 he presented a project to rebuild the Labyrinth of Thebes in Karnak. Douaumont ossuary On his return to France, he was appointed professor at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1923 he won the contest for Douaumont ossuary, which reflects his admiration for Roman art and stone building construction, and was completed in 1932.

In 1938, work started on his design for the Parc de la Butte du Chapeau Rouge in the 19th arrondissement, which was then completed by his son Jean. Between 1933 and 1935, he built the church of Saint Anthony of Padua in the 15th arrondissement. His work for the Parc des Expositions (exhibition ground) at the Porte de Versailles included office buildings, medical service and, in 1937, with Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, the entrance to the Park. At the Brussels World Fair of 1935, he designed the Pavillon de la Ville de Paris. In 1936, together with Maurice Mantout, he built the Franco-Muslim Avicenna hospital in Bobigny.

The main objective of IRDP is to increase rural incomes through: *Improved agriculture practices *Water Resource Management *Livestock Management *Women Empowerment through Self Help Group (SHG)  Role of Yuvaparivartan  India has the second largest population in the world at 1.20 billion, and with the 2nd fastest growing economy which will scale to 9-9.5%. The National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC)NSDC  News & Events  NSDC presentation at the Yuva Parivartan International Summit on Skills Development has projected an incremental shortage of 244 million labourers by 2022 and about 13 million on annual basis! YP saw this scenario 14 years back and decided to work for the underprivileged dropouts and less educated, forgotten by every successive Govt. from all the several Schemes it announces. Hence Skill Development is critical and relevant and mass customised training the need of the hour.  Support from people  Management people collect Donations from sponsors to run the NGO for School drop out & deprived youth.  Operations  Yuva Parivartan is tied up with Axis Bank to take Skill Development & Training to Vidarbha & Marathwada Regions of Maharashtra which covers 19 districts and is known for the maximum Farmers' suicides in India due to continual droughts and failure of crops. KSWA started a main Center in the city of Nagpur and Aurangabad, which was opened in December 2010. These Model Centers are serving as Training Centers for partners in these areas where KSWA opened 66 Centers. Year ending March 31, 2011, KSWA had 28 Centers spread over seven districts of Maharashtra, mainly Mumbai, Pune, Raigad, Thane & Nashik and Centers in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Chandrapur and Wardha District. *YP was one of the five selected NGO‚Äôs of Mumbai selected by Impact International Consulting Firm from the U.K. to participate in the CSR Initiative of Thomson Reuters International.

His thesis was supervised by Marcel Prenant, and focused on histology. He also did a larger \\"Doctorat d'√©tat\\" (a degree that no longer exists but that was required at the time to supervise doctoral students or for academic advancement). That thesis was published as several papers in the Annales de Pal√©ontologie. Career He worked in the University of Paris from 1961 (before completing his thesis, as was then customary in France) till 1995, when he was nominated to the Historical and Evolutionary Biology Chair of the Coll√®ge de France. He officially retired in 2010, but he continues publishing. By the time that he retired, he had published 104 scientific papers and about 120 semi-popular papers.

The film won by Best Children's Film award at the 57th National Film Awards. It also won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Children's Film of 2009. Plot Keshu (Navneet Krishnan) is a deaf and dumb boy who lost his mother when he was born. He was raised by his maternal uncle (Kaladharan) and wife (Lakshmi Krishnamoorty). Being mischievous, there were many complaints against Keshu by the villagers. His uncle kept punishing him, but to no avail. The only person who Keshu could find solace was his distant relative and the maid of the house, Devu (Amala). Then, Shalini (Priyanka Nair), a drawing teacher transferred to that village started living with the family. Keshu did not spare her from his mischief, but she did not complain to anyone, and instead started liking Keshu. He reciprocated the affection shown to him and there was a gradual change in his behaviour. She encouraged him to take up drawing and even convinced his uncle to enroll him in a special school for the deaf and the dumb. Keshu wins an international award for his painting, The elephant and the Mahout, and becomes the darling of the whole village. The end of the happy chapter came as a letter to Shalini informing that her marriage is fixed. Her return was a torment to Keshu, his family as well as Shalini. Keshu remained sad and desperate for her return for days, but eventually realised that she will not come back. He asked his uncle to take him back to his school, and his uncle took him back to his world of colours and drawings.

Some have argued that they were instituted to prevent financial \\"doping\\" from outside sources injecting money into smaller clubs. They were agreed to in principle in September 2009 by the Financial Control Panel of football's governing body in Europe (Union of European Football Associations ‚Äì UEFA). The regulations provide for sanctions to be taken against clubs who exceed spending, over several seasons, within a set budgetary framework. Implementation of the regulations took place at the outset of the 2011‚Äì12 football season.BBC News Website 2 March 2010 The severest penalty is disqualification from the European competitions.https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/EuroExperience/uefaorg/Publications/01/59/87/45/1598745_DOWNLOAD.pdf Other penalties included fines, the withholding of prize money, and player transfer bans. On announcing the new legislation, former UEFA President Michel Platini said, Platini went on to say that the measures were supported by the majority of football club owners, and that an independent panel would be set up to judge whether clubs had broken the rules. Although the intentions of encouraging greater financial caution in football have been well-received, FFP has been criticised as illegal by limiting the internal market, failing to reduce football club debt and protecting the status quo. In 2015, UEFA announced FFP would be \\"eased\\" in response to a number of lawsuits which are currently ongoing in courts. Background A 2009 UEFA review showed that more than half of 655 European clubs incurred a loss over the previous year, and although a small proportion were able to sustain heavy losses year-on-year as a result of the wealth of their owners, at least 20% of clubs surveyed were believed to be in actual financial peril. The reasons for this are well summarised in the 2010‚Äì12 House of Commons report on Football Governance: Even among Europe's elite sides, continued excessive spending has often been justified by club executives as being \\"necessary to keep the club competitive\\". As Christian M√ºller, CFO of the German Bundesliga told the European Commission: \\"... we learn by experience all over the world [that] most club executives tend to operate riskily, tend to overestimate their chances in the Championship. This may result in disproportionate spending relative to the income some clubs generate... club executives have somehow to be protected from themselves.\\"The Seventh Report of Session (2010‚Äì12) House of Commons (Culture, Media and Sport & Committee) report into English Football Governance The vast majority of the overall European football debt is owed by only three of the biggest leagues: the English Premier League, the Italian Serie A and the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n, commonly known as La Liga. The English, Italian and Spanish leagues =Premier League= A report by Deloitte indicated that total debt among the 20 Premier League clubs for the year 2008‚Äì09 was around ¬£3.1 billion.The Guardian ‚Äì 3 June 2009 At the time of the introduction FFP, several Premier League clubs were known to be spending considerably above their income. For example, between 2005 and 2010, West Ham United recorded an aggregate net loss of ¬£90.2 million, with equity of ¬£13.063 million on 31 May 2010 following a re-capitalization. Meanwhile, Everton, whose former manager David Moyes had long received praise for his continued ability to keep the club among the top Premier League sides despite an extremely tight transfer budget, had a negative equity (in group accounts) of ¬£29.774 million on 31 May 2010, making a net loss of ¬£3.093 million in consolidated accounts. Worst of all, though, were the finances of Portsmouth, which had a shortfall of ¬£59,458,603 to the creditor in February 2010 (after deducting the book value of the asset). Having invested heavily on players over previous seasons, (the previous year's net loss was covered by French- Israeli businessman Alexandre Gaydamak), Portsmouth were runners-up of the 2009‚Äì10 FA Cup in 2010, but as the season wore on the financial situation deteriorated, leaving players unpaid and the club with an outstanding bill for income tax which in turn led to a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs.Sky.com Sports News ‚Äì 26 February 2010 There then followed administration to avoid the club being liquidated, a nine-point deduction from the Premier League, and finally relegation into the lower division. A similar train of events had affected another English club, Leeds United, some years previously.BBC News ‚Äì 10 September 2006 The problem of debt was not confined to the top division, with a number of clubs in the second tier of English football, the Championship seemingly gambling their futures in an effort to gain promotion into the Premier League. The 2010‚Äì2012 parliamentary report into English football noted that, \\"Much of the overspending [by non Premier league clubs] is as a result of the desire to get into the 'promised land' of the Premier League or indeed to simply stay there... the prevailing reasoning amongst Football League sides seems to be that excessive levels of spending can be sustained for a few years within which time promotion must be achieved. After that, Premier League revenues can be used to pay off all the debts accrued.\\" =Serie A= In the Italian Serie A, most clubs also reported a net loss over the previous season: Milan (group) ‚Ç¨69.751 million on 31 December 2010; Genoa ‚Ç¨16,964,706 on 31 December 2010; Fiorentina ‚Ç¨9,604,353 on 31 December 2010; Bologna ‚Ç¨4,166,419 on 30 June 2011; and Chievo ‚Ç¨527,661 on 30 June 2011, among others. Only a few Italian clubs made a net profit, which included Udinese, Catania, Napoli (‚Ç¨4,197,829 on 30 June 2011) and Lazio (‚Ç¨9,982,408 on the group account on 30 June 2011). Some of the Italian clubs had been losing money for a number of years; for example Inter Milan have accumulated losses of around ‚Ç¨1.3 billion over the last 16 years,The Swiss Ramble 7 December 2011 while on 20 May 2005, Lazio agreed a 23-year repayment plan to pay back a ‚Ç¨140 million overdue tax bill. The club recovered, however, showing a net asset/equity of ‚Ç¨10,500,666 in its consolidated accounts on 30 June 2011, while net financial debt of the group () was ‚Ç¨9.01 million. Its city rival A.S. Roma SpA, from its ultimate holding company Italpetroli, intermediate holding company \\"Roma 2000\\" (the holding company or the head of Roma larger group of companies, holding company of \\"ASR Real Estate S.r.l.\\" and \\"Brand Management S.r.l.\\") to AS Roma SpA (or AS Roma [smaller] group), owed considerable money to banks, including UniCredit. On 30 June 2010, AS Roma SpA had a negative equity (total liability greater than total asset) of ‚Ç¨13.2 million on the consolidated balance sheet, which ultimately led to the group (\\"Roma 2000\\") being sold to group of investor led by American billionaire Thomas R. DiBenedetto (25%). Before the formal handover on 30 June 2011, the club had a net financial debt of ‚Ç¨53.831 million, with a negative equity of ‚Ç¨43.984 million. =La Liga= Despite the most recent report showing 8% growth in La Liga revenues, the highest of any European league, the overwhelming majority of the extra money went to the two dominant clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, primarily due to their ability to negotiate separate TV deals.Elcentrocampista.com 27 December 2011 During the summer of 2009, Real Madrid paid a world record transfer fee of ¬£70 million for Cristiano Ronaldo. Being the world's richest club according to the Forbes List, heavy spending on two other players, Kak√° and Karim Benzema, with their associated high wages, trebled Real's net financial debt from ‚Ç¨130 million on 30 June 2008 to ‚Ç¨326.7 million on 30 June 2009, as the signing Ra√∫l Albiol, Benzema, Kak√°, Ronaldo, James Roudiguez, Gareth Bale, and some minor players to the 2009‚Äì10 squad were included in the 2008‚Äì09 financial year.http://www.realmadrid.com/StaticFiles/RealMadrid/img/pdf/InformeRm08_09.pdf Madrid's signing one additional big name, Xabi Alonso in August 2009, made the net financial debt only drop from ‚Ç¨326.7 million to ‚Ç¨244.6 million on 30 June 2010, still higher than previous eight seasons. The net asset/equity, however, increased from ‚Ç¨195.9 million to ‚Ç¨219.7 million.BBC News Website ‚Äì 20 September 2009 Barcelona also continued to spend heavily, although in recent years, the level had been slightly reduced. On 30 June 2009, Barcelona's net asset/equity was ‚Ç¨20.844 million.http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/downloads/sala_premsa/memoria/2009/memoria_barca_economica_eng.pdfThe net asset value, however, may under-valued or over-valued as the intangible asset, may be over or under valued. For example, youth product does not have an asset value given that there is no formation cost of that capital, such as a transfer fee; the asset value would also be amortized which the residual value of the contract in accounting did not reflect the true market value; lastly, there is a lack of protocol to make impairment on flops. The residual contract value may be greater than the market value as the transfer market always had fluctuation Total debt in La Liga was estimated at ¬£2.5 billion, leaving many of the owners, as so often in the past, having to put more of their own money into clubs. In the summer of 2010, Villarreal failed to pay its players because the ceramics industry from which their owner Fernando Roig made his money was hit hard by the European credit crisis. At the end of the year, Deportivo de La Coru√±a were more than ‚Ç¨120 million in debt, Atl√©tico Madrid owed more than ‚Ç¨300 million, while the total for Valencia at one point in 2009 was reported to be as high as ‚Ç¨547 million.The Guardian In 2007, during a property boom, Valencia's management decided to build a new 70,000 capacity stadium, despite doubts that it could attract enough fans to regularly fill it. Construction of the \\"Nou Mestalla\\" was to be funded by the sale of the existing ground; however, two years into the project, work ground to a halt when the club could not find a buyer following the Spanish property crash.Yahoo news 12 April 2012 Despite an impressive display on the field, Valencia was forced to temporarily halt work on a new stadium and delay wages when its bank denied it more credit, forcing management to sell some of their top players, including David Silva and David Villa. In the lower Spanish leagues, at least six clubs, including former second-tier sides Real Sociedad, Celta de Vigo, and Levante, were in administration with more threatened as the recession worsened. In July 2008, the Spanish government revealed that the clubs had a combined debt of ¬£507 million to the tax authorities alone, with substantial amounts owed to a number of other state bodies.Daily Telegraph 19 November 2008 The French and German leagues For a number of years, the clubs in the two other big European leagues, the French Ligue 1 and the German Bundesliga, had been subject to regulations not unlike the FFP rules. =Ligue 1= In France, The Direction Nationale du Contr√¥le de Gestion (DNCG) is responsible for administering, monitoring and overseeing the accounts of all professional clubs to ensure that owners are being financially prudent. Sanctions for non-compliance include transfer embargoes, reduced playing squads, demotion or even expulsion from the league. Despite lower incomes, French clubs do not carry the enormous debt of the English, Italian and Spanish leagues. A number of French clubs have produced small profits over a number of years, concentrating on developing young players in modern academies, who then generate profits when sold. For example, in the four years up to 2009, player trading by Lille, one of the leading clubs, exceeded ‚Ç¨164 million in profit.The Swiss Ramble 10 May 2011 OL Group, the holding company of the same name (Olympique Lyonnais), had a net profit of ‚Ç¨5.1 million in the 2008‚Äì09 season.http://www.actusnews.com/documents/ACTUS-0-3288-OL- DDR-0809-GB.pdf =Bundesliga= At the end of each season, Bundesliga rules indicated that clubs must apply to the German Football Federation (DFB) for a licence to participate again the following year; only when the DFB, which has access to all transfer documents and accounts, are satisfied that there is no threat of insolvency does it provide approval. The DFB have a system of fines and points deductions for clubs who flout rules and those who go into the red can only buy a player after selling one for at least the same amount. In addition, no individual is allowed to own more than 49% of any Bundesliga club. Despite the strong economic governance in the German league, there were still some instances of clubs running into difficulties. In 2004, Borussia Dortmund reported a debt of ‚Ç¨118.8 million (¬£83 million).Daily Telegraph 17 November 2004 Having won the UEFA Champions League in 1997 and a number of Bundesliga titles, Dortmund had gambled to maintain their success with an expensive group of largely foreign players but failed, narrowly escaping liquidation in 2006. In subsequent years, the club went through extensive restructuring to return to financial health, largely with young home-grown players. In 2004, Hertha BSC reported debts of ¬£24.7 million and were able to continue in the Bundesliga only after proving they had long-term credit with their bank. Bayern Munich made a net profit of just ‚Ç¨2.5 million in the 2008‚Äì09 season (group accounts), while Schalke 04 incurred a net loss of ‚Ç¨30.4 million in the 2009 financial year. Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA made a net loss of just ‚Ç¨2.9 million in 2008‚Äì09. Other leagues Other European leagues include the Portuguese Primeira Liga, the Dutch Eredivisie and the Scottish Premier League. Mainly as a result of their lower populations and smaller economies, these and other leagues such as the Belgian and Scandinavian leagues generate less revenue than those of the bigger nations, and there are currently no clubs in the Deloitte Top 20 from outside the big five leagues, although these are home to a number of extremely well run and successful clubs. Despite earning only a sixth of Real Madrid's revenue for example, Portuguese club Porto regularly reach the last 16 of the Champions League and have been European champions twice ‚Äì in 1986‚Äì87 and 2003‚Äì04. Porto make use of third-party deals and an extremely effective scouting network, particularly in South America, to purchase promising young players to develop and play in the first team in the near future before eventually selling them for a large profit. Since 2004, Porto has covered its large operating losses with a ‚Ç¨190 million net profit in player sales.Swiss Ramble ‚Äì 8 December 2010 The three main Dutch clubs, Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord, have each been crowned European champions at least once. In recent years, however, their dominance has been challenged by the emergence of other clubs such as FC Twente, meaning they can no longer rely on annual infusions of Champions League cash. As in other countries, the Global Recession greatly diminished sponsorship and TV income, turning an Eredivisie profit of ‚Ç¨64 million in 2007‚Äì08 into a ‚Ç¨90 million loss for 2009‚Äì10.NL Planet PSV recorded a ‚Ç¨17.5 million loss as their annual revenue dropped back 40% from ‚Ç¨85 million to ‚Ç¨50 million, while major rival Ajax ‚Äì the only Dutch club listed on the stock exchange ‚Äì lost ‚Ç¨22.8 million.Reuters ‚Äì 14 October 2010 After enjoying 11 consecutive years of Champions League qualification and reaching the semi-final in 2005, PSV found its regular profits turning into losses and began selling top players, including Heurelho Gomes (Tottenham Hotspur), Mark van Bommel (Barcelona), Park Ji-sung (Manchester United), Johann Vogel (Milan), Alex (Chelsea) and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink (Celtic). Able to count only on the much lower revenues of the UEFA Europa League (less than ‚Ç¨4 million in 2010The Swiss Ramble ‚Äì 28 July 11), the club took on a ‚Ç¨10 million loan from its long-standing benefactor, the electronic giant Phillips, and in April 2012 was forced to sell its ground and training complex to the local council for ‚Ç¨49 million, leasing it back for ‚Ç¨2.3 million per year. A leading councillor said that the move was necessary because of \\"the idiocy of big money and the game played between millionaires and football agents\\".DutchNews.nl ‚Äì 5 April 2012 Recognising the social and cultural importance of its clubs, Dutch authorities invested over ‚Ç¨300 million in football between 2006 and 2011, mainly through indirect subsidies and loans to clubs such as FC Utrecht, FC Groningen, FC Twente, Vitesse and ADO Den Haag, though such aid has fallen foul of EU rules. A 2011 report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers expressed deep concern at the fragile financial state of Scottish football. Despite a modest profit in five of the previous six seasons, net indebtedness of SPL clubs had grown over the previous year to ¬£109m, with half of clubs reporting a worsening position and only two clubs debt free.PricewaterhouseCoopers 21st Annual Financial Review of Scottish Football (August 2010) Despite providing the first British team (Celtic in 1967) to become European champions, since the advent of pay-per- view TV Scottish football had failed to keep up with its English counterpart; in stark contrast to the Premier League's vast TV earnings, following the collapse of the Irish satellite broadcaster Setanta in June 2009 the joint Sky-ESPN TV rights to be shared among all SPL clubs now amounted to only ¬£13 million per year, a figure little changed from the ¬£12 million it had received under the Sky deal as long ago as 1998.The Guardian 19 August 2010 Following the global downturn, job insecurity and rising unemployment meant that a number of Scottish fans did not renew season tickets, leading to a 10% fall in attendance over one year. The entire turnover of SPL champions Rangers for the 2008‚Äì09 season dropped 38% to ¬£39.7 million.Deloitte Football Money League February 2009 As with other leagues, participation in the Champions League continued to make the crucial difference between profit and loss for the two \\"Old Firm\\" clubs. However, because of mediocre performances in recent years, the SPL champions no longer qualify automatically for the Champions League group stages and are now largely confined to the much less lucrative Europa League. Issues relating to Financial Fair Play Leveraged buyouts There was also concern at the heavy debt being loaded onto some clubs as a result of new owners borrowing heavily to acquire the club and then using future earnings to pay the interest, a practice known as a leveraged buyout.Daily Telegraph 27 January 2010The Guardian ‚Äì 3 November November 2010 The world's richest club, Manchester United, was bought in this way by the Glazer family in 2005 after which the club, previously very profitable, remains several hundred millions of pounds in debt. Since 2005, more than ¬£300 million which might otherwise have been spent on players, improving facilities or simply kept as a contingency has been taken out of Manchester United and spent on interest, bank fees and derivative losses. (While Manchester United FC Limited was almost debt free, its ultimate holding company \\"Red Football Shareholder Limited\\" had a negative equity of ¬£64.866 million in its consolidated balance sheet on 30 June 2010.) Liverpool found itself in a similar position after being purchased by Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett in February 2007. Although subjected to less leveraged debt than Manchester United, by 31 July 2010, the club was suffering a negative equity of ¬£5.896 million while its holding company, KOP Football Limited ‚Äì the entity which carried the debt ‚Äì had a negative equity of ¬£111.88 million, leaving the club tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, and had to be put up for sale. Hicks and Gillett placed what was widely believed to be an unrealistic value on the club in the hope of making a vast profit however, for which they were severely criticised in the House of Commons as \\"asset strippers draining the club with their greed\\".BBC News Website 17 June 2010 Eventually Liverpool was bought by a new American consortium, but because leveraged buyouts are permitted under normal stock market rules they will not be addressed by the FFP rules.http://www.parliament.uk ‚Äì 'Football Governance' The leveraged buyout model is common for normal business ventures where ‚Äì apart from the actual employees ‚Äì the overall national impact of a firm collapsing is not particularly significant since other companies will fill the gap in the market. LBOs have sometimes been defended by those using them as mechanisms to bring greater efficiency and financial discipline to target companies, although there are also examples where they have actually added to an existing problem of debt. To football fans who find themselves paying significantly higher ticket prices (around 50% at Manchester United in the first five years of the Glazer takeover), LBOs are anathema, perhaps representing the complete opposite of the wealthy benefactor model, taking money out of the club and providing few or no positive changes to their club since no new players are purchased and no facilities or stadia are built or improved. As with debt taken on in an attempt to improve the team, unexpected failure (such as not qualifying for the Champions League) can cause significant financial problems for clubs loaded with LBO debt. For these \\"emotional stakeholders\\", their club is not a \\"normal business\\" but rather an intrinsic part of their lives and often of great social and cultural importance to the local community. LBOs are also believed to have played at least a part role in takeovers at Portsmouth, Hull City, Chesterfield, Notts County and Derby County, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the main supporters groups of Manchester United and Liverpool, MUST and Spirit of Shankly called on the British government to legislate against future LBOs of football clubs, calling for an outright ban or a limit on the amount which can be borrowed against acquisition ‚Äì perhaps along the German model where no individual can own more than 49% of the club. There have also been calls to restrict levels of dividend withdrawal and improvements in \\"proper person tests\\"‚Äô introduced after the earlier takeover of Manchester City by Thaksin Shinawatra. After being ousted as prime minister of Thailand in a military coup, Shinawatra was accused of human rights abuses, charged with three counts of corruption and had his financial assets in Thailand frozen, but eventually made a significant profit when selling the club to Sheik Mansour. Wealthy benefactors A number of clubs across Europe were historically in a position to spend substantially more than they earned as a result of the benevolence of their owners who made substantial financial gifts to the club, either by paying off existing debt, providing direct injections of cash, issuing extra shares or giving loans which are later written off. Such a practice adversely affects the market by creating wage and transfer inflation as well encouraging other clubs to spend more than they can afford in an effort to remain competitive. For example, Internazionale's enormous losses since the mid-1990s have been largely underwritten by their president, energy company owner Massimo Moratti. Its archrival, Milan, was also financially supported by Silvio Berlusconi (over ‚Ç¨120 million between 2007 and 2010). The Della Valle brothers, meanwhile, also contributed ‚Ç¨84.7 million to Fiorentina from 2006 to 2009. Juventus had re-capitalized twice in recent years, by about ‚Ç¨104.8 million after the 2006 Italian football scandal and in 2011 by ‚Ç¨120 million. In Ligue 1, Paris Saint-Germain became the richest club in France and one of the richest clubs in the world after Qatar Investment Authority became the majority shareholder of PSG after buying 70% of the shares in 2011 by buying the club in a deal worth ‚Ç¨50 million, which covered an estimated ‚Ç¨15‚Äì20 million in debt and losses of ‚Ç¨19 million from the 2010‚Äì11 season. PSG splashed a French record ‚Ç¨108 million and were the biggest spenders in the world for the 2011‚Äì12 season. In the English Premier League, Chelsea's massive transfer spending since 2003 has been paid for by their owner, the Russian oil and gas billionaire Roman Abramovich, while Manchester City is owned by one of the world's richest men, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Since 2008, the owner has spent in excess of ¬£1 billion on players and infrastructure at the club, though this has drawn considerable criticism from other clubs and football figures. Arsenal manager Ars√®ne Wenger, a major proponent of the FFP legislation, has referred to transparent owner equity investment as \\"financial doping\\".Daily Telegraph 7 August 2009Metro 26 August 2011 Referring to the intention to reduce the plutocratic influence of the \\"Sugar Daddies\\", UEFA President Michel Platini said, \\"If you buy a house, you have a debt but that doesn't mean someone is going to stop you from working. If you depend only on a rich benefactor however, then the financial model is too volatile.\\" Delay in implementing FFP Rules Despite broad approval across Europe, in early 2010, the European Club Association succeeded in delaying the full introduction of the FFP Regulations to give clubs more time to adjust. The original timescale was lengthened, with a phased implementation over five years meaning that the full rules would apply in 2015 instead of 2012. The clubs also rejected a proposal by UEFA that the new rule should only apply to clubs with a turnover of more than ‚Ç¨50 million, agreeing that all clubs should be treated the same. Also on the agenda was a proposal to limit squads to 25 players with unlimited under-21 players per team at national and European level, as well as plans to reduce fees paid to agents. Clubs also agreed that they will not be able to owe each other money, nor will they be allowed to compete in Europe if salaries have not been paid to players or non-playing staff. Despite the delay, ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, representing Bayern Munich, called the new rules \\"a magnificent achievement\\" and pointed out that 93 clubs from 53 countries who attended the ECA's General Assembly in Manchester agreed with the proposals. He stated, \\"After only two years of existence, the European Club Association has managed, together with UEFA, to set measures that will shape the future of European club football into a more responsible business and ultimately a more sustainable one.\\" Manchester United Chief Executive David Gill, also a member of the ECA board, said that his club would meet the new rules, despite their reported debts of ¬£716.5 million. He said, \\"We have seen what the proposals are and we would meet the financial break even rules. We as Manchester United have always been run professionally and will continue to be run professionally.\\" Summary of current FFP Regulations Only a club's outgoings in transfers, employee benefits (including wages), amortisation of transfers, finance costs and dividends will be counted over income from gate receipts, TV revenue, advertising, merchandising, disposal of tangible fixed assets, finance, sales of players and prize money. Any money spent on infrastructure, training facilities or youth development will not be included. The legislation currently allows for eight separate punishments to be taken against clubs transgressing the rules, based in order of severity: Reprimand / Warning, fines, points deduction, withholding of Revenue from a UEFA competition, Prohibition to register new players for UEFA competitions, Restrictions on how many players a club can register for UEFA competitions, Disqualification from a competition in progress and Exclusion from future competitions The full regulations (Edition 2015) are available to download from the UEFA official portal UEFA.com.http://www.uefa.org/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/02/26/77/91/2267791_DOWNLOAD.pdf Criticism of FFP Creation of a big club status quo One of the major criticisms of FFP is the possibility of solidifying the so-called big clubs which generate largest revenue and profits, and can consequently spend more money on transfers. Qualification and participation in the Champions League is regarded as a lucrative affair and can earn clubs up to ¬£60 million in prize money and television rights a season if a club makes it to the final. A club only has to play 13 matches from the group stages to reach the final. In comparison, finishing bottom of the Premier League is now worth ¬£175 million, but is won over 38 matches. The financial gulf between successful clubs in the top-tier of European league has had an impact domestically, most notably in the Premier League, where for approximately a dozen years (from 1996 to 2008) there had been an almost complete dominance of the three major domestic English competitions by just four clubs (Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester United). During this period, the lack of competition for lucrative Champions League football in England from outside of those four clubs was frequently criticised. More recently, however, the grip on the four top places in the Premier League (that enable automatic entry into the Champions League competition) by the incumbent \\"Big 4\\" clubs has been heavily eroded in more recent seasons due to the rise in competitive performance of both Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City and the relative decline of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool. Since the 2015-2016 season the original \\"Big 4\\" clubs have gained no more than 2 of the top 4 positions each year. Questionable sponsorship deals Some forums have expressed concern at the potential risk that as clubs become ever desperate to raise \\"allowable\\" revenue which will positively affect their balance sheet, they will indulge in questionable U.S.-style advertising and sponsorship practices from multiple backers which may eventually compromise the ethical composition of football. Some clubs are easily able to attract reputable sponsorship due to the willingness of companies to be associated with a successful brand. For example, many top clubs raise money from selling sponsorship for their playing as well as their away and training kit, and other titles like the \\"official logistics partner\\" (Like Serveto for Barcelona) or \\"official marine engine partner\\" (Like Yanmar for Manchester United). Several top clubs have similar deals. Differing tax rates In addition, there remains the issue of widely differing tax rates and social security costs to which the European leagues are subject, meaning that some clubs have to pay a player much higher gross wages in order for him to be left with the same net salary as if he belonged to a club in another country. In addition, the UEFA guidance states that each club's accounts must be audited under the national accountancy conditions applicable in their particular country, which may vary. Third party ownership One area of concern for English clubs is the practice of third-party ownership. Under this model, companies or wealthy individuals buy a percentage of a young player in the hope that if his value increases in the future they will make a profit based on their percentage. The advantage for clubs is that they can make big savings from not having to pay the full transfer value of a player and can also make other financial gains, that is, from selling on a player's image rights. Following the problems caused by the sale of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano to West Ham United in 2006, third party ownership was banned in the Premiership, although it is widely used in South America and Europe and is permissible under FFP. Following the introduction of FFP, the Premiership unsuccessfully lobbied UEFA to review the situation to avoid English clubs being disadvantaged,BBC News ‚Äì 27 October 2011 and in October 2011, the leading sports lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont told the BBC that the Premier League's third-party ownership rules were not legitimate and that a legal challenge to overturn them would have a \\"very, very good chance of succeeding\\".BBC News ‚Äì 7 December 2011 On 4 February 2013, UEFA confirmed that it intended to ban third-party ownership of players, stating, \\"We think this should be the case all over the world, certainly all over Europe. If FIFA will not do it, we will certainly do it as far as Europe is concerned.\\"Guardian 5 February 2013 Charity and solidarity payments Another big issue for English clubs is the substantial payments made to the lower leagues in the football \\"pyramid\\" and to other charities out of their joint Sky TV deal.BBC News Website 26/09/11 In 2009‚Äì10, Premier League clubs paid a total of ¬£167.2 million to various causes, including ¬£62.2 million to recently relegated clubs in \\"parachute payments\\"; ¬£56.4 million across The Football League in \\"solidarity payments\\"; ¬£17.3 million to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA); ¬£7.8 million domestically and ¬£3 million internationally to the Creating Chances Trust ( a charity for children leaving care); ¬£12 million to other charities such as the Football Foundation, which provides funding for grass roots sport; ¬£2.9 million to Professional Games Match Officials (referees and assistant referees); ¬£2 million to the Conference National; and ¬£500,000 to the League Managers Association.

Kits are manufactured in Belgium. Design and development The M212 has had an unusually long gestation time. It was designed in 1992 by Filip Lambert, then a student at the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, and was selected as one of three winners of the Royal Aeronautical Society Light Aircraft Competition in 1995. Construction of the M212-100 prototype began in 1996. This aircraft was registered in the UK in 2000 and was displayed, complete apart from some engine and fuel supply systems, at the Popular Flying Association (PFA) Rally held at Cranfield in June 2002. The first flight, delayed by another two years, took place on 13 April 2004 at Cranfield with Roger Bailey as pilot. The M212 is an all- composite aircraft with 95% of its weight in pre-pregs. The wing has two main spars plus an auxiliary one, all formed from glass and carbon fibre in epoxy resin. In plan the wing is gently straight tapered, with most sweep on the trailing edge and with turned up wingtips. It has 5¬∞ of dihedral and 2¬∞ of washout. Electrically actuated single slot flaps are fitted. Fin and rudder are swept, with a small dorsal fin; the rudder is horn-balanced. The tailplane is rectangular and set a little above the fuselage, carrying inset elevators. The fuselage is a monocoque construction, tapering strongly to the rear. The cockpit seats four in two rows with dual controls in front, covered by a forward-hinged, single-piece canopy. There are two side windows for the rear seat passengers. The M212 has a fixed tricycle undercarriage, the mainwheels mounted on forward-leaning cantilever legs in narrow chord fairings, attached to the fuselage. The mainwheels have brakes and the nosewheel is steerable. The first M212 is powered by a 112 kW (150 hp) Lycoming O-320-ED flat-four engine driving a three-bladed propeller. Other engines have been considered, including the 134 kW (180 hp) Superior X-360, a flat-four related to the Lycoming O-360, and the 134-149 kW (180-200 hp) DeltaHawk DH180A4 liquid- cooled, four-cylinder, two-stroke Diesels. The M212 was initially intended to feature a Zoche aero-diesel ZO 01A, a radical single-row \\"cross-4\\" engine of 2,660 cc (162 cu in), producing up to 150 hp (112 kW) @ 2500 rpm. This engine was to be compact, lightweight (84 kg/185 lb),and economical, consuming some 21 litres per hour @ 75% power. As the Zoche company showed no signs of nearing production, Lambert had to settle for a more conventional, but readily available, option. Operational history In the mid-2000s Lambert were concentrating on the Mission 106 and Mission 212 kits were not produced until late 2006. In May 2010 the first kit-built example and second M212, registered in the Netherlands, was flown. It attempted an around-the-world flight which was ended by an engine fire and an emergency landing in the Philippines.

Czech botanist Karel Domin described this species in 1926 and it still bears its original name. Domin reported collecting the type specimen from somewhere between Camooweal and Burketown in northwestern Queensland, though it is more likely to have been northeast of Aramac. Description Acacia argyrodendron is a tree, reaching high, and has dark grey to black bark. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The ascending and evergreen phyllodes have a narrowly linear-elliptic shape and are straight or sometimes a little recurved. The leathery glabrous to subglabrous phyllodes are in length and wide and have many closely parallel nerves where one to three of the nerves are far more prominent than the others. When it blooms it produces inflorescences that occur in groups of 12 to 30 along an axis that is in length. the spherical flower-heads have a diameter of approximately and contain 12 to 20 golden coloured flowers. Following flowering thin and glabrous seed pods form that are up to in length and wide. The dull brown seeds inside the pods are soft with an elliptic to broadly oblong shape and are in length. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Karel Domin in 1926 as part of the work Beitrage zur Flora und Pflanzengeographie Australiens as published in the work Bibliotheca Botanica. It was reclassified as Racosperma argyrodendron in 1987 by Leslie Pedley then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2001. Distribution Acacia argyrodendron is found in central Queensland in the basins of the Cape, Suttor and Belyando Rivers on clay soils in areas where the annual rainfall ranges between . It forms open forests as the dominant (and sometimes only) tree species. Associated understory plants include shrub species such as the false sandalwood (Eremophila mitchellii), yellow-wood (Terminalia oblongata) and conkerberry (Carissa spinarum), and smaller herbaceous plants such as brigalow grass (Paspalidium caespitosum), yakka grass (Sporobolus caroli), blue trumpet (Brunoniella australis) and Dipteracanthus australasicus. Occasionally, there may be trees such as Dawson River blackbutt (Eucalyptus cambageana), coolibah (E. coolabah) and Brown's box (E. brownii). Gidgee (A. cambagei) replaces it in drier habitats, while brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) replaces it in wetter areas, as well as overlapping for part of the southern and eastern parts of its range. It has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema preissii, Amyema quandang and Lysiana exocarpi.

For a crime to be considered homicide, it must take place after the victim's legally recognised birth, and before their legal death. There is also the usually uncontroversial requirement that the victim be under the \\"Queen's peace\\". The death must be causally linked to the actions of the defendant. Since the abolition of the year and a day rule, there is no maximum time period between any act being committed and the victim's death, so long as the former caused the latter. There are two general types of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Murder requires an intention to kill or an intention to commit grievous bodily harm. If this intention is present but there are certain types of mitigating factors - loss of control, diminished responsibility, or pursuance of a suicide pact - then this is voluntary manslaughter. There are two types of involuntary manslaughter. Firstly, it may be \\"constructive\\" or \\"unlawful act\\" manslaugher, where a lesser but inherently criminal and dangerous act has caused the death. Alternatively, manslaughter may be caused by gross negligence, where the defendant has broken a duty of care over the victim, where that breach has led to the death, and is sufficiently gross as to warrant criminalisation. General features Death is an irremediable harm that is dealt with particularly seriously in English law. For example, the crime of murder uniquely carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, regardless of the degree to which the defendant is morally culpable provided they are legally culpable. To use another example: causing injury by dangerous driving carries a maximum sentence of two years, whereas causing death by dangerous driving carries one of fourteen years.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 359-360. All homicides involve three elements as a defining feature: firstly, that the victim must be a legally defined \\"human being\\"; that their death must be caused by the act or omission of one or more human beings; and that this must occur within the \\"Queen's peace\\", which relates to jurisdiction.Simester et al. (2010). p. 360. Birth and death A foetus, even at a late stage of pregnancy, is not protected by the law of homicide (rather, other offences have been created to prevent the proscribed harmFor example, child destruction (Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929) and unlawfully procuring a miscarriage (Offences Against the Person Act, section 58.)).Ormerod (2005). p. 430. To qualify, the victim must have an \\"independent existence\\". This was confirmed in 1998 in Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 1994),[1998] AC 245 [HL] even where the foetus is viable and could have survived if born before the offence was committed.Simester et al. (2010). p. 361. The confused rationale appears to match the complicated moral and biological distinction on which it is based; there is huge social significance placed upon birth and thus the law is unlikely to change - Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights has not yet been interpreted to conflict with the English law.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 362-363. Instead, in Vo v France, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that most definitions were within the margin of appreciation set aside to national law.Ormerod (2005). p. 431. The death of a child after birth from injuries sustained before birth would only constitute murder if the requisite intent - that the child would die after birth - was present. Other forms of homicide would also be applicable.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 363-364. There is no legislation that defines when death has occurred. However, in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland,[1993] 1 AC 789 (HL) cessation of brain stem function, one form of brain death, was considered the definition by the House of Lords. Much medical law - for example, that conferring the right to remove organs for transplant - is predicated on this decision and it is unlikely to be overturned.Simester et al. (2010). p. 365. The Criminal Law Revision Committee has declined to propose a legal definition, for fear of the wide impact that it could have on disparate branches of the law, and the changing basis in medical science.Ormerod (2005). p. 433. In Bland, a person in a persistent vegetative state was considered to be alive; accordingly, anything less than brain stem cessation is unlikely to be sufficient for death.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 365-366. Causation The normal rules of causation apply, although they can become strained when compared to the various moral issues of importance in cases of homicide. In R v. Pagett,(1983) 76 Cr App R 279 (CA) the defendant was found guilty of the manslaughter of a hostage he was using as a human shield, who was killed by police returning fire against the defendant. Whether another's actions are \\"free, voluntary and informed\\" is the operating definition, as upheld in R. v Kennedy (No. 2)[2008] 1 AC 269 (HL) where the defendant was acquitted. Such an intervening act is known as a \\"novus actus interveniens\\".Simester et al. (2010). pp. 366-367. The judgments of several judges in various cases, including Devlin J in R. v Adams[1957] Crim LR 365 appear to confuse causality with motive: where there is a strong moral imperative to clear the defendant, causality is doubted, rather than the mental element (mens rea).Simester et al. (2010). pp. 367-368. Since everyone will die at some point, then even murder is a mere acceleration of death. In Adams the question of life-shortening palliative care was approached, and the need to provide a suitable reason with which to distinguish the doctor from any other murderer. Ultimately it seems a special defence was created.Ormerod (2005). p. 435. A homicide can be brought about through act or omission. Baker, notes Elsewhere Baker argues: There are no specific rules that apply to acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim where he or she has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so.Simester et al. (2010). p. 368. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans,[2009] 1 WLR 1999 even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant.In R. v Miller [1983] 2 AC 161, part of the defendant's culpability was established on the converse being the case.Simester et al. (2010). p. 369. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 369-370. Other features The year and a day rule was abolished in England and Wales by the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996. As a matter of practice, the defendant may already have been prosecuted for the initial offence (for example, another offence against the person). Accordingly, the Attorney General's consent is required if more than three years has elapsed, or where the defendant has already been prosecuted in the circumstances alleged to have resulted in the victim's death.Simester et al. (2010). p. 370.Ormerod (2005). p. 434. A person who is not \\"under the Queen's Peace\\" cannot be the victim of a homicide. This includes the killing of alien enemies during a time of war. Murder or manslaughter committed by a British citizen is triable in an English (or Northern Irish) court, regardless of where the crime took place. The same is true for homicides committed on British ships or aircraft, regardless of the nationality of the offender. There are other statutory provisions which extend jurisdiction regarding types of offender on foreign ships, and, in the case of murder, terrorist activities.Ormerod (2005). pp. 429-430. Although most crimes committed overseas are generally dealt with in the home jurisdiction, the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 formally brings the offences of a British citizen under the jurisdiction of the British courts, and therefore the \\"Queen's Peace\\" rule is usefully retained. Defences The killing of another person must be unlawful. Some defences are therefore open to the defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the child was born alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder. Murder Sir Edward Coke, responsible for the traditional common law definition of murder. Murder has never been statutorily defined, despite being recognised as either the most serious crime, or certainly among them.Ormerod (2005). p. 429. The actus reus (prohibited act) of murder, unlawfully causing the death of another person, fits the general provisions for homicide.Ormerod (2005). pp. 429-436. The mens rea (mental element) of murder was long held to be \\"malice aforethought\\", which took on a meaning only of the required mental state for murder, since malice aforethought required neither malice (compassionate killing is still murder) nor aforethought (no premeditation is required).Simester et al. (2010). p. 371.Ormerod (2005). p. 436. It is this mental component that marks murder out from manslaughter. The mental element is taken to be either an intention to kill, or an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.Ormerod (2005). p. 436. Grievous bodily harm is \\"really serious\\" harm.Ormerod (2005). p. 437. The extension of the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm has been criticised, although it has remained in place despite several legal challenges, and, in the case of R v Hyam[1975] AC 55 the minority judgments of Lord Diplock and Lord Kilbrandon which would have removed it. The judges there made reference to the abolition under the Homicide Act 1957 of constructive malice (causing death whilst committing a felony or resisting arrest), believing the rule for grievous bodily harm to be a hang-over of the old system. It can now be concluded that only legislative intervention could abolish this form of murder, and, although the Law Commission proposed a change in the law, none has yet been enacted.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 371-373. The current law was judged to be compatible with Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to Northern Ireland. It can also be defended with reference to the actor taking responsibility for his actions, even unforeseen consequences, or merely as an appropriate response in itself.Ormerod (2005). pp. 438-439. Intent is subjective: that the defendant must surely have intended their actions because a reasonable person would, knowing what the defendant knew, have foreseen death as a result, is insufficient. This seemed to have been allowed as a form of intent in DPP v Smith,[1961] AC 290 but that case has been considered overturned following legislative changes, and more recent cases leave no room for doubt on this issue.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 373-374. Core intent would be where the defendant acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, the jury is directed that \\"intent\\" is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt to define it in other terms.Simester et al. (2010). p. 373. However, following R v Woollin,[1992] AC 82 it is also possible for a jury to convict if they \\"feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case\\" - known as \\"oblique intent\\". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the primary, core sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if it is difficult to imagine circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor. The exception for medical care is mentioned as a general principle for homicide.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 374-375. There is a mandatory life sentence for murder in England and Wales. David Ormerod describes the evidence for abolishing it - instead giving judges discretion to impose a life sentence, or some lesser term - as \\"overwhelming\\" since murders and murderers differ greatly, as in any other crime.Ormerod (2005). p. 439. However, no government has yet, or seems likely to, institute such reform. The former role of the Home Secretary in deciding the minimum time spent in jail was successfully challenged with reference to the ECHR in R v Home Secretary, ex p Anderson,[2002] UKHL 46 but the mandatory life sentence itself has been judged compatible. The sentencing and release of life prisoners was reformed by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.Ormerod (2005). pp. 439-440. Manslaughter Previously, all deaths which were not murder were classified as \\"manslaughter\\" - however, the law now requires that the death fit a particular type of manslaughter. Modern manslaughter does, however, retain a very wide scope.Simester et al. (2010). p. 379. There are three main forms of manslaughter in English law: voluntary manslaughter, cases which would otherwise amount to murder but for some legally recognised mitigating factor; and involuntary manslaughter which includes cases of gross negligence manslaughter and unlawful act manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter There are three types of voluntary manslaughter: that resulting from loss of self- control; that resulting from statutorily defined diminished responsibility; and killing in perseverance of a suicide pact.Simester et al. (2010). p. 380. Loss of control is defined in sections 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 56 abolishes the common law defence of provocation, which also dealt only with murder.Simester et al. (2010). p. 396. There is no mandatory life sentence for voluntary manslaughter. The defence operates whether the defendant is a principal or an accomplice.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 396-397. Broadly speaking, the defendant must have actually lost self- control; the trigger for this must be a qualifying trigger; and it must be that a \\"normal\\" person might also have lost control in the circumstances.Simester et al. (2010). p. 397. The loss of control need not be sudden, but cannot be in a \\"considered desired for revenge\\". The loss of control is a subjective test which asks whether this defendant actually lost control, and if so, whether that loss of control led to their killing. The qualifying trigger may take one of two forms, or be a combination of both: that the killing was attributable to the defendant's fear of serious violence from the victim against the defendant or another identified person; or where the defendant's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. The meaning of the terms \\"extremely grave character\\" and \\"justifiable sense of being seriously wronged\\" used in the second form is currently unclear.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 399-400. Section 51(1)(c) requires that \\"a person of [the defendant]'s sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of [the defendant], might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to [the defendant].\\" These issues are complicated and directing a jury on issues of loss of control is likely to be difficult.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 400-401. Diminished responsibility occurs where the defendant has an \\"abnormality of mental functioning\\" atrributable to a recognised medical condition. It must \\"substantially impair\\" the defendant's ability to either: under the nature of his or her conduct; form a rational judgment; or exercise self-control. It must provide an explanation for the defendant's actions.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 719-720. There is some sort of causal link required between the defendant's condition and his acts or omissions, a change on the previous law. A.P. Simester and G. R. Sullivan have argued that it is more clearly worded and more schematic provision than the earlier law, although they are worried if the wording of the section is taken to imprison those better suited to psychiatric help outside of prison.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 720-721. A killing in puseverance of a suicide pact, where the defendant had the \\"settled intention\\" of also committing suicide - although not necessarily by the same act - is a partial defence to murder. He or she must intend to fulfil that pact at the time of the killing and may renege on it later. Where the jury is not satisfied that the killing can be attributed to the defendant, a charge of encouraging or assisting suicide may be substituted to a charge of murder or voluntary manslaughter.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 422-423. Involuntary manslaughter Involuntary manslaughter involves the causing of the death of another person without intent to kill or intention to commit grievous bodily harm. Some cases are in form similar to murder cases; whilst, in others, had death not been caused, the defendant would only be liable for an insignificant crime.Simester et al. (2010). p. 402. =\\"Constructive\\" or \\"unlawful act\\" manslaughter= \\"Constructive\\" or \\"unlawful act\\" manslaughter results from the continuation of aspects of the felony murder rule, which was abolished in English law. Under that rule, the perpetrator of any (civil or criminal) illegality were held responsible for manslaughter for any death they caused. It had a huge scope. Constructive manslaughter has been narrowed, but remains broad. It requires a criminal act that causes the death; that that act is inherently criminal; and that that act is dangerous. Civil liability is insufficient for constructive manslaughter to result.Simester et al. (2010). p. 403. It is deemed \\"constructive\\" in the sense that a greater crime - manslaughter - is constructed from a lesser.Ashworth (2006). p. 287. The typical case will be of a non-fatal offence against the person that causes death.Ashworth (2006). p. 288. There must be a criminal act, rather than an omission, following R v Lowe.[1973] QB 702 Although acts and omissions may be equally culpable, the extension to omissions - where there is no need to show intent - would have made illegal a huge class of persons. Cases such as Lowe, which there was parental neglect, can be dealt with by gross negligence manslaughter.Simester et al. (2010). p. 404. Judges have often failed to identify a single unlawful act on which the crime of manslaughter is to be constructed, rather assuming the presence of one in particular circumstances. There is a required mental element (mens rea) for this crime, but it has in some cases not actually been formally established. This mens rea might be very low, such as recklessness. The requirement of an unlawful act also means that no lawful defence must be available to the defendant in respect of the lesser crime. The act must be inherently criminal - the case in point is that of R v Andrews, where the defendant had killed whilst driving dangerously. It was only the fact that the driving was dangerous that made it a crime, not the driving itself. Accordingly, Andrews removed driving and regulatory offences from the scope of constructive manslaughter. There are separate rules for causing death by dangerous driving and some regulatory offences.Simester et al. (2010). p. 405. Some commentators took Andrews as excluding strict liability and negligence cases out of constructive manslaughter, although contrary to the exact wording in the judgment there; however, a separate case also called R v Andrews convicted the defendant of constructive manslaughter based on a strict liability offence and this alternative proposition cannot be supported. Gross negligence manslaughter exists as a complementary form, and, if a driver was sufficiently negligent, as well he might, he would be liable for it. This provides an additional reason to exclude such cases from constructive manslaughter.Ashworth (2006). p. 289. The requirement that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury,[1977] AC 500 which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church:[1966] 1 QB 59 \\"the unlawful act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm\\".Simester et al. (2010). pp. 406-407.Ashworth (2006). p. 290. This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least in relation to the susceptibility of the victim.Ashworth (2006). pp. 290-291. R v Ball[1989] Crim LR 730 did, however, create a class of dangerous - that of the act itself - where the jury knew more than the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a blank cartridge, the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the reasonable man. This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing of an innocent bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.Simester et al. (2010). p. 407. This act must be causally linked to the death. In the case of an offence against the person, it is usually obvious; however, rather more controversial cases have founded constructive manslaughter on drug possession crimes involving the subsequent injection of the drug into another. =Gross negligence manslaughter= Gross negligence manslaughter requires a much greater level of wrongdoing that the civil tort of negligence.Simester et al. (2010). p. 411. It requires that the defendant owed a duty of care to the victim (it is for the judge to decide on which facts such a duty would be created). These rules are typically those of tort.Ashworth (2006). p. 292. For example, in R v Pittwood, the defendant was put under a duty to act on account of being contractually obliged to close the gates at a railway crossing.Simester et al. (2010). pp. 411‚Äì412. Similar duties include those of a doctor of his patients, an electrician over a householder he has done work for, parents over their children, and, developed more recently, a police officer over persons he arrests. Included, however, are those of a criminal enterprise, which would not attract tortious liability in the civil law. Where the defendant is liable through an omission and not an act, then a legal duty to act ‚Äì rather than a duty of care ‚Äì is needed. Andrew Ashworth has criticised the nature of the duty of care requirement as \\"decision-making at its retrospective worst\\".Ashworth (2006). p. 293. Once a duty of care (or duty to act, as required) has been shown, the jury should then be asked, following Lord Mackay in R v Adamoko:[1995] 1 AC 171 \\"having regard to the risk of death involved, [was] the conduct of the defendant... so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission\\".Simester et al. (2010). p. 412. This has two elements: firstly, the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death (confirmed in R v Singh[1999] Crim LR 582), and not to any lesser harm. In other words, the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim's death. Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime. For example, on the fact of Adomako itself, the defendant, an anaesthetist, failed to spot a problem with the victim's breathing tube for 11 minutes, something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so. The defendant was convicted. This definition has been opposed as being circular, as defining the crime of manslaughter as gross negligence as being negligence to a criminal degree. The jury may, under this characterisation, be ruling upon a point of law and not a point of fact.Ashworth (2006). pp. 293‚Äì94.

The product 2-phenyloxirane is also known as styrene oxide and can be converted by a styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) to obtain phenylacetaldehyde, which can be transformed into the key-intermediate phenylacetic acid by a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PAD). The enzyme belongs to the group of oxidoreductases according to the EC classification and is dependent on FAD as cofactor, thus it was classified as an external flavoprotein monooxygenase (designated as type E). It forms a two-component system with a reductase (StyB, StyA2B). The reductase utilizes solely NADH to reduce the FAD, which is then transferred to the styrene monooxygenase (StyA, StyA1). Two types of that enzyme are described so far: StyA/StyB (designated E1), first described from Pseudomonas species, and StyA1/StyA2B (designated E2), first described from Actinobacteria. The E1-type is more abundant in nature and comprises a single monooxygenase (StyA) supported by a single reductase (StyB), whereas the E2-type has a major monooxygenase (StyA1) which is supported by fusion protein of a monooxygenase and reductase (StyA2B). The latter one is the source of reduced FAD for the monooxygenase subunits and has some side activity as a monooxygenase. So far all styrene monooxygenases perform enantioselective epoxidations of styrene and chemically analogous compounds, which makes them interesting for biotechnological applications.

Although outnumbered, the Burgundian force succeeded in routing the militia of Li√®ge, inflicting heavy casualties.  Background  The War of the Public Weal between Louis XI and many of his senior nobles began in March 1465. As a consequence, the Burgundian State found itself at war with France. Louis, anxious to find allies, entered into talks with the city of Li√®ge, which had historical grievances with Burgundy, leading to a military treaty in June 1465. With the major part of the Burgundian army, under Charles, Count of Charolais, engaged in France, the Li√®gois declared war on Burgundy on 28 August. Despite having most of his forces committed in France, the elderly Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, rapidly assembled a force to defend his possessions against the attack of Li√®ge.  The armies  The Liegois army, commanded by Raes de Lyntre, Lord of Heers was approximately 2-3,000 strong, mostly infantry with some field artillery. The Burgundian force was about 1,800 strong, mostly cavalry, not all of whom took part in the battle.  The battle  The Burgundian army, having confronted the Li√®ge forces at Montenaken found themselves too weak to assault the defences. They therefore sent out raiders to burn the countryside in the hope of provoking the Liege troops to confront them. This was successful and a large Liege force, perhaps their whole army, met with a force of 3-500 Burgundian cavalry in open country. The Liege forces drew up between two tumuli, of which there are a number around Montenaken. The Burgundian cavalry charged but were beaten back by artillery fire. Regrouping, they charged again and were again beaten back. This time, however, their opponents pursued them. The Burgundians rallied again and charged a third time. The Li√®ge army, out of its defensive position and disordered by pursuit was routed. 1,200 men were estimated to have been killed in the battle and pursuit.Smith & DeVriess (2005), pp150-151  Aftermath  On 21 October, Louis XI wrote to Li√®ge, informing the city he had made an independent peace with the Burgundians (the Treaty of Conflans), and advising them to do likewise before the main Burgundian army returned. This they did, signing the Treaty of Saint-Trond in December.Vaughan (2002), pp394-5  References  Mont 1465 in Europe Montenaken 1460s in the Burgundian Netherlands 1460s in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Battle of Montenaken"},{"id":"34255499","text":"A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die () is a 1968 Italian spaghetti western.

Biography Scourfield was the son of Henry Scourfield and his wife Elizabeth (daughter of Rev John Ewer of Bangor), of the Scourfield family of New Moat and Robeston Hall. Scourfield was educated at New College, Oxford and on 27 October 1804 he married Maria Goate, daughter of Lt. Colonel Edward Goate of Brent Eleigh Hall, Suffolk. Despite his father having moved the family from New Moat in Pembrokeshire to Robeston Hall near Milford Haven, purchased from the pioneer industrialist Thomas Kymer, Scourfield returned to New Moat on his father's death in 1805 and proceed to rebuild the old estate, The Mote. Scourfield was a Tory by political leaning and had supported Lords Milford and Kensington in their elections as well as Lord Cowder's son in his 1812 campaign to win the county seat of Carmarthen. In 1816 Milford and Kensington fell out after Cowder allied himself to their joint enemy John Owen. Kensington, who had sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Haverfordwest with Milford's support, was obliged to lose the seat at the coming election. Milford had earmarked Scourfield for the seat of Haverfordwest since 1805, and with Kensingtons's support, Scourfield became Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest in 1818. That same year he was also appointed High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire. He was re-elected unopposed in 1820 but in 1826 the seat was taken by Milford's heir Richard Phillips, who had come of age. Although William Holmes wrote to Robert Peel in 1823, stating that Scourfield held the seat in opposition to Milford's interest, it was truer that Scourfield was an independent Parliamentarian, with a greater desire to serve his constituents than be involved in political machinations. In 1835 Scourfield was re-elected to Haverfordwest, the same year that his wife Maria died. He left Parliament for good in 1837, and on 28 December of that year he married for a second time, to Louisa Sarah, daughter of Richard Bowen of Manorowen. Scourfield died without an heir in 1843 and left the estate to his sister, Elizabeth Anne Scourfield. She was married to Colonel Owen Phillips of Williamston in 1804, and they left The Mote to their son, John Henry Phillips (1808‚Äì1876) who took the surname Scourfield in 1862.

Excavations began in 1964, with the first notable discovery occurring in 1969. History of excavations The first person to find objects at the location did so during 1828. These were animal bones considered antediluvian by Marcel de Serres, a professional geologist at the University of Montpellier. The Proto-Mousterian Industry tools found by Jean Ab√©lanet during 1963, initiated the beginning of the Lumley led excavations of 1964. Discovery and representative fossils The skeletal remains of two individual hominins have been found in the cave: a female older than 40 (Arago II, July 1969), and a male aged no more than 20 (Arago XXI, July 1971, and Arago XLVII, July 1979). Recovered stone tools originate from within a radius of the cave, while animal bones suggest the inhabitants could travel up to for food. All fossils recovered from Arago were found by Henry and Marie-Antoinette de Lumley and are now located at the Institute for Human Palaeontology in Paris. Arago II is a nearly complete mandible with six teeth from a 40‚Äì55 years old female. Arago XXI is a deformed cranial fragment featuring the most complete pre-Neanderthal face accompanied by a frontal and a sphenoid bone. Arago XLVII is a right parietal bone, the sutures of which fits perfectly with Arago XXI. The two latter have an estimated developmental age of twenty, while a uranium series dating produced a fossil age of c.400,000 years (this is near the maximum limit for this method and the fossil may be older.) The male skull has a flat and receding forehead with well- developed supraorbital ridges (\\"eyebrows\\") and a large face with rectangular eye sockets. The cranial cavity had a volume of . The rest of the skeleton has been reconstructed from 75 fossil remains and casts from fossils found at other sites; an interpretation suggesting in a sturdier skeleton than that of modern humans and a height of . Through the thousands of years from the time that Arago XXI died, changes occurred to the structure of the bone known as \\"taphonomic transformations\\", modifying the shape of skull. These had caused parts of the bone to become slightly bent,Ponce de Le√≥n & Zollikofer 1999 including the front of the skull to lose symmetry.Mafart et al. 1999 Three- dimensional imaging using computers allowed a morphometric analysis of the skull and this was used to compare with skull dimensions of Homo sapiens sapiens and also to obtain a computer generated image of the hominins face. Compared to H. erectus in North Africa and China, H. erectus tautavelensis is closer to early H. sapiens and thus form a morphologically distinct group together with other European Middle Pleistocene hominins found in Steinheim, Swanscombe, and Pontnewydd, because they show some of the characteristics of Neanderthals. The oldest indirect evidence of hominins in Europe dates to perhaps and while Arago is certainly younger, the stalagmite floor under the cave deposits has been ambiguously dated to 700,000 years old by electron spin resonance but to 300,000 years old by thermoluminescence. No signs of fire, ash, charcoal, burned stone, or clay is documented in the cave which seems to suggest the art of fire is a recent discovery, though traces at a erectus site in East Africa indicate the opposite.  Arago XXI  Arago XXI is a deformed cranial fragment dated to approximately 450,000 years. The skull was found by H. Lumley and M.A. Lumley in the Arago Cave located at Tautavel France. The hominin was twenty years old as indicated by the state of the fronto-pariental suture, and the gender is thought to be male. Archaeologists were uncertain of the age of the hominin, although finding the morphology comparable to the Petralona skull that is accepted as a Neanderthal of the Upper Pleistocene variate, paleoanthropologists (Cartmill, Smith, et al) have classified the skull instead as Heidelberg. Ecology The people of the cave ate elk, fallow deer, reindeer, musk ox, bison, Hemitragus bonali (bonal tahr), argali, chamois and Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis.Minist√®re de la Culture et de la Communication [NAVIGATION] to the information shown from this link is > THE ENVIRONMENT > FAUNA [Retrieved 2012-01-04] Bones of Cervus elaphus acoronatus and Cervus elaphoids, two species of deer, Canis etruscus (wolf), and Ursus deningeri, were the most found animal remains in reducing order of number of findings by percentage in the interglacial stage, in the glacial stage the most were Equus mosbachensis (horse), and Ovis ammon antiqua (non-extant mouflon), (plus C. e. acoronatus), and additionally remains of Hemitragus bosali.Jourdan and Moigne 1981 Arago Cave Occupied from 600,000 to 400,000 B.P., the cave is of the earliest known from the middle Pleistocene to archaeology of the Pyrenees.

Joseph Maiden described Acacia loderi in 1920 and it still bears its original name. It was named after its collector, assistant forester at Broken Hill A.C. Loder who collected it at Yancowinnia near Broken Hill in November 1907. The common name nelia and its former variants nealie and neelya are derived from the Ngyiyambaa word nhiil'i for the species. Acacia loderi grows as a large shrub or small tree high, with an erect or spreading habit. The bark is grey. Like all wattles it has leaf-like structures known as phyllodes instead of leaves. These are pale grey-green to green and very narrow and long, measuring in length by wide. The bright yellow flowers appear in spring (August to October). Acacia loderi is found in inland southeastern Australia, mainly in far western New South Wales, from White Cliffs in the north of the tip of northwestern Victoria in the south, east to Hillston and west through the Darling River basin and Broken Hill into eastern South Australia, growing in colonized brown or red soils in mostly flat country. It forms a dominant component of Acacia loderi shrubland, where it is found with such trees as black oak (Casuarina pauper), inland rosewood (Alectryon oleifolius) and leopardwood (Flindersia maculosa), and an understory of chenopods and grasses. Acacia loderi shrubland has been classified as an Endangered Ecological Community by the New South Wales Government. Key threats include clearing and excessive grazing by livestock.

In the late Victorian Britain an aristocratic politician falls in love with a showgirl. The film is also known by the alternative title Mrs. Loring's Secret. Plot In 1892, showgirls Millie and Rose have a chance encounter with Clive Loring, a politician who invites them to tea. Millie falls for Clive and vows to give up the stage, but his brother Lord Belmont nevertheless disapproves. Going out in public in stage makeup, Millie and Rose are mistaken for prostitutes. And a man Millie spends a few innocent hours with, Jose Martinez, is arrested for a murder. His only chance of being proven innocent is if Millie will provide an alibi, but she denies knowing him, fearing it will reflect poorly on Clive. Lord Belmont's suspicions are confirmed when he attends the trial. Martinez is convicted, but it's obvious he was telling the truth in identifying Millie as the woman he'd been with at the time. Millie is coerced into testifying as a public outcry begins for Clive to resign from Parliament. But despite the uproar, Clive decides to remain true to his love.

Fresco at Paruzzaro, Italy, c. 1518 Intercession of Christ is the Christian belief in the continued intercession of Jesus and his advocacy on behalf of humanity, even after he left the earth.Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 13 by James Hastings and John A. Selbie 2003 page 384 In Christian teachings, the intercession of Christ before God relates to Jesus' anamnesis before God during the Last Supper and the continuing memorial nature of the Eucharistic offering.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: 4 Vol. by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 page 166 From the Christological perspective, the intercession of Christ is distinguished from the Intercession of the Spirit. In the first case Christ takes petitions to the Father in Heaven, in the second case the Comforter (the Spirit) flows from Heaven toward the hearts of believers. Biblical basis The theological basis for the belief in the intercession of Christ is provided in the New Testament. In the Epistle to the Romans (8:34) Saint Paul states: > It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who > is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. This intercession resonates with John 17:22 which refers to the \\"heavenly communion\\" between Christ and God the Father. The First Epistle of John (2:1-2) states: > And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the > righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, > but also for the whole world. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (7:25) the author wrote of the \\"salvation to the uttermost\\" through the continued intercession of Christ:Talking to God: the theology of prayer by Wayne R. Spear 2002 page 55 > Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto > God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. The intercession of Christ in Heaven is seen as a continuation of the prayers and petitions he performed for humanity while on earth, e.g. as in Luke 23:34: \\"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do\\". Christology In Pauline Christology the intercession of Christ has two components, both in the present and at the Last Judgement.Studies in Early Christology by Martin Hengel 2004 page 159 This is expressed in Romans 8:33-34 in terms of \\"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?\\" and \\"Who is he that condemneth?\\", and then in Hebrews 7:25 in terms of the activities of Christ as the High Priest. In Christian teachings, the intercession of Christ before God relates to Jesus' anamnesis before God during the Last Supper and the continuing memorial nature of the Eucharistic offering. In the Christology of salvation, the one time offering of Christ via his willing sacrifice at Calvary is distinguished from, but relates to his continued intercession from Heaven in his role as the High Priest, and his role at the Last Judgement.Toward a christology of Christ the high priest by Michael Keenan Jones 2006 pages 57-58 The notion of intercession by Christ as the Lamb of God relates to the imagery of the Lamb in Revelation 14:1:5 where those who are first saved \\"were purchased from among men\\" through the sacrifice of the lamb: > These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were > purchased from among men, [to be] the firstfruits unto God and unto the > Lamb. From the Christological perspective, the intercession of Christ is distinguished from the Intercession of the Spirit.Reconstructing pastoral theology: a Christological foundation by Andrew Purves 2004 page 122 While 1 John 2:1 states \\"We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\\", John 14:16-17 includes the statement: > And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he > may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot > receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he > abideth with you, and shall be in you. The distinction between the two forms of the advocacy can be interpreted in terms of the direction of the flow: in the first case Christ takes petitions to the Father in Heaven, in the second case the comforter (the Spirit) flows from Heaven toward the hearts of believers.

Playing career A Parramatta junior, Olling won a Second Division premiership with Wentworthville in 1971 before entering the NSWRFL Premiership with the Eastern Suburbs club the following year. There he played for three seasons before moving back to Parramatta. At the end of the 1976 NSWRFL season he was part of a forward pack which included Ray Higgs, Geoff Gerard, Ron Hilditch, Denis Fitzgerald and Ray Price, which lost the Eels' maiden grand final 13‚Äì10 to Manly-Warringah. The following year he played in the drawn grand final with St. George and its replay. In 1977 Olling made headlines when he became the first rugby league player to admit to taking anabolic steroids. It was a six- week course taken under medical supervision in the off-season and was not illegal at the time. During 1978 he was selected to play for New South Wales against Queensland and then became Kangaroo No. 506 when he made his international d√©but against the visiting New Zealand side. At the end of that season Olling was selected to go on the 1978 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, playing in Test matches against both nations. A broken leg reduced the amount of football Olling played in 1980 and he left Sydney. Coaching career Olling captain-coached Temora in 1981. He later moved to Brisbane and replaced Darryl van der Velde as coach the Redcliffe Dolphins, spending the 1988 and 1989 seasons in the role. He was then replaced by Mark Murray.

He lived in exile in Paris for a while, returning to Italy for reasons of health, and dying in the psychiatric hospital in Nocera Inferiore. Early life Covelli was born into an aristocratic family in Trani (Apulia). He received his secondary education at a seminary in Molfetta (where he was in the same class as Cafiero), but after studying law at Naples University and then in Heidelberg and Berlin (where he studied under Eugen D√ºhring), he moved towards socialism, leaving his bourgeois origins behind him. Activism His extensive knowledge of German socialist literature (D√ºhring, Marx, etc.) was fundamental in introducing the ideas of \\"scientific socialism\\" into his own country, particularly through his 1874 work L‚Äôeconomia politica e la scienza, one of the earliest pieces of socialist theoretical writings in Italian.Masini, Pier Carlo, \\"Emilio COVELLI\\", in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 30, Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana.

Alberto M. Ghisalberti (ed.), Rome 1984 becoming an important influence within it and also contributing to the newspaper, \\"La Campana\\". Together with Carlo Cafiero, Errico Malatesta and Andrea Costa, he was instrumental in moving the Italian anarchist movement away from the collectivism it professed in the days of Mikhail Bakunin in order to adopt the communist formula \\"From each according to ability, to each according to need\\".Damiani, Franco, Carlo Cafiero nella storia del primo socialismo italiano, Jaca Book, Milano 1974. At the 1876 congress of the Italian Federation of the International in Florence- Tosi, it was these four who were responsible for the adoption of the anarchist communist programme. In 1877, together with Malatesta, Cafiero and others, he participated in the unsuccessful Benevento uprising, following which he moved to Genoa, where he founded branches of the International. After a spell in prison he left the country, moving to London first, where he launched and edited a magazine, \\"Redattori della Lotta!\\", and then Geneva, where he founded the \\"I Malfattori\\" magazine, before returning once more to Italy. Together with most of the anarchist movement, he was to turn to more radical methods of propaganda by the deed in the 1880s and was forced to live on the run for several years, suffering a mental breakdown in 1884. After his release from the Como psychiatric hospital, he moved abroad, living at various times in Switzerland, Greece and Turkey. The last 23 years of his life were spent in a series of mental institutions and he eventually died in the same hospital as Cafiero, in Nocera Inferiore.

He also made two further first-class appearances for the Minor Counties in this decade, against the touring Zimbabweans in 1985 and the touring New Zealanders in 1986. All the while he continued to play Minor counties cricket for Durham throughout this decade, which included making his MCCA Knockout Trophy debut in 1983 against Cheshire. He made twelve further List A appearances for Durham, with his final appearance coming in the 1990 NatWest Trophy against Lancashire. In total, Riddell made twenty List A appearances for Durham, scoring a total of 347 runs at an average of 18.26, with a high score of 52. He remained Durham captain throughout the 1980s, and finally retired from county cricket at the end of the 1990 season, having played 175 Minor Counties Championship matches and fourteen MCCA Knockout Trophy matches. Under his captaincy Durham won the Minor Counties Championship three times (1980, 1981 and 1984) and the MCCA Knockout Trophy in 1985. Two years after his retirement, Durham had been granted first-class status and were admitted to the County Championship.

A Cheshire eyepiece or Cheshire collimator is a simple tool that helps aligning the optical axes of the mirrors or lenses of a telescope, a process called collimation. It consists of a peephole to be inserted into the focuser in place of the eyepiece. Through a lateral opening, ambient light falls on the brightly painted oblique back of the peephole. Images of this bright surface are reflected by the mirrors or lenses of the telescope and can thus be seen by a person peering through the hole. A Cheshire eyepiece contains no lenses or other polished optical surfaces. The tool was first described by F. J. Cheshire in 1921.Cheshire, F.

(, a Technicolor film in Techniscope also known as 7 Women for the MacGregors) is a 1967 Italian spaghetti Western directed by Franco Giraldi (here credited as Frank Garfield). It is the immediate sequel of Seven Guns for the MacGregors, still directed by Giraldi. The film has the same cast as its predecessor except for Manuel Zarzo and Robert Woods, who refused the role due to his conflicts with the leading actress Agata Flori, the wife of producer Dario Sabatello. Plot summary The elder MacGregors wakes up in the middle of the night to take out a chest of gold ingots and coins from the hiding place and bury it outside their house while being secretly watched by a bandit spy. On the day of the engagement party between Gregor MacGregor and Rosita Carson the bandit Maldonado, with his gang, came and robbed the MacGregors of their gold which the elder MacGregors buried. They left a note, purporting to be from Frank James, in the hole where the chest of gold was buried. So, the MacGregor brothers throw themselves in pursuit of Frank James. When they found Frank who is now a run down old man, they are told that he was framed by Maldonado. So, they set out again but this time to find Maldonado. Upon finding out that Gregor has gone with the traveling medicine man and his daughter, Dolly, to Maldonado's hide out, Rosita out of jealousy ride out to confront Dolly; ending up being kept as a prisoner of the outlaws together with Gregor who came back to rescue her after he and his brothers managed to regain the stolen gold. The other MacGregor brothers also came back to Maldonado's hide out to rescue Gregor and Rosita. They escaped but are later trapped in an empty cargo train wagon. Soon they are rescued by their parents, the Donovans, a band of Apaches, and other cowboys. During a fight with Gregor Maldonado fell off the engine when the engine crashed into a stationary train cargo wagon and is killed by the run away engine.

R, G are weights used by the wake-sleep algorithm to modify data inside the layers. The wake-sleep algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm for a stochastic multilayer neural network. The algorithm adjusts the parameters so as to produce a good density estimator. There are two learning phases, the ‚Äúwake‚Äù phase and the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù phase, which are performed alternately. It was first designed as a model for brain functioning using variational Bayesian learning. After that, the algorithm was adapted to machine learning. It can be viewed as a way to train a Helmholtz Machine. It can also be used in Deep Belief Networks (DBN).  Description  The wake-sleep algorithm is visualized as a stack of layers containing representations of data. Layers above represent data from the layer below it. Actual data is placed below the bottom layer, causing layers on top of it to become gradually more abstract. Between each pair of layers there is a recognition weight and generative weight, which are trained to improve reliability during the algorithm runtime. The wake-sleep algorithm is convergent and can be stochastic if alternated appropriately.  Training  Training consists of two phases ‚Äì the ‚Äúwake‚Äù phase and the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù phase.  The \\"wake\\" phase  Neurons are fired by recognition connections (from what would be input to what would be output). Generative connections (leading from outputs to inputs) are then modified to increase probability that they would recreate the correct activity in the layer below ‚Äì closer to actual data from sensory input.  The \\"sleep\\" phase  The process is reversed in the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù phase ‚Äì neurons are fired by generative connections while recognition connections are being modified to increase probability that they would recreate the correct activity in the layer above ‚Äì further to actual data from sensory input.  Potential risks  Variational Bayesian learning is based on probabilities. There is a chance that an approximation is performed with mistakes, damaging further data representations. Another downside pertains to complicated or corrupted data samples, making it difficult to infer a representational pattern. The wake-sleep algorithm has been suggested not to be powerful enough for the layers of the inference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior distribution of latent variables.

It is the Giraldi's second film after Seven Guns for the MacGregors. The film represents the cinematographical debut for Jack Betts, here credited as Hunt Powers, and it is also Erno Crisa's last film. Plot Rocco ‚Äì also called the man with two faces ‚Äì is visited by Pinkerton, who wants him to investigate the disappearance, and possible kidnapping, of some soldiers. Rocco declines, as he has a good life teaching women self- defence. When Pinkerton is assassinated, Rocco changes his mind and goes to Snake Valley disguised as a doctor. He uses narcotic gas to loosen the tongues, and gets help from a sidekick and two women at the saloon. He is disclosed and heavily beaten, but eventually frees the hostages, while the responsible big boss gets killed.  Cast   Production   Filming  It was filmed in Tabernas, in the town of El Fraile, in the lodge Los Arcos and in Almer√≠a.  Music  With his modernist sheet music, Luis Bacalov created the characters of Sugar Colt, Django, I quattro del pater noster, Chapaqua, Lo chiamavano King and The Man Called Noon. Reception Sugar Colt was generally well received by critics, and Tullio Kezich defined it as a \\"little masterpiece\\". Over 40 years after it was made, Sugar Colt was screened at the 2007 Venice Film Festival in a spaghetti western retrospective. Director Franco Giraldi and star Jack Betts were in attendance. In his investigation of narrative structures in Spaghetti Western films, Fridlund ranges Sugar Colt among Spaghetti Westerns heavily influenced by secret-agent films, because the hero is shown in company with beautiful women, works to uncover a mystery and - unlike the protagonists in A Fistful of Dollars and Django - does not have any complicating secondary motive.

Noting that Cicely Courtneidge had come from a theatrical background and that her acting skills were adequate for the stage, Greene described her aspect in this film as \\"fling[ing] her facial contortions to the back of the gallery\\", and expressed sorrow that so many of the stage's most capable comedians were today \\"going the Pagliacci way\\".

Royal Avenue is a street in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In the Cathedral Quarter in the heart of Belfast city centre, as well as being identified with the more recent Smithfield and Union Quarter, it has been the city's principal shopping thoroughfare since its establishment in 1881. Today Royal Avenue is one of Belfast's main commercial centres and is home to the ¬£40 million shopping complex Westfield CastleCourt. The top end of Royal Avenue was formerly named John Street and the bottom end was named Hercules Street. Location A view of upper Royal Avenue, 2011. On the right is the Belfast Central Library, which opened in 1888. Royal Avenue is in the Cathedral Quarter. Beginning from the Donegall Place junction with Castle Place and Castle Street, which is the hub of Belfast city centre, the road runs north to the North Street crossing where the former Bank of Ireland once stood. A fire in summer of 2018 caused the front part of the building to burn leaving only the back of the building standing. Royal Avenue then angles northeast to the Donegall Street intersection continuing in a northeasterly direction as York Street. Looking south on Royal Avenue, there is an imposing vista of Belfast City Hall and Donegall Square. The Anglican St. Anne's Cathedral in Donegall Street is adjacent to its northern end. It has many Victorian and Edwardian buildings, including the Belfast Central Library and the Haymarket Building, along with newer, modern structures and shopping complexes. It serves as the headquarters for the Belfast Telegraph newspaper. Like the rest of the city centre, Royal Avenue has seen much redevelopment since the Troubles officially ended in 1998, and the city embarked on a major urban renewal project. History Royal Avenue, 1898, viewed from Castle Junction. Its top end formerly named John Street, and the bottom end Hercules Street, Royal Avenue was established in 1881.\\"Belfast History Through the Years\\". Rushlight Magazine Since that time, it has served as Belfast's principal shopping thoroughfare, and today it is lined with many leading department stores and top name shops. The city's most prestigious and elegant hotel, the Grand Central Hotel, was on the street before it was demolished in the late 1980s to make room for the ¬£40 million shopping complex, Westfield CastleCourt. The site on which it was built by John Robb was originally intended to be a central railway terminus; however, due to hesitation on the part of town councillors, Robb constructed a 200-room luxury hotel instead. The hotel, which first opened its doors on 1 June 1893, became the \\"social hub of Belfast\\" and provided a temporary home for many illustrious guests, including King Leopold III of Belgium, Sir Winston Churchill, Gene Autry, Bob Hope, The Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. The latter's presence inside the hotel in the mid-1960s nearly provoked a riot as hundreds of fans gathered in Royal Avenue to catch a glimpse of the bandmembers, who watched the chaotic scene taking place below from the hotel's upper windows.\\"The Grand Central Hotel, Royal Avenue\\" . Richard Graham. 6 November 2008. A year after the hotel closed down in 1971, it was converted into a fortified military barracks serving as battalion headquarters for regiments in the British Army that were based in Belfast city centre.Chartres, John; Henshaw, Bert; Dewar, Michael (1986). Northern Ireland Scrapbook. London: Arms and Armour Press. p.65 The former hotel's Bridal Suite became the Army's operational centre for over ten years. Royal Avenue was filmed from a horse-drawn tramcar on 27 May 1901. The film is extant and shows the street bustling with shoppers, workers, trams, carts, bicycles, and wagons. During the 1907 Belfast Dock strike, Royal Avenue was used as one of the principal thoroughfares for the passage of traction engines driven by blackleg carters to deliver goods from the docks into the city centre. The blacklegs had to be escorted by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) to prevent them from being attacked by flying pickets. On 29 October 1935, Royal Avenue was packed with thousands of mourners as the funeral cortege of Edward Carson made its way along the street. The road was hit by bombs in the Belfast Blitz when the German Luftwaffe bombarded the city on the night of 15/16 April 1941 in an aerial attack that involved up to 200 bombers and lasted for six and a half hours; many of the buildings sustained considerable damage, although the destruction was much less severe than what was wrought in nearby Donegall and York streets. The Germans returned to bombard the city in another raid on the night of 4/5 May. Royal Avenue was spared from the excessive damage visited upon adjacent streets which were gutted by fire. It is one of the traditional routes used by the Orange Order on their annual 12 July parade. The Troubles The former Grand Central Hotel, which was converted into a British Army barracks in 1972, was the site of many bombing attacks during The Troubles. Throughout the Troubles, Royal Avenue was targeted by the Provisional IRA due to its economic importance as a commercial zone and the presence of the British Army military barracks. The barracks itself was bombed many times in the mid-1970s, despite the anti- rocket metal mesh put up to fortify the edifice. Security gates placed at the junction of Royal Avenue and Donegall Place were closed every evening at 6:00 p.m., sealing off the area by what was known locally as a \\"ring of steel\\". On 25 November 1975 when Francis Crossan, a 34-year-old Catholic civilian, was abducted by the notorious Shankill Butchers gang, themselves members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), from Library Street, a side street that leads immediately off Royal Avenue at the Central Library. Crossan was heading towards Royal Avenue when he was hit over the head with a wheel brace, then dragged into a waiting black taxi where he sustained a vicious beating before being fatally stabbed. He was found, with his throat deeply slashed, in an entry near Bisley Street on the Shankill Road. Crossan became the first victim of the lethal gang, which was led by Lenny Murphy.Sutton Index of Deaths 1975.Dillon, Martin (1989).

The centre occupies the former site of the Grand Central Hotel. Around 2008 calls came from certain quarters, including former Lord Mayor of Belfast Jim Rodgers, for the pedestrianisation of Royal Avenue following a number of road traffic accidents on the street including a Dunmurry teenager, Ciara Park, being knocked down and killed.Latest city centre accident sparks call for pedestrian zone.

He made seven further first-class appearances for Middlesex between 1905 and 1907, playing his final match against Nottinghamshire in the 1907 County Championship. During this period he met little success, scoring 86 runs with a high score of 23. He also took 2 wickets, which came at a bowling average of 42.50. Hendren moved to the north of England, where he made his debut for Durham in the 1910 Minor Counties Championship against Norfolk.

He claimed the wicket of Harry Dean in this match, while with the bat he scored 15 runs in Middlesex's first- innings, before being dismissed by Charlie Hallows, while in their second- innings he was unbeaten on 8, with the match ending in a draw. This match represented his final first-class appearance, he returned to Durham in 1921, playing in two Minor Counties Championship matches against Northumberland and the Yorkshire Second XI. He later stood as a first-class umpire between 1931 and 1957, standing in 390 matches. He was three months away from his 75th birthday when he stood in his final match. He died at Paddington, London on 29 May 1962.

Life He practised below the bar as a special pleader at the Inner Temple and on the western circuit. In 1824 Hammond was examined by a select parliamentary committee appointed to consider the expediency of consolidating and amending the criminal law of England; and he submitted a draft measure for that purpose, which was printed by order of the House of Commons. It was later developed into a regular code, and formed the basis of Peel's Acts (the Larceny Laws Repeal and Consolidation, Criminal Procedure and Malicious Injuries to Property, and Remedies against the Hundred Consolidation Acts of 1827 (7 & 8 Geo 4 cc 27 - 31). The code itself, with A Treatise on the Consolidation of the Criminal Law, was printed by order of Robert Peel, then Home Secretary, between 1825 and 1829, 8 vols, folio. Hammond was also consulted by the commissioners for the revision of the laws of the State of New York in 1825, to whom he communicated a pamphlet entitled Reflections on the Criminal Law.

Before the war Daniel Mr√≥z obtained his baccalaureate degree and for two years studied at the School of Artistic Crafts in Krak√≥w. Immediately after the Second World War started with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, his father was arrested by the Germans for publishing a Polish newspaper without permission of the just-installed German occupations authorities. Soon afterwards, in the winter of 1940, his mother, unable to cope without her partner and father of her sons, died. In February 1941, his father, who was one of the first prisoners of Auschwitz-Birkenau, died there of illness and exhaustion. Official cause of his death was pneumonia. His ashes were sent by the German authorities to his sons for the burial.  Studies  After the war, in 1945, Daniel Mr√≥z illegally crossed the German border in order to find his former girlfriend, who had been taken to Ravensbr√ºck. He was going to stay abroad, but eventually he made up his mind to go back to Poland. Upon his return to Krak√≥w, he studied from 1946 at Fine Arts Academy. One of his professors, Marian Eile, had most influence on the young artist. He invited Daniel Mr√≥z to work as an illustrator and a graphic designer of the popular Krak√≥w weekly Przekr√≥j, of which Eile was founder and editor-in-chief. Mr√≥z has been working and studying, finally to complete the Academy's Graphic Department requirements and receive the diploma with honors in 1952.  Artistic career  Illustration by Daniel Mr√≥z for the short story by S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek \\"The Elephant\\", 1957 In years 1951-1978 Mr√≥z worked as an illustrator and cover designer for \\"Przekr√≥j\\", creating a distinct style, full of humor and references to the art of the past century and being one of the elements which created popularity in Poland at the time weekly magazine. At the same time Daniel Mr√≥z worked as a theater designer creating decors for different theater companies in Poland. He also had several shows of his work in Poland and abroad. But the real international recognition was brought to him by the covers and illustrations for the books of Stanislaw Lem and S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek. While Daniel Mr√≥z illustrated many books by several other writers such as Franz Kafka, Jules Verne, Jerzy Szaniawski, Jan Stoberski, Ludwik Jerzy Kern, and Stanis≈Çaw Jerzy Lec, illustrations for several Lem and Mro≈ºek books became responsible for his popularity in Poland and abroad. These illustrations - a true graphic interpretation of the written word - become an essential element for the readers of these books and as such were reprinted in their numerous editions, all over the world.  Private life  Daniel Mr√≥z married Alina Nieniewska, a colleague from his studies at Fine Arts Academy in Krak√≥w. He had one daughter - ≈Åucja Mr√≥z-Raynoch, also an artist, author of animated short films and a graphic designer.  The value of Daniel Mr√≥z work  Daniel Mr√≥z's work remained highly valued. Created in the difficult era of Communist Poland, when realistic works were promoted by the authorities, these surreal black and white drawings and collages inspired several artists in Poland and abroad. In winter of 2011 Google's Doodle repeated his unique artistic style.

Alongside Lazarus Stipiƒá, a librarian at the public library in Subotica, she was one of the few prominent figures from the Bunjevci. Biography Mara Malagurski was born in Subotica. Like many female school students in Subotica (Subotica City Museum) she originates from the Bunjevac Malagurski-ƒÜurƒçiƒá family. Her grandfather, Ice Malagurski, was the first president of the Bunjevci cultural association \\"Puƒçke Kasine\\", founded in 1878. Her father was named Josip and her mother Hristina (born Stantiƒá). Malagurski was educated at The ≈†trosmajerovo Institute in ƒêakovo, and then moved on to higher education at a school for women in Subotica. In addition, she studied English in London. When the Grand National Assembly was held in Novi Sad (1918), she was one of the seven female delegates, and at the same time one of the members of the delegation that opted for the annexation of Vojvodina into the Kingdom of Serbia, and not the State of Slovenes, Croats or Serbs. She married senator and professor Dragoslav Djordjevic in 1919. She relocated to Belgrade in the beginning of 1929. In Subotica she founded the Bunjevac Catholic Women's Society and the Dilettante Society (1911). In addition, she took part in the development of the Bunjevac Center of Educational Heritage (1927), and as its first president organized exhibitions of folk crafts, theater and so on. She led Subotians to Belgrade to appear in traditional robes in front of the royal family and Radio Belgrade. She was a board member of the Circle of Serbian Sisters and after the end of World War II, a member of the Association of Writers of Serbia. In the first half of the 20th century together with some other pro-Serbian Bunjevac authors, Mara ƒêorƒëeviƒá-Malagurski in several publications and newspaper articles presented theses which deny that Bunjevci belong to the Croatian nation and that Bunjevci are in fact fourth South Slavic tribe.Bu≈°iƒá, Kre≈°imir; (2009) Putopisi subotiƒçkog biskupa.

One of the scenes of the S√ºleymann√¢me. The S√ºleymann√¢me (lit. \\"Book of Suleiman\\") is an illustration of Suleiman the Magnificent's life and achievements. In 65 scenes the miniature paintings are decorated with gold, depicting battles, receptions, hunts and sieges. Written by Fethullah Arifi √áelebi in Persian verse, and illustrated by five unnamed artists, the S√ºleymann√¢me was the fifth volume of the first illustrated history of the Ottoman dynasty. It was written in the manner of the Iranian Shahnameh epic. The original version of the S√ºleymann√¢me lies in the Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul and there is another manuscript in Astan Quds Razavi, the manuscript numbered as manuscript 4249 in Astan Quds Razavi library. The S√ºleymann√¢me is the fifth volume of the Shahnama-yi Al-i Osman (The Shahnama of the House of Osman) written by Arif Celebi. It is an account of Suleiman's first 35 years of his reign as ruler from 1520 to 1555. The portrayal of Suleiman's reign is idealized, as it not only includes the last exceptional events in world history, but also ends the timeline begun at creation with this perceived perfect ruler. The manuscript itself measures 25.4 by 37 centimeters and has 617 folios. In addition, it is organized in chronological order. This manuscript had a much more private use compared to other pieces of art produced for the Ottoman elite. The S√ºleymann√¢me has 69 illustrated pages since four topics out of the 65 represented are double-folio images. The cultural and political context of this work is Persian. This work is important because it allows for the acceptance of the sultan presenting himself in a divine image as well as presenting the ideas and expectations of the court. Arifi wrote in this epic poem 30,000 verses.  The ≈ûehname (Shahnama) model  The S√ºleymann√¢me, while a work of art, bore political function as well. The S√ºleymann√¢me falls under the ≈ûehname, or ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Book‚Äù category. The primary function of the Sehname type was to document a complete Ottoman history, legitimizing and exalting the patron sultan in the process. They were viewed as symbols of Ottoman court culture. Creators of ≈ûehnames, or ‚Äú≈ûehnameci,‚Äù were salaried appointees; under Suleiman, the creator of ‚Äúcourt historiographer‚Äù was established, pointing to the courtly and political importance of ≈ûehnameci. ≈ûehnamecis were not considered major historians, rather were recognized for their literary skill; ≈ûehnames called for a melding of historical documentation and literary composition, making them difficult to categorize. The texts had to be approved by the Sultan and court officials (the grand vizier and religious scholars) before they were included. Approval ensured all texts met a high literary standard and accurately matched the content of illustrations. The intense vetting process allowed the sultan and advisors to project a carefully crafted image through the text. Despite this attention to image, the intended audience for ≈ûehnames were the sultan himself, his court and advisors. Luxury manuscripts were considered valuable collectors items, so they were not intended to leave the palace confines. Often the sultan would have ≈ûehname texts read aloud for a court audience, intending to inspire and educate future Ottoman statesmen. For the Sultan and his circle, ≈ûehnames were intended to reinforce the power and status of the Ottoman Empire. For a broader Ottoman elite, ≈ûehnames were intended to instill and understanding of Ottoman identity. For the general population, ≈ûehnames were intended to symbolize the Sultan's power, evidence of his fulfillment of patronage often associated with and expected of a powerful ruler. Generally, ≈ûehnames are associated with extravagance and power. In addition to legitimizing the Sultan's reign, ≈ûehnames were commissioned typically during times of turmoil, intended to bolster dynastic prestige and justify the ruler.  Political function of the S√ºleymann√¢me The main purpose of this manuscript was to paint an ideal public image for Sultan Suleiman and his court. It focuses on portraying Suleiman as a military figure, but also serving justice as a ruler. For example, the image of Suleiman's enthronement in the S√ºleymann√¢me serves as a way to show Suleiman's military role and having order of the court. The idea of a just leader is exemplified by the numerous paintings of his court receptions with other ambassadors, but also through his compassion for his enemies and showing his power and Ottoman superiority. Suleiman is likened to previous, legendary rulers and heroes. His deeds are emphasized to compare him to these historical figures and it is because of these deeds he is so great. The similarities between the prophet-kings in the Anbiyanama (Book of Prophets) and Suleiman's worries creates a direct portrayal of Suleiman as one of the aforementioned prophet-kings in the first volume of Arif Celebi's Shahnama-yi Al-i Osman. This portrayal is not meant to devalue the status of the prophets to a sultan; however, it elevates Suleiman's status, especially at a time when his image was suffering. The historical context of this work coincides with Suleiman's failing image due to his old age, but more importantly, his negative image as he had his son, Mustafa, killed in 1553, who was popular with the population. This work can be seen as a move to elevate this ruler's image as his own actions decreased his popularity. A relationship between Suleiman and God is made which functions in two ways. First, it shows him as the Creator, but also as a divine figure. Second, his position was not only approved by God himself, but he was chosen to rule by God. Adding to Suleiman's religious significance, he is written as the last reformer of religion and depicted as the image of the Perfect Man, only second to the prophet Muhammad. Certain images in the manuscript were executed as a way to show Suleiman's importance as one of the last religious and political leaders and were all approved by the sultan himself. Some of these images include Suleiman's portrayal as the second Solomon on a gold throne and as a saint with a nimbus surrounding his head. Again, Suleiman's reign is legitimized as divine through the combination of his legacy with the histories of other great rulers from other traditions. With that being said, Arif even goes as far to declare Suleiman's superiority over both past Ottoman and world rulers. Rulers of the past all possessed the right kingly characteristics, but in regards to Suleiman, none of them compared to him. Even in the realms of religion, Suleiman's faith and belief in God surpasses the rest of these rulers. By analyzing the order of volumes in Arif's Shahanama, Arif's main purpose is in placing Suleiman in a special position in world history as it started initially from Creation.  Artistic production under Suleiman  Suleiman's generous, adamant patronage to the arts helped cultivate a golden age of Ottoman culture. Suleiman employed male artists and artisans of European, Islamic, and Turkish origins, which forged a visual language consisting of a synthesis of traditions, particularly in architecture and manuscript production. The Ehl-i Hiref (Community of the Talented), a highly organized group of imperial artisans worked on court commissions. Because of the level of organization of arts production in the court, designs created for the court became part of the arts vocabulary across disciplines. The Cemaat-i Nakka≈üan (Society of Painters), one of the units in the Ehl-i Hiref, was in charge of decorating the manuscripts commissioned for imperial libraries. The unit was hierarchical, with members utilizing styles from across the empire, but particularly Tabriz masters and their trainees between 1520 and the 1540s. Nakka≈üane artists strongly influenced the decorative styles of the time, for example, the Saz style composed of naturalistic imagery. The nakka≈üane created hundreds of manuscripts consisting of classic tales, poetry, paintings, calligraphy, and illuminations. Illustrated histories like the S√ºleymann√¢me were made to exalt the lives of sultans or the festivities or campaigns of the empire, and became the primary work of the nakka≈üane after 1560. Though the S√ºleymann√¢me reflects historical events, it is not considered an accurate historical source due to its exaltation of the ruler, being an artistic interpretation of the Ottoman court under Suleiman. These manuscripts were produced for private use by members of the dynasty to emphasize the worthiness of their rule and status. Arif Celebi There is not substantial information on Arif Celebi's life, but the knowledge we have on him comes from biographical stories written by many 16th century writers. His mother was the daughter of the Sufi sheikh and religious scholar Ibrahim Gulseni. Arif Celebi was very close to his grandfather and was said to be dearer to him than Gulseni's own son. Arif Celebi's father, Dervis Celebi, according to other accounts, was a man of Persian elite and Arif states in the S√ºleymann√¢me that his father was from the city of Abadan. His father makes an appearance in the S√ºleymann√¢me again as an elderly figure where Arif pays respect to his father with lines of appreciation. His family came from a background of religion, intellect and politics. It is not known if he had siblings nor if he was married or if he had children. Around 1545, Arifi Celebi arrived at the Ottoman court and was commissioned in 1550 to write about the Ottoman dynasty in Persian due to the fact that Suleiman enjoyed the previous verses that Arif Celebi had given him. Arif Celebi's Shahnama was to be used as a means to ‚Äúcreate a common culture and a shared imperial identity.‚Äù For his project, Arif Celebi adopted visual styles from Firdawsi's Shahnama that detailed the mythic history of Iran. Arif's service in the Ottoman court for Suleiman is said to have started when he arrived to the capital and it is assumed that his arrival correlated with Elkas Mirza's arrival to Istanbul in 1547, a Safavid prince who found refuge with Suleiman. It is mentioned again in the S√ºleymann√¢me that his father served the Ottoman Empire as a diplomatic envoy and most likely worked for more than one royal person. Due to his familial background, it is very probable Arif had a high level of education and he was said to have a great skill in the sciences. He studied with the ulama (learned men), signifying that he got training from many medrese professors. Arif worked in both Turkish and Persian, but viewing the several verses he wrote, Persian was more his forte. Looking at the art that was produced under him, he was more than just a mere writer who ignored the illustrations of his work. He made many choices thematically and stylistically in the illustrations to accompany his writing instead of assigning what to be painted. Despite this, he still had to adhere to the opinions of both Suleiman and some of the members of his court. What we know of his skill in the arts mainly comes from his time as sehnameci. Some other works we can credit to Arif is the Ravzat al-Usak and his drafts for the Imperial Scroll. In addition, he is associated in creating an epic of 2,000 stichs about Hadim Suleyman's Pasa's expedition to India.  The illustrations  The S√ºleymann√¢me is a product of careful collaboration between artists and writers. The rendering of images is suggestive of one hand due to overall visual uniformity. The illustrations generally prioritizes concentrated, opaque pigments over light washes of color. Featured colors are often unorthodox and fantastical, including pinks, purples, bright blues and greens. Present throughout the manuscript are detailed geometric motifs, most visible on buildings, textiles and in evocations of grass, water and ground. The work exhibits fine detail and precision and crisply drawn lines. To promote the storytelling nature of the book, the illustrations often feature registers to break up sections of the composition; one section may be devoted to an enemy group and another to the Ottomans themselves, for example. Animals in the S√ºleymann√¢me vary between being depicted with traditional colors and being depicted with outlandish colors. In ‚ÄúDeath of Huseyin Pasa,‚Äù the horses are more naturalistic, painted in primarily black and brown. On the contrary, ‚ÄúDeath of Ahmed Pasa‚Äù features a blue speckled horse, a far cry from a horse's actual likeness. The S√ºleymann√¢me features efforts to differentiate between individuals through slight variation in facial features. Often, an attempt to feature a specific figure is made. In ‚ÄúExecution of Prisoners‚Äù Suleiman is easily identifiable because he is the largest figure in the image and he is centrally located. Less important figures are rendered more generally, often mirror images of others in their mass, sometimes with minor facial changes. This holds true for depictions of court attendants and larger armies, both of Ottomans and foreigners. Foreigners are typically differentiated by their style of dress. One can tell Ottomans and non-Ottomans apart through their headwear; Ottomans are shown wearing white turbans with red at the top and can be found in every illustration. In ‚ÄúArrival of the Austrian Ambassadors,‚Äù Austrians are shown wearing red and maroon caps and in ‚ÄúDeath of Kalender,‚Äù the rebel Kalender and his men are shown wearing white turbans with cinched midsections.  Themes and symbolism  The significance of the number 10 is prevalent throughout the S√ºleymann√¢me in the metaphysical context. This number is used to show Suleiman's significance as a ruler because he was born in the 10th century and was the 10th ruler in his lineage. The decimal system is used as an allegory to show how the time period of the 10th century was time used to prepare for Suleiman's perfection. The reason for the significance of the number ten is because all the numbers preceding it can be increased by one while maintaining its one digit places. Once 10 is reached, it spills over to the other decimal unit, beginning at 0 which is a starting point as well as representing nothingness. This effect of ‚Äúspilling over‚Äù can be seen as another metaphor for water, specifically the movement of waves. The image of a wave can explain the increasing numeric units as well as the numbers becoming one whole, larger unit. Simply put, the relationship of increasing numbers and waves are parallel. Water is a part of the wave and they are all a part of a larger complex of a body of water while separate, smaller numbers create a new, larger number. In addition, a wave and a body of water with its several units is also a representation of God and His existence in every unit. Arif then relates this to Noah and the Great Flood, connecting the decimal system to the gathering of animals pairs and including religious references again. Many folios in the S√ºleymann√¢me include depictions of trees; these depictions are not merely pieces of decoration for the manuscript, but are used as symbols. One purpose of the trees can be as an organizational function. In the folio with the confrontation of both Ottoman and Austrian forces, a tree is painted at the center top of the page. The tree is used as a division of these two sides and, including the rocks at the foot of the tree, identifies the two different fighting sides. The use of trees is signified in three different ways. One way is the relationship and position of the tree associated with the figure portrayed on the page. Another way is as any anomaly that contrasts with other components of the folio or makes the tree stand out. The more obvious sign given as showing the trees as symbols rather than decoration is references of it in the text. In many of the folios, the trees are accompanied with water near its roots. This relationship draws the viewer's attention towards the tree and the positioning of these two images aids in this as well. The positioning also incites a connection to be made between the tree and the protagonist on the specific page. In later pages of the manuscript, it is more common to see images of a tree with water accumulated at the foot, as seen in the reception of Queen Isabella and Infant King Stephen. The specific representation of a tree cut down the middle by water is said to represent death. One such example of this symbol is on the folio with the depiction of the Battle of G√ºns. An Ottoman cavalry, Turahan Bey, drags a Habsburg soldier. The tree indicates not only the dreary future of this soldier, but also the current state of a dead soldier who is lying right next to the tree. Many of these trees have a direct association with Suleiman. The symbols behind these trees are likely to represent a cultural aspect of the Ottoman courtly elite, which explains their frequency and link with Suleiman. The tree with water curving at its base is said to depict the Tree of Being. If this is true, again we have another reference to Suleiman and his divinity. If this not the case, nevertheless, the tree's association with life, Creation, and Muhammad is still prevalent. = Death = The S√ºleymann√¢me features various death scenes. These deaths are typically of foreigners in battles against the Ottomans. The death scenes are not overtly gruesome; there is no excess of blood nor extreme brutality done to the body. Rather, the S√ºleymann√¢me offers a stylized representation of death. In ‚ÄòDeath of Canberdi Gazali,‚Äù Canberdi Gazali falls into the river with a spear being driven into his body. While his facial expression is mildly suggest a scream, his body appears as an abstracted form with a spear protruding out and is not represented of a person on the brink of death in anguish. Surrounding him are ‚Äúfollowers, dead and dying from their wounds‚Äù- while mild spurts of blood are drawn at their sides, it is difficult to distinguish if they are dead or sleeping. The subject of death itself is often obscured by compositional arrangement. In ‚ÄúExecution of Prisoners‚Äù the Ottoman execution of Hungarian war prisoners is showcased, with onlookers including soldiers and officers off in the distance. It is difficult to tell exactly where the prisoners are being executed because the scene is so busy. Distracting elements include the ‚Äúrich floral patterns‚Äù employed and the clusters of surrounding figures. The ‚ÄúDeath of Ahmed Pasa,‚Äù focusing on the slaying of rebel leader Ahmed Pasa by Ayas Mehmed Pasa, also obscures death through a complicated composition. Ahmed Pasa's severed head is not immediately visible and almost blends into the ground it lays on. These scenes of enemy deaths focus their attention on the killers instead of the killed, emphasizing the power the Ottomans held over their enemies through these victories. Similar death scenes include ‚ÄúDeath of Kalender‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath of Contender Mustafa.‚Äù =Court receptions= The S√ºleymann√¢me also features scenes of court life, specifically featuring the Ottomans‚Äô interactions with ambassadors/foreigners and entertainment within the Ottoman court. In ‚ÄúArrival of the Austrian Ambassadors,‚Äù five Austrian envoys discuss with an Ottoman official in an ornately decorated space. The composition is diagonally oriented, giving the scene an uneasy sense. The scene presents the intricacies of court proceedings with foreign ambassadors and promotes a thoughtful, detailed handling of foreign affairs. The ‚ÄúReception of the Iranian Ambassador‚Äù highlights the ‚Äúsuperiority of the Ottoman sultan over his opponents‚Äù as an inscription above the throne declares ‚Äúthe Sultan, the shadow of God,‚Äù likening Suleiman to godlike figure. This superiority is further emphasized through registers, as Suleiman and his advisors are in a higher quadrant than the Safavid ambassadors. Illustrations are also utilized to outline political proceedings and court practices within the Ottoman Empire. In ‚ÄúMeeting of the Divan,‚Äù Ottoman scribes, viziers, translators and a variety of courtly officials are shown inside the structure their court meetings were held in. The Divan was the ‚Äúhighest administrative organ of the state,‚Äù of which the sultan was the head. Depicted in a bird's eye view, all proceedings inside and outside the Divan are on display, providing transparency into specific happenings within the court. Additionally, scenes showcase lavish celebrations, some specifically held for Suleiman; in ‚ÄúSuleiman Entertained,‚Äù the officials of Edirne are holding a lavish banquet in Suleiman's honor, where he is shown in the presence of musicians, singers, dancers and courtly officials. Suleiman is portrayed as a powerful ruler worthy of praise and celebration, and the Ottomans are portrayed as prestigious enough to throw large scale banquets. =Conquest and combat scenes= Sultan Suleiman during the Siege of Rhodes Of the 69 paintings in the S√ºleymann√¢me, about a dozen are scenes of combat ensued by Suleiman's territorial conquests. Though there are stylistic differences between painters because they were made by different artists, each captures a specific ‚Äúpsychological symbolism‚Äù of the various events that ultimately display the Ottoman perspective and the power of Suleiman. ‚ÄúSiege of Belgrade‚Äù emphasizes the grandness of the Ottoman camp through geometric decoration of the tents and barriers on the left half image, with the Sultan sitting enthroned and surrounded by a decorative tent. His soldiers also solemnly gaze at the destruction of Belgrade, where clusters of men lament their losses. The composition of the right image is cluttered by architecture and trees, whereas the left scene of the Ottoman army indicates a vegetal landscape with only a few trees and a simple hill incline. This image accurately portrays the events of Belgrade, however, the actions of the individuals and the overall composition are also symbolic. The clutter of the right scene is meant to indicate chaos, contrasted by the success and regal attitude of the sultan are communicated in the left scene. ‚ÄúSiege of Rhodes‚Äù by shows the valiance of the Ottoman army despite the losses they suffered. Historically, this was the battle in which Suleiman suffered the most losses of any attempted siege. In the ‚ÄúFall of Rhodes‚Äù, the Ottoman army celebrates their victory while the Suleiman looks on the scene solemnly. Here, the artist perpetuates the stoic leadership of the sultan. Despite the violence of these scenes, renders highly decorative landscapes. Each scene of conquest in the S√ºleymann√¢me emphasizes the sultan's eminence and leadership. He is often the overseer of events rather than being truly engaged the action itself, even when he is surrounded by chaos, such as in ‚ÄúBattle of Mohacs‚Äù. The artists make specific choices about how rigid or limber the figures should be depicted in order to capture the emotional energy of the scenes. =Exalting the sultan= There are a few scenes in the S√ºleymann√¢me which specifically aim to point to moments of the sultan's greatest accomplishments or glorifications. In these paintings, the sultan's magnificence is emphasized both by the context of the scene and through the compositional and decorative choices of the painters. ‚ÄúAccession Ceremonies‚Äù, illustrates the ceremonial, yet casual atmosphere of the new sultan's court. The gold throne, highly decorated geometric motifs of the walls and ceiling, communicate the importance of his position. The attitudes of the different groups of people communicate their class or position: the visitors outside are more dynamically rendered, whereas the indoor groups of courtiers are still, almost static to represent the highly regulated court life. Regardless of status, these individuals are clearly present for the leader, the sultan, further emphasizing his importance. Several of the scenes exalting Suleiman show him receiving symbolic gifts. In ‚ÄúReceiving the Crown of Hungary‚Äù, Suleiman is handed the crown of Hungary, a ceremonial act. ‚ÄúSuleiman Presented with the Ruby Cup‚Äù shows Suleiman receiving the ruby cup of Cem≈üid, a mystical symbol of Ottoman power. Here, the painter exemplifies the glory and honor symbolized by receiving the cup through grand decorative elements of the architecture and the central positioning of the sultan. Overall, these exaltation scenes show the ruler as a figure to be honored by many, worthy of the glory of his title and power.

Early life Dobreƒçiƒá was born in Bar, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire (now Montenegro). His family hailed from Livari (formerly Livor), a village in Skadarska Krajina. He had a brother, Filip, a later consul. While Dobreƒçiƒá was in primary school, Montenegro achieved its independence as the Kingdom of Montenegro, and he then attended a Serbian national school. Despite completing his first year with very good marks, he had to repeat the class as he was too young to be accepted in advanced classes. In 1890, Dobreƒçiƒá was sent by his parents to Rome, where he attended the Pontifical Roman Seminary. He successfully completed a doctorate in theology, followed by one in philosophy. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in the Basilica of St. John Lateran in 1898. He returned to his homeland in 1899 and served the church in various roles until in 1905 he was appointed as a parish priest in Cetinje, the capital of Montenegro at the time. While serving there, he taught elementary school and began his career in government and business affairs working as a stenographer for the Montenegrin National Assembly. From 1907 to 1913, he was a teacher at the Cetinje Gymnasium. He taught French. Office Following the death of the incumbent, Simon Milinoviƒá, in 1910, the Roman Curia chose Dobreƒçiƒá as the new Archbishop of Bar and Primate of Serbia, and he received his appointment in 1912.\\"Antivari\\" in Pace, Edward Aloysius (ed.) (1922) Catholic Encyclopedia Supplement and Yearbook I (being Volume 17 of the Catholic Encyclopedia), page 46 As head of the Roman Catholic Church in Montenegro, he regularly represented it in the parliament of the Kingdom of Montenegro and worked closely with the Montenegrin government and the king, until the fall of the monarchy and the occupation by the Central Powers during the First World War. The First World War was the first instance when he showed his Serbian-Montenegrin patriotism, through written moral support of Chetnik activities in the resistance. In 1918, he was a supporter of the union between Montenegro and Serbia.ƒêorƒëeviƒá-Malagurski, Mara (1941) Bunjevka o Bunjevcima Gradska ≈°tamparija, Subotica, Vojvodina, pp. 101-102, , in Serbian He supported, and welcomed in the name of the Roman Catholic community, the decision of the Great National Assembly of Serbian People in Montenegro, which overthrew the reigning Petrovic dynasty and declared unconditional unification with Serbia under the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. In 1919, the name of the unified country was officially the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians. Dobreƒçiƒá went to the Holy See, where he successfully gained recognition for the newly created state, despite a note of protest from the self-proclaimed Montenegrin government-in-exile in France under the leadership of King Nicholas. In 1922, he sought to move the archbishopric to Belgrade, and travelled to Rome to gain support. The Yugoslav government supported him. In 1923, he was the candidate proposed by Prime Minister Nikola Pasic for the new Archbishop of Belgrade, but he did not receive the appointment. On 23 October 1923, he was hosted for lunch in Bar by King Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, which demonstrates that he was on good terms with the ruling dynasty. In 1927, at Dobreƒçiƒá's direction an archbishop palace was built which remains the residence of the Archbishop of Bar and Primate of Serbia to this day, and which was the seat of the cultural life of the city of Bar in his day, hosting such notables as the choral society \\"Bratimstvo\\". Archbishop Dobreƒçiƒá financially assisted other national and educational associations such as the National Defense volunteers, the Adriatic Guard, and women's charities. During the interwar period Nikola Dobreƒçiƒá traveled Europe and to the United States contacting √©migr√©es and trying to arouse interest in investments in Montenegro. He worked for greater economic development of the Montenegrin part of the Yugoslav monarchy, and especially for that of his homeland, the Bar Coast. Among his several economic initiatives, perhaps the most famous was the construction of the Ford Motor Company factory in Bar. He was also responsible for the overall rise of the standard of living of clergy in his see. He pointed out the need for vigorous development of the eastern Adriatic coast, often comparing the \\"Croatian Riviera\\" with \\"completely abandoned Serbian coastline\\". On 20 June 1935, Dobreƒçiƒá opened the \\"Archbishop's and Primate's Serbian Seminary\\" at his residence, in order to improve education. This was in addition to an early form of kindergarten, when his residence included, for a time, an orphanage for abandoned children from the coastal region of Bar. However, in 1939 he turned down the idea of a Catholic Seminary in Bar that would serve a larger population outside of his see. When in 1941 the country fell under the occupation of the Axis powers in World War II, Dobreƒçiƒá supported the resistance despite great pressure from the Italian fascists. Immediately after the war, Dobreƒçiƒá condemned the so-called \\"Pastoral Letter\\" of Archbishop Stepinac. He felt that it was an attempt by Tito's regime to undermine the Roman Catholic Church. During an official visit to Zagreb, he died on 14 November 1955. Legacy In addition to his native Serbian, he knew eight other languages. Dobreƒçiƒá wrote poems dedicated to Montenegrin and other Serbian statesmen and prelates, in Serbian, Latin, French and Italian. With local funds he built the church of St. Nicholas, which bears the motto of the archbishop: \\"For God and for his people.\\" Political views In the years before and after World War I, Dobreƒçiƒá identified as a Serb and his clergy were Slavs. While opening the archbishopric residence in Bar in 1935, he held a speech in which he said that he \\"was and will always be the greatest friend of his people regardless of faith\\". He acted in the favour of Yugoslav radicalism, and was closest to the Yugoslav Radical Union. Works He wrote in Serbian, Latin and Italian, and translated from and to French. *Victor Hugo as a national and international poet (–í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ò–≥–æ –∫–∞–æ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏ –∏ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏ –ø—ò–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫), essay *Jubilee songs, poetry collection References Sources  * Rastoder, ≈†erbo and Rastoder, Jasmina (1991) Dr Nikola Dobreƒçiƒá, arcibiskup barski i primas srpski: 1872-1955: ≈Ωivot i djelo; Prilog izuƒçavan ju istorije Barske arcibiskupije Budva Mediteran, , in Croatian *–ù–µ–¥–µ—ô–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ, –°. 2011, \\"Serbs Catholics on the Southern Coast from 1918 till 1945\\", Boka, no. 31, pp. 127‚Äì170. 20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Montenegrin Roman Catholic archbishops Roman Catholic primates Archbishops of Antivari Serbian Roman Catholics People from Bar, Montenegro 1872 births 1955 deaths ","title":"Nikola Dobreƒçiƒá"},{"id":"34256767","text":"James Powell Mattox (December 17, 1896 ‚Äì October 12, 1973) was an American professional baseball player.

S. Crowther) was an English architect who practised in Manchester. His buildings are mainly located in Manchester, Cheshire and Cumbria. Life and career Crowther studied under Richard Tattersall from 1838 to 1843. He then worked as a managing clerk for Henry Bowman until 1846, when Bowman took him into partnership, the firm being known as Bowman and Crowther. In 1845 Bowman and Crowther published a book titled Churches of the Middle Ages (with a second edition in 1853). A reviewer for The Ecclesiologist praised it for its \\"accurate illustrations of some of the finest examples of our old churches\\". The partnership started by designing churches for the Unitarians, including chapels at Hyde, Cheshire, and in Leeds, Yorkshire. The authors of the Buildings of England series consider that the best of these was at Bury, built in 1852, but since demolished. When Crowther established his own practice, his earlier works were in the Gothic Revival manner of George Gilbert Scott. His first independent work was the church of St Philip, Alderley Edge (1851‚Äì1852). He moved to live in Alderley Edge, where he built a house for himself, Redclyffe Grange. The Buildings of England authors consider that Crowther's best churches of this period were St Mary, Hulme (1853‚Äì1858), St Alban, Cheetwood (1857‚Äì1864, since demolished), and St Mary, Bury. He later incorporated Perpendicular features in his designs, for example in St Chad, Rochdale (1884‚Äì85) where he added a chancel and chapels, and Holy Trinity, Littleborough (1889) where he added the chancel. The Buildings of England authors consider that Crowther's \\"most creative\\" church was St Benedict, Ardwick (1877‚Äì1880) with large high-set windows, an Italianate tower, and an attached clergy house. As well as churches, Crowther took the opportunity of designing villas in varying styles for the more wealthy people to move from the industrial cities to more attractive places such as Alderley Edge, although apart from his own house, Redclyffe Grange, most of his commissions in this town have been demolished. Further afield, in what is now Cumbria, he designed country houses such as Holehird in Troutbeck (1854), Wynlass Beck in Windermere (1854), and Parkside in Kendal (1865). He also designed a school for his home town of Alderley Edge. He married a fisherman's daughter, Richanda Barber (from Pakefield, [Suffolk and 48 years his junior) in 1891 in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex. The marriage had no issue. Crowther was appointed as the diocesan architect for Manchester Cathedral. His restoration of the cathedral is considered by the Buildings of England authors as \\"his final great work\\", which was incomplete at the time of his death; this occurred in March 1893. His widow remarried three years after his death, and died in 1929 in Lowestoft, having spent the rest of her life in Suffolk. Bibliography See also *List of works by J. S.

It is mainly used for surface coatings of walls and ceilings in housing construction. This material is reputed to achieve a notable range of traditional and modern finishes, including a full range of Venetian stucco and stone effects. Shikkui finishes allow a thin two-coat application, and their elasticity provides good stress-crack resistance. The color and texture of a finishing can be individually customized using a variety of diluted color pigments. The coatings are highly porous and naturally antiseptic, so indoor air quality is actively improved for healthier spaces. Shikkui coatings are also said to be humidity-regulating, fire-resistant, antistatic (preventing dust accumulation), hypoallergenic, antifungal and mold resistant. Shikkui surface coatings become harder as time passes, as they are continuously absorbing CO2.

It later became part of National Westminster Bank's network of branches after that bank acquired National Provincial. In 2011 it became J D Wetherspoon's second pub in central Brighton. One of many buildings by the prolific local architecture firm of Clayton & Black, whose work in various styles can be found across the city, it forms an important component of the range of banks, offices and commercial buildings on North Street‚Äîa significant commercial thoroughfare since the 18th century. In particular, the \\"good attention to detail\\" shown throughout the building's Louis XIV-style fa√ßade has been praised. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Brighton (originally Brighthelmston) originated as a fishing village bounded by four streets named after the points of the compass. The land to the north, west and east was agricultural. North Street lay on the main route towards London, and it thrived as the town grew in the 18th century: by 1800 it was the centre of commerce, lined with inns, shops and offices. Many buildings on the north side were removed between 1874 and 1879 when the road was widened, and offices and banks were attracted to the area. Large early 20th-century buildings included offices for the Prudential Association and the Royal Assurance Society and a branch of Midland Bank, and the north side of the street was soon \\"dominated\\" by such companies. National Provincial Bank, a major retail bank founded in 1833, sought to open a branch in Brighton, and in 1921 they commissioned the Clayton & Black firm to work with their in-house architect F.C.R. Palmer to design a building on North Street at the corner of Bond Street. The site faced the Midland Bank branch of 1902. Clayton & Black had nearly 50 years of experience in Brighton and neighbouring Hove, designing an eclectic range of buildings to serve a variety of functions. Among other commissions, they were responsible for the Royal Assurance Society offices at 163 North Street. The building was completed in 1923, and it was in use by National Provincial until the bank merged with the Westminster Bank in 1968 to form the National Westminster Bank. The branch was rebranded with that identity. From the 1990s, in response to changes in Government policy over alcohol licensing, many bank branches were sold for conversion into pubs and bars. There was already a National Westminster Bank branch a short distance away, at the corner of North Street and Pavilion Buildings, and 155‚Äì158 North Street was turned into a bar. By the early 21st century it operated under the name Saqqara. A sports bar and nightclub called The Gentleman's Turf then occupied the building, and it was later acquired by the J D Wetherspoon chain, which was granted permission by the city council in July 2010 to convert it into a pub. The Post & Telegraph opened on 21 December 2010. It is a short distance from the group's Bright Helm pub, and as of is one of four Wetherspoon outlets in the city of Brighton and Hove. Heritage Under the name National Westminster Bank, 155‚Äì158 North Street was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 23 June 1994. This status is given to \\"nationally important buildings of special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. The building is within the North Laine Conservation Area, one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. This was designated by Brighton Council in 1977 and covers . Architecture The stone-built structure is in the Louis XVI style, a derivative of Neoclassical architecture. Elements of the Edwardian Baroque style, which Clayton & Black used in their 1904 commission at 163 North Street, have also been identified. The building has been said to stand \\"glowering ... across the entrance to Bond Street\\" at T.B. Whinney's Edwardian/Italianate Midland Bank branch of 1902. The two-storey building has six windows facing North Street, a chamfered corner entrance bay and three windows to each floor facing Bond Street. There are dormer windows set into the slate-tiled mansard roof. There are three entrances: two subsidiary doorways in the outermost bays, and an elaborate arrangement in the corner bay consisting of straight-headed double doors decorated with zodiac-themed reliefs, set in an architrave with a cornice supported on corbels, below which is an escutcheon with a bas-relief coat of arms. Above the cornice and its entablature is a lavishly decorated Diocletian window surrounded by carved swags with a female face forming the centrepiece on top of the keystone. The whole of the ground floor is rusticated, including the concave, heavily recessed window surrounds in which tall round-arched windows are set. These windows have intricately carved keystones. A wide entablature forms separates the ground and first floors; above it, the windows are straight-headed and set below architraves with decorative keystones. Between each window is a slightly projecting panel. At the top of the building, a parapet runs around the whole building in front of the roof; it has balustraded sections in front of each dormer window. The dormers have distinctive architraves.

Direct Rail Services (DRS) leased the site from July 2006 - May 2011 where it was used as a wagon maintenance and storage location. Subsequently, DRS opted to move these operations to Motherwell TMD.

The bridge and Scammonden Reservoir to the west are named after Scammonden, the village that was flooded to accommodate the reservoir whose dam carries the motorway. On opening, the bridge was the longest single-span non-suspension bridge in the world and it is the longest concrete arch bridge in the UK. History The bridge was built for the West Riding County Council to the designs of the county surveyor, Colonel S. Maynard Lovell. In March 1962 a model of the section of the M62 was displayed in Wakefield, the administrative centre of the West Riding County Council. The route of the motorway, from the A572 to the A640 at Huddersfield, was announced by Tom Fraser on 29 October 1964. Design The bridge was planned as a flat arch bridge, but aerodynamic considerations led to an open spandrel design.The Motorway Archive - M62, Scammonden Bridge The main span supports eight spandrel columns and there are four other columns over the motorway cutting. The spandrel columns are thick.University of Bath April 2009 The arch is a twin box section. Its deck is an inverted T-type pretensioned prestressed concrete beam. The bridge deck is wide. Using computers, its design was calculated to withstand winds, and was tested in wind tunnels at the University of Nottingham and the National Physical Laboratory.Design Journal April 1971 The motorway cutting was profiled with 'steps'. The road it carries was the A6025 but is now the B6114 between Elland and the A640 junction at Buckstones Moss. To the west of the bridge the M62 enters Calderdale from Kirklees; the boundary crosses the B6114 north of the bridge, and follows the north side of the M62 along Scammonden Water. The road crosses the M62 at around above sea level, northeast of Cow Gate Hill. Safety Improvements In 2020 work was carried out to erect permanent, 8' (2.4m) high, inward curving anti climb fencing on both sides of the bridge, following a number of deaths, in order to prevent suicides. https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/major-1m-scheme- make-m62-18137662 Construction Motorway under construction, below Pole Moor, in 1970 The arch is made of modular precast concrete sections, weighing . The construction contractor was Alfred McAlpine. Construction of the arch required of scaffolding tubing. During the winter there was severe ice build up on the scaffolding. Excavation of the Deanhead cutting was done using explosives. The cutting is deep, long, and of earth was removed during its construction. Most of it was used to build the high Scammonden Dam across the Black Brook valley, which was the first motorway-dam project in the world. The route of the carriageway was set out in July 1963 and the motorway cutting began work in August 1964.Engineering timetables Work on the six-mile Windy Hill to Pole Moor section began on 1 November 1966 and was carried out for 12 hours on weekdays and eight hours at weekends.

He is principally known along with his wife Lilly Dubowitz for developing two clinical tests, the Dubowitz Score to estimate gestational age and the other for the systematic neurological examination of the newborn. Life Dubowitz is the son of Charley Dubowitz and Olga n√©e Schattel. He was educated in Beaufort West Central High School in South Africa. Dubowitz graduated Doctor of Medicine from the University of Cape Town in 1954, and moved to the United Kingdom in April 1954 to gain some clinical experience, and culture and theatre. Dubowitz planned to return to South Africa after 18 months and return to general practice there, but never did, as he encountered Sir Francis Fraser at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School who directed him into a position at University Hospital Lewisham working as an ophthalmology locum. He later took another locum position at New End Hospital in Hampstead. Two medical conditions are named after him, Dubowitz syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation and a characteristic facial appearance of unknown genetic cause; and Dubowitz disease, a particular form of spinal muscular atrophy, a severe neuromuscular disorder affecting mainly infants and children. A medical and research institution at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, bears his name (the Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre). Dubowitz married Lilly Magdalena Suzanne n√©e Seb≈ëk in July 1960, who was also a paediatrician. They had four children, all boys, David born 1963, Michael born 1964, Gerald born 1965, and Daniel born 1969. Career Dubowitz started his clinical career in 1954, after graduating in medicine, as a resident in medicine and surgery at Groote Schuur Hospital, for the standard 6 months period in each specialisation. Dubowitz started his UK clinical career in 1958 with 3 week locum position at Queen Mary's Hospital where he saw his first case of Muscular dystrophy in two wards of patients, he became a paediatric resident a subject where he been involved in clinical and research aspects of muscle diseases ever since. He remained at this position for two years before becoming a lecturer and a houseman for a year as a clinical pathologist at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases, later called National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, performing muscle biopsies. An interest in research followed, studying for an MD thesis on muscular dystrophy in childhood, in 1960 at the University of Sheffield, where he would eventually stay for the next 13 years. Ronald Illingworth was Dubowitz's professor at Sheffield. Between 1961 and 1965, he was employed as a senior lecturer in child health, and Senior House Officer in hospital and was promoted to Dr.phil at the University of Sheffield. The thesis was based on Dubowitz's pioneering histochemical studies and sponsored by Professor Everson Pearse, on developing and diseased muscle. He continued in that position for another two years before being promoted to a reader in Child Health and Developmental Neurology, at Sheffield, a position Dubowitz held until 1972. In 1973, Dubowitz applied and received the Chair of Paediatrics and Neonatal Medicine at the Postgraduate Medical School of Hammersmith Hospital, now part of Imperial College London. A large number of researchers followed Dubowitz to the unit, which eventually became the Jerry Lewis Muscle Research Lab, after the building was funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Jerry Lewis actually came an open the unit. Dubowitz was a founding member of the British Paediatric Neurology Association and the president from 1992 to 1994. In 1996, Dubowitz was made professor emeritus of paediatrics at the University of London. Dubowitz was honorary member of the European Paediatric Neurology Society since 2005. Dubowitz was president of the Medical Art Society from 1997 to 2000. From 1972 to 1996, Dubowitz was the director of Muscle Research Centre. From 1999 to 2003 Dubowitz was president and later honorary member European Neuromuscular Centre in The Netherlands. From 1972 to the present, Dubowitz has been an honorary consultant paediatrician at the Hammersmith Hospital. Dubowitz syndrome The syndrome that eventually became the Dubowitz syndrome was first described in 1965. Dubowitz held a clinic in cystic fibrosis and noticed a baby girl born at full term at Jessop Hospital who weighed around 3 to 4lbs. Dubowitz commented that the baby had an unusually shaped face, recessive and it‚Äôs an unusual face, with odd ears and a particular nose, and doesn‚Äôt quite fit in and the mother commented that her previous child had a similar shaped face. Dubowitz being interested in the case, through his cystic fibrosis clinic, researched all the different face shapes within syndromes of dwarfism and found that none matched. Dubowitz decided to write a Case report, that was published in the British Journal of Genetics. Then geneticist, John M. Opitz, noticed a similar case in a baby girl in Germany, and published an identical case. Opitz stated that they had identical features, and could almost be sister. From that point on the condition eventually became the Dubowitz syndrome. World Muscle Society The idea for the World Muscle Society began in 1995, when Dubowitz discussed the formation of a new society with the pediatrician Luciano Merlini, principally due to the quickening of medical advances in the field and it was felt that the interval between the 4-year meetings of the World Federation of Neurology was too long. Dubowitz felt that a new multidisciplinary society was needed that would meet frequently and focus more on the current research community rather than established figures in the medical community. Dubowitz further discussed the proposal with Italian pediatrician Giovanni Nigro and later with the French pediatrician George Serratrice in Marseille while travelling. The name World Muscle Society was finally chosen as it was the most easily recognisable name. The society was legally established in London. Dubowitz wrote to 60 potential members asking the following two questions: :do you think there is a need a for a new international muscle society to arrange more frequent interdisciplinary meetings; and would you be able to attend a foundation meeting of the new society in London on Sunday 4th June, 1995? 15 people replied and attended the first meeting in London on Sunday 4 June 1995.

Lake Naivasha is an important source of water in a semi-arid environment, and supports export-oriented horticulture and floriculture businesses as well as tourism. Malewa River water quality has deteriorated because of more human activities in the upper catchment. Long-term effects of this on the percentage of rainfall getting into Lake Naivasha are not clear. Possibly in low-rainfall years the percentage will drop because of water abstraction, while in high- rainfall years the percentage will go up because of cultivated soils having a lower water-holding capacity and the introduction of more 100% runoff surfaces like tarmac roads and iron sheets, etc. Catchment The Malewa River catchment of provides about 90% of the water flowing into Lake Naivasha, with most of the remainder coming from the Gilgil River. The headwaters of the main channel of the Malewa originate at an elevation of in the Nyandarua (Aberdare) mountains. Its tributary the Wanjohi is fed by several small rivers running from the slopes of the Aberdares. Other tributaries are the Turasha, Simba, Nyairoko and Ol Kalou. The rivers in the Malewa basin are relatively shallow but are all perennial. The Aberdare range receives about of rain annually and has large areas of dense forest. The highlands drained by the Malewa are volcanic and contribute sodium and calcium to the water through chemical weathering of the rocks. Sulphate in the water comes from the atmosphere. The floor of the Rift Valley gets just each year and is mainly covered by scrub, with some bare soil. Rainfall peaks between April and June and again in October and November. Erosion is highest in these months. Land use The Malewa river is fed by streams that run through the Kinangop Plateau. At one time the plateau was almost completely covered in tussocky grassland with very few trees. The stream valleys had many tussocky bogs. The plateau has been settled by Kikuyu farmers since the 1960s. They have ploughed much of the land to grow maize, wheat, cabbage and potatoes. The wetlands have mostly been drained. Where drainage has not been deliberate, the trees planted for poles and firewood have absorbed the water. The trend is towards more intensive cultivation of food crops and cash crops. Issues The river is threatened by deforestation and siltation, increasing diversion of water for irrigation, and pollution by fertilizers and pesticides. In August 1997 sediment-laden plumes of Malewa river water extended about into Lake Naivasha. Access to natural resources and markets is not equitable in the region. Water conflict is common and poverty widespread. Improvements to resource management practices could cause major improvements in reducing pollution and erosion.

When grown in liquid media it takes approximately 76 hours to reach stationary phase and is very sensitive to decreases in pH. This species typically has an oval or cylindrical shape, but it can be dumb-bell shaped at the microscopic level. C. aquaticus reproduces through bipolar mypodial budding. This species is somewhat unusual in the Cryptococcus family in that it can weakly ferment D-glucose, D-galactose, maltose and melezitose. This species is DBB+. C. aquaticus has been studied because of its ability to produce pecticase.

In 1859, he won both of his races including The Derby, in which he landed a huge gamble for his owner despite concerted efforts to prevent him winning. Musjid developed leg problems after the Derby and never ran again. He was retired to stud, where he made little impression before his early death in 1865 from a stomach rupture. Background Musjid was a \\"stylish-looking\\" brown horse with a white star on his head who stood 15.3 hands high. He was bred by Lord Scarborough at his Tickhill stud in Yorkshire. Musjid was sent to the Doncaster sales, where he failed to find a buyer willing to pay the reserve price of 300 guineas. He was later sold for ¬£200 in a private deal to Sir Joseph Hawley, with a proviso that Sir Joseph would pay an additional ¬£500 if the colt won the Derby. Musjid was sent into training with George Manning, who trained Hawley's colt Beadsman to win the 1858 derby, at his stable at Cannons Heath, near Kingsclere in Hampshire. Manning's stable was a converted barn and was not noted for its hygiene: a stagnant pond \\"where frogs and beetles revel\\" stood close by the entrance and was blamed for causing outbreaks of fever and \\"malaria\\" among the inmates. Racing career Joseph Hawley, Musjid's owner, who won more than ¬£75,000 on the 1859 Derby 1858: two-year-old season Musjid was the subject of very positive rumours before his debut, but ran disappointingly and finished third to North Lincoln in the New Stakes at Ascot on 2 June. On 17 June he started 5/4 favourite for the Mottisford Stakes at Stockbridge Racecourse and won easily by a length from Sir Hercules. One source also claims that he won a race at Newmarket later that year. After his win at Stockbridge, the New Sporting Magazine noted that while he seemed to lack the pace to be a leading two-year-old, he looked like a potential Derby horse. 1859: three-year-old season In the spring of 1862, Musjid won a match race at Newmarket in which he defeated a filly owned by Lord Glasgow. He did not run again before the Derby, but his impressive form in training gallops against a good colt named Gallus was enough to establish him as a leading contender, and he was the subject of heavy wagering by his owner, who stood to win a reported ¬£75,000. At Epsom, Musjid was ridden by John Wells and started 9/4 favourite in a field of thirty runners. Many bookmakers faced paying out huge sums if Musjid won and attempts were made to ensure his defeat. Several jockeys attempted to box in the favourite while others, including the rider of the joint-second-favourite The Promised Land, were alleged to have deliberately ‚Äúpulled‚Äù their horses to ensure a win for the outsider Marionette. In a rough and unsatisfactory race, Wells managed to extricate Musjid from a bad position and produced the colt with a strong late challenge to take the lead well inside the final furlong and win by half a length from Marionette and Trumpeter. Confusion ensued when the racecourse judge completely misread the finish and awarded second place to a colt named Ticket-of-Leave who had not finished in the first ten: the correct finishing order was only established after an inquiry. Hawley's winning bets on the colt were reported to be the highest ever paid out to an individual on a single race. In October, a match race between Musjid and The Promised Land was arranged for Newmarket. Musjid, however was having training problems and it was decided to withdraw him from the race and pay a forfeit. Musjid's worsening leg trouble meant that he was unable to race again and he was retired to stud. Stud career Musjid stood as a stallion at Sir Joseph's stud at Leybourne Grange in Kent. He had little opportunity to prove himself as a sire as he died in 1865 from a \\"rupture in the stomach\\" at the age of nine. He sired one good horse in Vagabond, who won the Trial Stakes in 1869, but who, as a gelding, was incapable of continuing Musjid‚Äôs sire-line.

Literary career Anselmo Su√°rez y Romero's masterpiece: Francisco, also known as El ingenio o las delicias del campo (The sugar mill or the delights of the country), written between 1838 and 1839, is considered the first anti-slavery novel in the Americas. The other work which encompassed slavery, was the short story Petrona y Rosal√≠a written in 1838 by F√©lix Tanco y Bosmeniel (1797‚Äì1871), unpublished until 1925, which also touched upon slaves' lives in the 19th century.

Written years before Uncle Tom's Cabin, Francisco could not be published immediately due to colonial censorship. The manuscript was delivered to British official and abolitionist Richard Robert Madden in 1840, along with a revised copy of the work Autobiograf√≠a de un esclavo () by Juan Francisco Manzano, which had been proofread by Su√°rez y Romero himself. About the importance of Francisco as a literary masterpiece, British abolitionist Madden was quoted as saying that: > Tho there is literary merit of but small amount in this piece, there is life > and truth in every line of it. [...] In this little piece of the Ingenio > there is a minuteness of description and closeness of observation and a > rightness of feeling that I have not often seen surpassed.Lorna V. Williams. > The representation of slavery in Cuban fiction. (1994). Madden himself thought that the narrative employed by Su√°rez y Romero in Francisco had a palpable realm of invisible realism in it. No other book, in his opinion, was as descriptive, or as graphically drafted, as in Francisco 's prose, in which slavery was depicted with the same intellectual rigor as in real life in Cuba. Madden found certain parts of the book originally narrated, in a prose style by which Su√°rez y Romero was known for, especially when the central figure in the book, still shackled after being injured by lashes, had to endure the humid heat in a mistreated and painful state, while harvesting sugar cane. Most of the early readers of Francisco agreed with Madden in that the book had a realistic and accurate representation not before seen. Others, like the critic Enrique Pi√±eyro, thought that the book was unoriginal. His opinion would appear in the periodical El Ateneo in Havana, and later in Revista Cubana.

A commemorative plaque indicates it was dedicated in memory of the soldiers who fought in defense of the flag. Note: This includes This monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. It is located in the Athens Historic District. History and architectural features Located in Academy Park at 715 South Main Street in Athens, Pennsylvania, the Protection of the Flag Monument was completed in 1902. Erected on the front of the lot where it stands, it occupies the center of the site's western half. The front of the monument may be reached from Main Street via a concrete sidewalk while the monument's eastern side may be approached via a brick walkway, which is flanked by two stones affixed with bronze commemorative plaques. Situated between those stones is a state historical marker and a flag pole. Note: This includes The monument itself, which is situated 50 feet east of the sidewalk, is surrounded by a 26-foot ornamented, raised granite coping square. The monument's polished, Stony Creek granite pedestal, which stands at the center of that square, is composed of a plinth, molded base, die, and a cap, is roughly nine feet tall, and is topped by a roughly eight-foot-tall bronze sculpture of a wounded adult Revolutionary War-era soldier holding a rifle and a young, barefooted drummer boy. It was created by sculptor George T. Brewster. Note: This includes The monument's sculpture was commissioned in 1900 by Joseph Whipple Stickler and his wife, Charlotte Snell Stickler, and was unveiled in June 1902.

The P stands for parallel and refers to load-bearing walls arranged parallel to wall surfaces. 2 denotes the arrangement of two stairways in a building. The first building of this type was built in 1961 as an experimental building in Berlin-Lichtenberg. The original building was located at Erich-Kuttner-Stra√üe 9-15 in the Fennpfuhl district and is now a listed building.P2 in the experimental building monument Erich Kuttner-Stra√üe 9 / 15, tenement, 1961-62 by Achim Felz, Herbert and Wilfrid Kuschy Stallknecht Stairs and arrangement of dwellings A P2 building is characterized by the arrangement of apartments around a nearly square interior stairwell, often equipped with a glass roof. The buildings have five to eleven stories and there are usually two apartments per floor, although some designs have three apartments per floor, above and below the stairwell access. Floors As a standard design, the P2 is five or six stories high, with the lowest floor raised half a story above the ground. This allows natural light and ventilation to the basement, and minimizes the excavation required for the foundation. The building interior can be accessed by way of an outdoor stairway or via a half-staircase in the entrance area. The staircase and access area reduce the amount of space available for a ground-floor apartment. Therefore the ground floor arrangement consists of a four-room apartment and a one-bedroom apartment - unlike the symmetric three- bedroom apartments on the upper floors. The remaining space is configured as a hallway.P2 User study In P2-buildings with more than six stories, every third floor has a distribution hallway. The hallway is usually located on the entrance side of a building and serves as the access or entrance to stairwells, elevators, waste discharge and storerooms. The apartments located above or below the distribution hallways are not accessed directly from the elevator but via a staircase. Typically the distribution hallways are arranged like this: * P2/10 (with 10 stories): first, third, sixth and ninth floors * P2/11 (with 11 stories): first, fourth, seventh and tenth floors (Seventh floor has an emergency exit passage connecting to a neighboring building). Apartment As a standard, apartments in P2-buildings have one-to-four rooms. In buildings with special elements, such as a trapezoidal shape, there are also 5-room apartments with two rooms that have no right angles. Originally there were no loggias on the raised ground floor. Ground floor loggias were added later in the course of reconstruction work. Kitchens and baths Kitchen hatch The novelty of the bathrooms and kitchens is the optimization of space. The bathrooms and kitchens are located inside and next to each other and they utilize the same supply shaft for water, sewage, and ventilation. Bathrooms are fully equipped sanitary room modules (including toilet, sink, tub, faucets and washing machine connection; and kitchen modules include vertical supply and disposal lines. During construction, they are lifted into the shell construction in one piece. The bathroom and kitchen modules require a simple connection to the pipes at ground level for installation. The walls of the service shaft are made of different materials, ranging from pressboard over the plaster to massive concrete elements. The designers avoided the typical kitchen and separate dining room arrangement, which required a lengthwise format and separated the family during meal preparation. This arrangement reduced living space and therefore reduced expenses. The designers hoped to integrate women more effectively into the family by opening the kitchen to the living room and thereby encouraging men to participate in the household. The kitchens were initially connected to the living rooms by large service hatches in the form of built-in furniture. After widespread criticism that the kitchen was not isolated enough from the living room, later buildings incorporated concrete walls with a small hatch window. In the last series produced, the kitchen was completely separated from the living room by a wall. Daylight fell into the kitchen only through the door or service hatch.

Well- regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact. Early life and career Kilburn was born in Sheffield in 1909, and attended Holgate Grammar School in Barnsley, before completing a degree in economics at the university there. From an early age, he showed interest in cricket; as a boy he received coaching from former Yorkshire cricketer George Hirst at Scarborough, and played for Barnsley in Yorkshire Council matches and for Bradford in the Bradford League. Bowling fast-paced off spin, Kilburn was successful enough with bat and ball to win medals for Bradford and have his achievements reported in the press. He worked briefly as a teacher in a Harrogate preparatory school.Hamilton, p. 12. While in Bradford, he met the vice-consul for Finland; as a result, he went to live in Finland for a year.Hamilton, p. 13. Cricket correspondent During his time in Finland, Kilburn sent travel articles to the Barnsley Chronicle and the Yorkshire Post. The editor of the latter, Arthur Mann, was impressed by Kilburn's work, and arranged to meet him in 1934. Learning of his interest in cricket, and recognising his name from his success in the Bradford League, Mann gave Kilburn a trial as the newspaper's cricket correspondent; the position had been vacant since Alfred Pullin had retired in 1931. An initial three-month period, with a salary of ¬£3 per week, resulted in a written commendation from Neville Cardus, and he was appointed permanently with responsibility for cricket and rugby. Now paid ¬£6 per week plus expenses, and initially writing under the by-line \\"Our Cricket Correspondent\\",Hamilton, pp. 13‚Äì14. Kilburn quickly established his reputation. Soon after he took the position, he was given the byline \\"J. M. Kilburn\\"; his reports were often among the few not anonymised. He continued in the position until 1976, when he retired. Style and personality As cricket correspondent for the Yorkshire Post, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his writing style: he wrote \\"with a fountain pen on press telegram forms at 60 or 80 words a shilling. At the close of play he immediately concluded his essay; he hardly ever crossed anything out. His cricketing judgments were assured and rigorous, his style exact but sometimes elegant: Leyland's bowling is a joke but it is an extremely practical joke.\\" The Times stated that his reports were \\"always precise, frequently elegant, sometimes stern and invariably fair and accurate. He never wrote an unpolished piece or an unidentifiable one, although he was only occasionally analytical.\\" The speed and ease with which he produced his reports, and his refusal to use a typewriter‚Äîwhich he described as \\"the devil's own invention\\"‚Äîwere envied by other journalists.Hamilton, p. 15. Kilburn's writing was printed exactly as he wrote it; sub-editors did not touch anything, even if he had made a mistake, as his employers valued his style so greatly. He refused to write about off- field events which caused consternation for his editors as Yorkshire cricket was turbulent behind the scenes at the time he wrote. Nor would he write about the wider aspects of cricket, confident that his reputation made it impossible to sack him. This attitude made him popular with the players, and he became particularly close to Len Hutton and Donald Bradman.Hamilton, p. 14. His position at the Yorkshire Post gave him freedom to write about whatever he chose, and he refused several offers to move to national newspapers.Hamilton, p. 11. But his obituary in The Times suggested that, had he worked for a London publication, he would have been as well-known and respected as Cardus, E. W. Swanton and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow. The press-boxes of Kilburn's time, particularly in Yorkshire, were unfriendly and serious places. According to Wisden, \\"[Kilburn] was a tall, austere man who had little truck with press-box banter.\\" According to writer Derek Hodgson, Kilburn was shy. However, his views and methods were regarded as old-fashioned in the later stages of his career. Kilburn was often compared to his contemporary from Lancashire, Neville Cardus, but his style was dissimilar. Cardus wrote in a romantic style whereas Kilburn preferred factual accuracy; according to Wisden, Kilburn was \\"harder, less flashy, more punctilious\\". Journalist Frank Keating writes: \\"Neville Cardus was acclaimed the Wordsworth of cricket writing, while across the Pennines they hailed Kilburn as the Coleridge. With good reason.\\" Kilburn's writings on the Yorkshire players of the 1930s and 1940s made them well-known to the public as personalities, and he wrote several pieces for the Yorkshire Post which became famous. Kilburn had a deep love of cricket, and worried it was losing its way in embracing one-day matches and sponsorship, although he did not believe that progress was necessarily bad.Hamilton, p. 17. He believed that cricketers should be chivalrous, and greatly admired stylish play. He severely criticised anything on the field which he believed fell short of acceptable standards, including the occasion in 1967 when Yorkshire won the County Championship after engaging in time-wasting tactics to avoid losing a game.Hamilton, p. 18. He retired in 1976, but continued to follow the sport very closely.Hamilton, p. 20. Legacy and death Kilburn twice accompanied the England team on overseas tours to Australia: in 1946‚Äì47 and 1954‚Äì55. During the former tour, he became a founder member of the Cricket Writers' Club. He served as its secretary, chairman and later became an Honorary Life Member. He also became the only journalist elected as a life member at Yorkshire, and opened the newly built press box at Headingley Cricket Ground in 1988. In his final years, he became blind‚Äîhis sight began to fail shortly after his retirement‚Äî but according to Wisden, \\"Jim Kilburn remained an upright, dignified man until he died\\". Outside of his work, Kilburn played golf to a reasonable standard, and was married with three children. Derek Hodgson writes: \\"All his work will be valued as an accurate insight into social attitudes in the first half of this century. Jim Kilburn intended always to write about cricket but in fact he told us all so much more.\\" He wrote ten books on cricket, and contributed regularly to The Cricketer magazine and to Wisden. Bibliography He contributed to the following books (as the sole author except where otherwise noted):  With E. L. Roberts With J. H. Nash. With Norman Yardley.  * References Sources * 1909 births 1993 deaths Cricket historians and writers British male journalists British sportswriters ","title":"Jim Kilburn"},{"id":"34257682","text":"The Mowat Centre was an independent Canadian public policy think tank associated with the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. It was established in 2009 with support from the government of Ontario, and published its first report in February 2010. It closed in June 2019 after its funding agreement with the Government of Ontario was cancelled. It was named after Ontario's longest-serving Premier, Sir Oliver Mowat. About The Mowat Centre described itself as \\"Ontario's non- partisan, evidence-based voice on public policy.\\" It \\"undertakes collaborative applied policy research, proposes innovative research-driven recommendations, and engages in public dialogue on Canada's most important national issues.\\" Academic experts the Mowat Centre collaborated with include Robin Boadway, Sujit Choudhry, Tom Courchene, and others. Organizations Mowat collaborated with include the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council, the Broadbent Institute, the Brookings Institution, the Caledon Institute of Social Policy, the Canada West Foundation, Corporate Knights, KPMG, Leger Marketing, and others. According to a 2015 report analyzing its own policy impact and public footprint, the Mowat Centre played a role in the passage of the Fair Representation Act 2011 and reforms made to policy proposals that led to the Canada Job Grant and income splitting in Canada. According to the same report, in the years 2010 through 2014 the Mowat Centre published 101 reports, was mentioned in 1317 media reports, and was referenced 59 times in policy reports and 87 times in academic research. Research The Mowat Centre's research focused on two areas: intergovernmental economic and social policy and government transformation. In addition, The Mowat Centre was home to three research hubs, two of which have also closed. One was focused on energy policy in Ontario and Canada. The other was focused on education and skills. A third research hub, focused on the not-for-profit sector in Ontario and Canada, remains active. In the area of intergovernmental economic and social policy, the Mowat Centre published research into policy areas such as Canadian transfer payments, equalization payments in Canada, fiscal federalism in Canada, intergovernmental relations in Canada, poverty reduction and social programs in Canada, Canada's Employment Insurance program, Canada's immigration system and the economic impact of immigrants in Canada, Canadians‚Äô attitudes towards the Canadian federation, the distribution of electoral ridings in Canada, the economy of Ontario and Canada and others. The Mowat Centre also led the Mowat Centre EI Task Force, a task force of leading experts and public figures co-chaired by Ratna Omidvar and Roy Romanow, which reviewed Canada's Employment Insurance (EI) system, conducted public consultations about its relevance to contemporary realities, commissioned research on various aspects of the system from leading Canadian academic experts, and made recommendations about improving Canada's support system for the unemployed. In the area of government transformation, the Mowat Centre published work examining \\"how governments can improve their ability to deliver high-quality public services and public policy, even in times of fiscal constraint\\", through public service reform. Issues have included improvements to the health care system in Canada, the integration of human services, outcomes-based funding, insights for governments from behavioural science, the regulation of disruptive technologies, the role of government procurement [lxviii] in poverty reduction, community benefits agreements and other topics. Mowat NFP, Mowat's research hub focused on the not-for-profit sector, published research on human capital and capacity building in the not-for- profit sector, social enterprises, social impact bonds, data priorities for the not-for-profit sector, wages in the not-for-profit sector and other topics. Mowat Energy, Mowat's research hub focused on energy policy, published research on energy security, energy r&d; funding, social license and public engagement in energy policy decisions, an analysis of the economic impact [lxxxiv] on Ontario of the Energy East proposal, and carbon pricing in Canada. Other activities In addition to public policy research, the Mowat Centre engages in a variety of public policy knowledge transfer and convening activities. In 2010 it co-organized, with the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations, the 2010 State of the Federation conference. In 2011 the Mowat Centre co-organized, with the Brookings Institution, the Windsor-Detroit summit. Following the summit, the Mowat Centre took a leading role in creating the Council of the Great Lakes Region, which was launched in 2013. Mowat has since collaborated with the Council of the Great Lakes Region on several research projects. Leadership and funding The Mowat Centre's founding director was Matthew Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn is a former political science professor at Queens University and a former Deputy Minister in the Ontario Public Service, and has advised governments and political candidates on various policy matters, drawing on his academic expertise as well as Mowat research. He left the Mowat Centre in January 2016 for a senior position with the Public Service of Canada. The Mowat Centre was established with funding from the Ontario government. According to the Mowat Centre's public reports, the core grant constitutes less than 40% of the Centre's annual funding ($900,000 out of a total budget of $2,289,410 in fiscal year 2014-2015), with the remainder of its funding raised independently. The Mowat Centre's advisory board is composed of experts, education and policy leaders, and public figures, and includes former Ontario cabinet ministers from all major parties: Sean Conway, Joseph Cordiano, Dianne Cunningham, and Frances Lankin. Among other members of the Mowat Centre's advisory board are Alan Broadbent, Lisa De Wilde, Tony Dean, Dominic Giroux, John Honderich, Shirley Hoy, Danielle Martin, and Andr√© Pratte.

The earliest parish record is from Dec. 1832, when a Dekon Tiof baptized John Freyrik, but the community was not assigned a permanent parish priest until 1840, when Joseph Rosati, Bishop of St. Louis named Fr. Henry Meinkmann as pastor. In the early days, the parish built a log church, replaced with another in 1842, and that by a permanent church in 1858. The church was named for Saint Ludger, first Bishop of M√ºnster, as many families who settled in the area originated in Westphalia. The growth of Germantown stalled after 1871, however, when the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad built tracks to nearby Montrose instead.

Retrieved: May 14, 2016. The picture features the fictional Scotland Yard detective the Lone Wolf who travels to London, and solves the mystery of some missing jewels. It was the penultimate Lone Wolf film, followed by The Lone Wolf and His Lady in 1949, and the last for Mohr in the lead role. Plot In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard (Denis Green) suspects Michael Lanyard (Gerald Mohr), the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison (Eric Blore) to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen. Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott (Nancy Saunders), the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott (Vernon Steele), invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards (Tom Stevenson), is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham (Evelyn Ankers), has run off with Monty Beresford (Alan Napier) who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom. Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang (Paul Fung), a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton (Richard Fraser), Ann's fianc√©, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone. Woolerton claims Robards pushed him out of the car on the outskirts, and said he suspects Lanyard was the murderer. Lanyard thinks Kelmscott was being blackmailed by the thief who sold him the diamonds, and flees the police and proceeds to Iris' apartment. She has just persuaded Monty to get the diamonds from Lanyard. Lanyard and Monty struggle with Monty being subdued and told that Iris was about to flee with the famous Lone Wolf. At the theater, Lanyard discovers the diamonds are sewn into her mink coat but before he can leave her dressing room, Iris enters and admits that Robards had given her the diamonds. While Lanyard phones Jamison, Iris sneaks out an open window and heads to the airport to catch a flight out of the country. At the airport, Lanyard confronts Iris and turns her over to the waiting Garvey but Monty arrives, wielding a gun and declaring Iris planned the entire robbery and then killed Robards for the diamonds. When Jamison brings Lily and Iris' mink, Lanyard extracts the Eyes of the Nile from the coat's linings, proving that Iris was the thief and murderer.

Life  After his Abitur in Wiesbaden, Jahn studied history ‚Äì specialising in East European history ‚Äì political science, geography and educational theory between 1961 and 1969 in Marburg (under amongst others Peter Scheibert, Wolfgang Abendroth, Ernst-Otto Czempiel, Karl Christ, Walter Heinemeyer, Carl Schott, Kurt Scharlau and Leonhard Froese) and briefly also in Berlin and Bratislava. After his state examination in 1968 he graduated in East European history in 1969 under Peter Scheibert in Marburg. At the beginning of 1968, while still a student in Marburg, he set up the High School Union for Peace and Conflict Research (originally the High School Union for Interdisciplinary Polemology) and was one of the first members of the Association of Peace and Conflict Research (AFK), which was also founded in 1968. After a brief period in 1969/70 as scientific assistant to Czempiel in Marburg, he went with the latter to Frankfurt am Main and in 1971 became the first research fellow at the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (PRIF, Hessische Stiftung Friedens- und Konfliktforschung, HSFK). Here from 1974 until the end of 1990, he became the director of the Research Group ‚ÄúSocialist States‚Äù. In 1975 he was offered the Professorship in Socio-Economic Structures, Institutions and Foreign Policy of Socialist Countries and then the Professorship of Political Science and Political Sociology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main He received a further offer in 1993, in succession to Hermann Weber, of the Chair of Political Science and Contemporary History at the University of Mannheim until September 2005. In 1992. while still in Frankfurt, he founded the Research Unit for Conflict and Cooperation Structures in Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe and Eurasia (FKKS) called the Mannheim here-named the Research Area for Conflict and Cooperation Structures in Eastern Europe. At the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES), he first headed a department and then later on until 2009 directed the Research Area ‚ÄúNew Democracies and Conflict Resolution‚Äù. In 1986/7 Jahn took up a visiting Professorship at the University of Copenhagen, where he was active in the establishment of the Centre of Peace and Conflict Research. In 1988 he was a Visiting Professor at the University of California in Irvine. In September 1993 he gave lectures at Vilnius University. Since May 2004 he has been holding lectures on ‚ÄúPolitical Controversies from a Contemporary Perspective‚Äù. Here, Jahn has turned his attention to a wider public in the form of students of all faculties and of the older generation (Studies for senior citizens, University of the Third Age). Starting with this in Mannheim, he has continued this series at the University of Frankfurt since 2009.  Memberships  Jahn was frequently on the board of directors of the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (HSFK) and in 1975/6 and 1981/2 was the director in charge. Between 1996 and 1999, he was a member of the committee of the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research. He was frequently a member of the Council and the Board of Trustees of the German Society for Peace and Conflict Research (DGFK) from 1979 to 1983. In the German Association of Political Science (DVPW) during the 1970s, he directed the working group on ‚ÄúSocialist States‚Äù. At the beginning of the 1970s, he was also on the working group for ‚ÄúCivilian Defence‚Äù in the Federation of German Scientists‚Äù (VDW). He was for some years on the steering committee of the Association for Peace and Conflict Studies (AFK) and from 1977 to 1979 was Chairman. In the 1980s he initiated a working group on Peace Research in the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) in Hesse and was on the Council of the International Peace Research Association from 1986 to 1989.  Public activities  Though never a member of a political party, Jahn was nevertheless a member in the 1970s and 1980s of the Socialist Bureau, an independent democratic socialist union, where he was part of the editorial team producing their monthly journal ‚ÄúLeft. Socialist Newspaper‚Äù. He was often a consultant or commentator on events and working groups of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, subsequently also for the Green Party, occasionally also at events of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP) and in addition for various organisations of conscientious objectors and the Peace Movement. He also gave many lectures in the Protestant Academies of Tutzing, Arnoldshain and Loccum, in the Leadership Centre of the Bundeswehr in Koblenz and to the Trade Union Confederation. In the 1980s he was a visiting teacher at the Labour Academy (Akademie der Arbeit) in Frankfurt am Main. Jahn received an invitation to visit the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in March 1985, when he was wanting to set out on a long-prepared excursion to Leipzig. Due to his activities in the AFK, he was noted in the state security files of the GDR as a disruptive and divisive influence within the Peace Movement, above all probably because following his criticism of the arms build-up by NATO, he had also criticised the invasion of Afghanistan by Soviet troops, as it happened in the Catholic newspaper ‚ÄúPublic Forum‚Äù.

Regulations  The manufacture of diesel fuel tanks is strictly governed by safety regulations.US Department of Transportation http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules- regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.aspx?reg=393.65 Fuel tanks of a capacity greater than 25 US gallons must adhere to specifications for spillage, leakage, mounting, impact survivability, weld requirements, venting and a host of other stipulations. The regulations require side-mounted fuel tanks to survive a 30-foot drop test, while non side-mounted fuel tanks must survive a 10-foot drop test. Clear specifications are given as to what constitutes a successful drop test and how to conduct the test. The regulations also require, among other things, that fuel tanks pass a leakage test and a flame test. The procedures for conducting the tests are detailed in the regulations.  Design  Important considerations in designing a diesel fuel tank are determining placement, choosing the shape and calculating the required volume. Side mounting is the most common placement of diesel tanks for trucks. This is typically accomplished with the use of brackets, straps or a combination of both for the purpose of attaching the fuel tank to the truck frame. The choice of shape is generally influenced by the need for maximum fuel capacity and the desire for a stylish look. The most common diesel tank designs are cylindrical, rectangular and D-Style tanks. Cylindrical designs are often selected for their visual appeal while the rectangular tank is most often employed to maximize fuel volume for a given space. The D-Tank, as its name implies, is actually a hybrid of the cylindrical and rectangular designs. It offers the curved visual appeal of a cylindrical tank with significantly more fuel volume. Replacing a cylindrical fuel tank with a D-Tank can result in 46% additional fuel capacity. When calculating volume requirements, one would begin by assessing the available space. Once length, width and height restrictions have been ascertained, the easiest method of determining volume is with the use of a truck tank volume calculator. Although basic mathematics can be applied to calculate the volume of a cylinder, calculating that of a rectangular tank is more complex due to the rounded corners. Designers must take into consideration the loss of volume due to the radius of rounded corners.  Construction  Material selection is one of the key considerations in producing fuel tanks. The three most common materials used in the manufacture of fuel tanks are aluminum, steel, and stainless steel. Regardless of the choice of material, the quality of the selection must be such as to allow that material to be malleable enough to be bent, rolled and stamped into formation. Aluminum alloy 5052 H32 is a popular choice for fuel tanks as it contains adequate magnesium content to allow the material to be pliable enough to meet the needs of the manufacturing process. The majority of diesel tanks manufactured today are made of steel; however truck operators may elect to choose aluminum fuel tanks when replacing older tanks on their vehicles. Aluminum offers advantages of lighter weight and resistance to corrosion. Proper weld is 1/4 inch wide The selection of steel and stainless steel should be that of prime grade material. An important consideration in manufacturing is choosing material suitable for stamping and bending. The material must be ductile enough to be bent and formed yet thick enough to provide strength and to accept a weld. This is especially true for tanks of a design that require sharp bends. The pattern for a fuel tank is generally cut using automated programmable machinery such as laser cutters, high definition plasma cutters or water jet cutters. These tools provide accuracy and process repeatability. Once cut, the manufacturer removes the dross left behind from the cutting process. The holes required for ports, filler tubes, vents etc. are generally created with the use of a punch press. At this stage in the process all the metal parts that make up the fuel tank are cut to shape, stamped with holes and are flat according to a pattern, ready to be shaped three-dimensionally. TIG weld is identifiable by its \\"stacked dime\\" appearance Next, the heads which are often referred to as the \\"end caps\\" are formed in a die using a stamping press. This applies to all fuel tanks regardless of shape ‚Äì D-Tanks, cylindrical or rectangular. The \\"body\\" of the diesel tank is then formed to fit around the heads. Cylindrical tanks are rolled in a roll forming machine while non-cylindrical tanks are bent on a press brake. Enlargement of a proper weld cross section At this point in the manufacturing process the parts have been cut, shaped and ready for welding. Although each step in the process is important, good welds are of particular significance because they hold the pieces together and prevent leaks when done correctly. The weld must be 1/4 inch wide and have deep penetration into the metal. A proper weld is continuous, convex in shape and exhibits no porosity.Propower Mfg. Inc. Ten Things To Know Before Buying A Fuel Tank The underlying objective in manufacturing a diesel tank is to build it in such a way as to hold fuel for the life of the tank from the day it is installed. This requires a quality assurance test to identify the possibility of leaks. A common procedure in the industry is to perform a pressure test on the tank. All holes are temporarily plugged and the fuel tank is pressurized with air. A gauge is used to monitor the air pressure. A drop in pressure reveals a leak in the tank. Many manufacturers have adopted statistical process control (SPC) as a method of measuring the integrity of fuel tanks. Typically, using SPC, the manufacturer will test samples from a production lot and draw conclusions from the statistical data. However some manufacturers strive for a zero-failure rate and test each tank as part of their quality program. Following a successful leak test the fuel tank is ready for cleaning with a \\"metal-prep\\" solution. This may be done by hand or by employing a multi-stage submersion method. The purpose is to clean away the oils and particles left behind from the manufacturing process to prepare the surface for painting. This applies primarily for steel tanks, but some aluminum tanks may also be painted. Stainless steel tanks are rarely painted due to their inherent corrosion resistant properties. The final step in the manufacturing process is to apply the coatings. All openings are plugged to prevent paint or other contaminants from entering the fuel tank. Some of the most common coatings include rust resistant enamel, epoxy paint or powder coating to protect against environmental elements. Once the coating has cured, the tank is ready to be installed on the truck.

The \\"Decapitated Generation\\" was a group of four young Ecuadorian poets in the first decades of the 20th century. Two men from Guayaquil, Medardo √Ångel Silva and Ernesto Noboa y Caama√±o, and two men from Quito, Arturo Borja and Humberto Fierro, were the precursors of modernismo in Ecuador. These four writers were greatly influenced by the modernist movement of Rub√©n Dar√≠o and by 19th- century French romantic poetry. Though they knew each other and dedicated poems to each other, they never met together to create a true literary group. The term \\"generaci√≥n decapitada\\" originated in the middle of the 20th century, when Ecuadorian journalists and historians decided to name them, noting similarities in the authors' poetry. Silva was the lowest class of the four poets, troubled by his dark skin and economic status. He did however attend a prestigious high school and work as a journalist at El Tel√©grafo, a major newspaper in the city. His poems reflect fantasy and a fascination with death. The cause of his own death is not certain; he died at 21 while visiting a young girlfriend. He is believed to have committed suicide, but may have been murdered as the result of a love triangle. Silva's poem \\"El alma en los labios\\" was made into a song and made famous by the Ecuadorian singer Julio Jaramillo.

GRSM is a member of the International New Thought Alliance.Board. Retrieved January 2, 2012. 100px  Teaching and practice  RS/SOM teaches that all beings are expressions of and part of Infinite Intelligence, also known as Spirit, Christ Consciousness, or God. It teaches that, because God is all there is in the universe (not just present in Heaven, or in assigned deities, as believed by traditional teachings), Its power can be used by all humans to the extent that they recognize and align themselves with Its presence. Ernest Holmes said \\"God is not ... a person, but a Universal Presence ... already in our own soul, already operating through our own consciousness.‚Äù The Introduction to \\"The Science of Mind\\" text describes \\"The Thing Itself\\" (God or Infinite Intelligence), \\"The Way It Works,\\" \\"What It Does,\\" and \\"How to Use It.\\" Holmes taught that \\"Love rules through Law.\\" (i.e. the Law of Mind or Cause and Effect) and \\"Love points the way and Law makes the way possible.\\" The \\"Law of Cause and Effect\\" simply states that every action has a consequence ‚Äî creative, destructive, or neutral. It can be described as Jesus Christ implied and what was also stated in parts of the Old Testament: you reap what you sow, the bread you cast upon the water comes back to you, and other expressions of that concept. The Law of Attraction is one aspect of that Law. It differs from the Hindu definition of karma in that it is not related to reincarnation and that it happens in this life. Personal responsibility is a major tenet of RS/SOM. RS/SOM teaches that people can achieve more fulfilling lives through the practice called Spiritual Mind Treatment (Treatment), or Affirmative Prayer. Spiritual Mind Treatment is a step-by-step process, in which one states the desired outcome as if it has already happened. In that way, it differs from traditional prayer, since it does not ask an entity separate from itself to act. It declares human partnership with Infinite Intelligence to achieve success. Treatment is to be stated as personal (first person), positive, powerful (with feeling), and present (is happening right now). The goal is to gain clarity in thinking that guides action to be consistent with the desired outcome. The Treatment is believed to set off a new chain of causation in Mind that leads one to act according to the good for which one is treating. Spiritual Mind Treatment, as currently taught in RS/SOM centers, contains five steps: Recognition, Unification, Realization, Thanksgiving, and Release. Some adherents of RS/SOM also use supplemental meditation techniques, including \\"Visioning\\" Global religious science ministries professional seminary The Seminary is the educational component of GRSM. It offers classroom training and informal study groups. The Seminary includes all accredited full-time and part-time programs offered by its members. Most GRSM educational programs are part-time evening courses that follow an academic school year. The early courses in the series may be facilitated by practitioners or ministers. Practitioner and ministerial courses are led by ministers. Students enrolled in the doctorate program are assigned a sponsor.

Evening Star (Washington, D.C.). September 13, 1928. p. 7. At the time, the location of the airport was called Halpine, Maryland; the area was later annexed by the City of Rockville. By May 1929, Younger Sales Company advertised that it was flying Heath Super Parasols out of Congressional Airport.\\"Younger Sales Company\\" (advertisement). Evening Star (Washington, D.C.). May 12, 1929. Part 4. p. 8. That same month, the airport expanded, leasing land from the adjacent farm of Peter Wagner, making it one of the largest airfields in Maryland. An 80-by-120 foot concrete hangar was built in 1929. Flights over Great Falls were advertised for five dollars in July 1929. Airport authorities requested to rezone two adjoining parcels of land from residential to commercial in order to build a fueling station and an administrative building for the airport, but the request was disapproved by the Board of Montgomery County Commissioners. During World War II, the First Fighter Command of the United States Air Force closed the airport to civilian flying from August 1942 to June 1945, because it was within the vital defense area. Capital Squadron 334 of the Civil Air Patrol operated at Congressional Airport.  Complaints  Nearby residents complained that pilots fly at low altitudes along Rockville Pike while approaching to land at the airport, causing a noise nuisance and an increasing the danger to residents. The United States Department of Commerce received more complaints about Congressional Airport than any other airstrip near Washington. At the time, the Montgomery County Commissioners did not have the legal authority to regulate the operation of airfields located in the county. The airport was built before Maryland required airstrips to be licensed at the state level, so the Maryland State Aviation Commission could not restrict its flight paths or operating times. In 1935, Maryland Governor Harry W. Nice signed a bill requiring all existing airstrips to apply for licenses and renew them every four years. The State Aviation Commission would be required to hold public hearings upon receipt of written protests from residents. Residents could also request an equity court proceeding in the event the license is renewed. When Congressional Airport asked the State Aviation Commission how to apply for a license two weeks later, nearby residents immediately protested and requested a hearing. In response, the owners filed a demurrer in the Montgomery County Circuit Court, saying the proper venue for residents' complaints is at the state level not the county level. The owners also said the residents were guilty of laches because the residents allowed the airport to operate for many years before filing a legal complaint. The court sustained the demurrer, ending the lawsuit, and the State Aviation Commission ended up issuing a license to the airport. In 1939, the Aviation Committee of the Maryland State Senate held a hearing about the residents' complaints. The State Aviation Commission defended its issuance of a license to Congressional Airport, saying that it could not disapprove the airport's application because the airport existed before the commission did. The state senatorial committee decided not to pursue further investigation of the Aviation Commission. Record In May 1936, Helen Richey, flying a light plane, set an international altitude record for aircraft weighing under . She reached during a flight from Congressional Airport to Endless Caverns Airport in New Market, Virginia. Richey flew the same plane that Benjamin King had flown to break the record previously. Possible expansion In 1938, Congressional Airport was one of several sites in consideration for the site of a commercial airport near Washington, D.C.. Ultimately President Franklin D. Roosevelt instead chose to build the commercial airport at Gravely Point, which became National Airport. Closing and redevelopment into a shopping center The post-World War II flying boom collapsed in 1949, causing financial trouble for the airport. The land facing Rockville Pike was rezoned to commercial zoning in 1950, allowing portions of the airport's land to be sold for storage buildings in 1951. The flight school closed in 1951, although the airport itself continued to operate. In 1952, a lease to operate the airport was signed over to the Civil Air Patrol's Western Squadron. In March 1953, the City of Rockville annexed 300 acres of land, including the airport itself. Most of the land was rezoned for residential apartments, townhouses, and single family houses. Most of Congressional Airport's land was sold to a developer, the Rockville Land Company, Inc., in April 1954. The developer planned to build about apartment buildings, 160 townhouses, and 280 single family houses. Arthur Hyde, who had owned all of the airport's land since 1945, retained ownership of the commercially zoned strip of land along Rockville Pike. In December 1955, it was announced that a 50-acre shopping center would be built on the former site of the airport. Named Congressional Plaza, it opened on March 12, 1959.\\"Firm Here Opens Maryland 'Center'\\". The Pittsburgh Press. March 12, 1959. p. 58. It had a Giant Food, a J.C. Penney, and an S.S. Kresge.

His history books are largely based on first-person accounts and primary documents, providing insight into the early settlement of Marietta, Ohio and the Northwest Territory and the lives of early pioneers.Johnson and Brown, Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, Vol. V.Wilson and Fiske, Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, Vol. III, 201.Silliman, American Journal of Science and Arts, 2nd Series, Vol. XXXVI, Nov. 1863, 312-13. Early life Samuel Prescott Hildreth was born in Methuen, Massachusetts on September 30, 1783. His father, Dr. Samuel Hildreth of Massachusetts, was a physician with a regiment of volunteers during the American Revolutionary War, served as surgeon aboard a privateer, and became a prisoner-of-war. Samuel Prescott Hildreth was educated at the Phillips Academy at Andover, Massachusetts. He began medical studies under his father, completed studies under care of Dr. Thomas Kittredge of Andover, and received his diploma in 1805 after examination by the Massachusetts Medical Society. He subsequently practiced medicine in Hampstead, New Hampshire until relocating to Ohio in 1806.Haverstock, Artists in Ohio, 406.Hildreth, Sketches of the Hildreth Family, 129-61. Massachusetts to Ohio His father, Samuel Hildreth, was a shareholder in the Ohio Company of Associates, and had considered moving to Ohio. Since he was a boy, Samuel Prescott Hildreth had a desire to see the Ohio Country; he acted on his desire at the age of 23, traveling by horseback to Marietta, Ohio during September and October 1806. He spent about nine weeks in Marietta, then traveled 15 miles down the Ohio River to Belpre, Ohio. In August 1807 he married Ms. Rhoda Cook in Belpre. They permanently resettled to Marietta in March 1808. Subsequently, during 1810 and 1811, Dr. Samuel Prescott Hildreth served on the Ohio legislature.Stevens and Murphy, Cincinnati Lancet and Observer, 582-84. His father, Dr. Samuel Hildreth of Massachusetts, died while visiting him in Ohio during 1823 and was buried at Mound Cemetery in Marietta.Hildreth, Sketches of the Hildreth Family, 58-59. Career In Marietta, Dr. Samuel Prescott Hildreth served as the town's doctor and pursued the study of local history, botany, and geology. Dr. Hildreth was noted as one of the first pioneers of science in the country west of the Alleghany Mountains. He exhibited \\"a remarkable genius in drawing. Insects and plants were represented with scrupulous accuracy, and engravings made from them have a permanent value\\". \\"Dr. Hildreth was distinguished for his industrious research, and his numerous and well-received publications on professional topics; on natural history; on the antiquities, the modern history, and the resources, of his Western home.\\"Salisbury, American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, October 21, 1863, 16. In addition to serving in the Ohio legislature, he also served on the Ohio Geologic Survey. Dr. Samuel Prescott Hildreth died in Marietta, Ohio on July 24, 1863 and was buried at Mound Cemetery in Marietta,Hawley, Mound Cemetery, 244. along with his father and with many Revolutionary War soldiers and founding pioneer settlers of Marietta and the Northwest Territory.

Scientific publications Dr. Hildreth was the author of numerous scientific publications. He was industrious, and provided many valuable contributions to medical journals from 1808 to 1825. \\"In 1808 he published in the New York Medical Repository, a history of an epidemic which had prevailed the previous year; also in 1812 a description of the American Colomba, with a figure of the plant; likewise in 1822, an article on Hydrophobia, and another on a curious case of Siamese twins, in his practice. In 1824 he published in the Philadelphia Journal of Medical Science, a full history of the Great Epidemic Fever that visited the Ohio Valley and Marietta in 1822 and 1823; and in 1825, in the Western Journal of Medicine, Cincinnati, an account of the minor diseases of the epidemic. In 1826, he published in Silliman's Journal of Science, New Haven, a series of articles on the Natural and Civil History of Washington County. From that time until his death, nearly forty years, he was a contributor to the Journal‚Äîsuch articles as descriptions and drawings of fresh-water shells found in the Muskingum and other streams, several upon geological subjects, touching upon the geology of Southeastern Ohio, the salt- bearing rock, the history of salt manufacture from the first settlement of Ohio, the coal formation, &c.;\\"Medical News and Library, Vol. XXI, No. 249, September 1863\\". The first volume of Archaeologia Americana, published in 1820, contains important letters on objects of antiquarian interest in the vicinity of Marietta, Ohio, from Dr. Hildreth; and soon after he made repeated contributions to the American Antiquarian Society relating to kindred subjects. He presented his scientific library and his collections in various departments of natural history, numbering about 4000 specimens, to Marietta College, Ohio, where they occupied a room known as the Hildreth Cabinet, and his manuscripts are known as the Samuel P. Hildreth Collection. Historical publications Dr. Hildreth authored several books concerning the early days of Ohio and the Northwest Territory, including: * Original Contributions to the 'American Pioneer', J. S. Williams, Cincinnati, Ohio (1844). * Pioneer History: Being an Account of the First Examinations of the Ohio Valley, and the Early Settlement of the Northwest Territory, H. W. Derby and Co., Cincinnati, Ohio (1848). * Biographical and Historical Memoirs of the Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, H. W. Derby and Co., Cincinnati, Ohio (1852). * Contributions to the Early History of the Northwest: including the Moravian Missions in Ohio, Poe and Hitchcock, Cincinnati, Ohio (1864). The book Pioneer History provides the early civil history of the Northwest Territory, while the Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio provides biographies of the earliest settlers.

It includes phenomenons such as agnosticism, atheism, nontheism, secular humanism, casual non-affiliation or apathy. Historically, the growth of irreligion in the UK has followed a European-wide pattern of secularisation. The first British census to gather data on religion, in 2001, showed that there were 7.7 million non-affiliated people in the country. The wording of the question was criticised by demographers, humanists, and secularist groups for use of a leading question (\\"What is your religion?\\"). This question continued in a revised format in the next census in 2011 counted 14.1 million irreligious people, which made irreligion the second-largest viewpoint on religion after Christianity, larger than the combined populations of non-Christian religions in the UK, and the category which underwent most growth between censuses. Other surveys, such as the annual British Social Attitudes Survey, which asks a different question than the Census (\\"Do you regard yourself as having a religion? If yes, which?\\"), frequently estimate that non-religious are in the majority (52% in 2019, compared to 38% Christian denominations). While non- affiliation is the primary indicator, objective irreligion does not necessarily correlate with it. 6% of Anglicans polled in a 2013 survey affirmatively did not believe in a god, while 15% of those with no religion believed in some higher power, and deemed themselves \\"spiritual\\" or even \\"religious.\\"Linda Woodhead, ‚ÄúNo Religion‚Äù is the New Religion, Westminster Faith Debates, 2013. 1700‚Äì1850 Organised activism for irreligion in the United Kingdom derived its roots from the legacy of British nonconformists. The South Place Religious Society, which would later become associated with the Ethical movement, was founded in 1793 as an organisation of Philadelphians or Universalists. In 1811 ‚ÄúThe Necessity of Atheism‚Äù was published by a young oxford student, Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was one of the first printed, open avowals of irreligion in England. The Oracle of Reason, the first avowedly- atheist periodical publication in British history, was published from 1841 to 1843 by Charles Southwell. It suffered from numerous imprisonments of its staff, including Southwell, George Holyoake and Thomas Paterson, for missives deemed \\"blasphemous\\" by the authorities (Holyoake was the last person in Britain convicted of blasphemy in a public lecture). Holyoake took to publishing The Movement (1842‚Äì1845) following his six-month sentence, which later became The Reasoner (1845‚Äì1860) and shifted to a larger focus on social issues facing the British working class, increasing the publication's readership. It was during this time that Holyoake developed his idea for the replacement of Christianity with an ethical system based upon science and reason, terming his proposal \\"secularism\\". 1850‚Äì1900 Charles Bradlaugh, Member of Parliament for Northampton and founder of the National Secular Society in 1866. George Holyoake's coining of the word secularism in 1851 offered the English-speaking world the clarification of the nascent movement for separation of religion and state. The National Secular Society, founded in 1866 by politician Charles Bradlaugh, spearheaded the advocacy for freeing citizens from absolute government requirements involving religious observances; the Leicester Secular Society was founded in 1851. Bradlaugh's 1880 election to Parliament brought on a decade-long dispute over the demanded right to affirm declarations of office rather than swear oaths, as he was denied his seat for five years by a ruling that he had no right to affirm and resolutions preventing him from swearing an oath. When Bradlaugh was ultimately admitted in 1886, he took up the issue and saw the Oaths Act 1888 passed, which confirmed the right to optionally affirm declarations for inaugurations to office and offering testimony to government bodies. In 1881, The Freethinker began circulation as Britain's longest-running humanist periodical. In 1896, the Union of Ethical Societies was formed in the United Kingdom by American Stanton Coit as a union of pre-existing British Ethical movement societies; this group would later become known as the Ethical Union and the British Humanist Association. In 1899, the Rational Press Association was formed by a group of free-thinkers including Charles Albert Watts and George Holyoake. Meanwhile, the South Place Religious Society became further aligned with organised secularist advocacy during the tenure of Moncure D. Conway as minister of the congregation; Conway, an American Unitarian minister who served from 1864‚Äì1885 and 1892‚Äì1897, moved the congregation further away from doctrinal Unitarianism, and spent the break in his tenure (during which Stanton Coit served in his stead) writing a biography of American revolutionary ideologue Thomas Paine. In 1888, the South Place Religious Society became the South Place Ethical Society, now known as the Conway Hall Ethical Society. 20th century Richard Dawkins has been a significant figure in irreligion since the 1970s The 1960s were a significant time for irreligion, as the Ethical Union rebranded as the British Humanist Association, which went on to co-found the International Humanist and Ethical Union and create a symbol for humanism, the Happy Human. Broadcasters such as Margaret K. Knight sensationalised Britain with open advocacy of non-religious values and secular education. Senior figures in the British humanist movement went out to take on leading roles in institutions such as UNESCO, the World Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization. John William Gott, a working man of Bradford, West Yorkshire, attacked religion, especially Christianity, seeing it as reducing the opportunity for a socialist revolution. His lectures on rationalism and scepticism, and anti-Christian pamphlets, saw him jailed for blasphemy in 1911. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was one of a group of Members of Parliament who proposed an ultimately unsuccessful piece of legislation to abolish blasphemy offences. Gott was jailed again ten years later for a pamphlet showing Jesus as a clown, and died in 1922 soon after his nine-month sentence which included hard labour despite his worsening physical condition. There was a public backlash against his sentence. Gott was the last Briton jailed for blasphemy, but the offence remained a technical crime through common law until being abolished in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who first came to prominence in 1976 following the release of The Selfish Gene, increasingly figured in British irreligion with the release of his 1986 work The Blind Watchmaker, in which he argued in favour of evolutionary natural selection as opposed to intelligent design and creationism. 21st century The City of Norwich, according to the United Kingdom's 2011 census, is the most irreligious local authority in England, with 42.5% professing no religious affiliation. In the 21st century, New Atheism became a popular topic of debate, support and critique in the United Kingdom. Dawkins' 2006 book The God Delusion and Christopher Hitchens' 2007 book God Is Not Great were considered emblematic works of the era among British authors, and Dawkins advocated for the Brights movement. The Atheist Bus Campaign was inaugurated during this time, in which advertisements on double-decker buses were purchased by the British Humanist Association in order to advocate non-belief in the supernatural; the campaign caused controversy and complaints to authorities, but soon spread to other countries and continents, taking root in the United States as a variety of atheist billboard campaigns. Atheism is expected to be the dominant position on the existence of God by 2038. A 2009 survey of 1,000 teenagers aged 13 to 18 reports that two-thirds of British teenagers do not believe in God. The rise in irreligion was confirmed in the UK's 2011 census, which saw irreligion rise from 7.7 million in 2001 to 14.1 million, a rise of 10.3 percentage points. The local authority with the highest level of irreligion was Norwich, the county town of Norfolk, where the level was 42.5%. Religion has the least influence on youth. According to the 2011 census, 25% of England has no religion, 7% of Northern Ireland, one third in Scotland and one-third of Wales. In 2015, over 110 Parliamentarians in the UK are members of the All- Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, which means the non-religious have substantial representation among MPs and Lords. According to YouGov, Christianity is perceived to be on the decline. Mori Polls have shown that British Christians support a secular state. Britons are amongst the most skeptical about religion. Statistics from the Office of National Statistics published in 2019 showed that the number of non-religious people in Britain has increased by 46% since 2011 (up to a total of 39% of the population), with over 8 million more people declaring that they do not belong to any religious group. As well as this, the figures also show a 15% decline in the number of people identifying as Christian. Humanists UK is the most prominent organisation espousing irreligion in Britons. The organisation supports the United Kingdom becoming a secular state.

C, 154th New York Infantry Regiment, who died at the Battle of Gettysburg with the photograph in his hands. The National Homestead at Gettysburg (located at 777 Baltimore Street) was the Gettysburg Orphanage, and a widows home, which opened in October 1866 (incorporated March 22, 1867) on the Gettysburg Battlefield along Steinwehr Avenue on the north foot of Cemetery Hill. History The facility was created by Dr. John F. Bourns after fundraising resulting from the identification of a Battle of Gettysburg casualty's children as Amos Humiston's. p. 70: The Humiston family subsequently resided at the homestead for 3 years until the widow remarried, when they relocated to Massachusetts. In 1867, Ulysses S. Grant was photographed with orphans at the entrance,The Star and Sentinel, Jun 26, 1867 and an 1870 Pennsylvania bill was used to fund the facility.Gettysburg Compiler, Jul 1, 1870 The beginning history of the homestead was prosperous, but after the initial head mistress was replaced by Rosa J. Carmichael, the history of the orphanage took a turn for the worse. Carmichael was a cruel disciplinarian who created a dungeon for disciplining children. This dungeon, along with the stories that accompany it have made the homestead notorious. Eventually, the orphanage was turned into the Soldiers National Museum that was once owned by actor Cliff Arquette, who narrated tours of the building, especially the dungeon. However, the museum has been closed to the public since November 2014. Hauntings The homestead also became a popular spot for paranormal investigators to go ghost hunting. In 2011, the Ghost Adventures crew spent the night in the basement during their lockdown, trying to communicate with Carmichael's ghost. It was also featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series, Most Terrifying Places which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019.https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/most- terrifying-places References External links * National Homestead at Gettysburg, 1866-1877: A Brief History Gettysburg Battlefield Orphanages in the United States 1866 establishments in Pennsylvania Buildings and structures in Adams County, Pennsylvania ","title":"National Homestead at Gettysburg"},{"id":"34258573","text":"St. Peter's Catholic Church, also known as Brush Creek Church, is a historic Roman Catholic church located near Rensselaer, Ralls County, Missouri.

World is a global civic organization that started from Estonia, mobilizing people worldwide in joining local, national and regional clean-up events. Among other projects, it is the founder of World Cleanup Day, on which a network of 180 countries, with over 21.2 million participants took place in 2019. The Let's Do It! organization was first conceived in Estonia in 2008, where a country clean-up action called Let's do it! (in Estonian: \\"Teeme √Ñra!\\") cleaned up tons of illegal waste by more than volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead, many countries also started their own country clean- up events. Let's Do It! World is an accredited member of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Since 2017, the movement uses the W sign aka \\"Three Fingers Up\\" as a symbol. History On 3 May 2008, over Estonians came out of their homes to clean up Estonia in an event called Let's Do It 2008. People at home could follow the process via media channels. The idea spread from Estonia to other parts of Europe and beyond. Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year. On 20 March 2010, Portugal cleaned their country with people. Slovenia followed shortly, breaking all records with people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action. In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned. By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people had participated in Let's Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries ‚Äì Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil. World Cleanup 2012 In 2012, starting from 24 March until 25 September, a series of cleanups happened around the globe, on all continents, bringing together millions of volunteers in 96 countries. The action was initiated on 24 March 2012 by volunteers in Slovenia and Portugal. To bring together doers and initiators and share existing experience ‚Äì Let's Do It! teams were organizing workshops and regional gatherings, introducing the World Cleanup 2012 around the world. Each group or organisation was leading the cleanup action in their country. Cleanup in Armenia.jpgArmenia Let's Do It!

Afghanistan, 2015 World Cleanup Day After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina, Kosovo on 6‚Äì9 February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole world from illegally dumped solid waste and to keep the planet clean. To reach this goal, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world's population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change. This resulted in the first World Cleanup Day on 15 September 2018. Around 15 million people in 158 countries took part in this global cleanup effort. It has been organized annually since then.

He was born in Cornwall, UK, in c. 1872. He had a wide repertoire ranging from opera and oratorio to the popular ballads of his day and was becoming well regarded as a soloist, when in 1903 at about the age of 30, his life was cut short by an accident whilst on tour in the USA. Professional career His earliest known professional connection was with the Carl Rosa Opera Company in England. From 1898 to 1899 he toured Australia with a concert company headed by Dame Emma Albani ‚Äì his first appearance there being on 16 March 1898. Secured by the Australian actor and theatre manager J.C. Williamson as principal baritone of his Royal Comic Opera Company (formed in 1880), Paull made his first appearance as King Henri in Paul Lac√¥me's op√©ra comique, Ma mie Rosette. He played a number of different parts with this company. Also on this tour he met his wife-to-be, Ethel Gordon, in Sydney. In Adelaide he then severed his connection with Williamson's company. His first USA appearance was in c.1900 as Wolfram in Wagner's Tannh√§user with the Metropolitan English Opera Company which was managed by Henry Wilson Savage and Maurice Grau. This company had been set up to perform operas in English. However after its failure he returned to England where he continued to work for Savage. In 1901 he joined the Castle Square Opera Company as leading baritone and toured the USA again. Ethel Gordon travelled 15,000 miles to marry him there. In 1902 he performed in two concerts conducted by Henry Wood at the Queen's Hall in London ‚Äì Wolfram's Tournament Song from Wagner's Tannh√§user, \\"Blick ich umher\\" (When I cast my eye around), Act 2, Scene 4 (13 January) and the cavatina from Gounod's Faust, \\"Avant de quitter ces lieux\\" (Even bravest heart may swell) Act 2 (31 January). He returned to the USA in 1903 and gave a number of concerts with the Castle Square Opera Company at the Century Theatre in St Louis. It was there on 5 February while staying at the Southern Hotel that he fell from his sixth floor window, and although his fall was broken by telegraph wires opposite the second floor, he never regained consciousness after hitting the ground. It was presumed that he had lost his balance while leaning from the window and so this was considered to have been an accident. Recordings In 1901 and 1902 he recorded approximately 70 single-sided records for the Gramophone & Typewriter Ltd (the forerunner of HMV) at their studio in 31 Maiden Lane, London WC2.

Charles I of Spain in 1530 named two members of the family, the Duke of B√©jar and Plasencia and the Count of Miranda del Casta√±ar, among his Immemorial Grandees, while eight members of the family were inducted into the Order of the Golden Fleece. Roots and Origin Sancho I√±iguez (1040-1110) was alf√©rez mayor (a hereditary court office held by high nobility of the king's banner bearer and high military commander) of Alfonso the Battler, King of Arag√≥n and Navarre, and lord of the estate and valley of Stunica (today Z√∫√±iga / Estuniga), located in the district of Estella in Navarre.

He changed his coat of arms from an eagle in sable (black) to a shield ground in gules (red), a chain of or (gold/yellow) with eight links, and one green emerald in its center.

She has served as mayor of San Juan since 2013. From 2009 through 2013, Cruz served in the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico. Early years and studies Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz Soto was born on February 25, 1963, in San Juan to Carmen Irene Soto Molina from Lares and Pedro Cruz Vega. She has a brother named Pedro Jos√© Cruz. Cruz inherited the second part of her given name, Yul√≠n, from her paternal grandmother, Lutgarda Vega. She graduated with honors from Julio Sell√©s Sol√° Elementary School and attended University of Puerto Rico Secondary School where she was president of the student council as well as a representative at a presidential youth summit. Cruz earned her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Boston University on May 30, 1984, graduating Cum Laude. She completed a Master of Science in Public Management and Policy at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University on May 12, 1986, where she became the first student to receive the Spirit Award (now called the Barbara Jenkins Award), given to a graduating student for service and contributions to the college and region. Political career First years in politics In 1992, Cruz returned to Puerto Rico and became an adviser to San Juan mayor Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n. She ran unsuccessfully for District 1 representative in the 2000 general elections. 2009‚Äì13: Representative Eight years later, Cruz ran again for the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, this time for an islandwide at-large seat, at the 2008 elections, after nomination in the PDP primaries. After being elected, Cruz became the PDP's Ranking Member on the Women Affairs Committee. Due to the high population of Dominican immigrants in the subdivisions of San Juan, most notably in Santurce, Cruz became involved with the Dominican American National Roundtable as a supporter. Upon launching her re-election campaign in 2011, she became the first candidate from her party to collect the required endorsements, presenting more than the 4,000 total within the time frame required to complete only 2,000. At the Popular Democratic Party primaries in 2012, Cruz led all of the candidates to the House of Representatives in votes, followed by fellow soberanista (sovereigntist) Luis Vega Ramos. On the original result, she had 217,162 votes counted, which surpassed the incumbent House of Representatives President Jennifer Gonz√°lez, with a reported 216,087 in the NPP primaries. 2012: Candidate for San Juan's mayorship Cruz Soto began hinting at her interest in running for the mayorship of her native city of San Juan in early 2011, but decided to step down when opposed by the conservadores, led by Popular Democratic Party president Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla, who named the second in- command of that wing, representative H√©ctor Ferrer, to occupy the position. However, her name resurfaced following the resignation of Ferrer, who was forced to abandon the race due to a domestic abuse incident which led to a formal investigation. Cruz' campaign headquarters two days before the 2012 elections Although Cruz initially denied that she was running for mayor of San Juan, on March 26, 2012, she announced her decision to accept the party's petition and challenge incumbent mayor Jorge Santini. In the media fallout that followed, Cruz was favored over Santini throughout the social networks, Facebook and Twitter, as reported by a specialist in media marketing. Likewise, she was favored in unofficial polls held by mainstream publications El Nuevo D√≠a (64% of 1,940 votes) and Primera Hora (120,041 vs. 34,588 or 77.3%). On March 28, 2012, Cruz was promoted to the position of PDP Minority Whip in the House of Representatives. Two days later, the PDP's San Juan Municipal Committee ratified her as their new president. In contrast to the majority of the candidates for any mayorship, she has expressed not believing in the \\"perpetuation of office\\", noting that eight years should be enough to fulfill a development plan, if executed correctly. On May 4, 2012, she attended a Service Employees International Union conference and held a meeting with Jim Messina, campaign director for President Barack Obama, to discuss health care and education funds, citing that \\"it is important to take stances in US politics, since half of all Puerto Ricans live there\\". During this visit, Cruz also negotiated the establishment of a Chicago-San Juan alliance with the Puerto Rican community there, led by congressman Luis Gutierrez. Carmen Yul√≠n has also expressed full support for LGBTT and women's rights. 2013‚Äìpresent: Mayor of San Juan Cruz was elected as the next Mayor of San Juan on November 6, 2012, defeating three term-incumbent Mayor Jorge Santini in the city's 2012 mayoral election. She became the third woman to hold San Juan's mayoral office, after Felisa Rinc√≥n de Gautier and Sila Calder√≥n. Cruz's administration continues her predecessor Jorge Santini's plans for the revitalization of the R√≠o Piedras district. The first phase of this plan consisted of the restoration of historic buildings in the subdivision. An economic plan spearheaded by Jos√© Rivera-Santana promoted incentives for housing and establishment of new businesses in R√≠o Piedras, in an attempt to salvage the economic importance that the district once had. This was complemented with direct communication and collaboration with the local community and several institutions, including the University of Puerto Rico. =Hurricane Maria= In September 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Cruz made frequent appearances on national and international television, criticizing Federal aid efforts for not getting the aid shipments into the hands of the people who needed them, accusing President Donald Trump and his administration of \\"killing us with inefficiency\\", and giving pleas for help in numerous media interviews. At a September 29 press conference Cruz said: > \\"We are dying here and I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation > in the world cannot figure out logistics for a small island of 100 miles by > 35 miles long... People are drinking off a creek. So I am done being polite. > I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell... So I am asking the > members of the press, to send a mayday call all over the world. We are dying > here... And if it doesn't stop, and if we don't get the food and the water > into people's hands, what we are going to see is something close to a > genocide\\". Speaking on Fox News, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Brock Long responded to Cruz's remarks saying that unity of command was the main thing needed for the relief effort to be successful, and suggested the mayor needed to go to the joint field office and \\"get plugged in\\". Responding to her statements, President Trump tweeted, \\"The mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump. Such poor leadership ability by the mayor of San Juan and others in Puerto Rico who are not able to get their workers to help.\\" Many legislators responded to Cruz's comments and the Trump tweets. Speaking on CNN, Rep. Al Green said that he saw undertones of racism in the President's remarks. \\"If they were all Anglos, I don't believe the President would have the attitude that he has, because you don't hear that kind of dog whistle, of people not wanting to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, when the people are Anglos. That's something reserved for people of color.\\" In tweets Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called Trump's remarks \\"offensive\\" and Sen. Ed Markey said that the President needed to apologize to the people of Puerto Rico, saying, \\"\\"The definition of 'poor leadership' is sitting at your golf club while millions of US citizens beg for your help, @realDonaldTrump,\\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Puerto Rico was in \\"crisis\\" and Trump should \\"stop playing politics with their lives.\\" Rep. Don Beyer writing the President \\"focused on aid efforts in TX & FL but ignored Puerto Rico. Now you attack San Juan's mayor for saying 'people are dying.' THEY ARE DYING.\\" 2020 gubernatorial campaign In March 2019, Cruz announced her candidacy for governor in the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) primaries for the 2020 elections. In a three- way race she failed to secure the PDP nomination, finishing third behind Isabela mayor Carlos Delgado Altieri. Other activities On 21 February 2019, Cruz announced that she was joining Senator Bernie Sanders' Presidential campaign as one of its four national co-chairs.  Awards  Cruz has received numerous recognitions and awards, including the Martin Luther King Centre Justice, Peace and Freedom Award and Humanitarian Leadership Award in 2018, the Antonio Villaraigosa Leadership Award in 2018, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation Humanitarian Award 2017, and the Puerto Rico Arts Alliance Felisa Rinc√≥n Legacy Public Service Award. She was also nominated by People en Espa√±ol as one of the 50 most Powerful Women in 2017, and TIME Magazine chose her as candidate for Person of the Year recognition in 2017. This year, she was on the TIME Magazine list of the 100 most Influential People in the World, received the prestigious Ridenhour Truth-Telling Award, as well as Casa de Esperanza's Award for Inspirational leadership, the Hank Aaron Champion of Justice Award, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Award for Economic Justice, and she was also in ESSENCE Magazine's Woke 100 Women list as well. Personal life Cruz married psychologist and University of Sacred Heart professor Alfredo Carrasquillo on September 25, 2010, three months after their relationship started. They divorced a year later, but remarried in 2013 and divorced in 2017. Cruz has a daughter, Marina Yul√≠n Paul Cruz, from a previous marriage.

It is located east of Cle Elum and west of Ellensburg. The surrounding area is known as the Teanaway River Valley. History The Teanaway River Valley was first inhabited by members of the Yakama, Cayous, and Nez Perce Indian Tribes. It was part of the summering grounds for these tribes, where they came to gather food. Teanaway was platted in 1885. Geography and climate The Teanaway River Valley is home to the Teanaway River, which has three forks: the North Fork, Middle Fork, and West Fork. The Teanaway River Valley is separated from the town of Cle Elum by Cle Elum Ridge. Teanaway is home to one of the few confirmed wild wolf populations in the State of Washington. Like all of Eastern Washington, the Teanaway Valley sits in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains. Most overcast conditions to the west don't make it over, leaving this area sunnier than those areas to the west. The area is also subject to temperatures that are colder in the winter, and warmer in the summer, than those areas to the west (such as Seattle), and is also drier.  Economy  A large solar plant was planned for the Teanaway area. The project has since been cancelled.  Transport  Highway 10 and highway 970 meet in Teanaway. Highway 970 runs through the valley.

It was established in 2005 to undertake campus-safety projects and raise awareness of crimes in the MIT area. It rebroadcasts police radio transmissions online, assembles police-log compilations, and constructs crime maps. In 2009 the club hired two private detectives to investigate the murder of a drug dealer in a Harvard residence hall. They were arrested and prosecuted; the case was dismissed before trial. The club later contributed to a Snapped: Killer Couples television episode about the murder.  History  The MIT Crime Club was established by two MIT students in 2005. Harvard students have also joined the group. On June 2, 2009, a Boston Globe correspondent wrote that MIT's news office said MIT did not know of any crime club at the school. In August, a staff writer at Boston magazine reported that the club was an MIT-authorized group with a membership of five MIT students and one or more graduates.  Activities  The group compiles incident data from police logs, constructs crime maps, and rebroadcasts MIT, Harvard, and Cambridge police radio transmissions online. Members have written weekly police-log compilations for MIT's newspaper, The Tech. In 2009 the group awarded an MIT dormitory a \\"Sparky the Fire Dog Award for Not Setting Off as Many Fire Alarms as Last Year\\". In 2010 the group sponsored and hosted an MIT event, the MIT Security Workers Solidarity Gathering, where the patrol officers' union discussed upcoming negotiations. In September 2011 the Cambridge City Council adopted a resolution thanking the members for sponsoring bicycle theft-prevention workshops and so forth. \\"Club members have for six years furnished MIT students with technology and data of value in safeguarding their persons and property ...\\"Cambridge, Mass., Res. 37 of Sept. 26, 2011.

On May 30, 2009, the group hired a private-detective team to investigate security at Harvard University after a marijuana dealer was shot to death in a dormitory basement. The detective and his assistant were arrested by university police and prosecuted on charges of breaking and entering and trespass. A Massachusetts District Court judge dismissed the case before trial, finding that the evidence offered by the prosecutors was legally insufficient to convict the defendants.Judgment of Dismissal, PI Magazine, a trade journal, said of the ruling: > One apparent implication is that investigators may take photographs in > residential common areas at universities without being subject to immediate > arrest.

It was built in 1925 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History of Pennytown The community Today the church is all that remains of the small freedman's hamlet of Pennytown. The community was founded around 1871 by Joseph Penny, a former slave who moved to Saline County, Missouri from Kentucky shortly after the American Civil War. He used his life savings to purchase an eight-acre tract of land, intending it as a place of refuge and new beginnings for recently freed slaves. Penny divided the eight acres into building lots, selling them to newly arrived residents at affordable prices. Other freed slaves purchased small tracts of land around the village as well so that by 1879 the size of the community had increased about forty families and sixty-four acres. By 1880 Pennytown had a population of around 200 African-Americans residing there, with a school, two churches, a blacksmith shop and other businesses. While other freedmen's settlements suffered from predation by land speculators and unscrupulous neighbors, Pennytown largely avoided such chicanery. This was mostly due to Joseph Penny's insistence that residents hold clear legal title to their properties. Because they owned the land upon which they lived, Pennytown residents were able to avoid the pitfalls and abuses of sharecropping that befell many former slaves in the postbellum era. Instead, the men of the community were able to earn wages as laborers on area farms and in Marshall. The women largely worked too, as domestic help. With the working age adults gone most of the day, the older members of Pennytown served as caregivers for the children in a communal arrangement. Pennytown began to lose population in the 1920s as more farms began using machinery thus reducing the need for hired labor. The Great Depression in the 1930s further destroyed work opportunities in and around the rural community. The last family moved away from Pennytown in 1943, leaving only a few elderly residents who remained until their deaths. The church In 1886 a white neighbor donated a half-acre plot of land to be used for a house of worship. Prior to that time various homes in the community had been used for church services or, weather permitting, in neighboring brush arbors. A simple wood frame church was erected on the current spot, but it was destroyed by fire in 1924. It was replaced with the current tile block structure built in 1925-1926. Not having the funds for materials to construct a new church all at once, over a period of months church members would purchase a few tile blocks at a time as money allowed and stacked them on the site. Finally in the fall of 1925 the foundation was laid. The majority of the construction was done by the men of the community and the church over the succeeding months. At first lighting in the completed church was provided by a large suspended carbide lamp. Later, kerosene lamps were added to holders along the walls. Through the mid-20th century as the village population of Pennytown dwindled the church building also deteriorated. By the 1980s the church was in a serious state of disrepair. Vandals had broken the few windows while the sometimes harsh Missouri weather had badly damaged the roof and foundation. Despite its poor condition, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places largely due to the efforts of historian and former Pennytown resident Josephine Robinson Lawrence. Funds for repair and renovation were raised from locally and from across the U.S. by sales of a Pennytown cookbook, raffles, and bake sales, with $18,000 collected by 1994. This was used to help match a Historic Preservation Fund grant from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources in early 1995. By 1996 the restoration activity was largely complete. A new foundation was constructed, new windows and doors added, the original tile blocks reconstructed, a new roof added, and the interior was refurbished with painting, drywall, and a new wood plank floor. The building is maintained today by a volunteer organization, Friends of Pennytown Historic Site. An annual reunion, or Homecoming, of former residents and their descendants is held the first weekend of August. The Homecoming tradition started shortly after the end World War II as the former residents, now scattered all across the Midwest and nation, longed to stay connected to their roots. Adjacent to the church, but no longer part of the property or the historic site, is a natural pond that was used for baptisms during the active years of the church. A large pole- mounted sign on the property explains the history of the community and the church.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. It was first collected by Valery Havard in 1880 and was described by William Trelease in 1911. This plant is a succulent shrub with a trunk up to a meter long growing erect or reclining. The shiny, bright green, fibrous leaves are narrow, long, and pointed, growing up to 80 centimeters long by 2.5 wide. The margins have prickles. Mature specimens may wear a sheath of dead leaves from previous seasons around the trunk. The inflorescence is about 30 centimeters long and is borne atop a stalk which can reach five meters in height. The species is dioecious, with male and female reproductive structures on separate individuals. The many tiny flowers have whitish or greenish tepals about 2 millimeters in length. The fruit is a three-winged capsule under a centimeter in length. The plants reproduce by seed and vegetatively by sprouting from buds located at the leaf bases. This plant is native to the Chihuahuan Desert where it is dominant in a number of plant communities, often occurring with lechuguilla and walnut. It grows in woodlands and desert grasslands, often on calcareous substrates, and generally only in dry areas. Other plant species in the habitat may include prickly pear, yucca, nolina, Pinchot juniper, wavyleaf oak, skeleton goldeye, curlyleaf muhly, grama grasses, threeawns, and slim tridens. Mature individuals of this species can ignite and burn for hours if hit by lightning. Fire can then spread through the habitat if the burning top of the plant falls off and rolls down a hill. After the plant burns it can sometimes resprout from the buds at the leaf bases. This species of Dasylirion is one of several members of the genus to be used in the production of the Mexican spirit mezcal, despite it not being an Agave.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Smith County, is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark and a Tyler Historical Landmark. History This Victorian house, with touches of Italianate and Eastlake architecture, was built 1878‚Äì1880 by Harrison Moores Whitaker, a local attorney. The two-story cypress and pine house was constructed on a brick foundation. The first floor consists of the main foyer and living room, one bedroom and bath, plus the kitchen and dining room. Four more bedrooms and two baths are on the second floor. In 1910, ionic columns were added to support the portico. Also added in 1910 was a second- story bedroom with its own separate bathroom, and fronted by a porch. The two- acre parcel of land it sits on once belonged to James Pinckney Henderson, the first governor of Texas. When Whitaker married Mattie, the daughter of Texas Supreme Court justice Micajah H. Bonner, the justice purchased the land as a wedding gift for the newlyweds. Mattie died in 1892. When Mattie's husband remarried in 1903, he relocated to Jefferson County and died there in 1922. Whitaker rented out the house after his relocation to Jefferson County. The house was purchased in 1907 by Anne and Sidney Smith McClendon, the sister and brother-in-law of Mattie Whitaker. White House correspondent Sarah McClendon was born in this house in 1910, the youngest of nine children born to Sidney and Annie McClendon.

One of the world's best-known guitars, it symbolizes the psychedelic era. Clapton used the guitar extensively while playing with Cream and it was an essential element of his famed \\"woman tone\\". From the 1970s to early 1980s, the guitar was owned by Todd Rundgren, who was often seen playing the instrument in his live performances. He nicknamed the guitar \\"Sunny\\", after the Cream song \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". History The Fool, a \\"psychedelic fantasy\\", according to Clapton, was the brainchild of who, along with , was a founding member of The Fool collective. In early 1967, the collective were contacted by Robert Stigwood, then manager of Cream, to work on instruments and costumes for the band, which was about to leave London for a tour of the United States. Koger and Postuma painted Clapton's Gibson SG, a drum kit for Ginger Baker, and a Fender Bass VI for Jack Bruce, which he did not like very much and played only on TV performances. The guitar made its debut as Cream played their first show in the United States on 25 March 1967 at the RKO theater on 58th Street, Manhattan, where Cream and The Who played a series of shows headlined by Mitch Ryder and promoted by Murray the K. Clapton used the guitar for most of Cream's recordings after Fresh Cream, particularly on Disraeli Gears, until the band broke up in 1968. After Clapton it passed to Jackie Lomax, who may have acquired it from George Harrison. It then passed to Todd Rundgren, who had seen Clapton play it during Cream's show at the RKO Theater and was \\"mesmerized\\" by it. Rundgren reportedly paid $500 for the guitar and had various repairs done to it. He had the guitar finished anew and retouched in places, and a portion of the neck and headstock was replaced. Rundgren sold the guitar in 2000 at auction for around $150,000 to pay off a tax debt, donating 10% to Clapton's Crossroads Centre. The Fool was resold to a private collector a few years later for around $500,000. The Fool has had other work done: some of the control knobs have been replaced and, most notably, the original trapeze-style tailpiece was replaced with a stop-tailpiece. The guitar now has Grover tuners rather than the original Klusons. Execution Koger and Postuma sanded Clapton's 1964 SG Standard (not, as is found in various sources, a 1961 model, and not an SG Special) and painted it with oil- based enamel paint in the \\"gaudy dayglo colours of the day\\". As Koger explained, \\"the single thread running through all of my paintings is nostalgia for paradise.\\" The theme of the SG's design is \\"good versus evil, heaven versus hell, and the power of music in the universe to rise above it all as a force of good\\". The centrepiece on the face is a cherub holding a triangle, surrounded by yellow stars on a celestial blue background (\\"a Fool hallmark\\"). The angel's curly hairstyle was inspired by Clapton's hairstyle at the time. Flames come up from the bottom of the guitar (the treble bout with the volume and tone controls) and the bass point has rainbow-coloured arcs. The pick guard contains a landscape with mountains and a red sun on the horizon, a \\"Dutch miniature\\" representing paradise. On the back, coloured concentric circles are surrounded by coloured waves. Cultural significance Clapton's guitar is a key relic of the psychedelic fashion and design fad that flourished from the mid-to-late 1960s. This cultural movement featured the work of The Fool design collective prominently. The Fool's signature style featured highly colourful creations often drawing on Indian spiritual culture. This trend rapidly gained international recognition, mainly thanks to its adoption by the popular bands including The Beatles, Donovan, The Rolling Stones, Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Procol Harum. The Fool SG remains a significant and highly valuable guitar and, alongside George Harrison's \\"Rocky\\" guitar, it is one of the few original instruments of the British psychedelic music period to have survived relatively intact. Woman tone The Fool is an essential part of what Clapton called the \\"woman tone\\", \\"a sweet sound ... more like the human voice than the guitar\\". Clapton demonstrated the Woman Tone in a videotaped interview in 1968 included in the BBC movie from their final Royal Albert Hall farewell concerts, using The Fool SG and a Marshall amplifier; he said it is accomplished by turning the tone way down and the volume full up, and it is exemplified in the opening and the guitar solo of \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\".

The neighboring villages are Bhonikey, Rore, Taragarh, Khudian, Chak 41, Jaguwala and Kot Het Ram. History Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563‚Äì1606) fifth Sikh Guru was touring the Nakka area of Punjab located between river Ravi and river Sutlej with some of his Sikhs. Sandhu Jatt Chaudhary Hem Raj (Chieftain) of Baherwal Kalan respected and served Guru Arjan Dev Ji. The Guru blessed him saying that his descendants will be great Chieftains of that area. Guru Sahib left for Jamber Kalan Village near Bhai Phero Town.  Nakai Misl  Sardar Hira Singh (1706‚Äì1767), a Sandhu Jatt descendant of Chaudhary Hem Raj, took the area from the Afghans in 1748. In 1749 he took Dipalpur, Okara, Kanganpur Afghans and Gogaira from chaudhri Kamar Singh Sandhu. He had taken Amrit Sanchaar (Sikh Initiation) in 1731 from Nawab Kapur Singh, the leader of the Sikh confederacy in the Punjab. He named his territory Nakai Misl after the 'Nakka' name of area. He also built an army from neighboring villages around Baherwal Kalan. Baherwal was Hira Singh Nakai's capital. During an expedition to Pakpattan City, he was shot and killed by Muslim forces in 1767. His army cremated his body in his native Village. He had a son, Dal Singh, who was still a young boy, so his nephew, Nar Singh, became the next Chieftain. Nar Singh was killed in 1768 by the Kharal Jats of Kot Kumaliah. His son Sardar Ran Singh (d.1781) became the next leader. After Ran Singh's death in 1781, his son, Sardar Bhagwan Singh Nakai, became ruler until his death in 1789. He was succeeded by his brother Gyan Singh Nakai, who in 1798 married his sister Raj Kaur (d.1838) to Maharaja Ranjit Singh at a young age. She assumed the name Maharani Datar Kaur after marriage to distinguish from a mother of Ranjit Singh. After Gyan Singh Nakai's death in 1807, Kahan Singh became the next and final ruler. In 1810 Maharaja Ranjit Singh annexed their territories and granted the Jagir of Baherwal to Kahan Singh. Sardar Kahan Singh Nakai did not take active interest in politics after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He continued to live in Baherwal till his death in 1873.  Descendants of Nakai Misl  Their descendants achieved much fame during British Rule (1849‚Äì1947). In the early 20th century, Sardar Ishar Singh Nakai of Baherwal Kalan, married a Muslim woman and converted to Islam. He took the name Abdul Aziz Nakai. His grandson was Sardar Muhammad Arif Nakai Sandhu, a noted Pakistani politician who rose to become the Chief Minister of Punjab. He died on February 29, 2000. During the partition in 1947, the Sikh zamindars and landlords and Hindu bankers and grocery shop owners left for East Punjab India and the Muhajirs Muslims from Delhi migrated to Pakistan Kasur.

There is no consensus among economists on a precise operational definition for fiscal sustainability, rather different studies use their own, often similar, definitions. However, the European Commission defines public finance sustainability as: the ability of a government to sustain its current spending, tax and other policies in the long run without threatening the government's solvency or without defaulting on some of the government's liabilities or promised expenditures. Many countries and research institutes have published reports which assess the sustainability of fiscal policies based on long-run projections of country's public finances (see for example,Sustainability report 2009. European Commission.The Long-Term Budget Outlook, 2010 The United States Congressional Budget Office. and Office for Budget Responsibility (United Kingdom), 2011. Fiscal sustainability report ‚Äì July 2011.). These assessments attempt to determine whether an adjustment to current fiscal policies that is required to reconcile projected revenues with projected expenditures. The size of the required adjustment is given with measures such as the Fiscal gap. In empirical works, weak and strong fiscal sustainability are distinguished. Differences are related to both econometric techniques used for examination and variables involvedWysocki, Maciej, and Cezary W√≥jcik. \\"Sustainability of fiscal policy in Poland in the period 2004‚Äì2017.\\" International Journal of Management and Economics 54.3 (2018): 219-226.. Government's inter-temporal budget constraint There is no consensus among economists about the correct criterion/definition to be used for fiscal sustainability. The most commonly used criterion is the government's inter-temporal budget constraint or inter-temporal equilibrium condition: : B_t = \\\\sum_{i=1} ^ {\\\\infin} (1+r)^{-i} PB_{t+i} , where B_t is the stock of public debt, r is the interest rate of public debt and {PB}_t is the primary balance (negative of primary deficit or government revenues minus government expenditures excluding interest expenditure). The government's inter-temporal budget constraint states that the initial debt level should be equal to the present value of future surpluses. That is, the government debt must be backed by expected future cash flows. Many economists have voiced grave concerns over using inter-temporal budget constraint as a de facto definition or criterion for fiscal sustainability.Roubini, N., 2001. Debt Sustainability: How to Assess Whether a Country is Insolvent. Also, it has been shown that under plausible assumptions the inter-temporal budget constraint is in fact not the correct criterion for sustainability. Indicators of fiscal sustainability There are many different indicators of fiscal sustainability. The indicators measure the fiscal adjustment required to bring public finances back to sustainable track. Specifics of the indicator depend on the operational definition of fiscal sustainability and the underlying economic modelling framework employed in a study. Some of the most commonly used indicators are so-called tax gaps. For example, the infinite horizon tax gap, or S2 sustainability indicator in European Commission phraseology is defined as: : ITGAP = \\\\frac{(r-g) (b_t - \\\\sum_{i=1} ^ {\\\\infin} (\\\\frac{1+g}{1+r})^{i} pb_{t+i})}{1+g} where b_t is the debt-to-GDP ratio, r is the interest rate of government debt, g is the growth rate of the economy and pb_t is the primary balance to GDP ratio. The infinite horizon tax gap gives the adjustment required to satisfy the inter-temporal budget constraint in terms of a permanent one-time change to projected path of primary balance to GDP ratios. Thus, if ITGAP = 5%, primary balance must be greater than projected by 5% of GDP for each future year. This could be achieved by permanently raising taxes or cutting expenditures 5% of GDP. For derivations and more information, see for example, or.  Fiscal sustainability challenges  There are numerous challenges and threats to the sustainability of public finance which can range from institutional challenges ranging from creating independent fiscal institutions, fiscal responsibility laws, fiscal rules and the management of fiscal risks to changing dynamics in the demographic structure of societies. Although these factors are significant, the core indicator of outstanding government debt in proportion to GDP is the go to metric for analyzing the health of a country's public finance sector. If a country does suffer from a high proportion of outstanding government debt then it is very vulnerable to interest shocks and a negative growth rate. For EU member states in 2016, the expected government debt to GDP ratio is above the 60%. This is expected to change with the strong support of financial independent institutions assuming that they respect the SGP rules Additionally, reforms that address the root causes of risks to fiscal responsibility take into account the costs of aging and their components.  Institutional factors  Independent fiscal institutions which act responsibly are key for maintaining fiscal responsibility but often these institutions are created or further developed in response to crises instead of proactively preventing it. For example, during the great recession new fiscal rules were introduced to counteract debt accumulation. The question can be raised whether these economies are sustainable in the short run due to economic shocks and in the long run due to endemic problems in the structure of the system. The major challenges of the public finance sustainability consist of creating independent fiscal institutions, fiscal responsibility laws, fiscal rules and the management of fiscal risks. A few key factors for creating stability through institutions which have been leveraged by EU member states are the following activities which the majority of fiscal councils have enacted: * Monitor fiscal performance (by checking compliance with the fiscal rules, assessing the efficiency of taxation) * Advise the government on fiscal policy matters (by publishing opinions and recommendations on fiscal policy) * Analyse the stance of the fiscal policy, both ex post by comparing the realities with the assumed targets and ex ante by evaluating the impact of fiscal policy measures to be implemented.  Demographic impacts on fiscal sustainability  The trend of demographic aging presents a major challenge to the industrialized world and an increasing number of developing countries. Recent projections developed by the UN Population Division estimate a 40 percent increase in world population and 7.8 years increase in the median age over the next 40 years. Fiscal sustainability is considerably impacted by this phenomenon but this can be triggered multiple ways. For example, shocks such as war and mass migration can dramatically alter the demographic composition of a society. In the industrialized world this trend is driven by simultaneous decreasing fertility and increasing longevity. = Old-Age Dependency Ratio = One economic indicator that is used to illustrate the share of economically inactive people in society is the old age dependency ratio. The dependency ratio is an age to population ratio of those not typically in the labor force with individuals between 0-14 and 65+ comprising the dependent part individuals between 15-64 measured as the productive part. This ratio is significant for determining the pressure on exerted on the productive population by the dependent population. Although longevity is an arguably positive outcome, when paired with a decline in fertility it can create higher financial stress on working people. Key aspects that influence the age-dependency ratio: * The type of aging - decreasing fertility or increasing longevity * The type of unfunded social security system * regulation of retirement age  Political barriers for fiscal sustainability  Political actors often get in the way of financial stability due to competing interests between stakeholders that have a lot to gain through not implementing changes that would benefit society as a whole. One example of this is the financial sector in EU non Eurozone member states which benefit from trading currencies and would lose a large part of their income should their country join the eurozone. Creating independent fiscal institutions keeps these instruments out of the reach of political actors that would seek to use them for their personal benefit. = Potential for reform = The potential for states to reform their fiscal policy to ensure sustainability is typically oriented around institutional independence and covering the cost of aging over a longer time horizon. As public pension spending is the most affected by the demographic shift of aging at the EU level accounts for 11% of GDP it is critical to develop reforms that anticipate this trend. Although there is a large variation between the composition of the welfare state between member states which is reflected across current expenditure levels and projected changes to spending, states are uses a number of measures to combat this trend. The two main categories of reform in the area of pensions are altering the age eligibility for pension benefits or altering the coverage of the benefits and adjusting the size of the benefits. Altering the age eligibility for pensions can be done through legislation through increasing statutory retirement ages or it can be achieved through nudging whereby incentives are given to individuals that postpone retirement. Adjusting the size of the benefits entails reducing the benefit ratio, i.e. \\"the generosity of pension entitlements\\". These reforms can stabilize public pension expenditure but it has the potential to create tension and instability politically.

The ethnic violence which swept Chinatown resulted in four deaths and the destruction of more than $100,000 worth of property belonging to the city's Chinese immigrant population. History Background From 1873 through the rest of the 1870s a severe economic crisis swept the United States of America known to history as the Long Depression. Economic contraction in the eastern United States proved the motivation for many to pull up stakes and try to reestablish themselves in the West coast mecca of California. Indeed, between the years 1873 and 1875 an estimated 150,000 workers made their way to the \\"Golden State,\\" many of whom settled in the state's only metropolis, San Francisco.Selig Perlman, \\"The Anti-Chinese Agitation in California,\\" in John R. Commons, et al., History of Labour in the United States. New York: Macmillan, 1918; vol. 2, pg. 253. By 1877 the depression that had already long plagued the East Coast arrived on the West Coast as well, and San Francisco's unemployment rate skyrocketed. There was no city or state central labor authority, no government provision for unemployed workers, and discontent was rampant. A meeting was called for the evening of July 23, 1877, by the fledgling Workingmen's Party of the United States to agitate on behalf of the needs of the labor movement and those of unemployed workers in particular. City authorities granted permission for the gathering, which was to be held on vacant lots adjoining the new San Francisco City Hall. As the day of the scheduled mass meeting arrived rumors were rampant in the city, including one that arson was being planned to destroy the docks of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company ‚Äì the chief mode of transport of immigrant workers from China to the USA ‚Äì as well as an attack on the city's Chinese quarter. Nevertheless, no city officials or political leaders attempted to intervene and the July 23 meeting proceeded as scheduled. The riot Nearly 8,000 people turned up for the socialist meeting at the so-called \\"sand-lots\\" in front of City Hall. Several representatives of the Workingmen's Party addressed the throng on the labor question, but none of them so much as mentioned the city's Chinese population, let alone attempted to lay blame upon them as the cause of the unemployment problem. Historian Selig Perlman recounts the origin of the riot which followed: > \\"Everything was orderly until an anti-coolie procession pushed its way into > the audience and insisted that the speakers say something about the Chinese. > This was refused and thereupon the crowd which had gathered on the outskirts > of the meeting attacked a passing Chinaman and started the cry, 'On to > Chinatown.'\\" Mayhem ensued, resulting in a two-day riot which claimed four lives and inflicted more than $100,000 worth of property damage upon the city's Chinese immigrant population. Twenty Chinese-owned laundries were destroyed in the violence and San Francisco's Chinese Methodist Mission suffered smashed glass when the mob pelted it with rocks.Chris Carlsson, \\"The Workingmen‚Äôs Party and The Dennis Kearney Agitation: Historical Essay,\\" Found SF, 1995, www.foundsf.org/ The ethnic violence was only halted on the night of July 24 through the combined efforts of police, the state militia, and as many as 1,000 members of citizen's vigilance committee, each armed with a hickory pickaxe handle.Perlman, \\"The Anti-Chinese Agitation in California,\\" pp. 253-254. Aftermath and legacy Denis Kearney, a nativist immigrant from Ireland, was drawn into political activism as a result of the 1877 San Francisco riot. The July 1877 San Francisco riot's suppression did not mark the end of anti-Chinese activity in the city, but rather the beginning. One of those who had served in the so-called \\"Pick-Handle Brigade\\" which had helped to quell the rioting, an Irish wagon-driver named Denis Kearney, was drawn into political activity by the July events.Perlman, \\"The Anti-Chinese Agitation in California,\\" pg. 254. Kearney first applied for membership in the Workingmen's Party (later known as the Socialist Labor Party of America), but was denied on the basis of his outspoken public views on what he considered the \\"laziness\\" and \\"shiftlessness\\" of the working class. Stymied from membership in the existing opposition political party, Kearney started a new organization of his own, the Workingmen's Trade and Labor Union of San Francisco, which made use of the mobilizing slogan \\"The Chinamen Must Go!\\" This organization changed its name in October 1877 to the Workingmen's Party of California, of which Kearney served as president.Perlman, \\"The Anti-Chinese Agitation in California,\\" pg. 255. The new party retained the anti-Chinese focus and slogans of the earlier organization. Anti-Chinese sentiment spread throughout the United States, culminating in the effective termination of importation of Chinese workers through passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.

Series creator Adam Reed later clarified the situation. He explained that while FX had intended the second set of episodes to be 13 episodes, he had believed that he was only going to be producing a further 10 episodes (with the first three episodes completing the standard order of 13 episodes). While he attempted to produce the full 16 episodes after he realized his error, it soon became clear that it would be impossible to produce three additional episodes. The order was eventually reduced to 13 episodes.

Ram√≠rez de Ferrer (b. 1941 in Caguas, Puerto Rico) is a Puerto Rican leader, medical doctor, politician, and former Senator. She was a member of the Senate of Puerto Rico from 2001-05.  Biography  Dr. Miriam J. Ram√≠rez de Ferrer, born in Caguas, Puerto Rico in 1941, lived in Europe while her father served in the U.S. Armed Forces. She graduated in 1968 with a medical degree from the Complutense University of Madrid. Married to a fellow physician, Dr. Tom√°s Ferrer, in 1974 she began practicing obstetrics and gynecology, first in San Juan, and later, when she moved with her late husband Dr. Tomas Ferrer, MD, in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, where they raised five children. She became active in Puerto Rico's statehood movement in the late 1970s, creating and heading Puerto Ricans for Civic Action, and after the 1980 general elections, began a movement to raise over 100,000 signatures in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico. In 2000, she was nominated for Senator at-large by her New Progressive Party (NPP) and elected a member of the Senate of Puerto Rico from 2001 to 2005, where she was a member of the NPP minority caucus, headed by fellow senator Kenneth McClintock, who appointed her as Ranking Member of the Senate's Federal and International Affairs Committee. Elecciones Generales de 2000: Senadores por Acumulaci√≥n on CEEPUR For her efforts and close friendship with the late George H. W. Bush she took credit for the legislation approved in the US House of Representatives for Self- Determination for Puerto Rico. After leaving the Senate in 2004, served as advisor on Federal, Health and Legislative Affairs for Jorge Santini, Mayor of San Juan, the Capital of Puerto Rico. Her major accomplishments while working for the city, include obtaining Federal property deed for ‚ÄúCasa Cuna‚Äù and other support from the Federal agencies to develop an area with multiple functions and buildings to give support, house and protect battered mothers and children. She was also instrumental in identifying resources for the financing of community projects for the city of San Juan. Primary backlash[edit] Most of Rossell√≥'s supporters were elected in the primary and endorsed Fortu√±o as their candidate for governor. However, several prominent NPP members demonstrated strong opposition to Fortu√±o's candidacy and victory. As soon as the results of the March 9, 2008 primaries were announced, NPP's Second Vice President, Miriam Ram√≠rez de Ferrer, announced her immediate resignation, saying \\"Effectively right now I am no longer the Second Vice President of this party. You will not see me ever again involved in active politics, party reunions or party meetings, as I now plan to become a private citizen. There's a lot of things I haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things I have to do to help the statehood cause\\".[citation needed] Ram√≠rez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rossell√≥. She lost to Fortu√±o's candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rossell√≥ supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodr√≠guez. When Ram√≠rez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortu√±o, she replied \\"My vote is secret\\". Another strong voice against Fortu√±o was NPP former President Leo D√≠az. D√≠az accused Fortu√±o and his wife of having ties to PDP law firms and to colonialist interests. At a November 4, 2007, rally called \\"Con Fuerza para Vencer\\" (With the Strength to Win), D√≠az said, \\"In this primary the life of this party is in jeopardy. The other candidate, Fortu√±o, isn't a real statehood defender! He should explain why he has ties with PDP's law firms and why the colonialist special interests are financing his campaign[...]\\".[8] He has since rejoined party activities and chairs Santini's 2012 reelection efforts. San Juan mayor Jorge Santini also made strong statements against Fortu√±o during the primary campaign, as he supported Rossell√≥. He said that Fortu√±o wasn't a \\"full-time leader\\" and that he \\"made arrangements with other causes\\".[9] He subsequently campaigned for Fortu√±o, both in 2008 as well as 2012. She now resides in Central Florida.

It is native to Asia, including China and Japan. It is present in the southeastern United States as an introduced species, a common landscaping and ornamental plant, and sometimes an invasive species.Gucker, Corey L. (2011). Elaeagnus pungens. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Retrieved 1 March 2012. Description Elaeagnus pungens is a dense, branching shrub which can reach over tall by wide. It sprouts prolifically from its stem, spreading out and twining into adjacent vegetation. Parts of the stem are covered in thorns which can be up to long. The evergreen, alternately-arranged leaves are up to long but under wide. The undersides are silvery white with brown flecks. Tubular flowers are borne in clusters of up to three. The flowers are yellowish or white and are sweet-scented.Elaeagnus pungens. Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants, University of Florida IFAS. Retrieved 1 March 2012. The fruit is a drupe up to long which contains one seed. It is reddish with silver scales. Blooming occurs in the autumn and fruit develops during the spring. The plant grows quickly, with shoots growing over one meter per season. The growth has been described as \\"aggressive\\", with shoots extending many meters into neighboring treetops. The seeds are dispersed by birds. Eleagnuspungens.jpg Elaeagnus pungens1.jpg Elaeagnus pungens2.jpg Elaeagnus pungens3.jpg Habitat In China this plant occurs on hillsides and in thickets. In Japan it grows in scrub dominated by Quercus phillyraeoides and Pittosporum tobira. This plant was introduced to the United States from Asia in 1830. It has been used extensively as a landscaping plant. Its densely packed, spreading form has proved useful along roadsides and highway medians. It was also used to revegetate abandoned mining sites in Kentucky and other areas. It took hold easily and still persists in these places. It also spread into the wild, having escaped cultivation. In North Carolina it has been reported from longleaf pine forests, urban and maritime forests, and oak- hickory woodlands. In Alabama it grows in urban areas and in protected, natural habitats as a weed. The South Carolina Southern Weed Science Society places it as an invasive species in their local area. Cultivation E. pungens as bonsai, Montreal Botanical Garden Despite its invasive potential, E. pungens is widely cultivated as a garden plant in temperate regions. It tolerates varied environmental conditions, including heat, cold, wind, coastal conditions, shade, and full sun. It is very drought-tolerant. It can grow in varied soil types, including those found at mine spoils. Numerous cultivars have been developed, especially for variegated foliage effects. Commercially available cultivars include 'Maculata', which has gold coloration on the leaves,E. pungens 'Maculata'. BBC Plant Finder.

Elaeagnus √ó submacrophylla, formerly known as E. √ó ebbingei, is a hybrid between E. macrophylla and E. pungens. The hybrid and its cultivars are also grown in gardens as ornamental plants. Ecology Many birds feed on the fruits of the shrub. Birds are most attracted to the plants that produce the most fruit. Studies have found that cedar waxwings attracted to roadside plantings of the shrub are susceptible to automobile-related mortality. In Brazos County, Texas between 8 March and 5 April 1981, researchers counted 298 cedar waxwings that had been killed while trying to get fruits from thorny-olive shrubs growing along one highway.

There were also numerous naval battles at sea, almost all of them in the Atlantic. Actions along the Canadian border occurred in three sectors (from west to east): the old Territory, the Niagara Frontier, and the St. Lawrence River. Battles (chronological order within theater) 1812 =American Northwest= * Capture of the Cuyahoga Packet (July 2, 1812): The capture on the Detroit River of the American merchant schooner Cuyahoga Packet by several members of Canadian Provincial Marine in a rowboat commanded by Lieutenant Frederick Rolette. The American vessel contained official documents with information valuable to the British belonging to Brigadier General William Hull. Hull was unaware that war had been declared when he dispatched the schooner. * Capture of Michilimackinac Island (July 17, 1812): The bloodless capture of Fort Mackinac on Michilimackinac (Mackinac) Island by a British force consisting of a small number of regulars, about two hundred fur traders and four hundred Chippewa, Menominee, Ottawa, Sioux, and Winnebago warriors. The Americans surrendered without firing a shot. * Hull's Campaign on the Detroit River (July 12-August 8, 1812): A lackluster attempt by Brigadier General William Hull to invade Upper Canada across the Detroit River. After successfully crossing the river on July 12, the Americans never pressed the attack on the out-numbered British force at Fort Amherstburg, and withdrew back to Detroit when Hull learned of the imminent arrival of British reinforcements under the command of Major General Isaac Brock. * Skirmish at Brownstown, Michigan Territory (August 5, 1812): A British victory in which a small force, including twenty-five warriors under Tecumseh, ambushed two hundred Ohio militiamen at a small Wyandot village (located near present-day Gibraltar about twenty miles south of Detroit), who were on their way to escort a supply train from Frenchtown (near present-day Monroe) headed for Detroit. * Skirmish at Maguaga, Michigan Territory (August 9, 1812): The first land battle of the war in which the Americans held their own. It occurred when an American detachment sent to Maguaga (a Wyandot village near present-day Wyandotte) to reopen the supply line between Frenchtown (present-day Monroe) and Detroit was ambushed by a British force including both regulars and native warriors under Tecumseh. * Massacre at Fort Dearborn, Illinois Territory (August 15, 1812): A massacre carried out by Potawatomi and Menominee warriors following the evacuation of Fort Dearborn (at the location of present-day Chicago), ordered by Brigadier General Hull upon learning that Fort Mackinac had been captured by the British. The garrison was attempting to march to Fort Wayne, Indiana Territory, when the attack occurred about a mile and a half south of Fort Dearborn. * Capture of Detroit, Michigan Territory (August 16, 1812): A startling and humiliating defeat for the Americans. Hull surrendered Detroit without a fight, despite having a larger force under his command than the force under Major General Isaac Brock, his British adversary. * Massacre at Pigeon Roost, Indiana Territory (September 3, 1812): An attack by Kickapoo Warriors on a small settlement about a hundred miles south of present-day Indianapolis, Indiana. * Investment of Fort Harrison, Indiana Territory (September 3-16, 1812): The first American victory in the war on land. The fort (located on the Wabash River just north of present-day Terre Haute, Indiana) defended by about sixty officers and men under the command of Captain Zachary Taylor, was attacked by a large party of Kickapoo, Miami, Potawatomi, Shawnee and Winebago warriors from Prophetstown, Indiana Territory. When a relief part arrived from Vincennes, the Indians withdrew. * Investment of Fort Wayne, Indiana Territory (September 5-12, 1812): An unsuccessful attempt by about six hundred warriors from the Ottawa Nations to infiltrate and attack the American garrison at Fort Wayne at the confluence of the Maumee, St. Joseph and St. Mary Rivers in northeastern Indiana Territory. * Harrison's Campaign in the Northwest (September 17, 1812 - October, 1813): A campaign tasked with reestablishing security in the Old Northwest and retaking Detroit following Hull's disastrous performance as commander of the army on the Detroit frontier. Even before taking command of the Northwestern American army, William Henry Harrison (commissioned as a brigadier general in August, 1812, and promoted to major general in March, 1813) had begun the process establishing supply bases in northern Ohio and sending detachments of infantry to protect American forts that were threatened by Indians allied with the British. He oversaw the construction of Fort Meigs in early 1813, secured his supply line, and reoccupied Detroit following the American naval victory on Lake Erie. * Destruction of Prophetstown, Indiana Territory (November 19, 1812): An attack ordered by Brigadier General William Henry Harrison on the Indian settlement near the junction of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers north of present-day Lafayette, Indiana, that had been the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe in November, 1811. The village was not occupied at the time of the attack. * Battle on the Mississinewa River, Indiana Territory (December 17-18, 1812): A battle that occurred during an expedition against Delaware and Miami villages at a location where the Mississinewa River flows into the Wabash River near present-day Marion, Indiana. =Niagara Frontier= * First British raid at Charlotte, New York, at the mouth of the Genesee River (October 1, 1812): A raid by a British landing party from the Royal George, in which the British seized the American merchantman Lady Murray and a smaller boat, with no resistance from the small American force present. * Capture of HMS Caledonia (1807) and HMS Detroit (1812) at Ft. Erie, Upper Canada (October 9, 1812): A successful raid conducted by about a hundred American troops who crossed the Niagara River from Buffalo and captured two Provincial Marine brigs that had just arrived at Fort Erie. The Caledonia was sailed safely to Black Rock on the American side of the river, whereas the Detroit ran aground at the southern tip of Squaw Island and was set on fire before the British could recapture it. * Battle of Queenston Heights, Upper Canada (October 13, 1812): A major American defeat suffered when Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer attempted to capture Queenston on the west (Canadian) side of the Niagara River, seven miles from its mouth. Major General Isaac Brock, \\"the hero of Upper Canada,\\" was killed during the battle. * Skirmish at Frenchman's Creek, Upper Canada (November 28, 1812): An American raid across the Niagara River intended to prepare the ground for a subsequent invasion of Upper Canada. The objectives were to spike British artillery at Red House to enable the American landing to occur without being subjected to artillery fire, and to destroy a bridge over Frenchman's Creek to prevent the movement of British reinforcements. The first objective was accomplished; the second was not. * Smyth's failed invasion of Upper Canada (November 28 - December 1, 1812): A debacle for the Americans, caused by poor planning and poor leadership by Brigadier General Alexander Smyth. Immediately following the action at Frenchman's Creek and again on December 1, Smyth tried and failed to get his invasion force assembled and into boats to cross the Niagara River and invade Upper Canada, following which he cancelled the entire operation. =St. Lawrence River= * Occurrence at Carleton Island (June 26, 1812): An unusual incident in which a private American citizen, two other men, and a boy captured a British sergeant and three privates of the 10th Royal Veteran Battalion on Carleton Island, an island in the upper St. Lawrence River about ten miles east of Kingston, Upper Canada, that had been ceded to the United States in 1794. These were the first prisoners taken in the war. * First attack on Sackets Harbor, New York (July 19, 1812): An unsuccessful British naval attack on Sackets Harbor, a small port at the eastern end of Lake Ontario and the location of an American naval base. * Battle of the Julia _versus_ the Earl of Moria and the Duke of Gloucester on the St. Lawrence River (July 31, 1812): A standoff between a small American schooner, the Julia, and two larger British ships heading downriver toward Ogdensburg, New York, to attack six American schooners moored there. After a three-hour exchange of fire off Elizabethtown, New York, the British ships broke off the engagement, and the Julia retired to Ogdensburg. * Skirmish at Touissant's Island in the St. Lawrence River (September 16, 1812): A failed attempt by a small force of Americans from Ogdensburg, New York, to intercept a British supply convoy of forty bateaux coming up the St. Lawrence River. * Raid at Gananoque, Upper Canada (September 21, 1812): A successful raid by American troops from Sackets Harbor on the British depot at Gananoque, about twenty miles from Kingston down the St. Lawrence River. * First attack on Ogdensburg, New York (October 4, 1812): A failed British amphibious attack on Ogdensburg, a transshipment point for supplies being moved along the St. Lawrence River, repelled by American artillery. * Skirmishes at Akwesasne and French Mills (October 23 - November 23, 1812): A temporary victory by New York State Militia who captured a British post at Akwesasne, an Indian community that straddled the St. Lawrence River in a location where the present-day borders of Ontario, Quebec and New York State intersect. It, and the nearby American post at French Mills, were recaptured a month later by a small British force carrying supplies up the St. Lawrence River. * Skirmish at Lacolle, Lower Canada (November 20, 1812): A battle at Lacolle, a small village on the Lacolle River about five miles north of the New York border. Confused US troops attacked each other, who were then in turn attacked by British/loyalist troops, the US troops, having vast superior numbers, in any case retreated back to Champlain, and Maj. Gen. Henry Dearborn called off his planned invasion of Lower Canada. =American West= * Investment of Fort Madison, Missouri Territory (September 5-12, 1812): An unsuccessful attempt by Sauk and Fox warriors to capture a fort on the upper Mississippi River at the location of present-day Fort Madison, Iowa. =Naval Battles= * USS Nautilus _versus_ HMS Shannon (1806) (July 17, 1812): The first capture of an American ship by the British during the war. The American brig Nautilus was pursued and captured by the British frigate Shannon, which was part of a five-ship British squadron that also included HMS Africa, Aeolis, Belvidera, and Guerri√®re that was cruising off the coast of New Jersey. * USS Essex _versus_ HMS Alert (1804) (August 13, 1812): A battle off the Azores in which the British sloop Alert surrendered to the American frigate Essex after an engagement lasting only about eight minutes. * Constitution _versus_ HMS Guerri√®re (August 19, 1812): The first capture of a British frigate by an American ship. After an engagement of less than three hours about five hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland, the British frigate Guerri√®re surrendered to the American frigate Constitution. * Wasp (1807) _versus_ HMS Frolic (1806) (October 18, 1812): An engagement about three hundred miles north of Bermuda that caused serious damage to both ships. The British sloop surrendered only after being boarded by a party from the American sloop. Later in the day, while crews from both ships were making repair, HMS Poictiers captured the Wasp and recaptured the Frolic. * Wasp (1807) _versus_ HMS Poictiers (1809) (October 18, 1812): The capture of the American sloop Wasp and the recapture of the British sloop Frolic by the British only hours after the Frolic had been captured by the Wasp. * USS United States vs HMS Macedonian (October 25, 1812): A two-hour- long engagement about five hundred miles west of the Canary Islands, which ended when the British frigate Macedonian surrendered to the American frigate United States, which was on an independent cruise. The Macedonian was towed to New London, Connecticut, and purchased by the U. S. Navy. * Vixen (1803) _versus_ HMS Southampton (1757) (November 22, 1812): The pursuit and eventual capture of the American brig Vixen, cruising about ninety miles east of St. Augustine, Florida, by the British frigate Southampton. Several days of bad weather prevented the conclusion of the surrender, and both vessels were wrecked on a shoal near Concepc√≠on Island on November 27. The crews were rescued and taken to Jamaica. * Constitution _versus_ HMS Java (1811) (December 29, 1812): A two-and-a-half-hour battle off the coast of Brazil during which the British 38-gun fifth-rate Java suffered such serious damage that its captain ordered it scuttled. 1813 =Atlantic Coast= George & Federick's towns by a detachment of boats from The R. Hon. Sir J. B. Warrens squadron under Rear Admiral Cockburn in April 1813 * Warren's Chesapeake Bay Campaign (March-September, 1813): A major naval initiative, commanded by Admiral Sir John Warren, with the goals of blockading Chesapeake Bay, gathering intelligence concerning American strength, destroying the USS Constitution, interrupting commercial traffic within Chesapeake Bay, capturing of American vessels and supplies useful to the British and eventually extending the blockade to include Delaware Bay and Long Island. Although Warren remained the senior commander, many of the operations were conducted by ships under the command of Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane was much hated by the Americans because of his aggressive actions on-shore, such as destroying the private property of civilians in villages and towns that opposed his landings. * Battle of the Rappahannock River, Virginia (April 3, 1813): A British foray up the Rappahannock River, which empties into Chesapeake Bay forty miles north of Hampton, Virginia, during which they captured or destroyed fourteen American ships. * Raid at Frenchtown, Maryland (April 29, 1813): A raid conducted by a British landing party during Sir John Warren's harassing operations in Chesapeake Bay (March-September, 1813) on a small settlement about fifteen miles up the Elk River on the road between Baltimore and Philadelphia. * Raid on Havre de Grace and Principio Foundry, Maryland (May 3, 1813): A raid conducted by a flotilla of boats under Rear Admiral George Cockburn's command. When Maryland militia resisted the landing at Havre de Grace, the Royal Marines burned and looted homes, burned a warehouse and appropriated or killed livestock. At the Principio Foundry they destroyed a number of guns and the works in which they had been manufactured. * Raid at Georgetown and Fredericktown, Maryland (May 6, 1813): A raid conducted by a landing party from HMS Mohawk on two villages on the Sassafras River flowing into the northeast corner of Chesapeake Bay. The landing party destroyed uninhabited homes, four schooners and stores of sugar, lumber and leather. * Assault on Craney Island, Virginia (June 22, 1813): An important victory for the United States fought on an island at the mouth of the Elizabeth River, in which a British landing party failed to overcome a much smaller force of Americans defending the island. This defensive victory thwarted a British attempt to occupy the port city of Norfolk. * Capture and occupation of Hampton, Virginia (June 25-26, 1813): The successful British occupation of Hampton, Virginia, following their humiliating failure to secure Craney Island. During the one-day occupation of the town, the British took guns, ammunition, wagons, horses, livestock and other foodstuffs. French troops that were part of the force were reported to have participated in looting, vandalism, raping and killing. British casualties were 5 killed/33 wounded/10 missing.A Full and Correct Account of the Military Occurrences of the Late Wat Between Great Britain and The United States of America..1818, Volume 2 William James. p. 417 * Raid at Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina (July 12-16, 1813): A successful British naval operation in the Ocracoke Inlet, a channel through the Outer Banks off the coast of North Carolina into Pimlico Sound, a route used by American merchantmen during the British blockade of Chesapeake Bay. The raid captured a number of American vessels and confiscated stores and livestock from the villages of Ocracoke and Portsmouth. =American Northwest= * First Battle of Frenchtown, Michigan Territory (January 18, 1813): A skirmish in which an American detachment from Brigadier General William Henry Harrison's winter camp on the Maumee River (near present-day Toledo, Ohio) succeeded in driving a British force consisting of Canadian militia and Potawatomi and Wyandot warriors out of Frenchtown, a village at the mouth of the Raison River about twenty-five miles south of Detroit (near present-day Monroe, Michigan). * Second Battle of Frenchtown, Michigan Territory (January 22, 1813): A British victory achieved when a force of regulars, militia and native warriors surprised the Americans in a pre-dawn attack, and after several hours of heavy fighting, accepted the surrender of the entire American command. The battle came to be known as the Raison River Massacre on account of the massacre the following morning of numerous American wounded waiting to be transported to Fort Malden. This defeat caused Brigadier General William Henry Harrison to end his winter campaign to recapture Detroit. * Siege of Fort Meigs, Ohio (May 1-9, 1813): An unsuccessful attempt by a British force consisting of regulars, militia and over a thousand warriors commanded by Tecumseh to capture the recently construct fort at the rapids on the Maumee River about twelve miles from its mouth (near present-day Perrysburg, Ohio). * Investment of Fort Meigs, Ohio (July 21-28, 1813): A second unsuccessful attempt by the British to capture the fort, this time by a force containing more than three thousand warriors from the Fox, Menominee, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Sac, Sioux and Winnebago Nations under the command of Tecumseh. * Ball's Battle, Ohio (July 30, 1813): A battle that erupted between a party of Indians loyal to the British and an American force (including Pennsylvania volunteers under the command of Maj. James V. Ball) en route to Fort Stephenson. The action occurred near Fort Seneca located about eight miles south of Fort Sephenson and thirty-five miles southeast of Fort Meigs. * Assault on Fort Stephenson, Ohio (August 2, 1813): An unsuccessful attempt by the British to capture Fort Stephenson, a fort on the Sandusky River near present-day Fremont, Ohio. * Battle of Put-in-Bay, Ohio (September 10, 1813): The pivotal naval battle, also known as the Battle of Lake Erie, in which a squadron under the command of Captain Oliver Hazard Perry defeated the British squadron under Commander Robert Heriot Barclay, giving the United States complete control of Lake Erie. With their supply line cut, the British in southwestern Lower Canada were forced to abandon Detroit and Fort Amherstburg and retreat eastward toward the Niagara Peninsula. * Battle of Moraviantown, Upper Canada (October 5, 1813): An American victory at Moraviantown, a village on the Thames River close to the location of present-day Chatham, Ontario, over the British army retreating from Detroit and Fort Amherstburg. The battle is also referred to as the Battle of the Thames.

He was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and Order of Lenin in recognition of his sacrifice by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in May 1944. Biography Hunan Avetisyan was born to an Armenian family in Tsav, a village of the Armenian Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Syunik Province, Republic of Armenia) on 2 May 1913.Shkadov, I.N. et al. (eds.) (1987). Geroi Sovetskogo Soyuza: Kratky biografichesky slovar [Heroes of the Soviet Union: A Brief Biographical Dictionary], Volume 1. Moscow: Voyenizdat. p. 24. His parents were peasants and he grew up in the local area, where he received primary education. He worked in the agriculture sector and was employed at a sovkhoz at the time of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Avetisyan entered the Red Army in 1942 during World War II and fought with the 390th Rifle Regiment of the Armenian-manned 89th Rifle Division, then with the 18th Army of the North Caucasus Front. He was a senior sergeant assisting the leader of his platoon's First Company by September 1943, when the division received orders to attack the fortified German positions on the Taman Peninsula in the Novorossiysk-Taman Operation of the Battle of Caucasus. On 16 September 1943, Avetisyan's company was ordered to storm and seize the German-held Dolgaya Height in the Krasnoyarsk Krai near Novorossiysk in the offensive operation. The company was met with heavy fire from the machine-gun pillboxes, and Avetisyan successfully neutralized one of the enemy pillboxes by crawling up to it and throwing his grenades. The company was able to proceed, but its renewed attack was again met with machine gun fire coming from a second emplacement. Sergeant Avetisyan again began to crawl toward the Germans, but failed to destroy the enemy inside the second pillbox with another grenade, and the fire coming from the Germans left him wounded in the attempt. He then threw his body at the embrasure. The company's advance was renewed and ended in the capture of the height. Suren Arakelyan, another soldier in the 89th Rifle Division, was also awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in May 1944. Also wounded by a machine gun emplacement, Arakelyan had covered an enemy embrasure in a similar attack a mere six days after Avetisyan's sacrifice. Avetisyan was posthumously awarded the Soviet Union's highest honorary title and order by the Soviet government, receiving the title of Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on 16 May 1944. He was buried in the small town of Verkhnebakansky in the city of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai. Memory Senior Sergeant Avetisyan. Postage stamp of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 1963. Sergeant Avetisyan's portrait was featured on a 1963 Soviet postage stamp when the Soviet post issued a series of stamps honoring wartime heroes in the 1960s. Monuments of Avetisyan are located in the village of Tzav, his hometown, and the cities Kapan and Yerevan.

Her main adversary is Sister Gertrude, an archetypal authoritarian dragon, and in the middle are the two priests of the house. The veteran parish priest, Fr.

The Times of India. 11 October 2011. Retrieved 23 May 2013. by Shyamaprasad, starring Dileep, Samvrutha Sunil and Mamta Mohandas. The film, based on a Bengali short story by Sunil Gangopadhyay, was produced under the banner of Picture Perfect and has a script by Shyamaprasad, cinematography by Alagappan, editing by Vinod Sukumaran and music by Ouseppachan. The film, a romantic comedy, is about the shades of love that vary in a relationship woven around three individuals. Plot The film tells the story of Shanthanu (Dileep), a researcher in linguistics, and his two friends, Kalpana (Samvritha) and Anuradha (Mamtha). Anuradha is the sensitive type who has gone through certain bitter experiences in her teenage years, when her cousin approached her with love, which she later realised was just his lust for her. Kalpana is slightly capricious and loves being in love. Anuradha wants to play Cupid and bring Shanthanu and Kalpana together; she knows that they care a lot for each other, but for some reason or other are hesitant to take the next step. Kalpana's parents are against her marrying Shanthanu and they try to bring proposals from their own (Brahmin) community. At one point Kalpana's aunt tricks her into meeting a guy, Sanjay, whom they hope Kalpana will like and marry. While they travel with Sanjay in his car, they meet with an accident, which causes some scars on Kalpana's face and gave her a disfigured toe. After the accident Kalpana backs out from the relationship with Shanthanu and gives in to her parents' wishes to marry Sanjay. Anuradha feels very bad for Shanthanu and tries to console him. It is then that Shanthanu realizes that Kalpana had actually not loved him at all. Though his actual love was near him, so close, he failed to recognise it (Where the name of this film gets significance).

Arike is the latest in that list and is based on a Bengali short story by Sunil Gangopadhyay, whose novel was also the base for the director's Ore Kadal. Says the director, \\"I don‚Äôt think adapting stories from other languages is an issue at all, because human emotions are universal and can be told without linguistic barriers. I am fond of adapting literature, since writing a story is not my forte and I do not believe in concocting a story for the sake of filmmaking.\\" He also adds that Basu Chatterjee, a Bollywood director who portrayed the middle-class in many films, proved to be his guiding force while making Arike. Themes Like all of Shyamaprasad's previous films, Arike too is about the quest for love. Talking about the theme of Arike, the director says, \\"There is an obsessive quest for love in each one of us. We have illusions and inhibitions about love, yet we have an irrepressible thirst for it. We all want to find happiness in love. But whether we get that happiness is the question which I want to delve through this film.\\" Compared to the dark themes he took up earlier, Arike's tone is relatively lighter. Shyamaprasad says, \\"In Ore Kadal, the subject had an shadow of gloom and depression, Ritu was about the aspirations and attitude of the young working population. Arike has a breezy feel, and the story is told in a lighthearted and realistic way. I have also taken efforts to avoid cliches such as rain, sea, train that are common motifs in romantic films.\\" Casting and filming The film has only a handful of characters. Shyamaprasad wanted to use live sound recording and hence he chose actors who could emote dialogues perfectly while shooting itself. Shyamaprasad says he selected Dileep to play the protagonist because he feels the actor has the look and feel of the character. This is the first time Shyamaprasad has cast Dileep in a lead role, though the actor had earlier done a role in the director's 1998 film Kallu Kondoru Pennu. The film's production started in late November 2011. The director had given all the actors a copy of the script so that they could practice their parts well. The film uses sync sound recording or live sound recording. Shyamaprasad brought in Sohel Sanwari from Bollywood to record the sound. Says Shyamaprasad, \\"This is something I‚Äôve always wanted to do. The early talkies had speech recorded live but the change to outdoor locations made carrying recording cameras cumbersome. Added to this was the fact that technicians and stars started travelling and this started the trend of dubbing. I feel that we lose 50 to 60 per cent of the performance when we post-synchronise voices. Take for example a scene on the seashore ‚Äî our body, voice modulation and mannerisms are in sync with the surroundings. Dubbing in a studio means that a lot of vocal nuances get lost!\\" Lead player Dileep describes the sync sound recording experience, \\"I had to memorise the entire dialogues beforehand and deliver them at one go after umpteen rehearsals. It was a very novel experience for me and I personally feel that it increases one‚Äôs memory power.\\" Samvrutha Sunil says, \\"This is my first film where our voices have been recorded live during our respective performances. The sync sound recording actually threw open many challenges - one, you can't console yourself for a not-up-to-the-mark performance saying that you can cover it up with a good dubbing and two, you have to byheart the dialogues thoroughly as there is no prompting.\\" The film was shot completely from Kozhikode. It was Shyamaprasad's first film to be filmed from the city. He says it was his emotional relationship with the city and its calm nature which helped live recording to a great extent, that inspired him to choose Kozhikode as the main locale. Filming was completed in late December 2011. Cinematographer Alagappan says he experimented a lot with the film, and the film was made in a special \\"visual tone.\\" The film was shot using a Sony F3 Camera. Sakhi Thomas, who worked with Shyamaprasad in Ritu and Elektra, was the costume designer for this film.

From the start it also covered Wales, together with more limited information relating to Scotland, Ireland, and other churches within the Anglican Communion. Background and early contents An opportunity to compile and issue a new directory had been created by the effective disappearance of the earlier Clerical Guide or Ecclesiastical Directory, edited by Richard Gilbert, and also by the introduction of the much improved system of the Penny Post. The basic contents of the Clergy Lists earlier editions was summarised on their title pages: *an alphabetical list of the clergy (or at least of those who held benefices) *an alphabetical list of the benefices, with their post towns *lists of the cathedral establishments *benefices arranged under their ecclesiastical divisions *lists of ecclesiastical preferments variously under the patronage of the Crown, the bishops, and the deans & chapters, etc. The directory was always a bit less expensive than its later rival, Crockford's Clerical Directory, but not surprisingly it consequently offered considerably less in the way of biographical detail. This was especially true in the earlier editions which offered little or no information as to previous appointments, universities attended, or lists of publications by the clergy. Publishers and later history The directory was initially published by Charles Cox at the Ecclesiastical Directory Office, Southampton Street, Strand. Cox ‚Äì who in 1839 had taken over a periodical called the Ecclesiastical Gazette, originating during the previous year ‚Äì was able to produce two separate editions during the Clergy List's inaugural year of 1841. Church Times: two-part article \\"Shop-talk and mordant wit\\", by Christopher Currie & Glyn Paflin, describing the background to Crockford's Clerical Directorys first hundred editions, 6‚Äì13 December 2007 Thereafter, it managed to maintain annual publication right up until adverse trading conditions forced its closure as a separate volume in 1917. Cox remained as the Clergy Lists publisher for many years, but by 1881 the title had been taken over by John Hall of Parliament Street, In 1888 it was further taken over by Hamilton, Adams & Company, of London's Paternoster Row. They had earlier acquired Thomas Bosworth's Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory, merging the two titles in 1889. During the following year the combined directory was still further transferred to Kelly & Company, the publishers of Kelly's Directories. The later volumes were considerably expanded to include much greater biographical detail ‚Äì broadly comparable with Crockford ‚Äì but this was not sufficient to sustain the publication in the longer term. Over the years the number of pages also increased ‚Äì ranging from around 300 in 1841 to around 700 by the 1890s. After 1917 the Clergy List finally merged with its long-time rival, Crockford's Clerical Directory. At least as late as 1932 the latter continued to advertise on its preliminary pages that it \\"incorporated the Clergy List, the Clerical Guide and the Ecclesiastical Directory\\". In recent years certain of the earlier editions of the Clergy List (including the first edition The 1841 first edition of the Clergy List may be downloaded free of charge from the Google eBookstore ) have been reissued by various publishers ‚Äì either on CD-ROM or in scanned format on the Internet.

In 2002 he made songs based on this work. In the period from 2003 to 2004 he recorded two solo albums, –¶–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä–∞ (\\"Censorship\\") and –¶–µ–Ω–∑—É—Ä–∞-2 (\\"Censorship-2\\"). Neither of these albums brought Baretsky stardom. In 2004 he worked with the group named EU. They released an album in 2005, –≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω—â–∏–Ω–∞ (Elektronschina) featuring a stencil of his face on the cover. He performed at concerts with EU in Moscow and St Petersburg. He then worked with the group Leningrad, writing lyrics for a song. Baretsky is best known for his aggressive and anti-west stances. He frequently picks fights on television shows and radio interviews, sometimes being invited specifically to cause trouble. Baretsky is vocally antiimport and anti anything he deems capitalistic. He often draws a crowd to witness him make these statements. In 2015, Baretsky drove his BMW into a field and lit it on fire to promote Russian industry. He announces that all imported goods are evil and they should be destroyed. He then burns his BMW and drives away in a Russian made Lada Kalina.http://en.truba.com/others/video/stas_baretsky_burned_his_bmw_in_support_of_our_industry-460139 Baretsky is also known for biting into beer cans and twisting them apart, spraying those around him.

The 2011 Wealden District Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Wealden District Council in East Sussex, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Background At the 2007 election the Conservatives retained control of Wealden council with 34 seats, compared to 12 for the Liberal Democrats, 7 independents and 2 Green party councillors. However at a by- election in September 2008 the Liberal Democrats gained a seat from the Conservatives in Alfriston, meaning that by 2011 there were 33 Conservatives and 13 Liberal Democrats, while the independents were split into 3 Independent Democrats and 4 Independents. The Conservatives were the only party with candidates for all 55 seats being contested in 35 wards and they were guaranteed gains in Forest Row after the Green Party did not defend the seats they had won in 2007 and no other party stood in the ward. The Liberal Democrats only put up 24 candidates, down from 35 in 2007, with the party not defending 2 seats in Crowborough, where Liberal Democrats councillors Jane Clark and Martin Prestage stood down at the election. Meanwhile, Labour had 27 candidates, a substantial increase from only 3 in 2007. Election result The Conservatives increased their majority on the council after gaining 14 seats, to have 47 of the 55 councillors. This included winning all of the seats in Uckfield, where the party gained 4 seats from the Liberal Democrats. The Conservative leader of the council, Bob Standley, described the results as a \\"ringing endorsement\\" of the policies of the Conservative council. Overall turnout at the election was 49.5%, up from 38.51% in 2007. The Liberal Democrats lost 10 seats to only have 3 of the 13 councillors the party had held before the election. Meanwhile, neither Labour, nor any other party, managed to win any seats, with a spokesperson for Labour saying that Wealden was now \\"virtually a one party state\\". Independents won five seats, down two, with four of those five being taken by members of the Shing family in Polegate and Willingdon, and the final seat being won by a former mayor of Crowborough, Stephen Isted, in Crowborough Jarvis Brook. This led to the Conservatives being criticised by anti-racism groups over comments on the party website saying that the Liberal Democrats had seen \\"the humiliation of the 'Shing' dynasty becoming the official opposition\\". 4 Conservative candidates were unopposed at the election. Ward results By-elections between 2011 and 2015 Polegate North A by-election was held in Polegate North on 2 August 2012 following the death of Liberal Democrat councillor Roy Martin. The seat was held for the Liberal Democrats by Don Broadbent with a majority of 227 votes over an independent candidate. Heathfield North and Central A by-election was held in Heathfield North and Central on 29 November 2012 after the death of Conservative councillor Peter Newnham. The seat was held for the Conservatives by Raymond Cade with a majority of 384 votes over the UK Independence Party. Crowborough West A by-election was held in Crowborough West on 22 January 2015 after the death of Conservative councillor Antony Quin. The seat was held for the Conservatives by Simon Staveley with a majority of 138 votes over the UK Independence Party.
