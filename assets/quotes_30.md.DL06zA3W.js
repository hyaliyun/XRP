About half the dry weight of most living organisms is carbon. It plays an important role in the structure, biochemistry, and nutrition of all living cells. Living biomass holds about 550 gigatons of carbon, most of which is made of terrestrial plants (wood), while some 1,200 gigatons of carbon are stored in the terrestrial biosphere as dead biomass. Carbon is cycled through the terrestrial biosphere with varying speeds, depending on what form it is stored in and under which circumstances. It is exchanged most quickly with the atmosphere, although small amounts of carbon leave the terrestrial biosphere and enter the oceans as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Movement of carbon in the terrestrial biosphere Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is stored in forests: they hold 86% of the planet's terrestrial above-ground carbon and forest soils also hold 73% of the planet's soil carbon. Carbon stored inside plants can be transferred into other organisms during plant consumption. When animals eat plants, for example, the organic carbon stored in the plants is converted into other forms and utilized inside the animals. The same is true for bacteria and other heterotrophs. Dead plant material in or above soils remains there for some time before being respired by heterotrophs. Thus carbon is transferred in every step of the food chain from one organism to another. Carbon exchange between the terrestrial biosphere and other systems=Atmosphere Autotrophs, such as trees and other green plants, use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide during primary production, releasing oxygen in the process. This process occurs most quickly in ecosystems with high amounts of growth, such as in young forests. Because carbon is consumed in the process of autotrophic growth, more carbon is consumed in spring and summer during daytime than in winter and at night, when photosynthesis no longer takes place in most plants. Carbon storage in the biosphere is influenced by a number of processes on different time-scales: while carbon uptake through autotrophic respiration follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle, carbon can be stored in the terrestrial biosphere for up to several centuries, e.g. in wood or soil. Most carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere through respiration. When oxygen is present, aerobic respiration occurs, producing carbon dioxide. If oxygen is not present, e.g. as is the case in marshes or in animals' digestive tracts, anaerobic respiration can occur, which produces methane. About half of the gross primary production is respired by plants directly back into the atmosphere. Part of the net primary production, or the remaining carbon absorbed by the biosphere, is emitted back into the atmosphere through fires and heterotrophic respiration. The rest is converted into soil organic carbon, which is released more slowly, or \\"inert\\" dissolved carbon, which can remain in the biosphere for an unknown period of time. Geosphere Carbon in the terrestrial biosphere enters the geosphere only through highly specialized processes. When anaerobic decomposition converts organic material into hydrocarbon rich materials and is then deposited as sediment, the carbon can enter the geosphere through tectonic processes and remain there for several million years. This process can lead to the creation of fossil fuels. Anthropogenic influences thumbupright=1.7 Carbon dioxide emission from streams and rivers as an integrative part of terrestrial respiration. The disproportional role of streams and rivers in emitting terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere is strengthened by: (a) high input of soil CO2 to streams and small rivers (b) differential transport of organic rich soils to streams and rivers (c) high turbulence in streams and rivers that facilitates quick evasion of the gas to the atmosphere. Human activity has large effects on the terrestrial biosphere, changing the way that it acts as a carbon reservoir. Anthropogenically caused fires release large amounts of carbon as CO2 directly into the atmosphere. More significantly, however, humans modify land cover. Land cover change greatly decreases the amount of carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere. It modifies the local ecosystem, often replacing carbon-rich forest with agricultural or urban land use. This releases the carbon stored in the former land cover type and simultaneously decreases the biosphere's ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Indirectly, human- induced changes in the global climate cause widespread modifications to the terrestrial ecosystem's function in the carbon cycle. As local climates transition, locations that have long been conducive to one type of ecosystem can become more favorable for other ecosystem types. For example, warming in the Arctic has caused stress in North American boreal forests, thus decreasing primary production and carbon uptake, while the same warmer temperatures have led to increased shrub growth in the same areas, producing an opposite effect. Changes in weather patterns can also affect animals. For example, changed weather patterns may create favorable conditions for pine beetles, leading to large beetle outbreaks and forest destruction. Modified precipitation patterns can also lead to droughts or extreme precipitation events, causing additional stress for ecosystems and more erosion. Not only do such influences on the terrestrial ecosystem modify its carbon exchange with the atmosphere - they also can lead to increased outwashing of carbon into the oceans through the transport of organic material in rivers. These widespread changes in land cover also causes changes to the planetary albedo, inducing complex feedbacks in the Earth's planetary radiation budget. Higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere can cause photosynthesis to take place more efficiently, thus increasing plant growth and primary production. This could lead to the biosphere extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. How long this carbon would remain sequestered in the terrestrial biosphere before being rereleased into the atmosphere is unclear, however, and it is likely that other limiting factors (e.g. nitrogen availability, moisture, etc.) would prevent CO2 fertilization from significantly increasing primary production.

The film was directed by Bruce Davison who also stars as a local sheriff. It premiered on TV on June 30, 2012 and was released on DVD and Blu- ray on August 14, 2012. The film features a cameo by Alice Cooper playing himself. It is unrelated to the 1970 film of the same name. Plot A hunter tries to shoot a bear to bring home as a trophy until a large, hairy creature attacks and kills him. The creature appeared to be the legendary monster Bigfoot who then goes back to his cave to sleep. He then attacks and kills an elderly couple by turning over their RV. When Bigfoot attacks a 1980s themed rock concert in Deadwood, South Dakota, after the noise disturbed its hibernation, the cynical event organizer Harley Henderson (Danny Bonaduce) tries to kill the giant beast and create a tourist attraction around its stuffed body. However, his former musical partner, Simon Quinn (Barry Williams), now an environmentalist, realizes the creature is the last of its species, and is determined to make sure it does not become extinct. Harley goes to great lengths to kill the creature, in order to save his concert from being cancelled, but Simon thinks that the creature is just protecting its territory from trespassers. Harley assembles a team of hunters and mercenaries to track down Bigfoot. A group of men and women try to capture Bigfoot on camera, but all of them get killed. Simon uses a hang glider to spot the creature, while Harley and his men try to kill him, however Bigfoot kills three men in the process. Harley uses a rifle to shoot down Simon's hang glider. Army helicopters pursue the creature, leading it straight to the concert. Most of Simon's activist friends get killed by Bigfoot or the National Guard for their interference. They evacuate the town to avoid more casualties. With all his men killed, Harley decides to stop Bigfoot once and for all. Sheriff Alvarez (Sherilyn Fenn) and her partner Gunderson (Bruce Davison) try to call off an air strike after they spot Henderson and Quinn on Mount Rushmore trying to trap the creature. Henderson gets killed when Bigfoot kicks his patrol car into a tree, crushing Henderson. He tells Alvarez that she is a great sheriff and that her father would be proud. Unfortunately, Bigfoot is killed in the process when attack jets fire missiles at him, destroying Mount Rushmore as well. A year later, Mayor Tom Gillis, having survived his injuries, congratulates Henderson and Quinn for being heroes, and unveils a statue of them in their honor. Mount Rushmore is also being rebuilt as a new monument.

(31 October 1853 ‚Äì 29 May 1912) was an English landowner from Cornwall and Liberal Unionist Party politician. Family and education Lewis Molesworth was the eldest son of The Reverend Sir Paul William Molesworth, 10th of the Molesworth Baronets. He was the grandson of Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet, who served as Colonial Secretary under Lord Palmerston. Lewis succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1889.Who was Who, OUP online, 2007 Sir Paul Molesworth had been an Anglican rector but converted to Roman Catholicism in 1854The Times, 28 December 1889 p8 and he passed on his religion to his son Lewis. Lewis was duly educated at Beaumont and Stonyhurst Colleges.The Times, 12 October 1900 p10 In 1875, he married Jane Graham, the daughter of Brigadier-General Daniel Marsh Frost of St Louis, Missouri.Who was Who, OUP online, 2007 The couple did not have any children. Lady Molesworth died in September 1913 of heart failure, which an inquest jury found had been brought on by the sting of a wasp.The New York Times, 27 September 1913 p4 She died at Trewarthenick, where she and her husband had shared a home.Who was Who, OUP online, 2007 Politics Molesworth descended from an old established landowning family. One source records he owned 20,000 acres.Who was Who, OUP online, 2007 It is likely he inherited substantially from the earlier Molesworth baronets, who as recently as the time of Lewis' birth, had income from estates in Huntingdonshire and Jamaica as well as interests in mining and banking.Peter Burroughs, Sir William Molesworth, eighth Baronet, in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004‚Äì12 In 1909 he inherited the Pencarrow Estate in North Cornwall which had been in the Molesworth family since the late 16th century. Consequently, Sir Lewis Molesworth had sufficient private income and was in the privileged position of being able to give his time and commitment to his public career. He fought his first Parliamentary seat at the 1892 general election in the Liberal Unionist interest at Launceston in his home county of Cornwall. Traditionally a Conservative seat, Launceston went Liberal after 1885. The sitting MP, Sir Charles Thomas Dyke Acland, was returned unopposed in 1886 but by 1892, Acland had stood down and a new Liberal candidate was installed. Molesworth picked up the Unionist baton for this election but lost by 984 votes.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885‚Äì1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p240 Molesworth did not make a commitment to fighting Launceston again, although it was hoped by the Liberal Unionists that he might be their candidate in 1895.The Times, 26 June 1895 p10 In the event however, Molesworth did not contest any seat at the 1895 general election. His next election was as Liberal Unionist candidate for another local seat, Bodmin, in 1900 and this time he was successful. The political views of the former MP, Leonard Courtney, had been gradually diverging from those of his Liberal Unionist supporters in Bodmin and his opposition to the policy of the government on South Africa proved decisive. At a meeting at Liskeard on 16 June 1900, the Bodmin Liberal Unionists voted not to re-adopt Courtney at the coming election and to ask Molesworth to place his views before their association with a view to becoming their candidate.The Times, 18 June 1900 p12 He duly addressed a meeting of the Liberal Unionist Association at Liskeard on 30 June when he was adopted by 31 votes to 5; the dissenting voices apparently feeling his views on temperance issues were sufficiently advanced.The Times, 2 July 1895 p8 At the election, Molesworth (supported by the Liberal Unionists' Conservative alliesThe Times, 18 September 1900 p4) retained the seat for the Liberal Unionists with a majority of 1,032 votes.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885‚Äì1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p238 Courtney gradually reverted to formal membership of the Liberal party and, in January 1906, unsuccessfully contested Edinburgh West as a supporter of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman at the general election. Perhaps as a reward, he was elevated to the peerage in the 1906 Birthday Honours list. However, Molesworth only served a single Parliamentary term. At the beginning of 1905, he wrote to the Liberal Unionist Association advising them that, because of his general state of health, he could not undertake another election campaign and tendered his resignation.The Times, 2 February 1900 p4 He served out the rest of his Parliamentary term until the 1906 general election by which time he was 52 years old, but did not stand for Parliament again.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885‚Äì1918; Macmillan Press, 1974 p674 Other interests and public appointments Molesworth was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1894The Times, 28 November 1894 p6 It is also known that at some point, probably in the 1880s, Molesworth served as an officer in the West Somerset Yeomanry cavalry.The Times, 21 November 1895 p5 In 1898 he was appointed to serve as a Sheriff for the County of CornwallThe Times, 30 November 1898 p6 and was High Sheriff in 1899.Who was Who, OUP online, 2007 Molesworth also served as a Justice of the Peace for the county of Cornwall,Who was Who, OUP online, 2007 and was appointed a deputy lieutenant of the county on 19 March 1900. Death and succession Molesworth died suddenly, aged 58, on 29 May 1912 at Vane Tower, an Italianate villa in Torquay, where he had arrived on a visit.The Times, 30 May 1912 p9 He was buried on 1 June 1912 in the churchyard of the church at Cornelly where he had been christened. As he and his wife had no children, the baronetcy passed to Lewis‚Äô cousin, St. Aubyn Hender Molesworth- St Aubyn, formerly the vicar of Collingham in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the great-great-grandson of Sir John St Aubyn, 4th Baronet of the St Aubyn Baronetcy of Clowance, in the County of Cornwall.The Times, 20 May 1913 p9 The father of the twelfth Baronet, the Reverend Hender Molesworth, had assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of St Aubyn, through his mother (the twelfth baronet's grandmother) Catherine St Aubyn. This resulted in the baronetcy being renamed the Molesworth-St Aubyn Baronetcy, providing a linkage back to the extinct (since 1839) St Aubyn Baronetcy.

It was released on 27 August 2012 in Europe and 28 August in the U.S. through Peaceville Records. Like all Katatonia releases, the album was written primarily by founding members Jonas Renkse and Anders Nystr√∂m. The band went through a number of lineup changes, making the album the first to feature bassist Niklas Sandin, the only album to feature second guitarist Per Eriksson, and the last to feature drummer Daniel Liljekvist. Themes and composition Multiple tracks, including \\"Buildings\\", allude to abandoned city scenes, which were inspired by Renkse's and Nystr√∂m's visiting of abandoned train tunnels and hospitals in abandoned villages in Sweden. The album is not politically-themed in the conventional sense of promoting ideologies or presenting solutions, but rather contemplates and laments the poor state of the world due to modern politics in general. Journalists have noted a similarity in sound to the work of American progressive metal band Tool, a comparison Renkse refers to as accidental but flattering. Reception The album was generally well received by critics. AllMusic praised the diverse and layered sound production on the album, concluding that \\"With its various parts, ever-shifting dynamics, and blazing instrumental interludes, it sends the set off with a nearly majestic bang. Dead End Kings is uncompromising in its musical excellence, bleak vision, and dark, hunted beauty; it extends Katatonia's reach exponentially. Kyle Ward, staff reviewer from Sputnik Music, strongly praised the album for being the perfect culmination of everything the band had strived to become after moving away from their original death metal sound in the late 1990s, citing the albums high production values, layered sound and \\"emotional sincerity\\" for the album being a \\"massive success\\".

He immigrated to Texas alone as a teenager under the Galveston Plan with just a few dollars in his pocket. Soon, he became wealthy in the scrap metal business. He became a philanthropist, partial to Jewish causes. He became a patron to numerous political figures, most notably he supported the career of Lyndon B. Johnson. He became notable figure in Austin politics with his power felt as far away as the White House and Israel. He was a Mason, Odd Fellow, Shriner, Knight of Pythias, a member of the board for the Boy Scouts of America, Director of the Austin Chamber of Commerce, and Director of the Salvation Army. Background Jim Novy, whose birth name was Shimeon Novodvorsky, grew up in Knyszyn, Poland. He was the son of Reb Eli Novodvorsky, a Jewish scholar, and Chaya Tserel Novodvorsky, a small goods store owner. He was one of 17 children in this poor Jewish family. He grew up attending Jewish school (Talmud Torah). In 1913, at the age of 17, he escaped Knyszyn alone and fled to America. Journey and arrival in America He had a harrowing journey across Poland and sneaked across the Russian/Polish-German frontier at Grajewo. From there he took the train across Germany to Bremen. In Bremen he stayed in the Hotel Warsaw while he waited for a ship. On Sept. 17, 1913, he boarded the ship SS Chemnitz for his journey to America. He arrived in the port of Galveston on October 10, 1913, just in time for the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. With the assistance of Rabbi Henry Cohen he made transit from Galveston to Dallas to meet his older brothers Louis and Sam who had arrived a year earlier. Early years in America Upon arrival, the three brothers established a business in Ennis, Texas, peddling junk. Jim bought a blind white mule and peddled from the mule cart in towns between Ennis and Dallas. By 1914 the brothers relocated their junk business to Austin. When World War I broke out in Europe that year, scrap metal prices skyrocketed. The brothers hit it big and became wealthy. So while still a teenager with very little English skills, Novy struck it rich in America. When World War I ended in 1918, Scrap metal prices tanked. Novy got into other ventures, one of which was movie theaters. His brother Sam died that year from the Influenza epidemic of 1918. His other brother Louis remained struggling in the scrap metal business. By the mid-1920s scrap metal prices recovered, but Louis's credit was no good. So the two swapped businesses - Louis took over the theater business and Jim became a scrap metal dealer again, where he remained for the rest of his life. Jewish community leadership Novy was one of the early arrivals in Austin of Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe. At the time he arrived the new orthodox community could barely support a minyan. Secularized Jews, mostly from Germany, made up most of Austin's Jewish population at the time, belonging to Reform Congregation Beth Israel. In 1924, Novy was one of four people who signed the charter of newly formed Congregation Agudas Achim - the second Jewish congregation in Austin and the orthodox alternative to Beth Israel. In 1931, Jim was the building chairman for Agudas Achim's new synagogue building constructed on 10th and San Jacinto in Austin. He was president of Congregation Agudas Achim three different times - 1937‚Äì1938, 1946‚Äì1948, and 1954‚Äì1955. An ardent Zionist, Novy held several executive positions in the Zionist Organization of Texas. He had intended to visit the British Mandate of Palestine in 1938 but events in Europe interrupted his trip. In 1943, while he and LBJ were raising $65,000 in war bonds from local Jewish businessmen, it is rumored that funds were also raised to aid underground Jewish fighters in Palestine with covert shipments of arms in crates labeled \\"Texas Grapefruit\\". Jim Novy welcoming Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban outside his plane at Austin Mueller AirportNovy met with key Jewish leaders of his day, including hosting Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban in Austin to meet with the Governor and local leaders in 1953. Jim Novy presenting Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion with a Texas cowboy hat and flagIn 1958, as a personal representative of Texas Governor Price Daniel he met with Prime Minister David Ben Gurion in 1958 at the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the modern state of Israel. Holocaust rescues Jim Novy was involved in rescuing perhaps hundreds of people from Europe under Nazi suppression. He got most of his family out of Europe, often through Latin America. In 1938, he made a harrowing journey across Nazi Germany to visit his hometown of Knyszyn. Armed with lots of cash and 42 blank visas, he helped restore the synagogue, established free loans to the needy, and he successfully got 42 people to America. He and his friend Lyndon B. Johnson saved numerous people under Operation Texas, which Jim Novy helped fund. Relationship with Lyndon Johnson Jim Novy was one of Lyndon B. Johnson's (LBJ) great benefactors. Novy first met LBJ when LBJ was serving as assistant to Congressman Richard Kleberg. They became close when LBJ served as head of the National Youth Administration at the time Novy needed help placing European refugees; this collaboration between LBJ and Novy is referred to as Operation Texas. Novy and LBJ worked closely on many Jewish issues, particularly when LBJ was a senator in the early days of the state of Israel. Jim Novy introducing his friend, President Johnson, at the Congregation Agudas Achim building dedication in 1963 In 1962, when LBJ was vice-president under John F. Kennedy, the federal government condemned the land that Congregation Agudas Achim synagogue was on in order to build a new government office building. Novy worked with LBJ to get a good price for the land. Once again, Jim Novy was in charge of another Agudas Achim Building committee. In September 1963 the building, located on Bull Creek Road, was almost completed. Using open topped automobiles, four Torahs were transported from the old synagogue to the new state-of-the-art building, including one which was driven using LBJ's personal limousine. Vice-President Johnson was scheduled to dedicate the new synagogue building on November 24, 1963. But when Kennedy was assassinated two days before in Dallas, LBJ became president and couldn't attend the dedication. Remembering his promise to his friend Jim Novy, LBJ came to Austin on December 30, 1963 to dedicate the building. It was the first time that a sitting president dedicated a synagogue building. It was also LBJ's first public function after the assassination. Jim Novy shares a personal moment with President Johnson in Novy's Austin officeAfter the dedication, Novy was invited to the White House numerous times as a personal guest of LBJ. He was even present at one point to help LBJ work on his state of the union address. Late in LBJ's presidency, Novy managed to get White House support in providing financial aid for the publishing of the Encyclopaedia Judaica, occurring in 1972, the year after Novy's death in 1971. Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson were in attendance for Novy's funeral dedication at Congregation Agudas Achim, the same Austin synagogue the two men had helped previously dedicate. Personal life Jim Novy married Edna Goldstein of Fort Worth, Texas in 1922. He had two children, Dave Howard Novy in 1923 and Elaine Novy Shapiro in 1930. He divorced Edna and in 1948 he married Estelle Fishbein. ReferencesFurther reading *Anderson, Claudia, 2002, Lyndon B.

Types  Baltic psalteries include: * Kanklƒós (Lithuania) * Kantele (Finland, Karelia and Northwest Russia) * Kannel (Estonia) * KƒÅndla (Livonian people of Northwest Latvia) * Kokles (Latvia) * Krylovidnye gusli (Northwest Russia) * Harpu (S√°pmi) The internationally most known instrument of the family is Finnish kantele, so its name is sometimes used in English to also refer to the rest of the Baltic psalteries. Many of the Baltic psalteries hold a strong symbolic significance in their respective countries, including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Russia, where playing instruction and instrument makers are available.  Etymology  According to Finnish linguist Eino Nieminen, the names kanklƒós, kantele, kannel, kƒÅndla and kokles possibly come from the proto-Baltic form *kantlƒ´s/*kantlƒìs, which originally meant 'the singing tree', ultimately deriving from the Proto-European root *qan- ('to sing, to sound'). However, Lithuanian ethnologist Romualdas Apanaviƒçius believes they could be derived from the Proto-European root *gan(dh)-, meaning 'a vessel; a haft (of a sword)', suggesting that it may be related to the Russian word gusli.Apanaviƒçius, Romualdas.

He was adopted by an Australian couple and, 25 years later, reunited with his biological mother after finding his hometown via Google Earth. His story generated significant international media attention, especially in Australia and India. An autobiographical account of his experiences, A Long Way Home, was published in 2013 in Australia, released internationally in 2014, and adapted into the 2016 film Lion, starring Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel as Saroo, and Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother, Sue Brierley. Background Saroo Brierley was born Sheru Munshi Khan in Ganesh Talai, a suburb within Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh. When he was young, his father left his mother, throwing the family into poverty. His mother worked in construction to support herself and her children but often did not make enough money to feed them all, and could not afford to send them to school. At age five, Saroo and his elder brothers, Guddu and Kallu, began begging at the railway station for food and money. Guddu sometimes obtained work sweeping the floors of train carriages.Brierley, Saroo (2013) A Long Way Home. Viking. Melbourne, Australia. One evening, Guddu said he was going to ride the train from Khandwa to the city of Burhanpur, to the south. Saroo asked his older brother if he could go, too. Guddu reluctantly agreed. By the time the train reached Burhanpur, Saroo was so tired he collapsed onto a seat on the platform. Guddu told his little brother to wait and promised to be back shortly. Guddu did not return, and Saroo eventually became impatient. He noticed a train parked in the station and, thinking his brother was on it, boarded an empty carriage. He found there were no doors to the adjoining carriages. Hoping his brother would come for him, he fell asleep. When he awoke, the train was travelling across an unfamiliar area. Occasionally the train stopped at small stations, but Saroo was unable to open the door to escape. Saroo's rail journey eventually ended at the huge Howrah railway station in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), and he fled when someone opened the door to his carriage. Saroo did not know it at the time, but he was nearly from his hometown. On the same night as his separation from his brother, unbeknownst to Saroo, Guddu was hit and killed by an oncoming train. Saroo attempted to return home by boarding different trains, but they proved to be suburban trains and each one eventually took him back to Howrah railway station. For a week or two, he lived on and around Howrah railway station. He survived by scavenging scraps of food in the street and sleeping underneath the station's seats. Eventually, he ventured out into the city; and, after days of homelessness on Calcutta's streets, he was found by a railway worker who took him in and gave him food and shelter. But Saroo fled when the railway worker showed Saroo to a friend and Saroo sensed that something was not right. The two men chased after him, but he managed to escape. Saroo eventually met a teenager who took him to a police station and reported that he might be a lost child. The police took Saroo to a government centre for abandoned children. Weeks later, he was moved to the Indian Society for Sponsorship and Adoption. The staff there attempted to locate his family. But Saroo did not know enough for them to sufficiently trace his hometown, and he was officially declared a lost child. He was subsequently adopted by the Brierley family of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. In the meantime, his mother, Kamla Munshi, searched for her two sons. A few weeks after her sons failed to return home, police informed her that Guddu's body had been found near the railway tracks, having been killed by an oncoming train a kilometre (0.6 mi) from Burhanpur station. She then confined her energy to looking for Saroo, travelling to different places on trains. Search for his family Saroo grew up in Hobart in an Australian family. His Australian parents adopted another Indian boy, Mantosh. Saroo learned English and soon forgot Hindi. Saroo originated as a mispronunciation of his given name, Sheru. He studied business and hospitality at the Australian International Hotel School in Canberra. As an adult, he spent many hours over many months conducting searches using the satellite images on Google Earth, painstakingly following railway lines radiating out from Howrah railway station. He relied on his vague memories of the main features around Burhanpur railway station, although he knew little of the name of the station except that it began with the letter B. Late one night in 2011, he came upon a small railway station that closely matched his childhood recollection of where he had become trapped in an empty carriage; the name of this station was Burhanpur, very close to a phonetic spelling of the name he remembered from his childhood ordeal. He followed the satellite images of the railway line north and found the town of Khandwa. He had no recollection of that name, but the town contained recognizable features, such as a fountain near the train tracks where he used to play. He was able to trace a path through the streets to what appeared to be the place where he and his family used to live. Following up on a lead, Saroo contacted a Facebook group based in Khandwa. The Facebook group reinforced his belief that Khandwa might be his hometown. In 2012, Saroo travelled to Khandwa in India and asked residents if they knew of any family that had lost their son 25 years ago. He showed photographs of himself as a child in Hobart. Local people soon led him to his mother. He was also reunited with his sister, Shekila, and his surviving brother, Kallu, who were now a schoolteacher and factory manager, respectively. With the loss of Saroo and Guddu, their mother had been able to afford to send the other two to school. The reunion was extensively covered by Indian and international media. Aftermath Saroo continues to live in Hobart. He and his Indian family are now able to communicate regularly, taking advantage of a computer at the home of one of Kallu's neighbours. He bought his mother a house, so she no longer has to work. Saroo has returned to India and visited his biological family over a dozen times. He also travelled first class on the Kolkata Mail, a train service from Mumbai to Kolkata, to re-trace his journey of a quarter century earlier. He later returned to Australia. In 2013, Saroo published his book, A Long Way Home (Penguin Australia), describing his ordeal as a lost five-year-old, his adoption by an Australian family, and his search for his Indian family. A 2016 film based on his life, Lion, directed by Garth Davis and starring Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara, premiered to rave reviews and \\"Oscar buzz\\" at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, though it ultimately did not win an Oscar in any of the six categories for which it was nominated. Saroo was portrayed in the film by Dev Patel, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and newcomer Sunny Pawar. In April 2019 he announced that he is conducting a search for his father who left him and his family when he was a young child.

He was a Liberal Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1974 until 1977, representing the electorate of South Brisbane. Early life Lamont was born Colin Bird in Brisbane, and changed his name officially in 1965. He was educated at Wilston State School, Brisbane Grammar School and Brisbane Teachers' College, and subsequently studied political science, history and government at the University of Queensland. While at university, he was the arts representative on the student representative council, editor of Semper Floreat, and was the Queensland education officer of the National Union of Australian University Students in 1963. In 1964, Lamont served as national director of Abschol, a committee of the union supporting scholarships for indigenous students. Lamont worked as a state secondary school teacher after graduating from university, undertook further study in London, before serving a stint as a Detective-Inspector with the Royal Hong Kong Police from 1966 to 1971. He was injured at one stage during his Hong Kong service when a homemade bomb exploded while he was attempting to defuse it. He was seconded to MI6's special intelligence branch upon for a period upon his recovery. Lamont subsequently returned to Australia, where he served as senior history master at Brisbane Grammar School until his election to parliament. He was also active in debating circles, serving as President of the Queensland Debating Union in 1973 and as president of the Queensland Liberal Speakers' Group from 1973 to 1975. In parliament In 1974, Lamont was preselected as the Liberal candidate for the usually safe Labor seat of South Brisbane, in what was seen at the time as a test run for a future bid for the federal seat of Brisbane. Lamont reportedly told a senior cabinet minister on the day before the election that he thought he might win, only to be told \\"Don‚Äôt get carried away, Col, you need 11 per cent and the state swing is going to be about seven per cent.\\" He won the seat with a 17% swing, as Labor suffered one of the worst defeats in its history, taking a seat that, since 1912, had only fallen to the conservatives for one term following the 1957 Labor split, and for one term during the Great Depression. In parliament, Lamont was a fierce advocate for government transparency and accountability. During the 1975 constitutional crisis, he opposed premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen breaking convention by having Labor renegade Albert Field appointed to the Senate, and also opposed Bjelke-Petersen's appointment as Police Commissioner of Terry Lewis, who would later be jailed for corruption. When Lewis' reforming predecessor Ray Whitrod resigned as Commissioner in 1976, in protest at Bjelke-Petersen's promotion of Lewis to Assistant Commissioner, Lamont went on television to call for Whitrod to withdraw his resignation. Lamont staunchly opposed Bjelke-Petersen's 1977 ban on street marches. On 7 September that year, he addressed people attending a protest rally at the University of Queensland to dissuade them from forcing a confrontation, and then condemned the ban in parliament, citing his encounter with the students. Lamont said that, in response to his attack on the ban, Bjelke-Petersen lunged at him on the floor of parliament, saying \\"you are a traitor to this government!\\" Lamont once stated that, after the 1977 election, he had been offered a promotion to the ministry by Russ Hinze if he promised to stop commenting on police corruption and civil liberties issues, and that he had replied, \\"If that's the price, I don't want it.\\" Lamont discovered during 1977 that the police Special Branch had been conducting surveillance of him and other Liberal dissidents, and was reporting directly to Bjelke- Petersen. In a redistribution before the 1977 election, Bjelke-Petersen intentionally made Lamont's seat unwinnable. He attempted to switch to the seat of Woodridge, but was defeated in the Liberal Party preselection by Bill D'Arcy. Lamont's successor in South Brisbane, Jim Fouras, recounted being told by National Party MPs at the time of his election that they had changed South Brisbane's boundaries because they would rather have a Labor member than another term of Colin Lamont. Post-parliament Lamont served as head of the Brisbane Deaf School and as the state chair of the Council on Disability after his election defeat. He also remained involved in political life after his election defeat, and ran unsuccessfully for his old seat of South Brisbane at the 1980 election. He was a close friend of late Liberal Senator Neville Bonner, and strongly criticised his 1983 preselection loss to David MacGibbon. He later served as president of the Registered & Licensed Clubs Association of Queensland, lectured in politics and public policy at Griffith University and served as the Queensland chairman of the Australian Council for Education Standards. In retirement in 2006, he founded the Unit Owners and Body Corporate Alliance, a Gold Coast lobby group for unit owners. Lamont died on 7 July 2012.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. History: Harbor and light construction Inner range light Keeper's house Map of Grand Marais Harbor In the 1870s, shipping traffic through Lake Superior increased tremendously. Realizing the lack of a safe harbor between Whitefish Bay and Grand Island, the Army Corps of Engineers began upgrading the harbor at Grand Marais in 1881. Over the next ten years, the Corps dredged the harbor and constructed a timber pile breakwater stretching across the harbor. A shipping channel was dredged into the harbor, and two timber crib piers long were built to each side of the channel. These piers were extended one section at a time. As the work on the harbor neared completion, the Lighthouse Board decided that navigation into the harbor would be improved by the addition of a light and fog signal on the head of the western pier. They requested funding for a light in 1892, and Congress allocated funds in 1895. The Board quickly drew up plans and awarded contracts to build a prefabricated light, and the new tower light was in place by November 1895. A fog signal originally located at the Point Iroquois Light was transferred to Grand Marais, and no keeper's quarters were built, causing the project to be significantly under budget (although the keeper was reduced to living in a \\"temporary\\" shanty). Realizing that the addition of a rear range light would improve navigation, the Lighthouse Board requested that the unused funds be re-appropriated toward constructing a second light. Congress agreed in 1897, and by 1898 the second light was fabricated and installed at the inner end of the pier. Later history In 1905, the west pier was extended , and the following year the front range light was moved to the new pierhead. In 1908, a keeper's quarters was finally constructed. As larger vessels began traveling in the Great Lakes, the Grand Marais harbor decreased in importance, and in the 1940s the Corps of Engineers stopped maintaining the breakwater. It quickly rotted away, allowing sand to fill the harbor. Around the same time, the Coast Guard took over the operation of the lights. In the 1960s and 70s, portions of the pier the lights sat on were capped with concrete. In addition, the west pier was lengthened by by the addition of a cellular sheet pile extension. Keepers stayed in the keeper's quarters until 1982; in 1984, the Grand Marais Historical Society received and restored the house. Both range lights are still operational, and although the lantern in the outer range light has been replaced with a modern acrylic lens, the inner range light retains its Fresnel lens, one of the few Fresnel lenses still in use in lighthouses. The lightkeeper's house is operated as a museum. Description The Grand Marais Harbor Inner and Outer lights area pair of lighthouses located on the Grand Marais pier, apart. Both are prefabricated skeletal iron or steel structures painted white and bolted to the pier. The outer light is tall and the inner light is tall.

According to Ars Technica, key FunnyJunk personnel are Bryan Durel and Benjamin Bunker.Anderson, Nate (July 17, 2012). Finding the mystery man behind FunnyJunk. Ars Technica In 2010, The Oatmeal creator Matthew Inman found that FunnyJunk was distributing copies of comics from his website without permission. He sent e-mails, resulting in removal of some but not all of the comics, and subsequently discontinued attempts at removal. In May 2011, Inman made a post on The Oatmeals blog against FunnyJunk and contemplating a cease and desist under the DMCA (see Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act). The FunnyJunk owner known simply as \\"Admin\\" responded with a message to all users claiming that ‚Äúthe Oatmeal wants to sue funnyjunk and shut it down! He thinks we're nothing more than dirty content thieves...Contact Oatmeal anyway you can!\\" and provided links to The Oatmeals e-mail and Facebook page. This triggered spamming by FunnyJunk users and a flame war with The Oatmeal readers. Operation BearLove Good, Cancer Bad In 2011/2012, FunnyJunk hired Charles Carreon to review its website. In June 2012, Carreon delivered a demand letter via process server to Matthew Inman of The Oatmeal claiming that The Oatmeals posts regarding FunnyJunk's alleged copyright infringement constituted defamation. The letter demanded the removal of references to FunnyJunk and US$20,000 in damages. Inman responded with a The Oatmeal blog post containing an annotated copy of the letter, and refusing to do so. Inman further proposed to raise the requisite $20,000, take a photo of himself with the cash, and send the photograph along with a satirical illustration of FunnyJunk's mother \\"seducing a Kodiak bear\\" to FunnyJunk. Rather than pay the damages, Inman proposed to donate the money to two charities, the National Wildlife Federation and the American Cancer Society. This blog post elicited more popular support for Inman and The Oatmeal than anticipated, and the fundraising effort \\"Operation BearLove Good. Cancer Bad.\\" generated the $20,000 in 64 minutes and over $100,000 in under 24 hours, and at completion he raised $220,024. Inman also responded via counsel. On June 21, 2012, Carreon abandoned FunnyJunk's demands because of misinformation. The incident spurred commentary by Dan Mitchell of SF Weekly on how the Digital Millennium Copyright Act places the onus of policing violations on content creators and by Maxwell S. Kennerly Esquire of the Beasley Firm LLC on whether public accusations of copyright infringement are defamatory. In the aftermath of the blog post, FunnyJunk took down all pages Inman linked as infringement and Carreon sought to hide his e-mail address due to a flood of e-mail. Carreon expressed surprise, stating: \\"I really did not expect that he would marshal an army of people who would besiege my website and send me a string of obscene emails.\\" On June 14, 2012 Carreon replaced his contact page with one saying, \\"Due to security attacks instigated by Matt Inman, this function has been temporarily disabled.\\" Inman, however, disputed the assertion that he had instigated an attack, noting in a blog post that Carreon's contact information had been redacted from his initial comic and that he had never directed anyone to attack Carreon. Carreon's website, Twitter account and WordPress site were all attacked, but he says \\"I welcome the opportunity to confront legally the misuse of a new technology.\\" Carreon claimed that a user identifying themselves as \\"Modelista\\" at Ars Technica registered the @Charles_Carreon account at Twitter on June 14, 2012. He tried to identify the operator of the impostor account @Charles_Carreon by subpoenaing Twitter and Ars Technica. Carreon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on July 3, 2012. As of September 2012, the account was suspended.https://m.twitter.com/Charles_Carreon Carreon sent Indiegogo a request to halt Inman's charity fundraiser as a terms of service violation, alleging that the charities' names are misrepresented in violation of California law, and Inman will profit. Inman promised, \\"I won't use any of the money on legal fees.\\" and \\"100% of it is going to charity.\\" Indiegogo investigated the allegations and did not suspend the campaign. When Operation BearLove Good, Cancer Bad ended, Matthew Inman said that he still plans to go with his plan of taking a picture of the money, sending it to Carreon with the satirical picture, and donating the money, though now both the National Wildlife Federation and the American Cancer Society get $105,611.52 each instead of $10,000 each. Inman negotiated to receive the sum in $20 bills from the bank. As of July 1, 2012 Inman has already withdrawn and photographed his own funds, posting the images on July 9. Glenn Fleishman participated in and reported the photo shoot. Inman sent FunnyJunk a framed print of the satirical drawing and a photo of the cash spelling out \\"F. U.\\"  Carreon v. Inman et al  On June 15, 2012, Carreon filed a pro se lawsuit Carreon v. Inman et al in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland against Inman, Indiegogo Inc., the American Cancer Society, the National Wildlife Federation and a hundred anonymous Internet users for allegations related to the Oatmeal case. In the filing, Carreon says he donated to the fundraiser, which would give him legal standing for his lawsuit. Carreon stated that he wants to prevent charity fraud like the donations from being diverted from NWF and ACS to Inman, Indiegogo or other undisclosed charities. Inman responded to the lawsuit with a blog post, but was advised against giving interviews. Indiegogo responded with a statement calling the lawsuit \\"frivolous.\\" Lawyer Rebecca E. Hoffman of Bloomberg BNA said Carreon's case could \\"only be described as frivolity on top of frivolousness.\\"Hoffman, Rebecca E. (June 28, 2012). He let the world know about some infringement and now he's getting sued for raising $200K for charity. Wait, what? Bloomberg BNA On June 21, 2012, the case of Carreon v. Inman et al was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen. On the same day, the Electronic Frontier Foundation announced that it would represent Inman, stating, \\"This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to abuse the legal process to punish a critic.\\" On June 25, Carreon amended his lawsuit against Inman and the other defendants to include Kamala Harris, the state Attorney General of California. On June 30, Carreon also requested a temporary restraining order to stop disbursement of the donations.Farivar, Cyrus (July 1, 2012). FunnyJunk lawyer aims to halt distribution of \\"BearLove\\" money. Ars Technica On July 1, 2012 Inman's and Indiegogo's attorneys filed opposition.

Charles Carreon Drops Bogus Lawsuit Against The Oatmeal Creator. Carreon declared, \\"Mission Accomplished,\\" in an interview with Ars Technica and told Comic Riffs, ‚ÄúInman aborted his ‚Äòpublicity stunt‚Äô to photograph himself with the proceeds that were intended to go to charity, the court took cognizance of the issues and ordered Inman to deposit evidence of his disposition of the funds, and Inman deposited the evidence of payments made to the charities.‚Äù Carreon wrote to MSNBC.com, \\"While it's not the largest sum of money I have ever had a substantial role in raising, it is the first time I've seen it go to charity, and I think it's great.\\" Carreon went on to propose a mud wrestling match with Inman but Inman declined.

There is no village clustered around the church, rather the nearest village within the parish is Longdown. Only the manor house and two cottages are situated next to the church. The former manor house next to the church is today known as Holcombe Burnell Barton having subsequently been used as a farmhouse. The manor was in the historical Hundred of Wonford. Church of St John the Baptist Chancel of Holcombe Burnell Parish Church looking eastwards, showing the 16th-century Easter Sepulchre monument to a member of the Denys family, north wall of chancel The church was dedicated originally to St Nicholas, mentioned in a charter dated 1150.Chalk In the 15th century the manor was acquired by a member of the Denys family of Orleigh in Devon, and the church was then substantially reconstructed. The church was restored in the Victorian era in 1843‚Äì1844, to the plans of the Exeter architect John Hayward with Henry Lloyd of Bristol. The north aisle was added at that time. The church contains a rare Easter Sepulchre, situated on the north side of the chancel. The advowson of the church was acquired by the Bishop of Wells, which made it into a prebendary for one of its canons. The advowson was acquired by the Bishop of Exeter in about 1850. The altar is an ancient Spanish chest in carved oak from Culver House, one of the principal residences in the parish. The font is 15th century. There existed formerly next to the manor house a private chapel, demolished in the 18th century, the only remains of which are some stone blocks made into a mounting block by the church gate. Medieval manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records the manor as held by Queen Matilda. Before the Norman Conquest it had been a possession of Brictric, a powerful thane based in Gloucestershire. After the death of Queen Matilda the manor was granted by the king to Tetbald FitzBerner, one of King William's knights. The manor derives its appellation \\"Burnell\\" from a corruption which has developed over the centuries of the name \\"Berner\\". From the 15th century the manor was held by a branch of the Denys family. Thomas Denys (died 1498) of Holcombe Burnell married Janera Loveday, daughter of Philip Loveday of Sneston in Suffolk, and their son was Sir Thomas Denys (c. 1477 ‚Äì 1561), a prominent lawyer who served as Sheriff and MP for Devon. He married twice, firstly to Anne, widow of Thomas Warley a Treasury official, and secondly to Elizabeth Donne, widow of Sir Thomas Murfyn, Lord Mayor of London. Sir Thomas is notorious as having supervised the burning at the stake of the Protestant martyr Thomas Benet in Exeter in January 1531/2. His eldest son was Sir Robert Dennis (died 1592), MP for Devon in 1555 and Sheriff of Devon, who acquired Bicton House. According to W. G. Hoskins, the Easter Sepulchre in the church is his tomb and monument.Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, Newton Abbot: David & Charles. New edition, 1972. p. 410\\\\. Sir Robert married Mary Blount, a first cousin of Lady Jane Grey. In March 1591 he founded the Livery Dole Almshouses in Heavitree Road, Exeter.Worthy, Charles. History of the Suburbs of Exeter, 1892 Sir Robert's eldest son and heir, Sir Thomas Denys married Anne Paulet, daughter of William Paulet, 3rd Marquess of Winchester, and left two co-heiresses, Anne Denys who married Sir Henry Rolle (died 1616) of Stevenstone, and Margaret Denys (died 1649) who married Sir Arthur Mainwaring of Ightfield, Shropshire.

Early life and education  Tigar was born in London, England in 1962. Tigar earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and Economics in 1984 from Williams College and a Juris Doctor degree in 1989 from UC Berkeley School of Law. He graduated Order of the Coif, was an Articles Editor of the California Law Review, and served as a Research Assistant to Professor Melvin Eisenberg. In 1989, Tigar served as a law clerk for United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Judge Robert Smith Vance.  Professional career  From 1990 until 1992, Tigar served as a litigation associate for the law firm Morrison & Foerster. He then served as a public defender in San Francisco from 1993 until 1994 Tigar practiced complex commercial litigation at the law firm Keker & Van Nest from 1994 until 2002. From 2002 to 2013, Tigar served as a judge on the Alameda County Superior Court. Tigar is a member of the American Law Institute, for which he served as an Adviser to the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Loss and will serve in the same capacity on the forthcoming Restatement (Third) of Torts: Defamation and Privacy. Tigar has taught Pretrial Litigation at UC Berkeley's School of Law. He is a Fellow of the American Bar Foundation.  Federal judicial service  On June 11, 2012, President Obama nominated Tigar to be a judge on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, taking the seat vacated by Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong, who took senior status on March 23, 2012. The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on his nomination on July 11, 2012, and reported his nomination to the floor on August 2. The Senate confirmed his nomination by unanimous consent on December 21, 2012, and he received his commission on January 18, 2013. Notable decisions On April 2, 2015, Tigar ordered the California Department of Corrections to provide gender reassignment surgery to a transgender inmate, finding that such surgery was the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria. On October 4, 2017, in the In re Wells Fargo & Company Shareholder Derivative Litigation, Tigar allowed a shareholder lawsuit to proceed against Wells Fargo's directors, finding that it was plausible that they had \\"consciously disregarded their fiduciary duties despite knowledge regarding [Wells Fargo's] widespread illegal account-creation activities.\\" Writing for the New York Times, financial writer Gretchen Morgenson called the ruling \\"unusual and welcome\\" and said it would \\"resonate among corporate directors.\\" On November 19, 2018, Tigar issued a nationwide injunction barring the Trump administration from enforcing a rule that would deny asylum to anyone who entered the United States somewhere other than at a designated port of entry. Complaining about the ruling, President Trump characterized Tigar as an \\"Obama judge,\\" prompting Chief Justice John Roberts to defend judicial independence by stating, \\"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\\" Tigar's injunction was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court allowed the injunction to remain in place pending appeal. On July 24, 2019 Tigar issued a nationwide injunction that barred the Trump administration from denying asylum to persons who crossed through but did not apply for asylum in a third country. In August, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found the administration's asylum policy \\"likely violated federal regulatory law\\" but narrowed Tigar's injunction to apply only within the Ninth Circuit. On September 9, 2019, Tigar reinstated the nationwide scope of the injunction. The Supreme Court stayed both orders on September 11, 2019 without addressing the legality of the administration's asylum policy. On July 6, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the injunction blocking the third country asylum bar and upheld the nationwide scope of the injunction.

Ford (April 6, 1912 ‚Äì September 12, 1954) was a member of the Dearborn, MI City Council from 1945-1953. Ford was a resident of Dearborn for 27 years, studied in Dearborn schools and did post graduate work at the University of Detroit. He was a State Senate nominee for the state of Michigan in 1944, 1948, and 1950 under the Republican ticket. Ford was a member of the Pioneers, Knights of Columbus, Moose and Eagles. Early life, education, and family Ford was born in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan on April 6, 1912. Joseph moved to Dearborn in 1923 with his parents. He studied at the University of Detroit. Joseph enjoyed spending time with his family and friends. He was known to be an avid fisherman and an outdoors-man.

Sector G mostly supports the football club of the CSKA Sofia sports society but also visits the important games of the volleyball, hockey and basketball departments of CSKA. The most influential ultras groups in Sector G are Animals' and Offenders. Members of Sector G often have nationalistic, antiziganistic, albanophobic and turkophobic beliefs. Sector G traditionally maintains good relations with the supporters of Romanian football club FC Steaua Bucure»ôti And Sector G's main rivalries are with Levski Sofia's Sektor B and Lauta Army of Lokomotiv Plovdiv.  History  Sector G at Balgarska Armia Stadium Although it was created relatively later than the other popular Bulgarian clubs, the team's early success led to a quickly growing fanbase and by the 1960s it already was one of the most popular and successful Bulgarian clubs at the time. The club's record attendance dates back to 1982. Some 70,000 spectators attended the European Champions Cup quarter final and semifinal games against Liverpool F.C. and Bayern Munich at Vasil Levski National Stadium, which are one of the largest recorded attendances of sport events in Bulgaria. In October 1999, Dimitar Angelov was appointed as a chairman of the National Fan Club of CSKA and left in August 2012. 2008 protests After CSKA won the 2007-08 A PFG without a single loss and with a record advantage of 16 points ahead of second-placed Levski Sofia, the team's license for European competitions was taken away because of financial problems. This resulted in several protests against the club's then-president Aleksandar Tomov, some of which ended with minor clashes with the police. In the end of the year, Tomov sold the club to Dimitar Borisov and Ivo Ivanov. Boycott and 2011 split CSKA ultras at Vasil Levski National Stadium. After numerous head coach changes, unfulfilled project for a new stadium and poor performance of the team, the majority of the ultras declared a boycott of the club's domestic home games because of inadequate management of the team by its new owners. After CSKA lost 0:2 to Rapid Vienna in Sofia during the 2010-11 Europa League group stage, thousands of fans gathered in front of the stadium shortly after the game seeking response from the owners, who were believed to be the main reason for the team's poor performance. However, the police pushed out the fans from the stadium and clashed with them. In 2011, the boycott was stopped and protests continued on the stadium. The protests were not fully supported by Dimitar Angelov and the National Fan Club which led to tensions inside Sector G. Shortly after, it became known that Angelov was receiving money from the owners which he allegedly used for private purposes. As a result, Angelov's supporters rapidly decreased and he quickly lost his power and influence. The ultras group Ofanziva was founded by Angelov's antagonists and it is currently the most influential and largest group inside Sector G. After CSKA unexpectedly lost to the Slovenian club ND Mura 05 in the second qualifying round of the 2012/13 Europa League, tensions between the fans and the club's board escalated once again. Thus, a large protest against the club's owners was proposed for 26 August 2012. 2013 protests and victory of fans against owners from Titan AS After the uncertain future ahead of CSKA Sofia, all united fan clubs announced national protests against the rule of the \\"Pernik garbages\\" (fans called them, because of their business with waste disposal and because they were born in the town of Pernik). After several daily protests, on 29 June 2013 Bulgarian Football Union announced that CSKA will not get a license for next season and the club will be closed, affected of this over 1000 supporters go to the central office of Titan AS (owners of CSKA), but were stopped by police, they come back and go to the BFU headquarters and attack building with stones, firecrackers, flares, smoke bombs and anything that's handy on the street. About two weeks later the club is sold to Red Champions Group, association of businessmen and sports figures attached to CSKA Sofia.

The Bike Shed, which is a youth-led, no-fee bike shop, is run by ‚ÄúChef Boy RB‚Äù Burnette Jr., aka Scraper Bike President. Members of the Original Scraper Bike Team were featured in Boots Riley‚Äôs 2018 film Sorry to Bother You as background extras. In 2018, members of the team reported being harassed by San Leandro police, sometimes having their bikes taken. SLPD did not respond to requests to comment on the incidents, but the bikers suspected SLPD officers thought they were breaking traffic laws, or that their bikes were stolen. On February 11th, 2019, rideshare company Lyft invested $700,000 dollars in the East Bay‚Äôs public transit system. The deal included a partnership with the Original Scraper Bike Team, funding a free bike sharing program run out of their bike shed at the MLK Jr. Library Branch.

In 2002-2010 the land area of UK was added in the soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation may not be a problem as such, but large monoculture areas and loss of rain forest may be in conflict with the local law and international agreements, add the use EU denied problematic chemicals, add climate change gases, and conflict with the rights of local peoples. Deforestation is fastest in Mato Grosso area, where soybean cultivation doubled in 1996-2006.Mer k√∂tt och soja, mindre regnskog Swedwatch 1.3.2010 Sweden imports annually 385,000 t soybean and 10,000 t beef from Brazil.

The major beef importers are North Trade and Annerstedt Flodin. Control of the Swedish companies in the Brazil deforestation was not sufficient. Swedwatch recommends better control, public control reports that can be criticized, and. selection of partners based on certifications.

It is being actively promoted by a number of governments for more effective implementation of domestic policy.UK Cabinet Office, \\"Open Public Services - White Paper\\"White House Office of Management and Budget, \\"Paying for Success\\" There is also increasing interest in the field of international development, where PBR is often referred to either as 'results-based aid' (where the funding relationship is between a donor and a recipient country) or 'results- based financing' (where the funding relationship is between a developing country government or a development agency, and public or private sector providers). There are also a number of other terms in use which can often lead to confusion and a lack of clarity.ESMAP (2013).\\"Results-Based Financing in the Energy Sector: An Analytical Guide\\", p.45. The World Bank, Washington, DC PbR instruments have three key features: * Payments for pre-agreed results * Recipient discretion over how the results are achieved * Independent verification as the trigger for disbursement  Domestic policy  There are many cases of PbR models being used to achieve domestic policy goals, in particular the delivery of social or community services, with payments linked to the results a provider achieves, rather than its inputs and processes. The use of PbR models is often promoted as a way to drive service improvements and achieve increased value for money by aligning incentives to desired outcomes. In practice, a diverse range of PbR models have been implemented by Governments, varying by the degree to which: # payments can be based on the achievement of pure outcomes; and # risk can be transferred away from Government and towards providers. The purest form of PbR is Payment by Outcomes, which seeks to maximise payments linked to outcomes. This is where the commissioner (central or local Government) is fully able to contract in terms of the outcomes it wants and to transfer the financial risk of non- delivery to providers. However, commissioners may face a number of challenges that may make a pure Payment by Outcomes approach either impractical or sub- optimal in terms of achieving the aims of PbR models. These challenges largely stem from commissioners‚Äô ability to manage different risks and responsibilities, especially in relation to their understanding of desired outcomes and their measurement. Challenges can include outcomes only being delivered beyond the provider or investor‚Äôs return horizon, meaning an earlier payment or proxy outcome must be used; having sufficient confidence that the cash savings used to fund the payment of outcomes will ultimately be realised (e.g. that a reduction in re-offending translates to a reduction in prison capacity); finding a contractual solution that ensures transactional costs are reasonable; and determining how far the delivery of outcomes is attributable to the actual intervention rather than other services or background factors. Commissioners may also find providers are reluctant to accept all of the delivery risk (e.g. where there is a dependency on future Government actions or policies) or where Government cannot truly transfer all of the delivery risk. There are no known cases where all Government services are commissioned out. Furthermore, PbR will not always be the optimal contracting model, especially where in-house delivery is more appropriate, or where greater control is required over the service to be delivered. Education Payment by results was introduced in the management of British schools in June 1862. National funding for individual schools, eventually rising to about half, depended in part on the outcomes of examinations of the pupils conducted by school inspectors. The system was deeply unpopular with teachers and led to increased unionisation. The system was abandoned in 1890. National Health Service A national tariff was introduced to the British NHS in 1990 and operated in the English NHS until 2020, prescribed in the National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012. Clinical Commissioning Groups, and NHS England are required to enter into standard ‚ÄúPayment by Results‚Äù contracts with providers. Such a contract between an NHS commissioner and a hospital trust is compulsory for all services provided to NHS patients. NHS Improvement is required by section 116 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to produce a National Tariff, which trusts must be paid for all the specified services. There is provision for an increase to the tariff. University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust was the first, and so far only one, in July 2015, to get an increase for its services agreed by Monitor (NHS) because of its \\"increased costs associated with this trust running health services across multiple sites in rural locations\\". It is paid more per episode for accident and emergency, surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, paediatrics, women‚Äôs health, and non-elective medical conditions. This is expected to increase the trust's income by more than ¬£20 million per year. In 2019-20 a new blended tariff with a fixed payment based on expected activity plus a risk share element was introduced for emergency care, and will be rolled out to other areas.  International development  A range of different instruments in the field of international development can be characterized as Payment by Results, many of which seek to provide incentives for the achievement of both outcomes and outputs by developing country governments, public agencies, commercial operators and civil society organizations. By linking disbursement to results PBR is an alternative to the majority official development assistance (ODA), which is generally provided as grants, loans and guarantees, and is therefore disbursed in advance of delivery. Proponents of PbR argue that this approach is more likely to deliver the desired development objective, with less scope for waste and greater freedom and incentive for the beneficiary to innovate or achieve the desired objective at least cost. Possible criticisms include the need for recipients to obtain pre-financing, the risk of unintended consequences, higher monitoring and verification costs, and the difficulty of setting the incentive at the optimum level (thereby leading to the risk of rent-seeking behavior). Results-based aid is concerned with incentivizing national-level outcomes and involves the linking of ODA (e.g. from bilateral or multilateral development agencies to developing country governments) to verifiable results, such as performance against one or more outcome indicators, or the successful implementation of a government program. Possible outcomes might include number of children passing an exam, an improvement in the infant mortality rate, or the number of people with a defined improvement in access to energy. Results- based financing is concerned with the delivery of national or sub-national outputs, and could be used by developing country governments (national or local), public agencies, or development agencies as incentive for the provision of goods or services, create or expand markets, or stimulate innovation. Possible target outputs might include the number of vaccines administered, the number of teachers that are trained, the number of new electricity connections that are provided in a defined area. Results-based financing includes approaches such as Output-Based Aid (OBA). Existing examples of PbR programs include the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid and Results-Based Financing for Health. However, interest in PBR in the international development sector is growing. The UK Department for International Development is piloting Cash on Delivery AidCenter for Global Development, \\"Cash on Delivery: A New Approach to Foreign Aid\\" (a form of results-based aid) and results-based financing programs in a number of countries,DFID, \\"DFID Pilots on Payment by Results\\" the World Bank has recently launched Program-for-Results (PforR),World Bank, \\"A new instrument to advance development effectiveness: program-for-results financing\\" a new results-based lending instrument, and the EU is exploring results-based approaches for the aid component of the multi-annual financial framework from 2014.

Orrick's uncle, Andrew Downey Orrick, was acting chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in San Francisco.Bob Egelko, S.F. lawyer Andrew Downey Orrick dies, San Francisco Chronicle (February 2, 2008). Orrick received his B.A. cum laude, from Yale University in 1976. He received his J.D. cum laude, from Boston College Law School in 1979. Legal career From 1977 to 1979 he was a student attorney for the Boston College Legal Assistance Bureau. After graduating, Orrick worked from 1979 to 1984 at the Georgia Legal Services Program in Savannah, providing legal aid services to low-income Georgians. Upon returning to San Francisco, he chose to join William Coblentz's Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass LLP, rather than the law firm co- founded by his grandfather William Orrick Sr., Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP. Orrick practiced at the Coblentz firm for about 25 years, from 1984 to 2009. He joined as an associate in 1984 and was promoted to partner in 1988. Orrick then served in the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, first as counselor (June 2009 ‚Äì June 2010) and then as deputy assistant attorney general (June 2010‚Äì2013), heading the Office of Immigration Litigation.Ryan J.

Orrick returned to Coblentz, Patch, Duffy & Bass for ten months while his nomination to the district court was pending in the Senate. Federal judicial service On June 11, 2012, President Obama nominated Orrick to be a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, to the seat vacated by Judge Charles R. Breyer, who took senior status on December 31, 2011.

He received his commission the following day. As a federal judge, Orrick established chambers in the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco. Notable cases In 2014, Orrick upheld California state legislation that banned the possession and sale of shark fin, a prohibition aimed at stopping the practice of shark finning. Orrick rejected the claim of a group of San Francisco Bay Area Chinese American businesses and shark fin suppliers that the ban was unconstitutionally discriminatory. Orrick wrote that although \\"people of Chinese origin or culture undoubtedly overwhelmingly comprise the market for shark fin,... a law is not unconstitutional simply because it has a racially disparate impact.\\"Bob Egelko, California shark fin ban upheld by federal judge, San Francisco Chronicle (March 26, 2014).Chinatown Neighborhood Ass'n v. Harris, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1085 (N.D. Cal. 2014). Orrick's dismissal of the case was affirmed on appeal.Chinatown Neighborhood Ass'n v. Harris, 794 F.3d 1136 (9th Cir. 2015). In 2015, Orrick denied a motion filed by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E;) to dismiss the case against it arising from pollution discharges into San Francisco Bay by PG&E;'s manufactured fuel gas (oil and coal) power plants decades earlier. Orrick held that PG&E;'s refusal to test for groundwater contamination at the former plants gave rise to a continuing \\"imminent and substantial endangerment\\" to the environment and human health, particularly in the Marina District and Fisherman's Wharf neighborhoods.Bob Egelko, PG&E; settles lawsuit over pollution from old power plants in San Francisco, San Francisco Chronicle (September 28, 2018).San Francisco Herring Ass'n v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 81 F. Supp. 3d 847 (N.D. Cal. 2015). In 2018, Orrick approved a settlement of the case, in which PG&E; agreed to monitor and potentially clean up pollution from its old sites and agreed to make payments to a conservation organization and habitat restoration efforts. Orrick is the judge assigned to oversee the reforms of the Oakland Police Department mandated by the department's 2003 settlement of Allen v. City of Oakland, a long-running case involving systemic police misconduct.Mayor Says She Shares Judge's Concerns About Police Department, Bay City News Service (August 22, 2019). In hearings, Orrick has pushed the department to make more progress on reforms. Robert Warshaw is the court- appointed monitor of the Oakland Police Department reforms.Judge Appoints Attorney To Investigate Fatal Shooting By Officers, Bay City News Service (March 5, 2019). In March 2019, Orrick appointed an attorney to serve as an independent investigator to probe the killing of a homeless man with mental health problems who was shot by Oakland police in 2018. At an August 2019 court conference, Orrick criticized the city for not making sufficient progress in eliminating racial disparities in policing.Bob Egelko & Megan Cassidy, Federal judge criticizes Oakland for losing ground in court-ordered policing reforms, San Francisco Chronicle (August 22, 2019). In 2015, Orrick issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), an anti-abortion group, from releasing secretly recorded videos of the National Abortion Federation (NAF). CMP had earlier released heavily edited videos, which purported to show that Planned Parenthood had been inappropriately selling fetal tissue. In his decision granting a restraining order, Orrick wrote that a TRO was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to NAF \\"in the form of harassment, intimidation, violence, invasion of privacy, and injury to reputation, and the requested relief is in the public interest.\\" In subsequent proceedings, Orrick reviewed hundreds of hours of videos and found no evidence of wrongdoing on NAF's behalf, and concluded that the CMP, led by anti-abortion activist David Daleiden, had \\"misleadingly edited videos to make it appear as though abortion providers were breaking the law.\\" In 2016, Orrick subsequently issued a preliminary injunction against CMP blocking the release of their videos; after Daleiden violated the injunction, Orrick found Daleiden and his two attorneys in civil contempt and fined them $195,000. The contempt finding was upheld on appeal. In April 2017, Orrick stayed the implementation of the Trump administration's Executive Order 13768 to withhold funding from sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities, saying Trump had no authority to attach new conditions to federal spending. In November 2017, Orrick ruled in favor of the City and County of San Francisco and County of Santa Clara (who challenged the order), finding that Section 9(a) of the Executive Order was unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine and the counties' Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights and issuing a nationwide permanent injunction against its implementation. In 2018, Orrick's ruling was upheld on appeal, but the scope of the injunction was narrowed to San Francisco and Santa Clara. In February 2018, Orrick issued a preliminary injunction ordering the Trump administration to enforce limits on methane emissions from oil and gas wells on federal and tribal land. (Methane is a greenhouse gas that, when released into the atmosphere, is a cause of climate change.) Orrick's order directed the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to halt the Trump administration's suspension of an Obama administration-era regulations that required fossil-fuel extractors on federal lands to take steps to reduce flaring and venting, and thus prevent methane leakage.Bob Egelko, Trump administration ordered to enforce limits on methane gas emissions, San Francisco Chronicle (February 23, 2018).State of California v.

Early life and education  Ismail Sait was born in March 1859 to Hajee Saliah Muhammad Sait of Bangalore. In 1870, his family moved to Bangalore when the British established their cantonment. Four years later, when his father died, the 15-year-old Ismail Sait plunged into the business of buying and selling goods. Through his various businesses, he catered to the needs of the British.  Career  Hajee Sir Ismail Sait's first commercial venture was a shop called the English Warehouse. He later diversified into a variety of businesses. By the early 1900s, Ismail Sait was one of the richest merchants, not just in Bangalore, but in all of south India. His first commercial venture seems to have been an extremely successful shop called the English Warehouse, strategically located on St Mark's Road, close to where his (mainly English) customers were. The shop sold all manner of goods from milk powder to machinery, everything imported from England. The shop flourished and soon, there were branches of English Warehouse in Chennai and Secunderabad too. Very quickly, Ismail Sait built on the success of his shop and diversified into an astonishing variety of businesses. At the age of 22, he became a director in the newly-established Carnatic Mills (which later merged with another mill to become the well-known Binny Mills). He owned and operated mines in Kolar Gold Fields and Shimoga. He supplied various provisions to the British army establishment in Bangalore, including horse gram. He traded in timber. He ran a distillery and a carbonic acid manufacturing unit in Calcutta. He also served as director in the Mysore Sandalwood Oil company, the Mysore Sugar company and the Bhadravathi Iron Works. Also Ismail Sait served as Chairman and Director of the Mysore Bank Limited, Bhadrawathi Iron Works and the Mysore Government Sandalwood Factory. Sait also constructed a number of mosques and hospitals in Bangalore, Madras and Bombay.  Honours  Sait was made a Khan Bahadur in 1911 and knighted in 1923. Sait Colony, a locality in Egmore, Chennai is named after him. In 1888, became a magistrate in Bangalore. File:Russell Market Key 2.jpg Russell Market Key Replica Made in Silver. Eighty-five years ago, when the market was opened, a Bangalorean was given a replica of the key to the market by the British, who built it. Hajee Sir Ismail Sait, businessman and philanthropist, was invited by the British to inaugurate Russell Market on August 5, 1927. The British also handed over a memento ‚Äî the replica of the key. Ismail Sait was nominated as a member of the Madras Legislative Council in 1911. In 1923, the then Mysore Government conferred the title Fakhr-ut-Tajjar on him and the King of England knighted him. Being successful in business was not the reason for honours being heaped upon Ismail Sait. Throughout his life, he donated generously to many causes. His most well-known act of charity was to donate Rs 1,50,000 towards the construction of the Gosha hospital in Bangalore, set up so that women who observed purdah could also avail of modern medical care. The hospital opened in 1925. He also donated the land and Rs 50,000 to build the mosque in Fraser Town that still bears his name.

From 1981 to 1991 he was the director of the GDR Academy of Sciences' Institute of Mathematics in Berlin.  Early years  Matthes studied from 1948 to 1954 mathematics at Humboldt University of Berlin. He obtained his PhD from his alma mater in 1958, advised by Heinrich Grell and Kurt Schr√∂der. In 1963 he received the habilitation, with Willi Rinow as one of the referees.Wer war wer in der DDR?. Ein Lexikon ostdeutscher Biographien, vol. 2 M-Z. Ch. Links Verlag Berlin. pp. 851.  Career  Matthes was employed from 1956 to 1961 as scientific assistant at Humboldt University. Then he acted as provisional director of the institute of mathematics at Ilmenau University of Technology. From 1964 to 1968 he was then full professor of mathematics at University of Jena. There he was since 1966 the dean of the mathematical-natural-scientific faculty. In 1969 he moved to Berlin, to the Central Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics of the German Academy of Sciences, later Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic (G.D.R.). From 1981 to 1991 he directed the academy institute of mathematics, which in 1985 was named ‚ÄûKarl-Weierstra√ü-Institut f√ºr Mathematik‚Äú. Thanks to the high quality of its staff, its applied part survived the big changes of the East German science system and was re-founded after the German reunification as Weierstra√ü-Institut f√ºr Angewandte Analysis und Stochastik (WIAS). In 1974 Klaus Matthes was elected corresponding and in 1980 full fellow of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. He was decorated in 1971 with the National Prize of East Germany and 1983 with the bronze Vaterl√§ndischer Verdienstorden.  Scientific work  The main field of Klaus Matthes' scientific work was probability theory. He worked in particular on point processes and their application in queueing theory and branching processes. In queueing theory he studied loss systems, e.g. the Erlang and Engset loss systems, and was the first to apply deep methods of the theory of point processes in queueing. Klaus Matthes can be seen as the father of the theory of marked infinitely divisible point processes. He was, together with Johannes Kerstan and Joseph Mecke, the leader of the East German school of point process theory, which later found successful applications in other fields, e.g. in stochastic geometry.Dietrich Stoyan: Obituary: Klaus Matthes. In: Journal of Applied Probability. 36(4)/1999. Applied Probability Trust, pp. 1256, In the context of limit theorems for superpositions of point processes he came to the problem of infinite divisibility of point processes (following a suggestion by Boris Vladimirovich Gnedenko). Together with his coworkers he investigated systematically the structure of infinitely divisible distributions, which culminated in the monograph \\"Infinitely Divisible Point Processes\\". Closely related are spatial branching processes, which he studied until the end of his life. A central problem here were equilibrium distributions and their structure. Matthes initiated the today prestigious ‚Ä≥Euler lectures‚Ä≥ in Sanssouci near Potsdam.  Personal life  Klaus Matthes was married with the stage producer Gisela Matthes, n√©e Weisse, and he was father of two sons.  Bibliography (selection)  * Station√§re zuf√§llige Punktfolgen, I..

He then joined the Metallurgical Review in 1877. He left that short-lived journal in 1878 to join the staff of the Iron Age. He left Iron Age in 1881 to be managing editor of the Engineering and Mining Journal, but returned to Iron Age in 1884. Four years later he became its editor-in-chief and vice-president of the David Williams Company, the publishers. Kirchhoff kept up his editorial work, in which he won distinction, until his resignation in 1909, although he had been asked by Andrew Carnegie to quit New York for Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Steel Company. From 1898-99 and 1911‚Äì12, he was president of the American Institute of Mining Engineering. He was at one time a special agent of the United States Geological Survey for the collection of statistics of the production of copper, lead and zinc. Beginning in 1882, he prepared chapters on certain of the heavier metals annually for the Mineral Resources of the United States. He was a member of the Iron and Steel Institute, was once president of the Germania Club and was a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 1912 he married Erwina Diepenbrock.

Judith and her brother Buddy were orphaned at a young age by the death of their drug- addicted mother and were placed in separate foster homes. Her brother eventually landed in juvenile detention for attacking a foster father that was molesting him, with Judith resorting to selling used tampons, bodily fluids, and other personal effects in order to raise money for a lawyer to free him. After a cosmetic company botches an attempt to create marketable pheromones, women have begun attacking any men they see and devouring their flesh. As Judith makes her way to where her brother is imprisoned she comes across several different survivors such as teenager Frank and fast food worker Penny. The group brings in several new members such as Judith's former boss, only to quickly lose most of them to either zombies or trigger happy men willing to shoot at anything vaguely female. The group loses member after member until it's just Frank, Penny, and Judith. They run into a group of male vigilantes that shoot at the group due to Penny and Judith's gender. They jump off a bridge to escape them, losing Penny in the process. Frank and Judith manage to make it to Buddy's detention center, unaware that the vigilantes are also en route to the same location in order to rape the female inmates, who they mistakenly believe will be uninfected. Judith frees Buddy, who opens the doors to all of the prison cells in order to free the male inmates so they will not die from lack of food and water. This also releases the female inmates, who are infected and attack the vigilantes and the male inmates. Judith, Frank, and Buddy manage to fight their way out and drive off together. However when Judith and Frank are sleeping Buddy is shown to be mentally unstable, as he is shown to be discussing plans to murder Frank.

Biography Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, in 1965, to a British father and mother of mixed Mediterranean origins,\\"Monique Roffey: 'I wanted what my parents had'\\", The Guardian, 8 May 2010. Roffey was educated at St Andrew's School in Maraval, Trinidad, and then in the UK at St Maur's Convent, and St George's College, Weybridge. She graduated with a BA in English and Film Studies from the University of East Anglia in 1987, and later completed an MA and PhD in Creative Writing at Lancaster University.\\"Success Stories\\", English Literature and Creative Writing, Lancaster University. Between 2002 and 2006 she was a Centre Director for the Arvon Foundation and later held three posts for the Royal Literary Fund (2006‚Äì12).

She has also co-led writing retreats in Trinidad in collaboration with other Caribbean writers such as Professor Loretta Collins-Klobah and Professor Kei Miller and in partnership with Mount Plaisir Estate in Grande Riviere, Trinidad. Roffey has dual nationality and divides her time between London and Port of Spain. She is also a mitra of the Triratna Buddhist order.\\"AofA People: Monique Roffey - Author, Lecturer\\" (interview), Advantages of Age, 15 August 2017.  Works  Roffey has written five novels and a memoir. Sun Dog (2002), set in west London, is a magical realist tale of psychological estrangement, identity loss and subsequent individuation. The White Woman on the Green Bicycle (2009; shortlisted for the 2010 Orange Prize and the 2011 Encore Award), is the story of European ex-colonials living in Trinidad during the island's early Independence years and their subsequent process of creolisation. It was hailed by Commonwealth Prize-winner Olive Senior, who said: :‚Äú‚Ä¶it breaks entirely new ground. It is a major contribution to the New Wave of Caribbean writing: energetic, uncompromising, bold in the choice of narrative devices and a great read.‚Äù It has been published to critical acclaim in the UK, United States and Europe. Roffey's 2011 memoir, With the Kisses of His Mouth, is a personal account of a mid-life quest for sexual liberation and self-identification other than the aspirant hetero-normative model. It has been characterised as \\"a subversive work that transcends the author's personal story: it stands alone in the chasm that has opened between feminist literature and the belles du jour brigade.\\"Kapka Kassabova, \\"Archipelago by Monique Roffey ‚Äì review\\", The Guardian, 27 July 2012. Her novel Archipelago, published in July 2012, set in the aftermath of a flood, examines climate change from the perspective of a man from the southern Caribbean. Andrew Miller (Costa Award winner, 2012) said: \\"Archipelago is beautifully done. There's a warmth to it, an exuberance and a wisdom, that makes the experience of reading it feel not just pleasurable but somehow instructive. It's funny, sometimes bitingly poignant. And how well Roffey writes a male central character. A brilliant piece of storytelling.\\" Archipelago won the 2013 OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature,Julien Neaves, \\"T&T; writer takes top Bocas prize\\", Trinidad Express Newspapers, 28 April 2013.\\"Archipelago wins the OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature 2013\\", Blake Friedmann, 29 April 2013.Tanya Batson- Savage, \\"Archipelago by Monique Roffey Cops Bocas Prize 2013\\", Susumba, 30 April 2012. whose judges commended it for its \\"exploration of the greater Caribbean space in which is embedded a real-life story of trauma and loss and ultimately redemption that is both contemporary and compelling\\".\\"Trinidad-Born Author Wins Regional Prize For Literature\\", The Gleaner, 29 April 2013.

Roffey's 2014 novel, House of Ashes, is a fictionalised account of the events surrounding the 1990 attempted coup in Trinidad.\\"Monique Roffey launches latest novel House of Ashes\\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 28 October 2014. Ronald Adamolekun, for Wasafiri magazine, said: House of Ashes will be remembered as the most authoritative fictionalised account of the 1990 Trinidad and Tobago revolution, arguably the darkest moment of the island‚Äôs history.\\" The Telegraph called it \\"vigorous, grimly absorbing tale\\",Ian Thomson, \\"House of Ashes by Monique Roffey, review: 'knuckle-whitening'\\", The Telegraph, 22 July 2014. while The Observer‚Ä≤s reviewer concluded: \\"Roffey's writing is raw and visceral and she thrusts her readers headlong into the very middle of the action, her pen as powerful as the butts of the guns shoved in her hostages' backs.\\"Lucy Scholes, \\"House of Ashes review ‚Äì Monique Roffey's Caribbean coup d'etat\\", The Observer, 31 August 2014. A fifth novel, The Tryst, published in July 2017, was sold twice, first to Simon and Schuster UK, and then to independent press Dodo Ink. Having worked on it, on and off, for fourteen years, Roffey revisits the tale of Adam‚Äôs first wife, Lilith, and examines the common but taboo issue of celibacy within marriage. Like much of Roffey‚Äôs work, it weaves magical realism into a contemporary setting. Many well known literary writers, sex writers, and sex workers have applauded The Tryst. DBC Pierre said of it, \\"Not a shade of grey within a mile of this book. What makes The Tryst an unexploded virus isn't just the quality and brightness of Roffey's writing on sex, even as it uncovers inner glades between flesh and fantasy where sex resides ‚Äì but the taunting clarity of why those glades stay covered. A throbbing homewrecker of a tale, too late to call Fifty Shades of Red.\\" Rowan Pelling, editor of The Amorist, also said: \\"The Tryst is a sly, feral, witty, offbeat erotic novella that unsettles the reader, even as it arouses. There are sex scenes of breath-taking audacity. What would any of us do if an irresistible sex daemon broke and entered our domestic lives, leaving havoc in her amoral wake? Monique Roffey knows that the real question about human desire is whether we even recognise our deepest yearnings. How can anyone resist what they have never even dreamt of?\\" Bidisha, writer and broadcaster said: \\"It's wild and witching, at once contemporary and atavistic, with an anarchic sexual energy running through it and a startling frankness, not only about sex, but about love and relationships, gender and power. ... a daring write and a consuming read.\\" A writer of dual nationality and perspective, Roffey writes about sex, fatherhood, the Caribbean and outsiders, be they the terminally awkward August Chalmin (in Sun Dog), the left-behind Europeans in Trinidad (George and Sabine Harwood in The White Woman on the Green Bicycle), or indeed herself. Stylistically, her work can be linked in terms of post-modern narrative choices, in that they often weave together magical realism, real-life historical characters and events, biography and autobiography to tackle themes of alienation and otherness.

People More than 500 families are living in Ittamozhi village. Most of the peoples have moved there and settled from other parts of Tamil Nadu, including Coimbatore and Chennai. Many are involved in retail business. People of several castes (Hindu Nadar, Christian Nadar, pillai, Aasari) reside in this village.  Religion  Hindus and Christians both celebrate their religious festivals in Ittamozhi. There are many temples in Ittamozhi village, including Vadaku Mutharaman Kovail, South Mutharaman kovail, and Esakiamman Kovil. Hindus celebrate a seven-day festival called Kovil Kodai in mid August every year (AAvani Maathan in the Tamil calendar), and people from out of village also come and celebrate this festival.

Ittamozhi(‡Æá‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øä‡Æ¥‡Æø):Once up on a time, UK people visited this place. They asked local people about the name of the place. Then as there was no name, they told whatever you told is this place name in Tamil as \\"neengal itta mozhi\\", then he pronounced as \\"ittamozhi\\", after that this place is called Ittamozhi. This means, Itta means whatever you say or told, Mozhi means name or language. Hence it is still Ittamozhi.  Education  A V Joseph Govt Higher Secondary School is attended by young people in Ittamozhi and the surrounding villages. A few other private schools are also in the village.  Environment  Ittamozhi has a dry climate, and a number of tamarind trees, palm trees and Acacia Nilotica trees can be seen. Since the village is near the Coast, the climate is hotter in summer.

L. Franklin Boulevard (also called Linwood Street) in Detroit, Michigan. Founded in 1932, the church was led by the Reverend C. L. Franklin from 1946 until 1979 and was at the center of the Civil Rights Movement in Detroit. Since 1982, Rev. Robert Smith, Jr., has been the pastor. Early years The church was founded March 6, 1932. V. L. Bolton was the first pastor and was followed by Horatius \\"H.H.\\" Coleman (1932-1935), N. H. Armstrong (1935-1940) and William E. Ramsey (1940-1946). C. L. Franklin years=Growth of the congregation In May 1946, Rev. C. L. Franklin became the pastor. When Rev. Franklin became pastor, the congregation had 400 members and met in a bowling alley at Willis and Hastings. In October 1951, the church moved into a new church, built at a cost of $250,000 with a seating capacity of 2,500, at 4210 Hastings Street in Detroit. In the 1950s, New Bethel became known for its gospel choir which had weekly radio broadcasts. Participants included Rev. Franklin, music director Thomas Shelby, and Rev. Franklin's daughter Aretha Franklin. James Cleveland served as organist and sometimes conductor in the early 1950s. In 1956, a 14-year-old Aretha Franklin made her first recordings for J-V-B Records at New Bethel. In 1961, the church lost its Hastings Street building to construction of the Chrysler Freeway. The church, which had 4,000 members at the time, moved to the Gold Coast Theater (8210 Twelfth) for the next two years. Move to Oriole Theater building On March 10, 1963, the church moved to the previously-dilapidated Oriole Theater at the corner of Linwood and Philadelphia in Detroit. Detroit architect Nathan Johnson oversaw the remodeling which cost more than $500,000. The project was Detroit's \\"first major all-Negro building project\\", using an architect, contractors, and financing from the African-American community. The Detroit Free Press described the new structure as follows: \\"The row of glass doors at the entrance and the vast expanse of whiteness inside gives one the feeling of entering a miniature Cobo Hall.\\" More than 2,000 persons participated in a procession of cars from the temporary home at the Gold Coast Theater to the new site. At the time, Rev. Franklin described the trip as a \\"trip from the valley to the mountain.\\" Civil Rights Movement During the 1960s, New Bethel under Rev. Franklin became a center of the Civil Rights Movement in Detroit. Events occurring at New Bethel included: * In May 1963, Rev. Franklin was elected chairman of the Detroit Council of Human Rights and petitioned Detroit's Common Council for permission to conduct a march that became known as the Detroit Walk to Freedom. The group also adopted the \\"Declaration of Detroit\\" noting that 30% of Detroit's population was African- American, yet 70% of the city's African-Americans lived in substandard housing. The Detroit Walk to Freedom, planned by Rev. Franklin and members of New Bethel, took place on June 23, 1963. The protest had 125,000 persons, was the largest civil rights demonstration in the country's history to that point, and culminated in a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. at Cobo Hall. * In February 1965, a rally was held at New Bethel to raise funds for Dr. King's voter registration drive in Selma, Alabama. * In November 1965, Coretta Scott King delivered the key note address at the annual Women's Day services at New Bethel. * In October 1966, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered a speech at the annual men's day dinner at New Bethel. * In November 1966, James Meredith, five months after being shot during his March Against Fear in Mississippi, spoke at a rally at New Bethel. * In April 1969, a memorial for Dr. King was held at New Bethel on the first anniversary of his assassination. Police shootout On March 29, 1969, the church was rented by the Republic of New Africa as the site of a black separatist convention. A shootout between police and members of the movement resulted in the death of a police officer. Police raided the church and arrested 150 persons in attendance. A controversy followed after the attendees were held and questioned without counsel. During the incident, police fired into the church, causing extensive damage, and resulting in the need for financing to repair the \\"bullet-scarred\\" building. In May 1969, as the controversy over the police raid and shooting continued, Rev. Franklin was arrested by Detroit police who claimed that they found marijuana in his luggage; Franklin denied the charge, wondered if the incident was connected to the church shooting, and asserted, \\"Somebody wants to disgrace me.\\" Police had held the luggage for 24 hours, and Rev. Franklin claimed he had never in his life smoked marijuana. The charge was dismissed one month later for insufficient evidence. 1970s and Rev. Franklin's shooting In January 1974, two gunshots were fired into the church during a service conducted by Rev. Franklin. Two attendees were injured. In June 1979, Rev. Franklin was shot twice by burglars at his home in Detroit. Franklin remained in a coma until his death from heart failure on July 27, 1984. His funeral, held at New Bethel, was reported to be the largest in Detroit history, and featured Jesse Jackson as a speaker. In June 2016, the portion of Linwood Street adjacent to the church was renamed Rev. Dr. C. L. Franklin Boulevard. Notable funerals and weddings Since the 1960s, New Bethel has been the site of funerals and memorial services for many notable Detroit residents, including the following: * Singer Dinah Washington in December 1963, * Civil rights activist and UAW vice president Nelson \\"Jack\\" Edwards in November 1974, * Florence Ballard of The Supremes in February 1976, * Philipp√© Wynne, lead singer of The Spinners, in July 1984, and * David Ruffin, lead singer of The Temptations, in June 1991. Aretha Franklin was also married to Glynn Turman there in April 1978 in a ceremony featuring singing by The Four Tops. Later years After Rev. Franklin's shooting in 1979, the church suffered from a power struggle for more than two years. In June 1982, Rev. Robert Smith, Jr., became the new pastor. Rev. Smith remains as the church's pastor as of 2017. In 1987, Aretha Franklin recorded the album, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism, at the church, releasing the album on the Arista label. The album was re-released in 2003 with previously unreleased songs.Discogs - One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism 2003 ReferencesExternal links *Official site Further reading * \\"Singing in a Strange Land: C.

As court counselor, he participated in settling succession dispute with the Italian branch of the family. French Revolution With the advent of French Revolution, he returned to his native Alsace, where he became an administrator of the D√©partement of Bas-Rhin under the new regime created by the National Assembly He was elected (31 August 1791) as a representative of Bas-Rhin to the Legislative Assembly (1791‚Äì1792). He sat with the extreme left wing of the deputies and served as a deputy member of the Extraordinary Commission of Twelve (18 June 1792 ‚Äì 21 September 1792). Elected (4 September 1792) to the Convention (1792‚Äì1795) as a deputy for Bas-Rhin, he presided at the first session of the Convention as the oldest deputy present (20 September 1792). He continued to ally himself with the more radical section of deputies, joining the Montagnard faction. However, he was absent from the Convention during the trial of King Louis XVI. He would go on to serve a full term as President of the Convention from 6 March 1794 until 21 March 1794. R√ºhl served as a member of the Committee of General Security (14 September 1793 ‚Äì 31 August 1794). He was dispatched as Representative on a Mission to departments of Marne and Haute-Marne (16 September 1793 ‚Äì 3 November 1793) to assist in arranging the lev√©e en masse (military conscription). While on this mission he showed his revolutionary zeal by breaking the so-called Holy Ampulla (8 October 1793) ‚Äì the Holy Ampulla had been a vessel containing the sacred oil for anointment of the French kings at Reims.

The event was started by mayor Lauri Aho and secretary of the Helsinki Society Jorma Waronen in the late 1950s. The first Helsinki day was celebrated in 1959 on the 409th anniversary of the founding of Helsinki. The number of attendees at events on Helsinki Day already exceeded ten thousand in the early 1960s. In the same decade, the events were made more entertaining and diverse. Main events, such as ice hall concerts, were added. As the day gained popularity, the association of neighbourhood societies wanted to expand the celebration to a full Helsinki Week in the late 1970s, but the city council denied permission. Nowadays, Helsinki Week, culminating on Helsinki Day, has been established, and it is directed by the event unit of the Helsinki city council. Since the 1990s, various units of the city council, organisations and corporations have organised events on Helsinki Day.

In some sources his baptismal names are given as Jacques, Joseph (most probably in error); his surname also spelled as (de) Fermon or (de) Fermond. He can also be referred to as comte Defermon, comte de l'Empire (count Defermon, count of the Empire) from 23 March 1808. Biography Born in Basse-Chapeli√®re, near Maumusson, in what would become the Department of Loire-Atlantique, he was educated at the Coll√®ge de Ch√¢tillon, in Ch√¢teaubriant, before studying law at Rennes. He became a lawyer in the Parlement of Rennes in 1782.Jacques Defermon. A guide to the study of historical offices. October 2013. Accessed 11 February 2014. French Revolution Defermon was elected (18 April 1789) as a representative of the Third Estate of Rennes to the Estates General (France) and proceeded to become a deputy of the National Assembly from 1789 to 1791. He served as President of the National Assembly 19‚Äì30 July 1791, a vital period of time following the Flight to Varennes. During the tenure of the Legislative Assembly he served as president of the Criminal Tribunal of Rennes (1791‚Äì1792). Elected to the Convention (serving 1792‚Äì1793, then 1794-1795 following a lengthy suspension) as a deputy for the d√©partement of Ille-et-Vilaine. He was President of the Convention 13‚Äì27 December 1792, during much of the debates surrounding the question of the Trial of Louis XVI. He would be exiled as a regicide following the Restoration. Defermon supported the Girondists and signed a petition (2 June 1793) against their exclusion from the convention by the Montagnards. For acting against the ascendent faction he was declared \\"tra√Ætre √† la patrie\\" (Traitor to the Fatherland), and eventually was forced to go into hiding to escape the arrest decreed by the convention (3 October 1793). Thermidor and The Directory Defermon returned to exercising his duties as deputy in December 1794 as supporters of the Girondists are rehabilitated by an increasingly conservative Convention. He was elected a member of the Committee of Public Safety and served from 4 May 1795 to 1 September 1795). He was elected (14 October 1795) to the Corps l√©gislatif by the D√©partement of Ille- et-Vilaine and subsequently selected to sit in the Council of Five Hundred (1795‚Äì1797), serving as president from 21 May 1796 to 19 June 1796). He retired from the legislature upon his appointment as a commissioner of the National Treasury (1797‚Äì1799). Consulate, Empire, and Restoration Defermon supported the Coup of 18 Brumaire (10 November 1799) of Napoleon Bonaparte and was appointed a member of the Tribunat (25 December 1799) and counselor of state. He chaired the department of finance (1799‚Äì1814), was appointed intendant g√©n√©ral (1805), and named minister of state (1808). Napoleon awarded him the title of comte Defermon, comte de l'Empire (23 March 1808). During the Cent Jours (Hundred Days), was elected (12 May 1815) a deputy of the Chamber of Representatives from Ille-et-Vilaine. Banished as a regicide (1816), he lived in Brussels (1816‚Äì1822) before returning to France. He died in Paris in 1831 at age 78.

TMIM has been utilized to describe the management of information regarding challenging, taboo, or sensitive matters. In regards to interpersonal information seeking, there are numerous routes and methods one can choose to take in order to obtain that information. TMIM analyzes whether an individual will engage in information seeking within the first place and also assess the role of the information provider. The theory posits that individuals are ‚Äúmotivated to manage their uncertainty levels when they perceive a discrepancy between the level of uncertainty they have about an important issue and the level of uncertainty they want‚Äù. \\"TMIM distinguishes itself from other information-seeking theories in that it does not attribute the motivation of information seeking to a desire for uncertainty reduction; rather, the catalyst of information management in TMIM lies in the discrepancy between actual and desired uncertainty.\\" In other words, someone may be uncertain about an important issue but decides not to engage or seek information because they are comfortable with that state and, therefore, desire it. People prefer certainty in some situations and uncertainty in other While still fairly new, TMIM has been incorporated to look at a variety of issues within a variety of contexts. This theory, although dealing with psychological actions, looks at communicative behavior and is applied in communication, specifically in the subfields of interpersonal and human communication.  Background  Theory of Motivated Information Management TMIM was first proposed in 2004 by Walid Afifi and Judith Weiner through their article, ‚ÄúToward a Theory of Motivated Information Management‚Äù. A revision to the theory was put forth by Walid Afifi and Christopher Morse in 2009. TMIM was developed to account for a person's ‚Äòactive‚Äô information management efforts in interpersonal communication channels. The framework shares close ties to Brashers' uncertainty management theory, Babrow's problematic integration theory, Johnson & Meischkes' comprehensive model of information seeking (CMIS) and Bandura's social cognitive theory. The revision also relies on Lazarus' appraisal theory of emotions. TMIM stemmed out of a desire to bring together ideas and address limitations of existing frameworks on uncertainty. More specifically, it emphasizes the role played by efficacy beliefs, explicitly highlights the role played by the information provider in uncertainty management interactions, and improves communication research about uncertainty management decisions. Definition TMIM is a description of a three- phase process that individuals go through in deciding whether to seek or avoid information about an issue and a similar two-stage process that information providers go through in deciding what, if any, information to provide. TMIM's three-phase process consists of the interpretation, evaluation, and decision stages and the two-stage process is broken down by examining the role of the information seeker and information provider.  Phases = Process for the Information Seeker  Interpretation Phase The first phase involves an assessment of uncertainty. According to TMIM, individuals experience uncertainty when they feel that they cannot predict what will happen with a particular issue or in a given situation. The difference between the amount of uncertainty a person has and the amount of uncertainty he or she desires to have about this issue is referred to as uncertainty discrepancy. It serves as the motivation factor for the information seeking process. TMIM originally proposed that uncertainty discrepancy caused anxiety due to a persons‚Äô need for a balance between their desired and actual states of uncertainty. The revised version, however, proposes that the discrepancy can create emotions other than anxiety, including shame, guilt or anger, among others. Nevertheless, the emotion felt influences, and is followed by, an evaluation. Evaluation Phase The evaluation phase focuses on mediation. It is used to facilitate the effect of the emotion by evaluating the expectations about the outcomes of an information search and the perceived abilities to gain the information sought after. In other words, the individual weighs whether or not to seek additional information. This involves two general considerations central to most models of human behavior: :# Outcome expectancy ‚Äì individuals assess the pros and cons that come from seeking information about the issue. (Will the expected outcome be positive or negative?) :# Efficacy assessments ‚Äì individuals decide whether they are able to gather the information needed to manage their uncertainty discrepancy and then actually cope with it. (Will the expected outcome be too much to handle or manageable?) These two conditions will determine how someone seeks information. According to TMIM, individuals that experience feelings of efficacy are generally able to engage in the behavior or to accomplish the task at hand. Unlike the broad conceptualizations of efficacy recognized by the comprehensive model of information seeking (CMIS), the theory argues three very specific efficacy perceptions that are uniquely relevant to interpersonal communication episodes: # Communication efficacy ‚Äì An individuals‚Äô perception that they have the communication skills to successfully complete the task at hand. # Coping efficacy ‚Äì An individuals‚Äô belief that they can or cannot cope with what information they might discover from seeking. # Target efficacy ‚Äì consist of two distinct components: target ability and target willingness. Thus, this is based on an individual's perception of the target person's ability and willingness to provide information that will reduce the uncertainty discrepancy. The theory argues that outcome expectancy, which is an individual's assessments of the benefits and costs of information seeking, impact their efficacy judgments. However, these assessments have little direct impact on the decision to seek information. In other words, TMIM assigns efficacy as the primary direct predictor of that decision. The Decision Phase The decision phase is where individuals decide whether or not, to engage information. TMIM proposes three ways of doing so: 1\\\\. Seek Relevant information: Several studies have found that when individuals decide to seek information relevant to their uncertainty, they usually adopt a communication strategy to do so (such as passive, active, or interactive approaches). TMIM's image of information managers is consistent with these findings. However, in cases in which individuals determine that seeking information is too costly, anxiety reduction is unlikely, or is otherwise likely to be unproductive, they will likely resort to other strategies. 2\\\\. Avoid Relevant information : Rather than seeking information, individuals may sometimes choose to avoid relevant information. TMIM hypothesizes that individuals are most likely to avoid information if they consider information seeking risky due to the outcome, efficacy beliefs or both. Some individuals would also avoid situations or people who may offer relevant information. This response is referred to as ‚Äòactive avoidance‚Äô and essentially, the individual decides that ‚Äúthe reduction of the uncertainty related anxiety is likely to be more damaging than beneficial‚Äù. 3\\\\. Cognitive reappraisal: According to TMIM, individuals can also reduce the anxiety or emotion that activated the need for uncertainty management by changing their mindset (cognitive alteration). Therefore, the individual reappraises ‚Äúthe perceived level of issue importance, the desired level of uncertainty, of the meaning of uncertainty\\".  Process for Information Provider  Model of TMIM Predictions assesses the impact of how much information the target-provider would give and how they do so. The theory argues that the provider goes through similar evaluation and decision phases as the information seeker. The provider considers the pros and cons of giving the seeker the sought-after information (outcome assessment) and their efficacy to do so. However, the efficacy perceptions are tailored toward the provider: :# Communication efficacy ‚Äì Is the provider confident in their skills to competently provide the information? :# Coping efficacy ‚Äì Can the provider cope with the consequences of providing the information? :# Target efficacy ‚Äì Is the seeker able and willing to manage the provided information? This assessment helps the provider choose whether to provide information to the seeker or not. During the decision phase, the provider also gets to determine how and in what way to convey the sought-after information. For example, the information provider can decide to respond to a seeker's request face-to-face or by email.  Application  Several studies have successfully tested TMIM. Specifically, the theory has accurately predicted whether people seek sexual health information from their partners (2006), what drives people to talk with their family about organ donation (2006) whether teenagers talk to their divorced or non-divorced parents about the parents‚Äô relationship (2009), and whether adult children talk to their elderly parents about eldercare preferences (2011), among other issues. In all these cases, the theory has provided generally favorable results about its utility to predict individuals' information management decisions, but also experienced some limitations.

Built in 1926 by the American Car Company, it is a type of streetcar known as a Birney \\"Safety Car\\". It was listed on the National Register in 1994 and is one of fewer than 10 streetcars listed. Original use Introduced in 1915, the Birney Safety Car was a new standardized streetcar design that encompassed new safety features; it was also lighter in weight than earlier designs and more economical to operate. Its economies gave a \\"new lease on life\\" to many small- town streetcar systems. No. 224 was built and purchased in 1926. The Fort Smith streetcar system used several Birney-type cars during the last several years of streetcar service, until the abandonment of the system by the Fort Smith Light & Traction Company on November 15, 1933. Car 224 was later used as a diner in Ashdown, Arkansas. Restoration and new use Interior of car 224 Birney car 224 is owned by the Fort Smith Streetcar Restoration Association (FSSRA) and is part of the Fort Smith Trolley Museum (FSTM) collection. Car 224 was restored by FSSRA volunteers and began carrying passengers on the museum's heritage streetcar line on May 19, 1991.\\"World News\\". Modern Tramway, July 1991, p. 247. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK). It was added to the National Register exactly three years later, on May 19, 1994. The FSTM streetcar line, or trolley line the terms streetcar and trolley are used interchangeably in much of North America connects Garrison Avenue, in downtown, with the gates of the Fort Smith National Cemetery. Description Like many streetcars, car 224 is a \\"double-ended\\" car ‚Äì capable of being operated from either end. It has a single door on each side. The backs of its wooden-bench seats are reversible, allowing the seats to face either end of the car. This type of seat was also known as a \\"walkover\\" seat, as the motorman could walk down the car's center aisle at the end of the line and flip the backs of the seats over. The 600 Volts DC that powers the car's electric motor is collected from the overhead trolley wire via a trolley pole on the roof; only one of the two poles is in use at a time, depending on the direction of travel. The car has a single truck and, overall, is approximately long. Fort Smith car 224 is one of three Birney streetcars listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the others both being from the former Fort Collins, Colorado system: Fort Collins car 21, which operates on a heritage streetcar line in its home town, and Fort Collins car 22.

He was the second son of another John Grantham. After leaving school, John (junior) worked with his father surveying routes for projected railway lines in England. To Ireland His father, John Grantham (1774-1833), was appointed as John Rennie's assistant to survey the River Shannon. He introduced steam navigation to the inland Shannon in 1827 and his steam boats plied the Shannon and the Grand Canal and were taken up by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company. He is buried in the cathedral at Killaloe where there is a commemorative wall tablet. His son assisted him in the work. Return to England=Mather, Dixon and Company Returning to England, he joined Mather, Dixon and Company in Liverpool and later became a manager and partner in the firm. Naval work Mather, Dixon and Company closed in 1843 and Grantham began a practice as a Naval Architect and Consulting Engineer. He was involved in the design of several large iron sailing and steam ships, including Sarah Sands, Pacific, Antelope and Empress Eugenie. He became Engineer to the Whitehaven Steamship Company, and other companies, and was involved in the construction of vessels for Australia and Egypt. In 1859 he left Liverpool for London, where he continued to do work for the mercantile marine. Railways and tramways In 1860, became Engineer to the Buenos Aires Northern Railway, Argentina. In 1863, he created the first tramway in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1872 he designed a steam tramcar. This was a four-wheel double-deck car with two vertical boilers in the centre. The boilers were of the Field type and each was 18 inches diameter and 4 ft 4 in high. The engine, placed under the floor, had two cylinders, each 4\\" diameter and 10\\" stroke. These drove a single pair of driving wheels, 30\\" diameter. The car could be driven from either end.Whitcombe, H.A., History of the Steam Tram, pp 7-8, Oakwood Press, 1961 The car was built in 1873 by the Oldbury Carriage and Wagon Company and the steam machinery was supplied by Merryweather & Sons. The car was tried out in London, at West Brompton and in Vauxhall Bridge Road, but it was not a great success. Edward Woods modified it, by fitting a single Shand Mason boiler in place of the twin Merryweather boilers, and it was then used on the Wantage Tramway from about 1876 to 1881. The car re-appeared on the Portsdown and Horndean Tramway about 1903 and was derelict when that line closed in 1934. Innovations In 1830, Grantham won a prize from the London and North Western Railway for a design for pulling up passenger carriages from Lime Street to Edge Hill Station, Liverpool, by stationary engines.

He is the brother of the former Zetas leaders Omar Trevi√±o Morales (alias Z-42) and Miguel Trevi√±o Morales (alias Z-40). In 2008, Trevi√±o funded a horserace operation in Oklahoma with money he made through money laundering. Nonetheless, he was arrested by the FBI along with seven others in a horse-breeding ranch in Lexington, Oklahoma on 12 June 2012. He was found guilty of money laundering on May 2013, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a U.S. federal court in September of that same year. Events On 12 June 2012, federal agents raided some stables and a house ranch of Trevi√±o Morales in New Mexico and Oklahoma respectively. Prosecutors accuse Trevi√±o Morales and several others of running a money laundering operation connected with Mexico's most ruthless criminal organization, Los Zetas. Los Zetas are one of Mexico's most dangerous criminal groups, notorious for kidnapping, decapitating, and completely dismembering their victims to maintain their violent reputation. They also accuse his older brother, Miguel Trevi√±o Morales, the second-in-command of the cartel, of setting up the horse operations that his younger brother ran in Lexington, Oklahoma, south of the state's capital. Moreover, Miguel is also in the list of the most-wanted drug lords by the United States and Mexico; one of his favorite brutal techniques is known as the \\"guiso\\" (stew), where enemies are forcibly placed in a 55-gallon drums and then burned alive. Furthermore, millions of dollars ran the operations of Jos√©, which helped him buy, feed, train, and breed horses for professional races throughout the Southwest, including the famous Ruidoso Downs Race Track. After an indictment accusing Trevi√±o Morales and others of laundering money, the U.S. authorities arrested 7 out of the 14 indicted, including Trevi√±o Morales and his wife, Zulema. They could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Currently, there are no charges against Trevi√±o Morales in Mexico. The indictment alleges how Trevi√±o Morales, his brothers, and his close associates arranged a network where they quietly purchased race horses with drug proceeds at auctions, to then disguise the source of the funds used by them to cover up the involvement of Los Zetas. When carrying out the transactions, they would often pay in large sums of cash, or use fake names, to cover up their identities and avoid being caught. Since 2008, Trevi√±o Morales' operation generated millions of dollars in transactions from the states of California, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma; the New York Times first reported on the raids and the operation's alleged connection with the Zetas, citing several anonymous sources and investigations. The operation, Tremor Enterprises LLC, started small but quickly generated huge profits and worked in plain sight. In fact, some of the horses used for the races had references to the drug world, like Coronita Cartel and Number One Cartel, to name a few. Over time, the horses of the operation were placed among the best in their industry. One of them named Mr. Piloto won $1 million at a race in Ruidoso Downs Race Track on Labor Day in 2010, going off the odds of 22-1. Another horse, the Tempting Dash, won the Dash for Cash race in Grand Prairie, Texas. Trevi√±o's success in quarter-horse racing allowed him to hire top trainers and jockeys. His successful record allowed him to gain social status and get a popular magazine to cover his daughter's wedding, where many well- known figures in the horse racing industry attended. After a number of wins, Trevi√±o \\"stunned the quarter-horse world,\\" winning competition after competition with unknown horses, and rising as a well-known figure within the racing community, where he even gave interviews. Seizures and raids At least a half-dozen federal agents wearing military-like uniforms and baseball caps with the FBI insignias stood by Trevi√±o Morales's ranch in Oklahoma on 12 June 2012. The raid in Oklahoma netted to Trevi√±o Morales and his associates; however, several other raids were carried out by federal agents across the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, where he had properties. Federal agents and prosecutors are trying to seize their properties, bank accounts, and horses. Authorities issued a seizure warrant for 41 horses that deemed most valuable to the money laundering operation in an effort to prevent them from being sent south into Mexico. The government ordered to ensure the care of the other 384 horses in the ranch. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the authorities to seize live animals because it is expensive to feed and take good care of them. Several raids were also carried out by the Mexican authorities in Mexico; the arrest of several cartel members in the state of Veracruz was what led to the investigation of Trevi√±o Morales' assets in the United States. Raising suspicions A day after Trevi√±o Morales was arrested by federal agents, people in the Oklahoma ranching community claimed that he was a \\"good neighbor\\". Others recall Trevi√±o as a \\"family-oriented, hardworking bricklayer\\" who had just moved from Texas to Oklahoma to raise horses. Nonetheless, his ranch ‚Äì the Zule Farms ‚Äì was seen suspiciously by many of his neighbors. According to reports by The Houston Chronicle, Trevi√±o Morales was not laundering money discreetly; his tax records state that he made around $70,000 in 2008 and $58,000 in 2009, but he somehow managed to buy a giant spotlight for his ranch, buy huge portions of land during an economic recession, and make significant improvements to a company that was not known for making large profits. Neighbors questioned how Trevi√±o Morales, his wife, and the company's associates could afford to buy top-notch horses all in cash. It is estimated by the prosecutors that Trevi√±o Morales spent over 20 million U.S. dollars. It wasn't just the cash payments that brought attention to Trevi√±o Morales and caught the eyes of those in the racing industry. Trevi√±o Morales had earned a reputation for always paying his bills and giving out handsome prices for some of the elite horses across the nation. \\"They paid their bills and didn't cause any trouble,\\" the director of the Oklahoma Quarter Horse Racing Association said. While it is common for foreigners to pay in cash for their transactions in the horse racing industry, the payments of Trevi√±o Morales were \\"noteworthy in value.\\" The quality of the horses they were buying and the amount of money they would spend to buy them \\"raised some eyebrows.\\" Aftermath=U.S. Security Warning Following the arrest of Trevi√±o Morales, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico issued a security message on 12 June 2012 for American citizens living or planning to travel to Mexico. The message asked Americans to be aware of the incident involving Trevi√±o Morales' arrest, and asked them to be prepared for any violent retaliation by Los Zetas for the arrests. The embassy stated that given the history and resources of the drug trafficking organizations, Americans in Mexico should maintain low profile and heighten their awareness. The message, found on the official page of the Consulate General of the United States in the Mexican border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, states the following: Moreover, the communiqu√© urged Americans to defer non-essential travels to the state of Tamaulipas and register at their nearest embassy online, via phone call, or in person. Previously in February 2012, the United States Department of State issued security warnings to Americans in Mexico, but particularly in Tamaulipas. It prohibited Americans to travel outside the city limits of Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, and Matamoros due to the risks of armed robberies and carjackings. The department also encouraged them to not frequent casinos or adult entertainment establishments within the cities, and established a midnight to 6 a.m. curfew. Most of the reported crimes, however, happen from Matamoros to Tampico on the Mexican Federal Highway 101, especially through the municipality of San Fernando, Tamaulipas and in northern Tampico. Tamaulipas' response The Government of the state of Tamaulipas rejected the security message issued by the U.S. government and classified it as an \\"overreaction.\\" In their defense, the Mexican authorities noted that Tamaulipas is safeguarded by federal forces, and that there is currently no correlation between the arrest in the U.S. state of Oklahoma and the situation in Matamoros and the rest of Tamaulipas. They also said that the incident is merely a media backlash and ignores the efforts the Mexican government is implementing. Moreover, Julio Almanza Armas, a politician from Tamaulipas, stated through Milenio that the reality in Mexico is not how the U.S. portrays it. He said that the drug- related violence that occurs in Tamaulipas often happens in isolated circumstances. He accepted, however, that Mexico lives through harsh times, but reiterated his stance in support of Tamaulipas. IRS's comment After an indictment was unsealed on 12 June 2012, the chief of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigation stated the following: Horse racing is a \\"perfect vehicle\\" for laundering money from drug proceeds and hiding it from the authorities. The drug industry makes billions of dollars a year, so drug traffickers often find themselves unable to ship the cash back to Mexico, and end up laundering it in the United States. Buying ranches across the U.S. is a viable way of laundering money. When the money is not laundered, it ends up in the hands of the territorial bosses for counting and further distribution. But when the cartels turn to laundering, they make \\"investments in racing quarter horses purchased via bulk currency payments, wire transfers, structured deposits and bulk currency deposits.\\" With push-to-talk Nextels, BlackBerries, UHF/VHF radio communications, the Mexican cartels can oversee their laundering operations on U.S. soil. Trevi√±o Morales' money laundering case serves as a worrisome reminder that the operations of the Mexican drug cartels does not end at the U.S. border with Mexico. In addition to overseeing multimillion- dollar smuggling corridors, the drug trafficking organizations often launder their money in the United States. Of these, the state of Arizona was identified by federal agents in 2012 as the \\"consolidation point\\" for drug earnings. According to InSight Crime, what is more amazing than the Zetas' operation is the blatant manner in which they carried it out in the U.S. Trevi√±o Morales made no efforts to hide his activities and wealth, had no problem giving interviews to journalists, and even called his horse \\"Number One Cartel.\\" This attack is one of the most profitable money laundering schemes of Los Zetas, and is considered by the U.S. authorities as essential for the War on Drugs, since it will hurt the Zetas financially and help dismantle the violent criminal syndicate. Series of Zeta arrests On 15 June 2012, three days after the arrest of Trevi√±o Morales, his nephew ‚Äì Juan Francisco Trevi√±o (a.k.a. El Quico) ‚Äì was arrested in the industrial city of Monterrey. He was accompanied by a cousin, two unidentified women, and a couple of AR-15 rifles. Jes√∫s Ch√°vez Garc√≠a, his cousin, was wanted by the United States for drug trafficking, and was one of the inmates that escaped during a massive jailbreak inside a prison in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas in 2010. Days later, Francisco Antonio Colorado Cessa, a businessman from the Mexican state of Veracruz with deep ties with Los Zetas, turned himself in to the Mexican authorities. He was accused of acting as a straw purchaser of racehorses and securing contracts with worth up to $100 million in Mexico's national oil company, Pemex. Finally, Gregorio Villanueva Salas, nicknamed the Czar of Piracy for his involvement in the production and distribution of piracy products, was arrested by the on 14 June 2012. Aside from being a senior member in the Zetas' financial sector, Villanueva was responsible for carrying out grenade attacks on schools, media outlets, and military bases in the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. These series of arrests target those who were suspected of laundering millions of dollars for Los Zetas in the legitimate economy. This attack on the Zetas is a response to the long- standing criticisms made to Felipe Calder√≥n for his security policies. In addition, it fits the proposed strategy of his likely successor, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. He announced that if voted in, he will appoint √ìscar Naranjo as his security advisor, a prominent Colombian police general. Pe√±a Nieto promises that Naranjo's incorporation will bring Mexico into a more robust focus on the financial networks of the criminal groups, just like the strategy that was implemented in Colombia. Nonetheless, it is still unclear whether attacking the financial sectors of the drug cartels will bring down the violence. But that is not to say that the series of arrests after the capture of Trevi√±o Morales should not be deemed as noteworthy and significant. Court case On 3 July 2012, Trevi√±o Morales pleaded not guilty during a detention hearing in Austin, Texas. His attorney argued that he was not a risk to flee or commit a crime; the judge agreed with the attorney's statement, but said that Trevi√±o Morales might possibly flee to Mexico if he is jailed out. Trevi√±o Morales, along with eight others, were set to go on trial on 22 October 2012 and the trial was expected to take two weeks in length. Federal prosecutors stated they would present 30,000 pages of documents and over 2,000 recorded phone conversations to prosecute him. On 9 May 2013, Trevi√±o Morales was found guilty of money laundering in a Texan jury and faced up to 20 years in prison. On 5 September 2013, he was found guilty of the charges in a federal court in Austin, Texas and sentenced to 20 years. Bank of America laundering scheme According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Los Zetas used several accounts at the Bank of America corporation to hide money and invest it in the horse racing operation headed by Trevi√±o Morales. The money was allegedly held in bank accounts in Charlotte, North Carolina with the ultimate goal of appearing as a legitimate source of income for Trevi√±o Morales' purchases. Bank of America is not accused of any wrongdoing, and according to reports of The Wall Street Journal, the bank is actually cooperating with the FBI. Los Zetas laundered more than $1 million US dollars in this scheme.

Current statistics form the World Bank show that in 2011, 49.1% of Tanzanians lived below US$1.90 per day. This figure is an improvement over 2007's report indicating a poverty rate of 55.1%. Tanzania has seen annual GDP gains of 7% since 2010 and this economic growth is attributed to this positive trends for poverty alleviation in Tanzania. The 2019 World Bank report showed that in the last 10 years, poverty has reduced by 8 percent, from 34.4% in 2007 to 26.4% in 2018. Recently there has been statistical reductions in the levels of extreme poverty, basic needs poverty, and food poverty. However, these reductions are occurring faster in urban areas as compared to rural areas.  Indicators of Poverty  GDP Trends in GDP per capita also break along the same divisions, with Dar es Salaam's GDP per capita at Tshs. 1,600,000 as compared to the Tanzania Mainland's of Tshs. 600,000. High levels of economic growth in Tanzania has been sustained since 2001, yet the current high rates of poverty challenge whether pure economic growth can be realized in human development. Food Poverty The split between rural and urban poverty is most extreme in terms of food insecurity. As of 2012 only 1% of Tanzanian's in Dar es Salaam experience food poverty as compared to 11.3% of Tanzania's living in rural areas. HDI Utilizing the Human Development Index, urban areas Dar es Salaam and Arusha are classified as having Medium levels of HDI, while the remainder of Tanzania has Low HDI. HDI indicators also show the life expectancy is on the rise, as well as declines in infant mortality. Rural poverty Trends in poverty alleviation in Tanzania vary greatly between urban and rural areas in which about 70% of Tanzania's population dwells. Endowments play a large part in distributing economic growth unevenly, with urban households having better access to infrastructure, health services, and education. Migratory trends towards urbanization, which have risen from ‚Äú5.6% in 1967 to 29.1% in 2012,‚Äù are only increasing the inequality. Another main factor of rural poverty in Tanzania is the lack of infrastructure to provide energy to a huge part of the population. Which means the electricity sector poses a significant liability to the government. With most of Tanzania's population living in rural areas, there is a heavy dependency on rain-fed agriculture. 76% of Tanzanian's rely on agriculture or on access to natural resources for their livelihood. The reliance on agriculture leaves Tanzanian's especially susceptible to economic shocks due to climate change. Child poverty Slow economic growth is a contributory factor for child poverty in Tanzania.Unicef, \\"Childhood Poverty in Tanzania: Deprivations and Disparities in Child Well-Being\\", pp 3, 10 (Report : September 2009) (Retrieved : 21 June 2012) Based on 2012 estimates, more than a third of households \\"live below the basic needs poverty line\\" earning less than $1 a day, while 20% of the total population \\"live below the food poverty line\\". However, it is the rural communities of Mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar who are mostly affected. This disparity in wealth between urban and rural is a key factor for child poverty in the rural areas, with 48% lacking basic needs compared to 10% of their peers in the urban areas.  Leadership systems at the community-level  The leadership system in Tanzania starts from ten cells level, meaning that, at least in every ten households, there is one democratically elected leader. The hamlet, which is led by democratically elected chairperson, is composed of 100 households and the village which is led by democratically elected chairperson and employed village executive officer is composed of 3 to 4 hamlets with population ranging from 300 to 500 households. The term for all elected leaders lasts for five years. Accountability is the problem in all these leadership levels as it is also pinpointed by Tim Kelsall, Siri Lange, Simeon Mesaki and Max Mmuya (June, 2005). Good Leadership and governance as prerequisite for development Tanzania, like other poor countries such as Uganda, Burundi and Malawi, has corrupt systems. The service delivery survey suggests that \\"bribes paid to officials in the police, courts, tax services, and land offices amounted to 62 percent of official public expenditures in these areas\\". Anwar Shah and Mark Schacter (2004) further mentioned the key corruption drivers, that include: The legitimacy of the state as the guardian of the ‚Äúpublic interest‚Äù is contested ‚Äì whereby public office holders focus on serving particular client groups linked to them by ethnic, geographic, or other ties; The rule of law is weakly embedded - public sector corruption thrives where laws apply to some but not to others, and where enforcement of the law is often used as a device for furthering private interests rather than protecting the public interest; Institutions of accountability are ineffective - there are glaring weaknesses in institutions of accountability in highly corrupt countries; The commitment of national leaders to combating corruption is weak - widespread corruption endures in the public sector when national authorities are either unwilling or unable to address it forcefully.http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2004/12/pdf/shah.pdf  Political Commitment to Poverty Alleviation  Tanzania has aligned their goals to alleviate poverty with the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations. Implementation of these goals on the domestic level has been introduced into both long and medium term policies. The medium-term policies include the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction in Poverty (NSGRP) for mainland Tanzania and the Zanzibar Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (ZSGRP) for the island of Zanzibar. These policies focus poverty alleviation through building up national infrastructure, production capabilities, creating employment opportunities, increasing governmental accountability, and by improving upon quality of life metrics. Endowed resources About 90% of Tanzania's population dwells in impoverished rural areas. Resources such as arable land, seasonal rainfall, and people are common to all villages; apart from these, many other villages are endowed with resources, such as minerals, natural forests, rivers, lakes, ocean et cetera. As of 2007 65.7% of people live off of $1.25 or less a day.Poverty headcount ratio at $1.25 a day (PPP) (% of population)  Data  Table Stable peace in Tanzania Stable peace in the country could be an opportunity to utilize the endowed resources for sustainable development. Tanzania has been enjoying stable peace even before independence due to the fact that there are more than 150 ethnic tribes;Study Swahili - Learn Swahili in Tanzania Kiswahili as national language that was reinforced during Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere administration; and abolishment of chiefdoms in the country immediately after independence which existed in every tribe. Despite this precious opportunity of stable peace, the economic condition failed to improve as compared to Rwanda, Mozambique, and Angola which have passed through civil wars for many years, but their economies are picking up. Financial and technical support from international organizations Developed countries together with International Financial Institutions have spent billions of US dollars in capacitating the government systems to bring development for many decades, but instead of poverty being decreased, it is increasing. There have been many internationally funded programs aiming at improving national economy since the 1980s, such as National Economic Survival Program (NESP), Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), and Economic Recovery Program (ERP), Economic and Social Action Program (ESAP), Rolling Plan and Forward Budget(RPFB). To-date there is a 25 years Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP 2001 ‚Äì 2025) parallel with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs ‚Äì 2000 to 2015); now there is Kilimo Kwanza initiative. Despite the observed initiatives, the economy is still insufficient to provide the impetus for the poverty eradication. The mentality of donor-led project is widespread from national to village level ‚Äì there are several projects that could be accomplished by using locally available resources, for example potable water wells, small irrigation schemes, health structures, school building et cetera, but they have remained unimplemented awaiting for external donor assistance. The well known economic indicators such as GNP and GDP always show that the economy is growing, but in actual sense they do not show how wealth is distributed to the majority. The Tanzanian economy is recorded to improve every year, but more that 80% of its population mostly living in the rural areas are living below poverty line. During the early 1990s, International Financial Institutions (including International Monetary Fund advised Tanzania to do retrenchment and stop employment even in the key sectors, such as education, health and agriculture as a precondition for financial assistance; as a result the economy paralyzed, and now it has a long walk towards achieving socio-economic improvement. General elections Political crises in many developing countries, including Tanzania, occur immediately after general election. The worst examples of crises occurred in Kenya after the 2008 General Election and C√¥te d'Ivoire after the 2011 General Election. In Tanzania, after the 2010 General Election there aroused conflicts which, fortunately, did not turn into a crisis. The conflicts occurred between the ruling party and potential opposition parties, following the complaints from opposition and some activists that the Tanzania National Electoral Commission is allegedly favored the ruling political party. Serious conflicts were observed in Zanzibar (which is part of Tanzania), after 1995, 2000, and 2005 general elections in which Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) defeated Civic United Front (CUF). There is a tendency of politicians to spend billions of money (mostly for bribing poor people in exchange for votes) during general election period in order to either get or maintain their leadership positions; but on the other hand, little effort is made towards poverty alleviation initiatives in the communities.

Early life Leong was born on November 27, 1929, in San Francisco's Chinatown, an ethnic enclave of recent Chinese immigrants to the United States. Leong grew up in this area during pre- and post-World War II, where he battled constant prejudice as an Asian American. Leong suffered from a discriminatory attack as a child that left him partially blind in one eye.Asian American Art, A History, 1850‚Äì1970. Gordon H. Chang, Mark Dean Johnson, Paul J. Karlstrom, Sharon Spain. Stanford, California. Stanford University Press, 2008. pp. 275‚Äì376. Asian Americans who were not Japanese during World War II wore special badges to indicate and identify their ethnicity, because they did not want to be mistaken for being an enemy during a time when the United States was at war with Japan. Because of this, Leong wore a button that indicated his Chinese descent. Each badge cost $5 and Leong would often lose them. He stated, \\"I really felt there was a lot of misunderstanding on the part of the whites in San Francisco as to what being Chinese meant.\\" Leong's first encounter with art was when he was introduced by his father to a co-worker named Alan Cole.Poon, Irene. Leading the Way- Asian American Artists of the Older Generation. Gordon College, Wenham, MA, 2001. Distributed by University of Washington Press, Seattle and London, pp. 26‚Äì27. . Cole was a painter and photographer of the 1939 World's Fair. Leong studied oil painting under Cole for six years. Growing up, Leong and his family had differing opinions on his future career, as Leong desired to become an artist while his family preferred he begin a career in medicine. At age 23, Leong worked for the Chinese press. Business leaders from Chinatown commissioned Leong to create a mural of Chinese American history. This painting was named One Hundred Years: History of the Chinese in America and was commissioned to be placed in Ping Yuen, the first federally funded public housing in Chinatown. Leong was awarded a scholarship and received a master's degree in Fine Arts at California College of Arts and Crafts in 1952. He also went on to receive his Master of Arts in Arts Education at San Francisco State University in 1955. He was inspired by the work of artists like Walt Kuhn, Yasuo Kuniyoshi and Dong Kingman. During this time, Leong grew strong friendships with fellow artists like Nathan Oliveira and Clayton Pinkerton. He and other artists would spend their time in the famous bohemian hot spots of San Francisco, such as the Iron Pot Restaurant, Vesuvios Bar and City Lights Bookstore. Career In 1956, when Leong was 27, he traveled to Norway for two years on a Fulbright Scholarship. After this, he also received a Guggenheim Fellowship that took Leong to Rome where he stayed at the American Academy. There, he converted the fifteenth- century Palazzo Pio into a haven for artists. Here, Leong would sublet spaces to other artists including Cy Twombly and Warrington Colescott. Through his experience of 31 years in Rome, Leong found that the Italian people were far more accepting of his Chinese American identity than that of those in his home country. This acceptance sparked Leong's own exploration of his Chinese American roots in his artwork. Along with a trip to China with his wife and son, Leong was soon expressing this new rediscovery of identity in his paintings. Later years Leong's art is best characterized as abstract expressionism, with the subjects and interests of his paintings constantly changing over time. He shifted from painting the relationships of nature and humans to painting the historic relationships of East and West. After living for three decades in Italy, Leong settled in Pioneer Square in Seattle in 1994, finding the town to be the perfect blend of San Francisco and Europe. There, he served as arts commissioner and on advisory boards for several museums. In 1997, Leong was nominated for a National Medal for the Arts from the National Endowment of the Arts. Death Leong died from congestive heart failure on April 15, 2011 at the Swedish Medical Center. He was constantly creating and influencing art until his death.

The landslide buried the town of Sayi Hazara, trapping 71 people. After four days of digging, only five bodies were recovered and the search was called off. Overall, 75 people were killed and 13 others were injured. Earthquakes The first earthquake struck at 09:32 local time (05:02 UTC), registering a magnitude of 5.4 at depth. A second quake struck 25 minutes later, measuring 5.7 magnitude. The epicenter of both quakes was approximately southwest of Fayzabad. The quakes could be felt away in the capital of Kabul. Damage The quakes caused a large portion of a mountain in the Hindu Kush region to break off. An estimated, one hectare of land was covered in up to of debris by the landslide in the Burka District of Baghlan Province. The village of Sayi Hazara was hardest hit, buried under 30 to 100 meters of rock from the landslide. Rescue efforts According to Baghlan provincial governor Munshi Majeed, Sayi Hazara was completely destroyed by the landslide. He said there was little hope in finding any survivors in the 23 homes buried when a large portion of the nearby mountain broke free and inundated the village. Only one home survived. Rescue workers worked throughout 11 June and into the night, but heard no human noises. Baghlan Provincial Council member Haji Wakil told reporters, \\"The mountain was too big and strong... There is silence and silence alone.\\" Majeed added, \\"This is a human tragedy. An entire village was lost... Two bulldozers are now there to recover the dead bodies but the amount of stones and debris that has hit the village makes the chances of survivors very slim.\\" At the time of the earthquake, most adult males were away from the village working farmland, so the victims are mostly women and children. As of 13 June, only two bodies had been recovered. \\"We have to dig and find the 69 other bodies,\\" said provincial spokesperson Mahmood Haqmal. \\"It is not an easy task, but the government has promised that they... will stay until they find the last bodies.\\" On 14 June, the search was called off after only five bodies were recovered. The government said the area would be turned into a permanent memorial for the 66 people whose bodies were not found. Religious leaders recommended the area be renamed \\"Martyrs Hill\\" in honor of the dead. In total, more than 800 people helped with rescue efforts before the search was ended. In addition to Sayi Hazara, four other areas, across three districts, in Baghlan Province reported damage. In Nahrin district, three people were killed, while in Guzargahi Nur, one person lost his life. The United Nations and the Afghan Red Crescent Society have sent humanitarian aid to the area.

The Deepak-class tankers were the first warships constructed for India by Fincantieri. The construction of the ship began in November 2009 at Fincantieri's Sestri Ponente shipyard in Italy. The sea trials started in December 2010. The ship was formally handed over to the Indian Navy on 23 September 2011, in under two years. Admiral Nirmal Verma, the chief of the Naval Staff, commissioned the tanker at Visakhapatnam, the home of the Eastern Naval Command, saying that the ship enhanced the reach of the navy well beyond the limits of the Indian Ocean. INS Shakti is the third tanker of the same name of the navy. The first Shakti had a displacement of 3,000 tonnes and was commissioned during World War II. She was in service with the Indian Navy from 29 January 1954 and decommissioned on 31 December 1967; whilst the second Shakti, a large ship built by a German yard, was commissioned on 21 February 1976 and decommissioned on 21 July 2007, after more than 31 years of naval service.

It is a bildungsroman about three wild brothers of white and Puerto Rican parentage who live a rough and tumble childhood in rural upstate New York during the 1980s. The youngest brother, who is the protagonist, eventually breaks away from the rest of the family. The novel is semi-autobiographical and is loosely based on Torres's own life growing up in up-state New York. Plot The young, unnamed narrator, a boy, grows up in a tight-knit family with two older brothers, Manny and Joel. His parents, who were teenagers when the boys were conceived and they married, have an abusive unhappy marriage but still feel love for each other. In a series of vignettes, the narrator describes how his parents struggle to keep the family afloat and how his father, and eventually his brothers, are abusive towards his mother who is deeply unhappy and longs for a better life. As the narrator grows up, he senses a difference between himself and his brothers, which is partially caused by his love of literature and partially caused by the fact that he is gay. After his parents discover his journal, which is filled with erotic imaginings and fantasies, the narrator lashes out, violently attacking his parents and sibling, after which he is interred at a psychiatric ward. Reception We the Animals received generally positive reviews, including warm notices from The New York Times and Kirkus Reviews and praise from such novelists and writers as Michael Cunningham, Dorothy Allison and Paul Harding. It was nominated for a Publishing Triangle Award, an NAACP Image Award, and it won an Indies Choice Book Award. Film adaptation A film adaptation of We the Animals, directed by Jeremiah Zagar, premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival.

These colors have a low lightness. From photometric point of view, a color which differs slightly from black always has low relative luminance. Variations of black include what are commonly termed off-black colors, which may be considered part of a neutral color scheme, usually in interior design as a part of a background for brighter colors. Black and dark gray colors are powerful accent colors that suggest weight, dignity, formality, and solemnity.Pile, John F. Interior Design Upper Saddle River, New Jersey:2007 Prentice-Hall Page 316 In color theory, a shade is a pure color mixed with black. It decreases its lightness while nearly conserving its chromaticity. Strictly speaking, a \\"shade of black\\" is always a pure black itself and a \\"tint of black\\" would be a neutral gray. Unlike these, many off-black colors possess a hue and a colorfulness (also called saturation). Colors often considered \\"shades of black\\" include onyx, black olive, charcoal, and jet; these colors and other variations of black are shown below. Black Black is a color, the perception of which is evoked by the total absence of light that stimulates any of the three types of color sensitive cone cells in the human eye and with very low brightness compared to the surroundings. A black visual stimulation will be void of hue and grayness. Black is the darkest possible color.  Technical black varieties  A black body is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation (regardless of frequency or angle of incidence). To the human eye, it seems black. Some recent surface treatments to simulate a black body are: * Carbon black * Super black * Roseman Black * Vantablack * Coal black * Red Black Variations of black (off-black colors) The colors are arranged in order of value (brightness) (v code in the hsv code), the lightest colors at the top and the darkest at the bottom. Dim gray The web color dim gray is a dark tone of gray. The color name dim gray first came into use in 1987, when this color was formulated as one of the colors on the X11 color list, introduced that year.

The color Charleston green originated after the American Civil War, when the North provided black paint to the South for use in its reconstruction. Charlestonians, i.e., the inhabitants of Charleston, South Carolina, mixed the black with a little bit of yellow and blue and created Charleston green. Since this color has a hue code of 180, it is actually an extremely dark shade of cyan.

Republican nominee Warren G. Harding, future President of the United States, defeated Democratic nominee Timothy S. Hogan to succeed retiring incumbent Republican Senator Theodore E. Burton. Candidates=Democratic *Timothy S. Hogan, Ohio Attorney General Republican *Warren G. Harding, former State Senator and Lieutenant Governor of Ohio *Joseph B. Foraker, former Governor of Ohio and U.S. Senator *Ralph D. Cole, former U.S. Representative Campaign Initially, Harding was not interested in running for U.S. Senate, due to the divisive remnants of the 1912 elections between the conservative and progressive factions of the Republican party. Harry Daugherty, an Ohio political boss, was interested in running for the seat himself upon learning of incumbent Senator Theodore Burton's plans to retire upon the expiration of his term, but party leaders advised him not to run. Instead, Daugherty unsuccessfully attempted to stage a draft movement to convince Harding to run for the seat. After the death of Amos Kling, the father of Harding's wife Florence, she encouraged her husband to run. The precise reasoning for this is unknown, but some in Marion, the Hardings' home town, believe that Harding had agreed not to seek higher office as part of a reuniting \\"truce\\" between Florence and her father, or that Kling had convinced Harding that it would behoove him to further his business rather than run for public office. Although Daugherty claimed it was him who had convinced Harding to run for the Senate, Harding's friend and attorney Hoke Donithen, who eventually became Harding's campaign manager, may have played a role in his decision to run. Retiring Senator Theodore Burton also claimed credit, saying to his biographer that Daugherty did not agree to throw his support behind Harding until after learning he had backed him. The Republican primary was a three-way contest between Harding, former U.S. Senator and ex-mentor Joseph B. Foraker and Ralph Cole. Rather than antagonizing his opponents, Harding notably tried to keep and make friends within the Republican party, to the frustration of those running against him. Ralph Cole, in his frustration, said, \\"If he is not going to fight someone, why did he enter the contest?\\" Harding eventually defeated both of his opponents in the primary, garnering 88,540 votes. Foraker finished in second with 76,817 votes, ahead of Cole with 52,237. In the general election campaign, Harding faced Democratic nominee Timothy Hogan and Progressive candidate Arthur Garford. Hogan was subject to anti-Catholic sentiment among voters, which Harding himself did not exhibit during the course of the election. Harding's supporters accused Hogan of wanting to \\"deliver Ohio to the Pope.\\" Harding downplayed the issue of World War I, despite the fact that the election took place just after the outbreak of the war, due to the high German immigrant population. Harding ultimately won the election and subsequently became the first United States Senator from Ohio to be popularly elected, following the passage of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. Harding's victory in his bid for the Senate seat raised speculation that he would seek higher office, specifically the Presidency, although Harding himself did not show any interest in doing so at the time. He told family and friends after being elected to the Senate that he would return to his previous career in newspaper publishing at The Marion Daily Star after serving in the Senate.

The larvae of this genus are notable for being obligate role reversal predators. Amphibians such as frogs are normally predators of beetles, however Epomis larvae feed exclusively on amphibians. Description Epomis beetles are often metallic blue or green colored, with a striking yellow-orange rim on the elytra and mostly yellow-colored legs and antennae. They are in length.Basilewsky, P. (1955). R√©vision des ep√®ces africaines du genre Epomis (Carabidae). Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London 107: 95-116. They can be distinguished from the closely related genus Chlaenius by the short (less than three times as long as wide) and triangular labial palps.Trautner J√ºrgen, & Geigenm√ºller Katrin (1987). Tiger beetles, ground beetles. Illustrated key to the Cicindelidae and Carabidae of Europe. TRIOPS Verlag. The larvae reach a body length of up to , they are white or yellow colored, with black and orange markings. Like many ground beetle larvae they are elongated with two extensions (Urogomphi) at the rear end. They have characteristic double-hooked mandibles. Larvae of the two European species can be distinguished by their color pattern. Feeding behavior Epomis larvae hunt in a rare reversal of the usual predator-prey relationship between amphibians and insects. They lure their amphibian predators by making prey-like movements, then evade the predator's attack and disable the predator, often with a bite to the throat or underside. After the attack, the larva stays attached to the amphibian while feeding on it, similarly to external parasites.Shiina, M., and Tachikawa, S. (1988). The life history of Epomis nigricans and its larval stage feeding on toads. Abstracts of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Entomological Society of Japan, p. 35. Nishibaru, Okinawa.Tachikawa, S. (1994). Predation on anurans by Epomis nigricans larvae. Amazing Life of Insects, Atlas of the 48th Special Exhibition, Otaru Museum, Otaru. Adult Epomis beetles are generalist predators but can also feed on amphibians.Toshiaki, H. (2006). Predation by a carabid beetle (Epomis nigricans) on a juvenile frog (Rana nigromaculata). Bulletin of the Herpetological Society of Japan 2: 99-100. They sneak up behind their victims, and hold on firmly using their legs. To paralyze the victim, the beetle makes an incision in the pelvic region with its mandibles. There is speculation that the incision cuts leg muscles.https://www.wired.com/2016/01/absurd-creature-of-the-week-this-toad- isnt-eating-a-bug-the-bug-is-eating-it/ The amphibian loses its ability to move and is eaten by the beetle. Scientists speculate that Epomis evolved this behavior as an aggressive evasion tactic in response to predation by amphibians and the success of this tactic led to Epomis becoming an obligate predator itself. Epomis circumscriptus larva displaying luring movements of antennae and mouthparts A juvenile toad is attracted and lured to an ambushing Epomis dejeani larva Taxonomic status The genus Epomis belongs to tribe Chlaeniini in the subfamily Licininae, which consists of species associated with swamps, temporary ponds and similar types of wetland habitats. It contains about 30 species distributed in the old world only, with the majority of species occurring in the Afrotropical region.L√∂bl Ivan, & Ale≈° Smetana (2010). Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera, Vol.1: Archostemata, Myxophaga, Adephaga. Apollo Books, Stenstrup: 347-356. Many taxonomists consider Epomis as a subgenus of Chlaenius, however differences in larval and adult morphology, as well as the unique life history of Epomis beetles, support their separate standing as a genus.Pietro Brandmayr, Teresa Bonacci, Tullia Zetto Brandmayr (2010): Larval morphology of epomis circumscriptus (Duftschmid 1812) and of first instar E. dejeani, Dejean, 1831 (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Chlaeniini), with morphofunctional remarks.

He credits The Secret Garden, Scott Gustafson‚Äôs illustrations for Peter Pan, and playing with Barbie dolls as childhood, creative influences. He attended Lexington High School where he received a gold key prize from the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers for a self-portrait drawing and awards for high academic achievement. He completed his BFA in Illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design and interned for Diane von F√ºrstenberg and Walt Disney Imagineering. Selected works The Golden Book Gown 2008-2012: RISD In 2008 Novelline was commissioned, among other RISD students and faculty, by GAP creative director Patrick Robinson to create one-of-a-kind cardigans that would be sold out of GAP's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. In 2011 Novelline created designs that were shown at Harvard University's fashion show, Eleganza. One of his dresses, an aquamarine and topaz Swarovski crystal-embellished gown, was made from repurposed hotel curtains and modeled by Sonia Dara. =The Golden Book Gown= During an elective college course in RISD's fashion department in 2010, Novelline created a garment from recycled materials. He acquired hundreds of recycled and discarded Little Golden Books from the Salvation Army and eBay in order to construct a dress entirely of the illustrations from the books sewn together with metallic gold thread, and a bodice was made from the books' foil spines. Tommy Hilfiger called the piece ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. The work of contemporary art, titled The Golden Book Gown, received widespread attention for its design and innovative use of material. According to Italian Glamour, the piece ‚Äúlascia tutti a bocca aperta‚Äù or ‚Äúleft everyone in awe.‚Äù Publishers Weekly said that the dress ‚Äúproves that green fashion can provide as rich a fantasia as can be imagined.‚Äù The gown was voted the ‚Äúmost creative‚Äù fashion design of 2011 by Ecouterre. 2013-present Comic-Con = In 2014, Novelline made a dress from the pages of recycled graphic novels for Maisie Williams that she wore as a guest judge for Bookbarn International's Out of Print Fashion Show. She wore the dress a second time at the Entertainment Weekly party at San Diego Comic Con. The dress, called ZAM!, included pages from X-Men, Sandman, Sailor Moon, and Game of Thrones. According to The Huffington Post, the paper dress was \\"the coolest thing at Comic Con\\" and later named among Williams‚Äô ‚ÄúBest Looks‚Äù by Vogue. Novelline created a gown called Beyond Blue based on the fairy-tale Undine, and showed it as cosplay during New York Comic-Con in 2017. The hemp-silk gown weighed over 50 pounds, had a 13-foot cathedral train, and featured over 20,000 hand-placed, Swarovski crystals. The fabric print featured a round composition of mermaids taken from one of the artist's original paintings. The blue gown was listed among the years ‚ÄúBest Cosplay‚Äù and compared to Elsa‚Äôs design from Frozen. In 2019, he returned to New York Comic-Con with a gown based on the story of Sleeping Beauty called The Good Fairy. According to him, the look ‚Äúcelebrate[d] not just the final character, but the process of creating one.‚Äú The design was also listed among the year‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Cosplay‚Äù. = Other Projects = Novelline collaborated on the children's book Piccadilly and the Fairy Polka contributing as the art director and illustrator of the book casing and dust jacket. In 2015, he created a series of illustrations of Tyler Oakley as Disney Princesses that were featured on Oakley's Tumblr. Influenced by a long- standing interest in fashion dolls, he has made paper dolls and art dolls wearing his own designs. In recognition of the Supreme Court's decision to recognize marriage equality in all 50 states, he created a commemorative art doll from an upcycled Barbie. The doll wore a rainbow gown and carried an American pride flag in one hand and a marriage license dated June 26, 2015 in the other.  Exhibitions  Novelline‚Äôs Golden Book Gown was displayed at the Scottish Rite Masonic Museum & Library and was the centerpiece of an exhibit at the Drift Contemporary Art Gallery in 2013. At this show, he asked visitors to consider whether or not \\"the stories of our past become part of a sustainable future.‚Äù Novelline was a guest speaker at Asian Geographic‚Äôs 2018 Asia Dive Expos (ADEX) in Singapore in April and again in Beijing in October.

She was the first operational French naval steamer. She took part in the Invasion of Algiers in 1830, pioneering the role of steamers in navies of the mid-19th century, and later took part in the transfer of the Luxor Obelisk from Egypt to Paris.  Career  Sphinx was built in Rochefort on plans by Jean-Baptiste Hubert around a low-pressure Newcomen steam engine purchased from Fawcett, in Liverpool. Indret then used this engine as its template for the locally produced engines that powered the subsequent Sphinx-class avisos.Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s√©ances de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, Volume 6 On 25 May 1830, Sphinx sailed with a French squadron under Admiral Guy-Victor Duperr√© for the Invasion of Algiers. On 13 June, along with Nageur, she silenced the coastal defences of Sidi Fredj. She then carried the news of the fall of Algiers back to France.1829\\\\. Vapeur le Sphinx (France) Sphinx towing the barge Louqsor ferrying the Louqsor Obelisk to France In August 1832, under Lieutenant Sarlat, Sphinx sailed to Alexandria to rendezvous there with the barge Louqsor, which was to load the Luxor Obelisk and bring it to Paris. After the complex loading of the obelisk, the ships departed on 1 April 1833. Spinx steamed at 4.5 knots with Louqsor in tow and reached Toulon on 10 May, where she had to spend 20 days in quarantine due to the fear of cholera.Philippe B√©jot, \\"Le transport de l'ob√©lisque de Louxor\\", Neptunia no 263, p. 45 The ships arrived at Cherbourg on 12 August 1833. From 1835, Sphinx cruised off Toulon and Algiers, under Lieutenant Baudin. In 1841, she was in the Mediterranean under Lieutenant Lacheuri√©,Roche, op. cit. and in 1843 under Lieutenant Guichon de Grandpont.ANNALES COLONIALES - 1843 On 6 July 1845, while under the command of Lieutenant Muterse, Sphinx departed Dellys, bound for Algiers. Due to a navigation error, during a heavy fog she ran aground near Cape Matifu. The steamers Cam√©l√©on, Chim√®re, and Tartare attempted unsuccessfully to aid her.

Over perfect fields these are the same as (connected) reductive groups, but over non-perfect fields Jacques Tits found some examples of pseudo-reductive groups that are not reductive. A pseudo-reductive k-group need not be reductive (since the formation of the k-unipotent radical does not generally commute with non-separable scalar extension on k, such as scalar extension to an algebraic closure of k). Pseudo-reductive groups arise naturally in the study of algebraic groups over function fields of positive- dimensional varieties in positive characteristic (even over a perfect field of constants). gives an exposition of Tits' results on pseudo-reductive groups, while builds on Tits' work to develop a general structure theory, including more advanced topics such as construction techniques, root systems and root groups and open cells, classification theorems, and applications to rational conjugacy theorems for smooth connected affine groups over arbitrary fields. The general theory (with applications) as of 2010 is summarized in , and later work in the second edition and in provides further refinements. Examples of pseudo reductive groups that are not reductive Suppose that k is a non- perfect field of characteristic 2, and a is an element of k that is not a square. Let G be the group of nonzero elements x + y in k[]. There is a morphism from G to the multiplicative group Gm taking x + y to its norm x2 ‚Äì ay2, and the kernel is the subgroup of elements of norm 1. The underlying reduced scheme of the geometric kernel is isomorphic to the additive group Ga and is the unipotent radical of the geometric fiber of G, but this reduced subgroup scheme of the geometric fiber is not defined over k (i.e., it does not arise from a closed subscheme of G over the ground field k) and the k-unipotent radical of G is trivial. So G is a pseudo-reductive k-group but is not a reductive k-group. A similar construction works using a primitive nontrivial purely inseparable finite extension of any imperfect field in any positive characteristic, the only difference being that the formula for the norm map is a bit more complicated than in the preceding quadratic examples. More generally, if K is a non-trivial purely inseparable finite extension of k and G is any non-trivial connected reductive K-group defined then the Weil restriction H=RK/k(G) is a smooth connected affine k-group for which there is a (surjective) homomorphism from HK onto G. The kernel of this K-homomorphism descends the unipotent radical of the geometric fiber of H and is not defined over k (i.e., does not arise from a closed subgroup scheme of H), so RK/k(G) is pseudo-reductive but not reductive. The previous example is the special case using the multiplicative group and the extension K=k[]. Classification and exotic phenomena Over fields of characteristic greater than 3, all pseudo-reductive groups can be obtained from reductive groups by the \\"standard construction\\", a generalization of the construction above. The standard construction involves an auxiliary choice of a commutative pseudo-reductive group, which turns out to be a Cartan subgroup of the output of the construction, and the main complication for a general pseudo-reductive group is that the structure of Cartan subgroups (which are always commutative and pseudo-reductive) is mysterious. The commutative pseudo-reductive groups admit no useful classification (in contrast with the connected reductive case, for which they are tori and hence are accessible via Galois lattices), but modulo this one has a useful description of the situation away from characteristics 2 and 3 in terms of reductive groups over some finite (possibly inseparable) extensions of the ground field. Over imperfect fields of characteristics 2 and 3 there are some extra pseudo-reductive groups (called exotic) coming from the existence of exceptional isogenies between groups of types B and C in characteristic 2, between groups of type F‚ÇÑ in characteristic 2, and between groups of type G‚ÇÇ in characteristic 3, using a construction analogous to that of the Ree groups. Moreover, in characteristic 2 there are additional possibilities arising not from exceptional isogenies but rather from the fact that for simply connected type C (I.e., symplectic groups) there are roots that are divisible (by 2) in the weight lattice; this gives rise to examples whose root system (over a separable closure of the ground field) is non- reduced; such examples exist with a split maximal torus and an irreducible non-reduced root system of any positive rank over every imperfect field of characteristic 2. The classification in characteristic 3 is as complete as in larger characteristics, but in characteristic 2 the classification is most complete when [k:k^2]=2 (due to complications caused by the examples with a non-reduced root system, as well as phenomena related to certain regular degenerate quadratic forms that can only exist when [k:k^2]>2). Subsequent work of , building on additional material included in the second edition , completes the classification in characteristic 2 up to a controlled central extension by providing an exhaustive array of additional constructions that only exist when [k:k^2]>2 , ultimately resting on a notion of special orthogonal group attached to regular but degenerate and not fully defective quadratic spaces in characteristic 2.

The park was developed by the Wilmington City Railway Company after extending the trolley lines to Shellpot Creek near the outskirts of the city. In its early years, Shellpot Park (and the adjacent Malin's Grove) was little more than a wooded lake and a place to picnic. At the peak of its popularity, the park also featured a miniature railroad, carousel, and roller coaster. The carousel, built in 1916 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, twenty-eight jumping horses, eighteen stationary horses, two chariots, and two Wurlitzer band organs. The roller coaster, also designed by PTC, was added in 1925 and featured a 65-foot vertical drop. (The tallest coaster of its era, at 100 feet, Cyclone, was built the same year at Revere Beach.) As interest in the park waned after the 1920s, the park added an open- air arena for boxing events. In 1932, the carousel was sold to Dorney Park; it was subsequently destroyed in a 1983 fire at that park. In 1934, a fire along the railway destroyed most of the remaining attractions, and Shellpot Park closed. The former dance pavilion, converted into a roller rink, was eventually torn down in 1936.

Tirado Yepes (born April 3, 1964, Caracas, Venezuela), is a Venezuelan artist, painter and sculptor who has developed a very personal and precise work line linked to Neo-pop art. With plenty of personal art exhibitions, Tirado Yepes has participated in numerous collective exhibitions, receiving different awards like III Premio de Escultura del Certamen Aires de C√≥rdoba in 2004Certamen II - Relaci√≥n de Artistas y Obras Premiadas and other recognitions, among them, in the Venezuelan Embassy in DC (2005), and the X Latin Art Festival of Atlanta (2005).  Biography  Tirado Yepes grew up in an upper-middle-class family environment and could feel the inclination towards the arts from an early age. At 8, he was already experimenting with tridimensional forms, creating molds out of cast lead from pieces previously gathered on the streets. These first artistic experiences, led by his inquisitive nature, provided the ground to continue exploring the possibilities with different materials like wood waste and plaster. His childhood games were centered on painting and sculpting, which played a feature role that ranged from recreational to their esthetic aspects. At 12, his parents finally agreed to register him in private art classes with professor Javier Hernandez in Caracas. During his adolescence, he understood that Art was a profession that required investment in materials, reason that led him to work at a furniture store where he would create and paint landscapes and figurative art to decorate the areas. He created numerous paintings of Caracas‚Äô famous mountain: El Avila, and other art pieces that provided financial stability. This type of activity lead him to deepen his figurative expression. In 1985, he started drawing comic sets for a renowned newspaper: El Diario de Caracas, alongside Jorge Blanco. It is the time when ‚ÄúAlfredo‚Äù was born; a cartoon character that has been part of Tirado Yepes all his life. Alfredo has also been featured in other newspapers like El Venezolano (in Miami, Florida). His presence in El Diario de Caracas was the beginning of a series of other comic characters later leveraged by private companies to be used as images for personnel improvement and corporate safety programs.\\"Carlos Tirado, rumbo a Shangai\\" After finishing High School, he decided to study Art. However, that was not his parents‚Äô plan, therefore agreed to study Law at the Universidad Santa Maria in Caracas during evenings while attending Art School at the Escuela Cristobal Rojas during mornings. He graduated from Law School in 1991. The courses taken at the Escuela Cristobal Rojas offered many opportunities since he was a pupil of Jorge Stever, Patricia Rizzo, Graciela Simmonato, among others. These were well-established and renowned artists who specialized in hyperrealism, abstract art or other conceptual propositions. Tirado Yepes continued working on decoration while he began to participate in art exhibitions, being recognized as the ‚ÄúEl Avila‚Äù artist. In 2003, he was invited to participate in the collective art exhibition honoring El Avila at the Venezuelan Consulate in Miami, Florida. He decided to take a leap from local market decorative work to something riskier. His goal was to produce art pieces with the needed stature to be internationally recognized. Working with Jorge Stever, Tirado Yepes was introduced to contemporary sculpture using non-traditional materials. He learned to create tridimensional pieces mixing sand and resins. However, he found himself making similar pieces just like his mentor. This is when a decision was made to break that line of work and look for his own language. He moved to South Florida and started working with available materials, which in some cases were very restrictive and different from the ones used in Venezuela: the river sand found in his country was substituted in his art work for a fine, white sand from ground coral, which resulted in a totally different product from the art pieces created in his native country. From this point on, a new series of Black and White artwork is born. With the use of coral sand mixed with black resin over different objects, Tirado Yepes recreate the objects and people found in the ruins of Pompeii, covered in ashes and lava, soaked by time. These pieces have a calcified look with an intense black hue that resembles raw petroleum. This art evokes the look of a city that could be covered in ashes from a Volcano, and at the same time, it is a metaphor for Caracas and its oil-covered society. Tirado Yepes agrees that he feels an attraction towards Pop Art. One of his major impulses has been to humanize those mass reaching characters like comic characters, with common problems as any human living in an everyday environment. Nevertheless, his major contribution has been his personal language representing these themes, which indeed resembles Pop Art, but has a twist that Tirado Yepes has achieved after years of investigation and research. In searching for his own expression, he decided to recycle an already existing man-made material, changing its original purpose. He opts to use an approximate 600-pantone-color chart from exterior paints at home improvement stores. The strategic combination of these samples based on the principles of collage: cutting and pasting produce a marvelous pixel-like image of outstanding beauty and allure. In the digital realm, a pixel is the smallest chromatic unit of an image. In Tirado Yepes artistic expression this concept is inverted creating an interesting game as a result of his investigation. He manually cuts one-color pieces, positions and pastes them over the canvas, looking to create a desired image. In some instances he applies small touches of color over the canvases. This technique, also known as ‚Äúanti-pixel‚Äù by some art critique, simulates the pixelated look of an over-zoomed digital picture; however, when viewed in detail, is clear that the process as very different in Tirado Yepes work, as he begins breaking the digital logic: instead of taking the image to its minimum chromatic expression, he builds off that minimum expression. In fact, they are not realistically minimal since the materials (paint samples) used by the artist measure approximately 10 x 10 cm. Using this technique, Tirado Yepes has created portraits of internationally recognized characters (presidents, renowned politicians, and artists) and pop culture icons (Marilyn Monroe, Monalisa, and cartoon characters, among others). He has participated in numerous collective art exhibitions, like Nobe 67 Art (Miami, 2008),Nobe 67 Art Art Shangai 2010Artistas latinoamericanos exponen con √©xito sus obras en la Feria del Arte de Shanghai and 2011, Florencia's Biennal (2011), M√©rida- Mexico Biennal,Effetto Biennale among others.

Many of these criticisms are blunted by the massive redesign of the site in 2012, occurring after the majority of original users had abandoned the website. Accessibility and reliability Because most Myspace pages are designed by individuals with little HTML experience, a very large proportion of pages do not satisfy the criteria for valid HTML or CSS laid down by the W3C. Poorly formatted code can cause accessibility problems for those using software such as screen readers. The Myspace home page, as of May 20, 2009, failed HTML validation with around 101 errors (the number changes on sequential validations of the home page due to dynamic content), using the W3C's validator. Furthermore, Myspace is set up so that anyone can customize the layout and colors of their profile page with virtually no restrictions, provided that the advertisements are not covered up by CSS or using other means. As Myspace users are usually not skilled web developers, this can cause further problems. Poorly constructed Myspace profiles could potentially freeze up web browsers due to malformed CSS coding, or as a result of users placing many high bandwidth objects such as videos, graphics, and Flash in their profiles (sometimes multiple videos and sound files are automatically played at the same time when a profile loads). While Myspace blocks potentially harmful code (such as JavaScript) from profiles, users have occasionally found ways to insert such code. PC World cited this as its main reason for naming Myspace as #1 in its list of twenty-five worst web sites ever. Security In October 2005, a flaw in MySpace's site design was exploited by \\"Samy\\" to create the first self-propagating cross-site scripting (XSS) worm. MSNBC has reported that \\"social-networking sites like Myspace are turning out to be hotbeds for spyware,\\" and \\"infection rates are on the rise, in part thanks to the surging popularity of social-networking sites like MySpace.com.\\" In addition to this, the customization of user pages currently allows the injection of certain HTML which can be crafted to form a phishing user profile, thus keeping the Myspace.com domain as the address. More recently, there has been spam on bulletins that has been the result of phishing. Users find their Myspace homepage with bulletins they did not post, realizing later they had been phished. The bulletin consists of an advertisement that provides a link to a fake login screen, tricking people into typing in their Myspace e-mail and password. Other security fears regarding profile content itself are also present. For example, the embedding of videos inherently allows all of the format's abilities and functions to be used on a page. A prime example of this surfaced in December 2006, when embedded QuickTime videos were shown to contain hyperlinks to JavaScript files, which would be run simply by a user visiting a 'phished' profile page, or even in some cases by simply viewing a user's 'about me' elsewhere on the site. Users who entered their login information into a fake login bar that appeared would also become 'phished', and their account would be used to spam other members, thus spreading this security problem. Myspace's anti-phishing and anti-spam measures have also come under fire. In 2007 Myspace made changes such that external links on profiles would be redirected through the http://msplinks.com domain. For example, http://en.wikipedia.org would be changed to http://www.msplinks.com/MDFodHRwOi8vZW4ud2lraXBlZGlhLm9yZwhttp (The new links are determined by Base64 encoding, as there are ways of decoding the link back into its original URL.) Myspace staffers would be able to disable potentially dangerous links. (The changed links only work if the HTTP referrer is a Myspace page; otherwise, the link will appear to be disabled.) This move has been criticized that it makes profile editing inconvenient and that it does nothing to deter spammers. In February 2008 Myspace changed the system such that users who click such links (except for whitelisted domains like Wikipedia and YouTube) will receive a warning that they will be leaving the domain. As of March 2008, this \\"feature\\" has been extended to blogs as well, although previous blog entries are unaffected unless the user updates them. On January 26, 2008, over 567,000 private Myspace user pictures were downloaded from the site by using a bug published on YouTube and put on the Piratebay torrent site for download. In 2010, the company was criticized, along with other social networks, for passing user personally identifiable profile information to advertisers when members clicked on ads. Privacy settings MySpace has agreed to regular privacy check-ups for the next 20 years due to the fact it \\"misrepresented\\" the protection of those using the site and their personal information. The Federal Trade Commission wants to ensure sites truly protect their users and live up to stated standards. MySpace originally promised to not share users \\"identifiable information, or use such information in a way that was inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted, without first giving notice to users and receiving their permission.\\"Federal Trade Commission, \\"MySpace Settles FTC Charges That It Misled Millions of Users About Sharing Personal Information with Advertisers\\" ,\\"Federal Trade Commission\\", May 8, 2012 Despite these promises, MySpace gave advertisers personal information from current users, including: age, gender, profile picture, and username. Consequently, advertisers were able to locate a user's MySpace profile from the Friend ID to gain access to personal information from one's profile, such as the user's full name. This became increasingly dangerous for users and their safety because it leaked private information to the public. MySpace, in 2010, provided users the option of controlling their individual privacy settings on their profile. In hope of regaining users from Facebook, MySpace is now simplifying their privacy settings. \\"The change is part of MySpace's new public commitment to privacy.\\"Van Grove, Jennifer , \\"MySpace Positions Itself as Facebook Alternative with New Privacy Settings\\", May 17, 2010 The new privacy settings will allow users to restrict who sees their profile by limiting the accessibility to friends only, or people 18 or older. \\"Some people may have a private gathering in someone's home - that doesn't mean they're inviting everyone who happens to be friends of friends who are invited,\\" said, Jeremy Mishkin, a partner and Internet privacy expert at the law firm Montgomery McCracken in Philadelphia.Price, Brian, , \\"MySpace Issues Facebook Privacy Challenge, but Will It Win Users?\\", May 18, 2010 Third-party sites gaining access to user's personal private information has been a recurring theme amongst these social networks. Providing a safe social network with proper privacy settings, while also allowing users to be as social as they want, is the ideal system for all social media users. Myspace party problems Myspace is often used as a venue for publicizing parties, sometimes with the host's knowledge and sometimes without. There have been some well-publicized incidents where Myspace parties have caused thousands of dollars damage to property, and even (in at least one case) loss of life. * A party hosted by Corey Worthington, a sixteen-year-old boy from Narre Warren in Melbourne, Australia, and advertised on MySpace, attracted 500 people. Police cars were attacked, and the dog squad and a helicopter were called in. The incident received international coverage. (Worthington subsequently found work as a party promoter, and appeared on the Ten Network's Australian version of Big Brother.) The Sydney Morning Herald's online technology writer, Asher Moses, has noted that MySpace/Facebook parties are particularly prone to gatecrashing because news of events can spread to uninvited guests via \\"newsfeeds.\\" He suspects some party hosts are oblivious to the actual number of people who get the message. * In April 2007, a seventeen-year-old British girl hosted a party after distributing information about it on Myspace that was reportedly subtitled \\"Let's trash the average family-sized house disco party.\\" Her parents were left with an approximately ¬£24,000 ($48,000) bill from police. * Allen Joplin, a seventeen-year-old American high school student from Seattle, was shot dead at a party that had been publicized through Myspace. Child safety The minimum age to register an account on Myspace is 13, but it was 14 at one time and some still think of it as being 14. Profiles with ages set from 13 to 15 years are automatically private. Users whose ages are set at 16 or over have the option to set their profile to public viewing. Accessing the full profile of, or messaging someone when their account is set to \\"private\\" (or if under sixteen) is restricted to a Myspace user's direct friends. Myspace will delete fake profiles if the victim verifies his or her identity and points out the profile via e-mail. In July 2007, the company found and deleted 29,000 profiles belonging to registered sex offenders. Myspace has been the focus of a number of news reports stating that teenagers have found ways around the restrictions set by Myspace. Stricter methods for enforcing age admission will be enforced in the future, such as blocking a person from accessing Myspace using a computer's IP address. In response, Myspace has given assurances to parents that the website is safe for people of all ages. Beginning in late June 2006, Myspace users whose ages are set over 18 could no longer be able to add users whose ages are set from 13 to 15 years as friends unless they already know the user's full name or email address. Some third party Internet safety companies such as Social Shield have launched online communities for parents concerned about their child's safety on Myspace. In June 2006, sixteen-year-old American Katherine Lester flew to the Middle East, to Tel Aviv, Israel, after having tricked her parents into getting her a passport in order to be with a twenty-year-old man she met through Myspace.'MySpace' Teen Returns From Middle East Foxnews.com U.S. officials in Jordan persuaded the teen to turn around and go home. In October 2006, thirteen-year-old Megan Meier committed suicide after being the victim of cyber-bullying instigated by the mother of a friend who had posed as a sixteen-year-old named \\"Josh Evans\\".Steve Pokin (November 11, 2007). 'My Space' hoax ends with suicide of Dardenne Prairie teen Suburban Journals. Accessed May 18, 2008. In December 2006, Myspace announced new measures to protect children from known sex offenders. Although precise details were not given they said that \\"tools\\" would be implemented to prevent known sex offenders from the USA creating a Myspace profile. In February 2007, a U.S. District Judge in Texas dismissed a case when a family sued MySpace for negligence, fraud, and misrepresentation; a girl in the family had been sexually assaulted by a man she met through MySpace, after she had misrepresented her age as 18 when she was 13. Regarding his dismissal of the case, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks wrote: \\"If anyone had a duty to protect young girls, it was her parents, not MySpace.\\" In October 2007, a study published in the Journal of Adolescence conducted by Sameer Hinduja (Florida Atlantic University) and Justin W. Patchin (University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire) concluded that most adolescents use Myspace responsibly: \\"When considered in its proper context, these results indicate that the problem of personal information disclosure on Myspace may not be as widespread as many assume, and that the overwhelming majority of adolescents are responsibly using the website,\\" they say. Social and cultural Dave Itzkoff, in the June 2006 Playboy magazine issue, related his experiences of experimentation with membership in Myspace. Among his other criticisms, one pertains to the distance afforded by the Internet that emboldens members, such as females who feature photos of themselves in scant clothing on their profile pages or behave in ways they would not in person, and he indicated that this duplicity undercuts the central design of MySpace, namely, to bring people together. Itzkoff also referenced the addictive, time-consuming nature of the site, mentioning that the Playboy Playmate and Myspace member Julie McCullough, who was the first to respond to his add-friend request, pointedly referred to the site as \\"cybercrack\\". Itzkoff argued that Myspace gives many people access to a member's life, without giving the time needed to maintain such relationships and that such relationships do not possess the depth of in-person relationships. Furthermore, in terms of MySpace's potential for underhanded commercial exploitation, Itzkoff is particularly critical of the disturbing and fraudulent behavior of people who can contact a member, unsolicited, as when he was contacted by someone expressing a desire to socialize and date, but whose blog (to which Itzkoff was directed via subsequent emails) was found to be a solicitation for a series of commercial porn sites. Itzkoff is similarly critical of the more subtle commercial solicitations on the site, such as the banner ads and links to profiles and video clips that turn out to be, for example, commercials for new 20th Century Fox films. He also observed that MySpace's much-celebrated music section is heavily weighted in favor of record labels rather than breakthrough musicians. In relating criticism from another person, whom Itzkoff called \\"Judas,\\" he illustrated that, while the goal of attempting to bring together people who might not otherwise associate with one another in real life may seem honorable, Myspace inherently violates a social contract only present when people interact face-to-face, rendering, in his opinion, the website nothing more than a passing fad: Controversy over corporate history After the sale of Myspace to News Corp, Brad Greenspan (the former CEO, founder, and shareholder of Intermix Media the parent company that owned and launched MySpace.com) contested the sale of the company to News Corp. Greenspan claimed that new Intermix Media CEO Richard Rosenblatt and other board members cheated shareholders by selling the company for less than it was actually worth. Valleywag, a gossip blog that reported on the allegations, also claimed that founder and public face of MySpace, Tom Anderson, was a public relations invention. It was later confirmed by Newsweek that Anderson's age on the site had been lowered to \\"appeal\\" to younger users. In October 2006, Greenspan published \\"The Myspace Report\\" on a personal website, calling for government investigation into News Corp's acquisition of Myspace. Greenspan's main allegation is that News Corp. should have valued Myspace at US$20 billion rather than US$327 million, and had defrauded Intermix shareholders through an unfair deal process. However the report was not widely accepted by the financial press and a lawsuit led by Greenspan challenging the acquisition was dismissed by a judge. Censorship Activist group MoveOn.org has criticized MySpace, claiming that the website practices censorship by not showing anti-media ads, removing fake profiles for high- profile media executives like Rupert Murdoch, and attempting to force users away from using certain third-party Flash applications on their profiles.anti- censorship campaign against Myspace for the censoring of user-generated content . MySpace China The simplified Chinese version of MySpace, launched in April 2007, has many censorship-related differences from other international versions of the service. Discussion forums on topics such as religion and politics are absent, and a filtering system that prevents the posting of content about Taiwan independence, the Dalai Lama, Falun Gong, and other \\"inappropriate topics\\" has been added. Users are also given the ability to report the \\"misconduct\\" of other users for offenses including \\"endangering national security, leaking state secrets, subverting the government, undermining national unity, and spreading rumors or disturbing the social order.\\" Religious and political discrimination Throughout 2007 and 2008, Myspace was accused of deleting the \\"Atheist and Agnostic Group\\" on at least two occasions, deleting a pro-choice group, as well as banning individual Myspace users. The controversy stemmed from the belief that the groups and users had not violated the site's Terms of Service, and had been banned solely due to complaints from a smaller group of conservative religious users who were offended by the groups and members being on Myspace. Blocking Schools, public libraries, and employers in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Russia, Australia and Malaysia have restricted access to Myspace, seeing it as \\"a haven for gossip and malicious comments.\\" A Catholic school in New Jersey has prohibited students from using Myspace at home, an action made to protect students from online predators as claimed by the school, although experts questioned the legality of such a ban and if it is constitutional. In autumn of 2005 Pope John XXIII Regional High School in Sparta Township, New Jersey made headlines by forbidding its students to have pages on Myspace or similar websites (such as Gaia) under threat of suspension or expulsion.Blogging ban provokes a debate over cyberspace: Pope John H.S. demands that online profiles end, calls forums havens for sexual predators, Daily Record, October 24, 2005 In Turkey, Myspace was blocked on September 19, 2009, due to copyright issues of M√ú-YAP. Turkish rock musician Aylin Aslƒ±m, who has a Myspace account said the block was a serious violation of rights for independent musicians of Turkey. On October 6 of the same year, the block was lifted. Legal issues In May 2006, Long Island, New York teenagers Shaun Harrison and Saverio Mondelli were charged with illegal computer access and attempted extortion of MySpace, after both had allegedly hacked into the site to steal the personal information of Myspace users before threatening to share the secrets of how they broke into the website unless Myspace paid them $150,000. Both teens were arrested by undercover Los Angeles police detectives posing as Myspace employees. In April 2007, police in County Durham, United Kingdom, arrested a 17-year-old girl on charges of criminal damage following a party advertised on MySpace, held at her parents' house without their consent. Over 200 teenagers came to the party from across the country, causing ¬£20,000 of damage, such as cigarette butts, urine on clothing, and writing on the walls. The girl's parents, who were away at the time, had to move out of the house. Musicians' rights and Myspace terms of use agreement Until June 2006, there was a concern amongst musicians, artists, and bands on Myspace such as songwriter Billy Bragg owing to the fine print within the user agreement that read, \\"You hereby grant to MySpace.com a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, adapt, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, store, reproduce, transmit, and distribute such Content on and through the Services.\\" The fine print brought particular concern as the agreement was being made with Murdoch's News Corporation. Billy Bragg brought the issue to the attention of the media during the first week of June 2006. Jeff Berman, a Myspace spokesman swiftly responded by saying, \\"Because the legalese has caused some confusion, we are at work revising it to make it very clear that Myspace is not seeking a license to do anything with an artist's work other than allow it to be shared in the manner the artist intends.\\" By June 27, 2006, Myspace had amended the user agreement with, \\"MySpace.com does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, or any other materials (collectively, 'Content') that you post to the Myspace Services. After posting your Content to the Myspace Services, you continue to retain all ownership rights in such Content, and you continue to have the right to use your Content in any way you choose.\\" References Myspace Myspace Myspace ","title":"Criticism of Myspace"},{"id":"36120925","text":"Events in the year 1729 in Norway.

It contains a single species, Magnapaulia laticaudus. Magnapaulia was first described in 1981 as a possible species of Lambeosaurus by William J. Morris, and was given its own genus in 2012 by Prieto-M√°rquez and colleagues.  Discovery and naming  Magnapaulia skin impressions, on display at Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Between 1968 and 1974, a team of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County headed by geologist William J. Morris excavated giant lambeosaurine remains from a site near El Rosario in Baja California. Morris named them Lambeosaurus laticaudus in 1981, based on type specimen LACM 17715, a partial skeleton with partial skull. Morris added a question mark to the front of the generic name to indicate its provisional nature: because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. The specific name is derived from the Latin latus, \\"broad\\", and cauda, \\"tail\\". Morris interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, as well as a healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. Between 1981 and 2012, other authors accepted it as a potential species of Lambeosaurus, suggested it could instead be a species of Hypacrosaurus, or questioned its validity. In 2012 it was named as a separate genus by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez, Luis Chiappe, and Shantanu Joshi. The generic name is a combination of the Latin magnus, \\"large\\", and the first name of Paul G. Haaga, Jr., the president of the board of trustees of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. The 2012 study indicated that the remains had been found in a layer of the El Gallo Formation, dating to the late Campanian, about 73.6 to 73 million years old. The study referred numerous other specimens to the species: LACM 17698, 17699, 17700, 17702‚Äì17713, 17716 and 17717; LACM 20873-20876; and LACM 20883-20885. These had been found within a distance of three metres to the holotype and consist of partial skeletons, separate bones and skin impressions from several individuals, varying in size. In 2012 a complete redescription of the body parts was given.  Description  Skeleton restoration and size comparisonMagnapaulia is noted for its great size and the tall profile of its tail, which had elongated chevrons and vertebral spines like those of Hypacrosaurus. Its size was estimated by its original describer as between 15 m (49.2 ft) and 16.5 m (54.1 ft) long, with a weight of up to 23 metric tons (25.4 tons); Prieto-M√°rquez et al. provided a smaller estimate of around , still among the longest ornithischians and representing the largest known lambeosaurine. The largest known specimen is LACM 17712, which includes a humerus with an estimated original length of 803 millimetres. The redescription of 2012 established two autapomorphies, unique derived traits: the presence of chevrons at the tail base that were four times as long as the vertebral centra; and the possession at the tail base vertebrae of front joint processes, prezygapophyses, the inner bases of which formed a bowl-shaped depression that extended upwards into a deep trough on the front surface of the spine. A life restoration of Magnapaulia laticaudus On the vertebral column, from at least the middle of the back to over the middle of the tail, a tall crest of almost continuous height was present formed by spines that were about four times as high as the vertebral centra. Magnapaulia is among the many hadrosaurids that have preserved skin impressions; the tail of specimen LACM 17712 had some up to four centimetres wide scales, or perhaps bony osteoderms, embedded within up to one centimetre long hexagonal and smaller rounded scales.  Phylogeny  Tail vertebrae Left dentary In 2012 Magnapaulia was assigned to the Lambeosaurinae. The 2012 study contained a cladistic analysis which found it to be closest to Velafrons, also from Mexico, with this sister species forming a separate southern clade, itself the sister group of a clade of more northern Asian and North-American forms, including Lambeosaurus, Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus and Olorotitan.

The libSBML library can be embedded in a software application or used in a web servlet (such as one that might be served by Apache Tomcat) as part of the application or servlet's implementation of support for reading, writing, and manipulating SBML documents and data streams. The core of libSBML is written in ISO standard C++; the library provides API for many programming languages via interfaces generated with the help of SWIG. The libSBML library is free software released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or any later version. LibSBML was developed thanks to funding from many agencies, particularly the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS, USA) as well as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA, USA) under the Bio-SPICE program.  Description  The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is an XML-based format for encoding computational models of a sort common in systems biology. Although SBML is based upon XML, and thus software developers could support SBML using off-the- shelf XML parser libraries, libSBML offers numerous advantages that make it easier for developers to implement support for SBML in their software. The premise behind the development of libSBML is that it is more convenient and efficient for developers to start with a higher-level API tailored specifically to SBML and its distinctive features than it is to start with a plain XML parser library.  Significant features of libSBML  The following is a partial list of libSBML's features: * Supports all Levels and Versions of SBML with common API classes and methods, thus smoothing the differences between different flavors of SBML from the perspective of the application software. * Provides facilities for manipulating mathematical formulas in both text-string format and MathML 2.0 format, as well as the ability to interconvert mathematical expressions between these forms. Internally, libSBML uses familiar Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to represent formulas, and provides AST-oriented methods for calling applications. * Performs validation of XML and SBML at the time of parsing files and data streams. This helps verify the correctness of models in a way that goes beyond simple syntactic validation. * Offers support for dimensional analysis and unit checking. LibSBML implements a thorough system for dimensional analysis and checking units of quantities in a model. * Provides facilities for the creation and manipulation of SBML annotations and notes. These have a specific format dictated by the SBML specifications. The formats and standards supported by libSBML include MIRIAM (Minimal Information Requested in the Annotation of a Model) and SBO (the Systems Biology Ontology). * Supports transparently reading and writing compressed files in the ZIP, GZIP and BZIP formats. * Provides interfaces for the C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB, Octave, and Ruby programming languages. The C and C++ interfaces are implemented natively; the C#, Java, Perl, Python, and Ruby interfaces are implemented using SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator; and the MATLAB and Octave interfaces are implemented through custom hand-written code. * Provides many convenience methods, such as for obtaining a count of the number of boundary condition species, determining the modifier species of a reaction (assuming the reaction provides kinetics), constructing the stoichiometric matrix for all reactions in a model, and more.  Manipulation of mathematical formulas  Some further explanations may be warranted concerning libSBML's support for working with mathematical formulas. In SBML Level 1, mathematical formulas are represented as text strings using a C-like syntax. This representation was chosen because of its simplicity, widespread familiarity and use in applications such as GEPASI and Jarnac,Sauro H. Jarnac: a system for interactive metabolic analysis. In: Hofmeyr J-HS, et al., editors. Animating the Cellular Map: Proceedings of the 9th International Meeting on BioThermoKinetics. Stellenbosch, South Africa: Stellenbosch University Press; 2000. pp. 221-228. whose authors contributed to the initial design of SBML. In SBML Levels 2 and 3, there was a need to expand the mathematical vocabulary of Level 1 to include additional functions (both built-in and user-defined), mathematical constants, logical operators, relational operators and a special symbol to represent time. Rather than growing the simple C-like syntax into something more complicated and esoteric in order to support these features, and consequently having to manage two standards in two different formats (XML and text string formulas), SBML Levels 2 and 3 leverage an existing standard for expressing mathematical formulas, namely the content portion of MathML. As mentioned above, LibSBML provides an abstraction for working with mathematical expressions in both text-string and MathML form: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Abstract Syntax Trees are well known in the computer science community; they are simple recursive data structures useful for representing the syntactic structure of sentences in certain kinds of languages (mathematical or otherwise). Much as libSBML allows programmers to manipulate SBML at the level of domain-specific objects, regardless of SBML Level or version, it also allows programmers to work with mathematical formula at the level of ASTs regardless of whether the original format was C-like infix or MathML. LibSBML goes one step further by allowing programmers to work exclusively with infix formula strings and instantly convert them to the appropriate MathML whenever needed.  Dependencies  LibSBML requires a separate library to do low-level read/write operations on XML. It can use any one of three XML parser libraries: Xerces, expat or libxml2. Users can specify which library they wish to use at libSBML compilation time. LibSBML hides the differences between these parser libraries behind an abstraction layer; it seamlessly uses whichever library against which a given instance of libSBML has been compiled. (However, released binary distributions of libSBML all make use of the libxml2 library.)  Usage  LibSBML uses software objects (i.e., instances of classes) that correspond to SBML components, with member variables representing the attributes of the corresponding SBML objects. The libSBML API is constructed to provide an intuitive way of relating SBML and the code needed to create or manipulate it with a class hierarchy that mimics the SBML structure. More information about the libSBML objects is available in the libSBML API documentation.  Reading and writing SBML  LibSBML enables reading from and writing to either files or strings. Once an SBML document is read, libSBML stores the SBML content in an SBMLDocument object. This object can be written out again later. The following is an example written in Python: >>> import libsbml # read a document >>> doc = libsbml.readSBMLFromFile(filename) >>> doc = libsbml.readSBMLFromString(string) # helper function that takes either a string # or filename as argument >>> doc = libsbml.readSBML(filename) >>> doc = libsbml.readSBML(string) # write a document >>> libsbml.writeSBMLToFile(doc, filename) >>> True >>> libsbml.writeSBMLToString(doc) >>> ' '  Creating and manipulating SBML  The libSBML API allows easy creation of objects and subobjects representing SBML elements and the subelements contained within them. The following is an example written in C++: void createSBML() { // create an SBML Level 3 Version 1 document SBMLDocument* doc = new SBMLDocument(3, 1); // create the model as a sub element of the document Model * model = doc->createModel(); // create a compartment as a sub element of the model Compartment * compartment1 = model->createCompartment(); // create an independent compartment and then add it to the model Compartment * compartment2 = new Compartment(3, 1); model->addCompartment(compartment2); }  Accessing attributes  Each component in SBML has a number of attributes associated with it. These are stored as member variables of a given class, and libSBML provides functions to retrieve and query these values. The syntax of these functions is consistent throughout libSBML. The following is an example written in Python: >>> import libsbml # create an SBML Level 3 Version 1 document >>> sbmlns = libsbml.SBMLNamespaces(3, 1) >>> doc = libsbml.SBMLDocument(sbmlns) #create the model as a sub element of the document >>> model = doc.createModel() #create a compartment as a sub element of the model >>> compartment = model.createCompartment() # set the attributes on the compartment # note a return value of 0 indicates success >>> compartment.setId(\\"cell\\") 0 >>> compartment.setSize(2.3) 0 >>> compartment.setSpatialDimensions(3) 0 >>> compartment.setUnits(\\"litre\\") 0 >>> compartment.setConstant(True) 0 # get the attribute values >>> compartment.getId() 'cell' >>> compartment.getSpatialDimensions() 3 # examine the status of the attribute >>> compartment.isSetSize() True >>> compartment.getSize() 2.3 #unset an attribute value >>> compartment.unsetSize() 0 >>> compartment.isSetSize() False >>> compartment.getSize() nan  See also  * JSBML * libxml2 * Xerces * Expat * XML validation * XML * BioModels Database * BioPAX * CellML * MIASE * MIRIAM * Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) * MathML  References  External links  * libSBML Home Page C++ libraries Free software programmed in C++ Free software Cross-platform free software Free computer libraries Free science software Articles with example Python (programming language) code ","title":"LibSBML"},{"id":"36121019","text":"Road I/50 is a first class road in Slovakia.

He specializes in the work of James Joyce in addition to the work of W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Also the former president of Emory University, he lives in Palo Alto, California, with his wife JoAn Johnstone Chace. Biography Born in Newport News, Virginia, Chace was awarded the bachelor of arts degree from Haverford College (1961) and a master's (1963) and Ph.D. in English (1968) from the University of California, Berkeley. He began his teaching career during a break from his doctoral studies in 1963-64 at Stillman College, a historically Black college, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. While there he joined with Black students in protesting the state's segregationist policies and participated in the 1964 march on the Tuscaloosa County Courthouse that ended in his arrest the only white person to have been incarcerated. Chace credits his experience at Stillman with giving him a focused direction in life and strengthening his resolve to become a teacher. While at Stanford he rose to Professor of English and served as Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences (1982 -1985), and Vice-Provost for Academic Planning and Development (1985 ‚Äì 1988). He left Stanford to be President of Wesleyan University from 1988-1994, and subsequently become President of Emory University from 1994 until 2003. His presidency at Emory was marked by his acrimonious public relationship with Emory professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, culminating in Sonnenfeld's resignation. Sonnenfeld subsequently sued Emory in the Federal Court, and during the proceedings it emerged that Chace had anonymously leaked information to the press regarding evidence admitted in the suit, in contravention to university policy. After his service as president he taught courses on Joyce and on Yeats, ‚ÄúWar and Literature‚Äù, and a course on the relationship of modern literature to ancient literature. He currently teaches a number of courses‚Äîon Joyce, Yeats, Eliot and Pound‚Äîat Stanford University in its Continuing Studies Program. A chair has been named in his honor in this program. Chace also participated in dramatics at Stillman, acting in a production of Edward Albee's ‚ÄúThe Death of Bessie Smith‚Äù, and Kurt Weill's Lost in the Stars College presidencies While at Wesleyan, Chace developed a five-year master plan with the aim of integrating academic and financial development which resulted in a reduction in the size of the administrative staff, a six percent reduction in faculty size, and a large reduction in annual operating expenses. This consolidation caused dissent, especially among faculty,Past Presidents of Wesleyan: Chace but in his own reflections on his tenure there, Chace cited as one of his prime imperatives the need to improve the quality of the faculty. He also wanted the faculty to take more responsibility for decision making. Writing about it in ‚ÄúInside Higher Education‚Äù, Chace wrote ‚Äúfaculty members are not so much the employees of the institution as they are its intellectual engine and its most important asset. They are \\"capital\\" rather than \\"labor.‚Äù‚Äù The Puzzle of Leadership During several months of student protests at Wesleyan in 1990, Chace's office was firebombed. He had been accused of being racist and uncommitted to diversity, an irony that the media noted given his early teaching at Stillman and his participation in the civil-rights movement that resulted in being ‚Äúthrown to the ground by police, threatened with a cattle prod, and locked in jail overnight on charges that included resisting arrest.‚Äù Commenting on the Wesleyan incident, Chace remarked ‚Äú..when you become president of an institution, for some students it does not make any difference what you were once upon a time. You are 'the man.' You are the symbol or the representative of authority, and you are seen in that way.‚Äù Later, a group calling itself STRIKE (Students Rebuilding Institutions for Knowledge and Education) claimed responsibility for the act. Chace referred to the act as not political, but criminal.author=Zach Schonfeld Activism or Terrorism: The Chace Firebombing 20 years on In 2013, Chace said his years at Wesleyan were \\"the hardest years of my life,\\" calling the college \\"a tough place for me.\\" During his tenure at Emory, the University experienced a tremendous growth as a research institution. Emory also invested $1 billion in campus renovation including a new standalone performing arts center, and a residential complex for students. Emory also worked towards making the campus environmentally sound and encouraging diversity in the student body.Emory University website page on Chace In 1995, Chace oversaw Emory's establishment of a campus-wide domestic partners policy for all employees, setting a trend for schools and businesses in the South,Emory Report: First year of domestic partner benefits runs smoothly although by 2002 it remained only one of two schools in Georgia offering same-sex domestic partners benefits. The move prompted criticism from United Methodist Church's Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference with which Emory has historic ties, though the conference's resolution passed by only a narrow margin. Chace responded in a lengthy letter to the presiding bishop, arguing that Emory's policy was consistent both with its educational mission and with the call to justice in the Methodist Church's Book of Discipline. Scholarly writing Chace has written two scholarly books‚Äì‚ÄìThe Political Identities of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot(1973) and Lionel Trilling: Criticism and Politics (1983)‚Äì‚Äì and edited (with Peter Collier) Justice Denied: The Black Man in White America; Making It New (poetry anthology with JoAn E. Chace); James Joyce: A Collection of Critical Essays; and An Introduction to Literature (again with Peter Collier). His scholarly articles include writings on Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Lionel Trilling, Graham Greene, D. H. Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence and James Joyce. In 2008 Common Knowledge published the first of several essays and reviews Chace contributed to that magazine, \\"On the Margin: Irving Howe Reconsidered\\". In 2011, he contributed an essay on Ezra Pound to a volume titled \\"AfterWord: Conjuring the Literary Dead\\". Writing about education Chace has written many articles about various aspects of and problems in higher education for The Chronicle of Higher Education, the New York Times, and other publications. Topics covered include multiculturalism, political correctness, consumerism and university finances. The American Interest published his essay, ‚ÄúApply and Demand,‚Äù about the financing of American higher education. These topics are also addressed in his academic memoir 100 Semesters: My Adventures as Student, Professor, and University President, and What I Learned along the Way. and in lectures he gave in 2006 to the Association of American Universities and the Hechinger Institute at Columbia University. His 2009 essay in The American Scholar entitled ‚ÄúWhere Have All the Students Gone?‚Äù was named by David Brooks of The New York Times as one of the best essays of the year and was named by that columnist a winner of a ‚ÄúSidney Hook Award.‚Äù The American Scholar has also published his essays ‚ÄúAffirmative Action‚Äôs Last Chance.‚Äù (2010) and ‚ÄúThe Truth about Campus Cheating.‚Äù Additional Publications * \\"The Unhappiness of Happiness\\" in The Hedgehog Review * \\"What I Have Taught and Learned\\" in \\"The American Scholar\\"  References  External links  * American Scholar article by William Chace on Decline of the English Department *'American Scholar article by William Chace on need for Affirmative Action in Universities *PDF copy of Spring 2010 issue of University of Georgia newsletter including interview with William Chace and UGA faculty on decline of humanities majors Presidents of Wesleyan University American academics of English literature 1938 births Living people Emory University faculty Presidents of Emory University Wesleyan University people People from Newport News, Virginia Haverford College alumni University of California, Berkeley alumni Stillman College faculty ","title":"William Chace"},{"id":"36121058","text":"Qaleh Qafeh (, also Romanized as Qal‚Äôeh Qafeh) is a village in Qaleh Qafeh Rural District, in the Central District of Minudasht County, Golestan Province, Iran.

Cerro de la Estrella National Park is centered on the Cerro de la Estrella mountain which is located entirely within eastern Mexico City, in the borough of Iztapalapa. The park was originally designated in 1938 with 1,100 hectares, but the growth of the city has encroached on it and left it with less than 200 hectares. The park is meant to provide cultural and recreational opportunity as well as to protect the mountain, which is important archaeologically and culturally as the site of the pre Hispanic New Fire ceremony and the modern-day Passion Play. Archaeological remains include temples related to the ceremony and older structures such as housing units, petroglyphs, and a major temple related to the Teotihuacan culture. The park and the archaeological sites remain in danger of destruction by encroachment, use of land for agriculture, graffiti and the dumping of garbage. Description The park was originally declared in 1938 with about 1,100 hectares but today it is considered to have somewhere between 143 and 192. The park is completely within Mexico City, located in the borough of Iztapalapa bordering the boroughs of Tl√°huac and Milpa Alta, bordered by major thoroughfares such as Calzada Ermita Iztapalapa and Calzada M√©xico-Tulyehualca. Most of the administration of the park falls under the Secretar√≠a de Agricultura y Recursos Hidr√°ulicos, with the objectives being a recreational and cultural zone for the borough to increase tourism. Of all the parks and green spaces in the city, it is the most abused with seasonal farming, illegal human settlements, areas used for grazing, the extraction of minerals, the dumping of garbage and even a cemetery. A wall has been constructed around parts of the park to protect it, especially the archeological site, from further encroachments by surrounding neighborhoods. Natural history The park is centered on the Cerro de la Estrella, a small mountain above sea level and about the city. It is the highest point in the borough of Iztapalapa. The hill is also called Huizachtepetl which means ‚Äúmountain of thorns.‚Äù It was made by volcanic processes, as part of the small mountain chain in the Valley of Mexico called the Sierra de Santa Catarina. The area serves as a recharge area for aquifers to the east of the city. The original wildlife of the area is extinct, and most animals here now are rodents, including squirrels. The trees are mostly Eucalyptus, Pinus patula pine, and some white cedar, all planted in reforestation projects. Hilltop view of Mexico City from the park. Recreation Recreational facilities include picnic tables, grills, playgrounds, sports facility and a lookout point. Sporting activities practiced in the park include hiking and running. The picnic area is administered by the borough and the Secretariat of Education, which provides activities for schoolchildren. The lookout point at the top of the hill provides one of the best views of the city. It has benches with pre Hispanic motifs and five telescopes for viewing. The park is filled with small caves, especially on the mountain proper. These caves have been a source of ghost stories and legends in the area, which include stories about the Devil, and youths lost in them. Another states that there is a tunnel under the hill that connects with a cemetery. The hill and park are the scene of the annual Passion Play, which ascends the main road of the park to the Museo del Fuego Nuevo . The Passion Play attracts thousands of visitors each year with its highlight being the reenactment of the Crucifixion at a place called Calvario but is really the base of a Teotihuacan era pyramid. History The park was established by President L√°zaro C√°rdenas in 1938, with an original area of 1,100 hectares. However, the growth of Mexico City has encroached on the park, despite various attempts to protect it, reducing its size by about ninety percent and stripping away all of its wild vegetation. The trees there now are due to reforestation efforts. Mesoamerican The area of the park was inhabited from at least the mid Pre Classic period, to the Spanish conquest and for the most part, the present day. Very early settlements were village and on near the mountain‚Äôs slopes. The largest settlement near the mountain was Culhuacan, founded around 900 CE by the Chichimeca. By the 15th century, the Mexicas had control of the area. During the pre-Columbian period, the Cerro de la Estrella was called Huizachtecatl, or Sacred Mountain, the site of the New Fire ceremony performed once every 52 years. The most important archeological remains in the park are related to this. The last New Fire ceremony took place in 1507. Today, the hill remains important culturally, as the scene of Iztapalapa‚Äôs annual Passion Play. =Archeology= Archeological finds at the Cerro de la Estrella archeological site relate to the Teotihuacan, Toltec, Chichimeca and Culhua- Mexica cultures and range from 1500 BCE to 1521. Excavations have found the Temple of the New Fire, the Sanctuary, the Villa Estrellas, 144 caves, the remains of walls and evidence of terracing. The most important of these is the former plaza and temple of the New Fire Ceremony, which is on the top of the hill. This archeological site can be visited through a guided tour. However, early archeological remains can be found in many parts of the park, including those which have since been covered over by urban sprawl. Ceramic and stone sculpture materials were discovered in the west side of Huizachtecatl that apparently was made within the 100 to 500 years CE; these resemble other similar pieces found in Zacatenco, north of Mexico City. The constructions here were built between the year 100 and 650 AD and are located in the north side, the remains consist of foundations and walls of palaces that show Teotihuac√°n influence. Another area was housing zone at the middle of the hill, built during the late Classic period (600 to 900 CE). In 2003, specialists from the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) worked to document petroglyphs found in various areas of the park, registering 210 in eleven groups, but they believe there are still more. Some of the petroglyphs are aligned with certain annual solar events. The most recent find was in 2006, when a pyramid base was discovered in what is called Calvary at the top of the mountain. This base dates to the Teotihuacan period, about 1300 years ago. INAH has decided not to excavate the base. Threats to park=Encroachment + appropriation Since its establishment in 1938, the park has shrunk in size from 1,100 hectares to somewhere between 143 and 192 hectares. This is due to illegal settlements and other encroachment onto the land, which even includes the Pante√≥n Civil San Nicol√°s Tolentino cemetery in the original designated area. The settlements have been made by groups of poor people, unable to purchase or rent living space. Later these groups organize to regularize their possession of the land. Some of this has not be by the poor, but by those able to build houses and buy cars shortly after they have legal possession of the land. To try and stop this process various other laws and declarations have been applied to the areas including declaring et a Zona Ecological y Cultural of Mexico City in 1999 and putting under the Ley Federal sobre Monumentos y Zonas Arqueol√≥gicos, Art√≠sticos e Hist√≥ricos in 2007. However, these efforts have not been sufficient to guarantee the preservation of the park. As of 2009, there were about 180 families inside the park proper. The 2007 effort made the park and some areas outside an archeological zone under INAH, but the agency has not acted to move those living within the area. Instead it only requires that buildings be no more than two stories tall and to be notified before any major excavation so that salvage operations can be done. One last effort to stop encroachment, especially in the major archeological areas has been two stretches of border wall, the last constructed in 2009. Another danger to the land is the appropriation of it for use for growing crops and as pasture, with fires lit in the area to clear space. Destruction Most of the danger archeologically has been to the numerous petroglyphs and caves in the park area. The park contains over 200 petroglyphs at risk of destruction. The Matlolotzin group of petroglyphs are found on the south side of the hill and are the most damaged by graffiti. Some have even been erased by the use to acid to give the impression that there is no heritage here to save. There are also more than 110 small caves which are important geologically and culturally, with evidence of human habitation over various epochs. Some of the more accessible caves have been damaged by people, including Concheros dancers using them for ceremonies. The Passion Play attracts thousands of visitors who also damage areas including caves. Many of the caves were sealed off by those who took over the land and more have been filed with garbage and graffiti.

In responding to the avian flu outbreak of 2009, a Canadian government body (the Remote and Isolated Task Group [RITG] of the Public Health Network H1N1 Task Force) published the following working definitions: In the above quote, the definition of isolated is borrowed from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) and the definition of remote is borrowed from Health Canada. Canada also has fly-in communities that lack road, rail, or water connections and rely entirely on bush aviation. Other remote communities lack road and rail but have water access, such as the Newfoundland outports, and those that have road access part of the year on ice roads, or can only be reached by gravel road. One academic measure of remoteness used in Canada is nordicity, i.e. \\"northerliness\\".  Healthcare in remote and isolated communities  In Canada, there were 76 nursing stations and over 195 health centres servicing remote communities in Northern Canada or on Indian reserves in the south. In about facilities, registered nurses are employed by Health Canada, a ministry of the government of Canada. In the other communities, nurses are employed by the Band Council.  Policing in remote and isolated communities  Policing in remote areas presents many challenges, most obviously logistical, but also social and even psychological. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had 268 \\"isolated posts\\" in 2009. Isolated posts are defined by the Treasury Board of Canada as communities that face \\"unique challenges\\" related to small populations, harsh climates, and/or limited access by commercial transportation or all-weather roads. All posts located in Canada's three northern territories are considered isolated as well as many in the ten provinces. Many of these posts are \\"fly-in only\\"; the police force has its own RCMP Air Services, which does everything from ferry prisoners to court to bring in new computers to offices. In 2009, in the territory of Nunavut there were 25 detachments, all fly-in (no roads), and only one RCMP airplane.

Originating in 1912, Ice Chips is said to be the longest running club-produced ice show in the world. The show is a two-day event which takes place each spring, showcasing national, international and Olympic champions from around the world. In recent years the show has been held at Harvard University, attracting thousands of spectators each year. History Originally referred to as an ice carnival, Ice Chips developed many of the techniques used in professional ice shows today. In the 1920s and 1930s, the ice carnival served as a touring show, showcasing the club's premiere skaters on the East Coast. Revenue from these early shows funded the building of The Skating Club of Boston's current facility on Soldiers Field Road in 1938. Over the years, Ice Chips has showcased some of the greatest skaters in figure skating history. In the early years, Olympic champions Gillis Grafstr√∂m, Sonja Henie, Karl Sch√§fer, Andr√©e Brunet, Pierre Brunet, Maxi Herber and Ernst Baier, and World champions, Cecilia Colledge and Felix Kaspar. In 1946, the show adopted the name Ice Chips, and went on to feature many more major champions including, Dick Button, Barbara Ann Scott, Tenley Albright, Hayes Jenkins, Carol Heiss, Sjoukje Dijkstra, Donald Jackson, Barbara Wagner, Robert Paul, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Charles Tickner, Elaine Zayak, Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano, Kurt Browning, Yuka Sato, Frances Dafoe, Norris Bowden, Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner, Alexei Yagudin, Stephane Lambiel, Jeffrey Buttle and Kaetlyn Osmond. Preceding its 7-year run at Harvard University's Bright Arena, Ice Chips has been held in some of Boston's most historic venues, including the original Boston Garden, Northeastern University's Matthews Arena, and Boston University's Walter Brown Arena. In recent years, while at Harvard University, the show has featured Olympic medalists, Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, Evan Lysacek, and Javier Fernandez.

The manuscript has survived in complete condition.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels on 289 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in two columns per page, 23 lines per page. At the end it has additional non-biblical material ‚Äì Lives of 12 Apostles. According to Hermann von Soden it is an ornamented manuscript. The text is divided according to chapters (tables of ), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their titles () at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections, with references to the Eusebian Canons (written below Ammonian Section numbers). It also contains the Epistula ad Carpianum, Eusebian Canon tables, and tables of contents (). Subscriptions at the end of each of the Gospels with numbers of lines () and stichoi ().  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden included it to the textual family Kx. Kurt Aland did not examine the text of the codex and did not place it in any Category. According to the Claremont Profile Method it has a mixture of the Byzantine families in Luke 1 and represents the textual family Kx in Luke 20. In Luke 10 no profile was made. It contains the spurious text of Matthew 16:2b‚Äì3 (Signs of the times) and Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11), but they are marked with an obelus as doubtful.  History  C. R. Gregory dated the manuscript to the 11th century. Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 11th century. Probably it was written in Calabria. Formerly it was known as Codex Columnensis 4. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener (689e) and Gregory (873e). C. R. Gregory saw it in 1886.

The band officially started in the beginning of 2009, but former drummer Mathias Hansen and current frontman Zachary Ray had already played together in the beginning of 2008. Along came bass player Casper Clausen and former guitarist Martin Christiansen. This quartet produced around 23 tracks and recorded it themselves at Zacharys room. But they only manage to land one gig together with another local band from Nyborg. After personal disagreements, in the middle of 2009, Mathias and Martin were dismissed from the quartet and current drummer Frederik Hansen was new man behind the drumset. From that on, their career started in a serious way, and since then they have played at numerous festivals, gave plenty of concerts, professionally recorded an EP, published a lot of singles and uploaded a music video which has gotten positive criticism. Their music style can best be described as high tempo and energetic, because they jump and dance around a lot on the stage. Equally as high tempoed and energetic is their music, which is full of tight well played drum fields and a lot of guitar riffs. Their music is exploding with energy, and another characteristic is that they have a simple and plain sound which makes the music extremely catchy.  Name  Unnamed Unknown was created when people started asking what the band was called. Then it was a big theme in the everyday life that you could never be secure of what you do, or what will happen tomorrow, especially not in a young age. Even in the adult world are we not secure and safe. And with those thoughts in mind, Unnamed Unknown was becoming more and more personal for the band members. Since then, the name has been much criticized as inappropriate, now that they have won numerous contents and therefore aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù anymore.

It was introduced after the reshuffle in the band's lineup. Gribbi is often seen with a hat on, and is always introduced on the stage, with a small note from the frontman.  Other media  In 2011 the band was contacted by a radio station in the United States who would like to play their music in the local radio in Rhode Island. In the summer 2012, Unnamed Unknown will have their music played as a commercial tune, for Naked Fruit, which is a local producer of fresh juice, just south of Nyborg.

Shirley Rossmore (Joyce), the judge's daughter, learns of her father's trouble and returns from Paris, where she has won success as an author. She is loved by Jefferson Ryder (Nagel), son of the magnet. Determined to force the millionaire's hand, she publishes The American Octopus under a pseudonym with a main character based upon Burkett. He is attracted by the book and brings its author Shirley, whom he knows as Sarah Green, into his home to write his biography. She uses this opportunity as the chance to obtain two letters that will clear her father's name. Jefferson aids her in obtaining the documents, but is discovered and denounced as a thief. Shirley cannot allow the man she loves so branded, so she reveals her identity. The millionaire \\"lion\\" had already been won over by the charm of the \\"mouse,\\" so there is a happy resolution.

Life=Education and early career Schmitt was born in Warren, Ohio, the son of Jacob A. Schmitt (1861-1952), a music professor and organist, and Grace Tod Wood Schmitt (1864-1949). He left Warren High School before graduating to study art in New York City under the patronage of Zell Hart Deming, editor of the local Warren Tribune newspaper and a prominent local patron of the arts. After a year at the Chase School, Schmitt enrolled at the National Academy of Design studying with Emil Carlsen. He graduated from the NAD in 1909, winning top honors for his work in still life.American Art News, vol. 7, no. 32 (June 12, 1909), p. 2. While still a student at the Academy, Schmitt made his first visit to Silvermine, Connecticut, then home of the Silvermine Group of Artists, an artist colony under the leadership of sculptor Solon Borglum. He first exhibited with the Silvermine Group in 1910.\\"Catalogue of the ... Art Exhibit given by the Silver Mine Group of Artists ... September 19‚Äì24, 1910.\\" Solon H. Borglum and Borglum family papers, 1864-2002. Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, box 9, folder 30. After Borglum's death in 1922 Schmitt was a charter member of the Silvermine Guild of Artists (now the Silvermine Arts Center).American Art News, Vol. 21, No. 6 (November 16, 1922), p. 8. Friendship with Hart Crane Upon returning from a year of study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence (cut short by the First World War), Schmitt returned to Warren, where he received a number of commissions from prominent local citizens including Joseph G. Butler, Jr. and Henry K. Wick.Irene S. Sweetkind, Index of the Permanent Collection: The Butler Institute of American Art (Youngstown, OH: The Butler Institute of American Art, 1997). In 1916 Schmitt returned to New York, where he established a studio in the Stuyvesant Square neighborhood. Hart Crane, then an unknown poet and newly arrived in New York, was a frequent visitor to Schmitt's studio apartment in the early part of 1917.John Unterecker, Voyager: A Life of Hart Crane, (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1969), p. 53. Crane and Schmitt had met in Warren the previous year through Crane's aunt and Schmitt's patron Zell Hart Deming. Just before moving to New York, Crane wrote to Schmitt about his life in Cleveland, Ohio.Hart Crane to Carl Schmitt, [November] 1916, in The Poet's Vocation: Selections from the Letters of H√∂lderlin, Rimbaud, & Hart Crane, ed. William Burford and Christopher Middleton (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1967), pp. 46-47. In one of his first letters to his mother from New York, Crane wrote, \\"Carl is a more wonderful man than you have any idea. A tremendous thinker!\\" A little later he wrote to his father: \\"Nearly every evening since my advent has been spent in the companionship of Carl. Last night ... we talked until twelve, or after, behind our pipes. He has some splendid ideas.\\"Unterecker, pp. 56-57. Crane got to know some of the poets and writers in Schmitt's circle, including Conrad Aiken.Edward Butscher, Conrad Aiken: Poet of the White Horse Vale (Athens and London: University of Georgia Press, 1988), p. 242. Although they would each pursue their own interests and friends in later years, Schmitt and Crane carried on an extensive correspondence, Crane sending drafts of his poems to Schmitt for his review. They saw each other for the last time in 1925 in New York with Zell Hart Deming. Crane described his friend at this meeting: \\"He was as always, looked and acted exactly the same as we remember him.\\"Paul Mariani, The Broken Tower: A Life of Hart Crane (New York: W.W. Norton, 1999), pp. 175-76\\\\. A portrait of Crane by Schmitt, done almost 50 years later, is now in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.National Portrait Gallery, Catalog of American Portraits Growing recognition and hardship Upon being drafted into the U.S. Army in 1917, Schmitt worked drawing maps in Washington, DC. While on leave in October 1918, he married Gertrude Lord, daughter of Austin W. Lord, a prominent New York architect and member of the Silvermine Group of Artists. They settled in Silvermine, their home for the remainder of their lives, where their family would grow to ten children. Over the next twenty- five years Schmitt's work was accepted at major national exhibitions, including Carnegie International (1920‚Äì29, 1932, 1934) those at the Art Institute of Chicago (ten times between 1912 and 1936),Peter Falk, ed., The Annual Exhibition Record of the Art Institute of Chicago, 1888-1950, (Madsion, CT: Sound View Press, 1990). the Corcoran Gallery of Art (six times between 1912 and 1928),Peter Falk, ed., The Biennial Exhibition Record of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1907-1967, (Madison, CT: Sound View Press, 1991). the National Academy of Design (four times between 1913 and 1924),Peter Falk, ed., The Annual Exhibition Record of the National Academy of Design, 1901-1950, (Madison, CT: Sound View Press, 1990). the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (six times between 1912 and 1930),Peter Falk, ed., The Annual Exhibition Record of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, vol. 2: 1876-1912 (Madison, CT: Sound View Press, 1991), ; vol. 3: 1913-1968 (Madison, CT: Sound View Press, 1991), . as well as numerous exhibitions in Silvermine and at galleries in New York. He was a guest at Yaddo in 1928, where he met the poet Stanley Kunitz and painter Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones.Micki McGee, Yaddo: Making American Culture (New York: The New York Public Library and Columbia University Press, 2008), ; a photo of the 1927 guests, including Carl Schmitt, may be found on page 60. His painting The Picnic was chosen for the art exhibition at the Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago in 1933.Chicago Tribune, April 30, 1933, p. C6; Catalogue of A Century of Progress Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, The Art Institute of Chicago, June 1 to November 1, 1934 (Art Institute of Chicago, 1934), p. 75. In the 1930s Schmitt caught the attention of Catholic social activist Peter Maurin, founder of the Catholic Worker newspaper, which published a series of articles about him in late 1934. Catholic Worker contributing writer Donald Powell recalls the first time he met Schmitt: \\"Several of us had gathered to discuss social justice. I remember his stating that social justice could be obtained only by starting with the individual; that is, when the individual was just, society was just, and that the Catholic could do the most by example. Which means, in effect, that Catholics must be converted to Catholicism before attempting to convert non-Catholics to it.\\"Donald Powell, ‚ÄúCarl Schmitt - The Forgotten Man,‚Äù Catholic Worker, November, 1934. Maurin himself wrote an essay about Schmitt for the newspaper, later reprinted in his book Catholic Radicalism.Peter Maurin, \\"Carl Schmitt: The Artist,\\" in Catholic Radicalism: Phrased Essays for the Green Revolution (Catholic Worker Books, 1949), pp. 48-49. Financial hardship led Schmitt to sign up for the Public Works of Art Project in 1934; in 1936 Schmitt worked for the Federal Arts Project (the visual arts branch of the Works Progress Administration). He completed fifteen works (7 oil paintings and 8 drawings) which were distributed in various public buildings in Connecticut.WPA Art Project of the Connecticut State Library Shortly thereafter, an attack of tuberculosis forced him to cease work and seek treatment at a sanatorium in Tagliacozzo, Italy. His wife and family of ten children joined him there in 1938 but they all returned to the United States upon the outbreak of World War II the following year.Wilton Bulletin, October 25, 1989, p. 21C Three of Schmitt's sons soon returned to Europe to fight on the front lines.New Canaan War Veterans Speak: Stories of World War II, vol. 1 (New Canaan, Connecticut: n.p., 1946), pp. 76-81; New Canaan's Records of World War II, vol. 3: Honor Roll and Service Records, The Home Front, (New Canaan, CT: The War Records Committee of the Town of New Canaan and the New Canaan Historical Society, 1951), p. 84. A friend described him during these difficult years: \\"A fellow of medium height, with a shock of dark brown hair, light brown eyes (Pan's eyes) and a deeply lined face. He looks, and is, ill-nourished. When painting he gets pains in the back of his neck and in his back and becomes so keyed up that he cannot eat. But he still worries the canvas with his brushes and fingers until at least part of his vision is realized.\\" Later years After the war Schmitt preferred to work in relative isolation in Silvermine for the next 50 years, exhibiting locally or by invitation. A large retrospective exhibit was held in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1980, featuring over 100 of his works. In an interview done during the exhibition he stated: \\"I tried not to exhibit unless I had to. I hate to see [my paintings] go out. I don't like to show. It's an interruption to painting but I feel I owe it to people. I've never sought publicity.\\"\\"Artist, 92, doesn't believe in rushing his paintings,\\" Stamford (CT) Advocate, Sept 12, 1980, p. 6. He continued to paint well into his nineties and celebrated his one hundredth birthday at his home in Silvermine surrounded by family and friends.\\"Carl Schmitt Century Old Saturday,\\" Wilton (CT) Bulletin, May 3, 1989, p. 1. He died in Norwalk, Connecticut a few months later.

It is part of a strong life sciences network including institutions such as the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, the Bernstein Center Freiburg (BCF), the Center for Applied Biosciences (Zentrum f√ºr angewandte Biowissenschaften, ZAB) and the Center for Biological Systems Analysis (Zentrum f√ºr Biosystemanalyse, ZBSA), which started operations in 2008 as offspring of the Freiburg Initiative for Systems Biology (FRISYS), funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).  History  The faculty of biology began to develop in 1960, when Friedrich Oehlkers forwarded the ordinary of botany to Hans Mohr and Bernhard Hassenstein took the chair of Zoology as successor of Otto Koehler. Back then, the department of biology was still part of the Naturwissenschaftlich-Mathematische Fakult√§t (faculty of natural sciences and mathematics), which had been established in 1767. In 1963 and 1964, the ‚Äúsecond generation‚Äù of ordinaries ‚Äì Bresch (genetics), Drews (microbiology), Grisebach (biochemistry) and Sander (developmental biology of animals) ‚Äì joined the founding fathers Mohr and Hassenstein. The ‚Äúthird generation‚Äù with the ordinaries Elster (limnology), Hertel (molecular biology), Osche (ecology and evolutionary biology of animals), Sitte (cellular biology), Spatz (biophysics) and the female professor Otti Wilmanns (geobotany) followed between 1967 and 1969. Within hardly one decade, the department of biology had become a subject with twelve fields, making the establishment of an ‚Äúown‚Äù faculty in compliance with a new constitution of the university in the year of 1970 a logical consequence.  Faculty today  In 2008 (German Wintersemester 2008/2009), teaching courses have been reorganized according to the Bologna Agreement, replacing the original German diploma with the Bachelor-Master-System. Currently, the faculty offers a Bachelor's course in biology and two different Master courses: the Master of Science in biology and the Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Systems biology. The trinational, trilingual biotechnology program offered at the √âcole sup√©rieure de biotechnologie Strasbourg (ESBS) is also partially funded by, and held at, the University of Freiburg faculty of biology. More than 1300 students are currently enrolled (as of 2011), among those about 300 in the old diploma program, 400 in the bachelor program and 350 in the German Lehramt-program (Staatsexamen).  Excellence  In 2010 the faculty was ranked in the \\"Excellence Group\\" for \\"biology, chemistry and mathematics\\" and among Germany's top research universities in the field of biology, according to the 2012 CHE University Ranking, according to several criteria. Several institutions funded within the German Universities Excellence Initiative are affiliated to the faculty of biology: * Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss) * Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine (SGBM) * Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS) * BrainLinks-BrainTools  Botanical garden  The faculty's botanical garden was founded in 1620 by the university's Faculty of Medicine as hortus medicus. It was almost completely destroyed during the Thirty Years' War in 1632 and in 1677, when the city of Freiburg was taken by French troops, barracks were built on the former area of the botanical garden. The botanical garden was relocated to an area of 2.7 hectare close to the river Dreisam in 1766, where the first greenhouses were built in the years of 1827 and 1828. Due to the city's expansion, the garden had to be relocated again in 1879. Today's botanical garden was built in yet another, fourth location between 1912 and 1920. It features four exhibition greenhouses that, in total, span an area of 910 m¬≤. They are thematically divided into \\"tropic\\", \\"ferns\\", \\"succulents\\" and \\"cold house\\" (mainly species from Australia and New Zealand). A research greenhouse is considered a special feature of the faculty.  iGEM  The University of Freiburg team has been the first German team to participate in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) undergraduate synthetic biology competition held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where it repeatedly scored highly. The participation in the competition is supported by numerous university institutions, among them the Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss) funded by the German Universities Excellence Initiative.  Golden rice  The genetically engineered golden rice was developed by the University of Freiburg professor Peter Beyer and the ETH Zurich professor Ingo Potrykus from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now helps to provide Vitamin A to people lacking access to it in their diet. One existing crop, genetically engineered \\"golden rice\\" that produces vitamin A, already holds enormous promise for reducing blindness and dwarfism that result from a vitamin-A deficient diet.  International Moss Stock Center (IMSC)  The faculty provides service centres such as the International Moss Stock Center (IMSC) which collects, preserves and distributes several mosses for scientific research.

The series debuted as a summer test run on June 11, 2012 on six stations owned by Fox Television Stations. It premiered nationwide across the United States and Canada starting on September 9, 2013. Production The idea to bring Frankel to talk television had been in the planning stages in 2011, but disagreements over the series' concept and failure to clear the show in major television markets resulted in the project being shelved that November. In January 2012, however, the project was revived when the Fox Stations group approached Warner Bros. Television about testing the show out as a summer replacement for some of the syndicated programs that were cancelled or had ended production. The summer test showed promising results. Warner Bros. Television announced that once the show finished its six-week test run, it would put the show on hiatus and syndicate it nationally in fall 2013. On July 6, 2012, Warner Bros. Television announced Bethenny was cleared by the entire Fox Television Stations Group, well ahead of its September 2013 launch. In some markets, the show was used to replace the cancelled Anderson Live, which was also distributed by Warner Bros. Television. In Canada, the show airs on CTV and CTV Two, with air times varying by market to allow for simsubbing. On February 14, 2014, Bethenny was cancelled due to a loss of affiliate clearances to NBC Universal Domestic Television Distribution's upcoming The Meredith Vieira Show. Despite the \\"final show\\" airing in May 2014, new episodes continued to air until July 4, 2014. Ratings Ratings for the series were fair. Though the series did not place first in ratings since its September 2013 relaunch, the show opened with a 0.9 rating. Bethenny averaged a 0.9 household rating, ranking No.14 among talk shows above only The Arsenio Hall Show, The Test, and Trisha, all of whom were also cancelled in May 2014 along with Bethenny.

NetGirl Forum In the role of a cyber-relationship ‚Äúsexpert,‚Äù Resnick developed and hosted AOL‚Äôs NetGirl Forum, one of the early Internet‚Äôs most popular online dating services, from 1995 to 1996. NetCreations Resnick co-founded NetCreations in March 1995 and served as the company‚Äôs CEO and president until December 2001. She pioneered the concept of 100% opt-in email marketing in 1996, which turned the 2-person website design firm into an online marketing company that generated $58 million in sales in 2000, the year after its IPO, and earned it a ranking in Business Week‚Äôs ‚ÄúInformation Technology 100‚Äù in 2001 for revenue growth surpassing 615%. NetCreations‚Äô development of opt-in email was a response to the prevalence of unsolicited email marketing, or Spam, which, in testimony to the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, Resnick characterized as an abuse of privacy. By 2000, NetCreation's opt-in email list was reportedly growing by 30,000 new email addresses per day, garnered from a pool of more than 260 partner websites. Among NetCreations‚Äô first clients for opt-in generated email marking lists were CMP Publishing, IDG Corp., MacMillan Online, Prodigy, Scholastic and Ziff-Davis Publishing Company. Her company‚Äôs early success in this Spam alternative to email marketing reportedly prompted traditional list houses to develop and sell web-generated lists. At the time of its IPO, the company was valued at approximately $300 million, achieving a market cap of over $1 billion in February 2000. Resnick and her partner Ryan Scott sold the company after the dot-com crash of 2000 to SEAT Pagine Gialle in February 2001 for $111 million in cash.

Verrucarin A belongs in the class of trichothecenes, a group of sesquiterpene toxins produced by several fungi, namely from the Fusarium species, that are responsible for infecting food grains. Within the skeleton of the basic trichothecane structure, the olefin and epoxide are crucial for toxicity; ester functionalities and hydroxyl groups often contribute to the toxicity, thereby rendering Verrucarin A as one of the most lethal examples. The mechanism of action for this class of toxins mainly inhibits protein biosynthesis by preventing peptidyl transferase activity. Although initially thought to be potentially useful as anticancer therapeutics, numerous examples of trichothecene derivatives were shown to be too toxic for clinical use. Biosynthesis Verrucarin A is classified as a type D trichothecene based on its substitution pattern in the 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT) core structure. Type D differs from types A, B and C by containing an additional ring linking the C-4 and C-15 position. Trichothecenes are generally formed via the Mevalonate pathway beginning with the precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). After cyclization of FPP to form trichodiene, TRI4 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme to catalyze a series of oxygenation events. Upon the addition of three oxygens at C-2, C-11 and the C-12,13 epoxide, the intermediate isotrichodiol is formed. Isotrichodiol then isomerizes, yielding the tricothecane EPT core structure. Subsequently, it is proposed that a series of hydroxylations and acylations occur at C-15 and C-4 which then cyclize at these carbons. 500px  References  Sesquiterpenes ","title":"Verrucarin A"},{"id":"36122187","text":"Jean Satterthwaite Faust was born Jean Satterthwaite in Tarboro, NC, March 19, 1930.

The film stars Luis Caballero and Miguel Angel Mamani as two half-brothers of mixed race who find themselves in a sprint to the Bolivia-Chile border. It is set against a backdrop of the 2003 Bolivian gas conflict and was shot during 2010 in the slums of El Alto and on El Altiplano in La Paz, Bolivia on a micro budget, using primarily non-professional actors. Plot Rocky (Luis Caballero), the older, illegitimate white son of a Bolivian mother and absent American father, returns home from prison to El Alto and the house he shares with his girlfriend and his also illegitimate indigenous half-brother, Nene (Miguel Angel Mamani). Rocky and Nene‚Äôs relationship is strained and distant. Rocky pays little attention to his girlfriend and goads his half-brother. Nene reveals that his estranged father has left him a small plot of land as inheritance. Rocky takes an interest in visiting the land with his brother. They visit the land and discover that it is a tiny and worthless sliver of land in the middle of nowhere. While Nene laments his inheritance, Rocky mocks him for his naivet√©. The brothers are ideologically opposed when it comes to notions of national identity, their values, ideas about their native Bolivia and relationships. Rocky sees something during his visit to the land that intrigues him. Rocky returns to the land the next day and discovers something buried there that leads him to flee for the Chilean border which is rumored to be closing due to the political turmoil around the gas conflict. Rocky encounters difficulties and is forced to call on his brother to help him to the border. Unbeknownst to Nene, in doing this, Nene is helping Rocky deceive him. The brothers encounter numerous difficulties on their journey that strain their relationship even further, but the difficulties they encounter force them to find common ground in the interests of getting themselves to the border on time. The obstacles they encounter are a microcosm of some of the contemporaneous social and economic problems that face Bolivians.
