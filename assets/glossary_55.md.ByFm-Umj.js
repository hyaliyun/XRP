It is located in Port Chatham bay, after which an adjacent community takes its namesake. Named after Nathaniel Portlock, the town was an active cannery community in the early- twentieth century. The residents of the town purportedly fled en masse in the 1950s after a number of unsolved murders and disappearances. History =Establishment= Portlock was established in the Kenai Peninsula in the early-twentieth century as a cannery, particularly for salmon. It is thought to have been named after Captain Nathaniel Portlock, a British ship captain who sailed there in 1786. In 1921, a U.S. Post Office opened in the town. The population largely consisted of Russian-Aleuts. =Abandonment= Around the 1940s, it was reported that several Dall sheep hunters had disappeared in the hills outside Portlock; it was also stated in a 1973 article from the Anchorage Daily News that dismembered bodies of some of the missing had washed ashore in the lagoon. These events led the residents of the community to flee en masse, and the town's post office officially closed between 1950 and 1951. Nearby communities Portlock was located adjacent to another community known as Port Chatham (which takes its name from Port Chatham bay). Seldovia is located north of Portlock; a chromite mining camp, known as Chrome, was also located near Portlock, which operated in the early-twentieth century. Demographics Portlock first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village of 31 residents. It would not report again on the census until 1980, when it was made a census-designated place (CDP), again reporting 31 residents. It was dissolved as a CDP by the 1990 census and has not reported again.

The school opened at 3152 Debby Drive, Montgomery and subsequently moved to 6010 Vaughn Road, Montgomery. The site was taken over by Saint James School. The school adopted the name of a Methodist institution in Birmingham of the same name that existed 1866-1923. There is no evidence that this school was associated with the Methodist Church. History =Background= National desegregation policy had been set by Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Alabama, like Mississippi, largely ignored the ruling at first. In Montgomery, conflict over school segregation was triggered an effort to integrate public parks. In December 1958 the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) sued the city of Montgomery to force an end to racial segregation in the city's public parks. Rather than accede to this demand the city closed down all of its parks, including the Montgomery Zoo, effective on January 1, 1959. In response to this, Martin Luther King Jr. on behalf of the MIA, announced that the Association would attempt to end racial segregation in Montgomery public schools by having large numbers of black children apply for admission to white schools in order to provide test cases which might allow a judge to declare the Alabama Pupil Placement Act unconstitutional. Governor John Patterson threatened to shut down the public schools to prevent their integration and the Ku Klux Klan leader Robert Shelton promised that the Klan was prepared to prevent integration by violent means if necessary. The first major lawsuit affecting Montgomery schools was Lee v. Macon County Board of Education in 1963. A three-judge panel issued a blanket desegregation order in 1967. Later, federal moves against segregation academies in Alabama switched from the courts to the IRS, addressing their non-profit status.\\"Recreational facilities Ruling Made,\\" The Tuscaloosa News, Jan 21, 1972. Four private schools in Montgomery would use city parks for football, basketball and baseball: Stephens-Spears (which had a published segregation policy), Central Alabama Academy (which had no published segregation policy), and Montgomery Academy and St. James which had \\"declared\\" open enrollment policies. Their use of the city facilities was defended by the city in Gilmore v. City of Montgomery (1972). The court found the schools' use of the facilities unconstitutional. The sitting judge was Frank M. Johnson, whose son John was a student at the Montgomery Academy, enjoined the city from continuing this practice, stating that \\"In allowing private academies to use city facilities, Montgomery is providing aid to private, segregated schools, thus facilitating their establishment and operation as an alternative for white students who in most instances are seeking to avoid desegregated public schools.\\" Academics have since described segregation academies in three categories, reflecting the social and economic divisions within the white community: (a) lower-class 'rebel yell' academies; (b) white community schools; and (c) upper-class day schools. It is unclear into which category Central Alabama Academy fell, but it did not last out the century. =Founding, operation, and decline= Central Alabama Academy was founded in 1970 as a segregation academy. The school operated at first near the Montgomery Mall, which opened the same year. Later, it moved east to 6010 Vaughn Road, near Montgomery Catholic High School. It gave up the property to Saint James School, which built its new campus there in 1990.

Geography Another view of the islands in Erbusaig Bay Erbusaig Bay has a classic half circle shape, that faces the island of Scalpay, with the small twin Black Islands in the bottom half of the bay looking north, obscuring the view. The area is dominated by two enormous flat rock hills which plateau in the area. The southern plateau is the higher, rising to 215 feet, while the northern rock plateaux is slightly lower. Both have a slight covering of heather and bracken with bare rock showing regularly. The village of Erbusaig sits at the head of the bay, in a V-shaped plain, which has been eroded from the rock plateau by the Erbusaig Burn. The plain is several feet above the bay. Whitewashed houses dot the plain. The west coast of Scotland close to Erbusaig Bay is highly fragmented and populated with many hundreds of small islets.

The Agency will also be headed by a Chief Executive recruited by the State Services Commission. The Agency plans to have formulated a plan for mine re-entry by the end of March 2018. The Government has allocated NZ$23 million to funding the agency's operations and mine re-entry over a three-year period. The Pike River Recovery Agency will also take over ownership of Pike River mine from Solid Energy, which is scheduled to enter into liquidation in mid-March 2018. After the planned re-entry, ownership of Pike River will return to the Department of Conservation, including a planned Pike29 Memorial Track, as part of Paparoa National Park. On 31 January 2018, the Pike River Recovery Agency formally came into existence with its headquarters being based in Greymouth on the West Coast. On 19 April, Little entered the Pike River Mine portal with Pike Family representatives Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse to demonstrate that a safe re-entry was possible. He promised that the Coalition Government would re-enter the drift to recover evidence and the remains of loved ones. On 21 May 2019, the Pike River Recovery Agency's chief operating officer Dinghy Pattinson led a recovery team which breached the concrete seal to the mine drift. The occasion was marked by family members releasing 29 yellow balloons and calling out the names of those who died. Re- entry and recovery operations are expected to take several months and will consist of three phases. The first team of miners will assess hazards and establish supporting infrastructure. A second forensically-focussed mining team will be tasked with collecting evidential material. A third team will provide mining services including gas monitoring, communications lines and ventilation bags. Once completed, the site is expected to be refurbished and returned to the Department of Conservation by June 2020. On 10 June 2020, Minister for Pike Mine Re-entry Little announced that it was \\"impractical\\" to expect the remains of the fallen miners to be recovered due to the dangerous conditions. Instead, recovery efforts would focus on gathering evidence for the homicide case. The cost of the recovery project had risen from NZ$23 million to NZ$35 million, with concerns that the figure could reach NZ$50 million.

Since 2002, the museum has been associated with the Marquette Harbor Light, a lighthouse that serves traffic in Marquette Harbor and adjacent waters of Lake Superior. The facility offers tours of the lighthouse, which remains an active aid to navigation overseen by the United States Coast Guard, and the museum specializes in the maritime history of Marquette, Lake Superior, and the iron ore trade. Lake Superior is one of the five Great Lakes. Description The Marquette City Water Works, a Richardsonian Romanesque building of Lake Superior sandstone, was built in 1891 during the Marquette Iron Range iron ore boom. The Marquette Maritime Museum Association was founded in 1980 as the old Water Works was nearing the end of its useful life. In 1984, the Association commenced Museum operations in the Water Works. In 2002, the Museum signed lease papers with the Coast Guard to offer guided, supervised public tours of the Marquette Harbor Light. In July 2016, on the 150th anniversary of the lighthouse, the Coast Guard gave the ownership deed of Lighthouse Point to the City of Marquette. Lighthouse Park is now open to the public but the Museum still offers guided tours mid- May to mid-October. The museum and lighthouse tour schedule and admission fee information can be found at mqtmaritimemuseum.com. The Museum includes a display of Fresnel lenses. This 19th-century lens technology used carefully fitted glass prisms to mathematically focus a beam of light onto the sometimes-stormy waters of the Great Lakes. Most Fresnel lenses have been rendered obsolete by high-intensity sealed beam lamps, so the lighthouses that formerly used them have transferred or lent them to the Museum. Outdoor features of the Marquette Maritime Museum include a harborside memorial to the World War II United States Navy submarines USS Darter and USS Dace, two attack submarines credited with a key role in the 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf. These two submarines are honored here because David McClintock (Darter) was a Marquette resident. Commander (later Captain) McClintock was awarded the Navy Cross for the Leyte Gulf service performed by him, his crew, and his ship.

The work began in 1896, and the design was done by architect Michelangelo Maiorfi: Cardinal Agostino Bausa blessed the first stone on May 31 of that year. The entrance is provided with a serene and travertine stone facade, with the coats of arms of the Misericordia and Florence painted along with those of the ancient Arts of Florence; on the sides of the entrance are instead sculpted those of the city districts, the Mercy and the People's Cross.

He is known for discovering the most complex animal visual system known of any organism. ‚Äì that of the mantis shrimp, which has 12 color channels.  Education and early life  Marshall's parents were both marine scientists; his father was Her Majesty‚Äôs Curator of Fish at the British Museum of Natural History, and his mother was a natural history illustrator of marine organisms. His early exposure as a child to marine animals and environments led to his love of marine biology. Marshall attended high school in Cambridge and studied a Bachelor of Science in zoology, graduating with 1st class honors from the University of Sussex, UK in 1985. He completed his PhD in the neurobiology of vision in mantis shrimps at the University of Sussex, UK in 1996.  Career and research  Marshall‚Äôs research focuses on neuroethology, understanding how animals perceive their environment, and also how the brains and sensory systems of animals in the real world have been shaped by their environment and needs, particularly their visual systems. His study of the mantis shrimp revealed it has the world‚Äôs most complex visual system of any known animal, with 12-channel colour channels. His research also showed that octopus and other cephalopods are colour blind. He showed that mantis shrimp and cuttlefish can reflect and detect circular polarised light, which is closely linked to covert communication. This research is being used to design new generation polarisation cameras and other optical devices. He has made discoveries in colour vision in several other animal groups, such as marine and freshwater fish, cephalopods, birds, lizards and crabs. In 2017, his lab uncovered a new type of eye cell in deep-sea fish, a 'rod-like cone' specialised for dimly lit environments. Marshall has also worked in the deep sea, contributing to the design of the MV Alucia research vessel. His research student Wen-Sung Chung was the first person in the world to see a giant squid in its natural habitat in July 2012, via a video cameras set up by Japanese broadcaster NHK. Marshall is also a marine biologist and began the citizen science/outreach program CoralWatch in 2002. One of his PhD students at the time developed the ‚Äòcoral health chart‚Äô, a color-coded chart to observe the health of corals seen when diving or snorkeling. The program is in 78 countries and has more than 3500 members; more than 8000 coral surveys have been conducted. Marshall has contributed to more than 50 documentaries, including National Geographic, and BBC Blue-chip productions, and Chasing Coral on Netflix. He was worked with Sir David Attenborough on several series including the 2015 Great Barrier Reef series as chief science consultant.

Johann Traeg (20 January 1747 ‚Äì 5 September 1805)Life dates from New Grove. was a German music copyist and publisher who flourished in Vienna in the late 18th century. He had business dealings with Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, and his catalogs and advertisements are still employed today as a source for historical musicology. Life and career He was born in Gochsheim in Bavaria, and had moved to Vienna by 1779.New Grove He began his work simply by offering hand copies of musical works, working out of his home. This was possible even in the late 18th century, for as David Wyn Jones notes, Austria was at the time not very technologically advanced in this respect: > Music-printing was becoming increasingly widespread in the 18th century ... > In those areas of Europe like Britain, France, and northern Germany, where > music-publishing was well established, printed copies of instrumental music > became the principal means of dissemination ... On the other hand, in > [other] parts of Europe, principally the Austrian monarchy, southern > Germany, Italy, and the Iberian peninsula, ... copying of music by hand > remained the principal means of dissemination for all music through Haydn's > lifetime [1732‚Äì1809].Jones, David Wyn (2011) Oxford Composer Companions: > Haydn. Oxford University Press, article \\"copyists\\". The article is by David > Wyn Jones. As Jones as elsewhere pointed out, what set Traeg apart from most professional copyists was his assiduous compilation of what became a vast library of music from which he could offer copies for sale. Jones suggests that the several changes of residence recorded for Traeg in his advertisements may have been needed to house the expanding collection, and indeed Traeg eventually moved his family out to the suburbs and placed the collection in his own shop, whose opening was advertised 16 May 1789, and which became a destination for Viennese music-lovers for the rest of his life.Jones's discussion of the expanding library appears in his book The Symphony in Beethoven's Vienna (2006); Cambridge University Press. As of 9 April 1794, Traeg entered the publication business per se, with issue of printed copies of quartets by Joseph Eybler; this business eventually flourished. Traeg retained his offerings of hand-copied music, however. Starting no later than 1789, he served as the Vienna agent of the important Leipzig publisher Breitkopf & H√§rtel.Edge (2001:191) Austria had no copyright law until the 19th centurySee Schnopfhagen, Richard Dieter Heine, and Vladan Katanic (2011) Intellectual Property Law in Austria, Kluwer Law International, p. 33). Edge (2001:152) remarks, \\"Musical copyright was not protected by law in the Habsburg monarchy at this time, and there was as yet no concept of \\"royalties\\". and Traeg was perfectly free to acquire copies from any source of whatever music he liked and offer hand copies of them for sale without compensation to the composer. Jones estimates, for instance, that Traeg at his peak had 500 works by Joseph Haydn on offer, none of which provided Haydn with any income.Cf. Edge's (2001:152) very similar remarks concerning Traeg and Mozart: \\"Needless to say, Mozart received no financial benefit from any of the manuscript copies sold by ... Traeg.\\" Nevertheless, Haydn occasionally dealt with Traeg on a business basis, though there is evidence he was not pleased with the situation; see below. =His catalogue= In 1799, Traeg's firm created a catalog listing all the items that were available for purchase at the time, indicating which were obtainable in print and which in custom hand-copy. The catalog runs to 233 pages and by Edge's \\"conservative\\" estimate contains at least 10,000 musical works by hundreds of composers.Edge (2001:274‚Äì276) A supplement to the catalog was issued in 1804. The catalogs have been re-published in modern times as a resource for historical musicology, along with the set of advertisements that Traeg took out in the newspaper Wiener Zeitung.See Weinmann (1973, 1981). Summarizing what music was available from Traeg's business, Edge writes: > In contrast to [other copyists], Traeg specialized in instrumental music, > including an extremely wide variety of arrangements. He also made a > specialty of \\"old\\" music (from a late eighteenth-century perspective, > anything composed before roughly 1775), and he occasionally advertised works > by such composers as Corelli and Handel. Traeg also seems to have been the > only commercial copyist in Vienna who dealt to any significant degree in > sacred music ... the wide variety of offerings in Traeg's catalogue of 1799 > seem to suggest that he maintained close contacts with music publishers and > dealers throughout Europe.Edge (2001:191) =Later years= Starting in about 1800, the music copying part of the business was deemphasized in favor of printed offerings.Edge (2001:757‚Äì758) In his later years Traeg carried out his business in collaboration with his son, also named Johann Traeg (15 September 1781 ‚Äì after 1831); as of October 1803 the firm was named \\"Johann Traeg und Sohn\\". Edge (2001:758) Traeg died on 5 September 1805; his fatal disease was described as (pulmonary dropsy).Edge (2001:758) The family business continued to prosper under the son for some time but eventually withered against strong competition and folded in 1820. Dealings with celebrated composers =Haydn= Joseph Haydn mostly entrusted publication of his works to others, but in old age he did have Traeg publish his late piano trio, H. XVI:31 (1803). Concerning the issue of Traeg and intellectual property, Jones narrates the following small act of revenge on Haydn's part, from the same year: > The vast majority of [Traeg's] material was acquired independently of the > composer. These were characteristics of contemporary musical life that Haydn > would have accepted but in 1803 it led to a quarrel between composer and > dealer. Traeg had acquired from a member of the Erd√∂dy family several > autograph scores of Haydn's operas, including L'isola disabitata. Breitkopf > & H√§rtel had expressed an interest in publishing the opera and Haydn > borrowed the autograph score from Traeg; after a while Traeg asked that the > score be either returned or purchased. Haydn did neither and gave the dealer > a dressing down in front of several mutual acquaintances.Jones (2011). For > the original version of the anecdote, which derives from a letter by Georg > August Griesinger and was published in a biographical volume on Haydn by > Hugo Botstiber, see Edge (2001:782). =Mozart= Traeg periodically offered works by Mozart for sale in his advertisements in the Wiener Zeitung.These may be viewed in English translation in Deutsch (1965); see entries for \\"Traeg\\" in Index; as well as in Edge (2001), who fills some gaps in the earlier record. He was the first (27 Sept. 1783) to offer copies of the Piano Concertos K. 413, K. 414, and K. 415 after the Paris publisher Jean Georges Sieber had turned them down. Halliwell (1998) raises the possibility that the Traeg issue of the concertos may have been not a backup business arrangement with Mozart but rather simply pirated.Ruth Halliwell (1998) The Mozart Family: four lives in a social context. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 396, fn. 25. But Edge makes the case that at least some of Traeg's Mozart offerings were in fact created from material acquired from Mozart himself, and thus presumably involved remuneration. > Traeg was ... in possession of an exceptionally wide variety of works by > Mozart, and he was often able to advertise them in the Wiener Zeitung at > quite an early date, often not long after the composer finished them or > received them from [his childhood home in] Salzburg. Under these > circumstances, it seems more than plausible that he acquired them directly > from the composer.Edge (2001:786) Cliff Eisen suggests that following Mozart's death (5 December 1791), Traeg may have been involved in important dealings with his widow Constanze. At the time Constanze was faced with a very serious financial situation in light of having two children, the debts her husband left, and (at first) no pension income. Eisen writes:The documents from Constanze's struggle (ultimately successful) to receive a pension from the Emperor are recorded in Deutsch (1965), entries for 1791‚Äì1792. > There is good reason to think that Traeg might have acquired [manuscripts of > Mozart's compositions] from Constanze, shortly after Mozart's death in > December 1791. As early as April 1792 Traeg offered for sale copies of 14 > Mozart symphonies; this number was augmented to 15 in August, at which time > Traeg also offered an enormous collection of Masses, concertos for piano, > violin and horn, cassations, partitas for winds, a horn quintet, the duos > for violin and viola, more than 30 dances, and 'various' arias, in score, > with Italian texts. Where could such a large selection ‚Äì including many > works previously not sold in Vienna ‚Äì suddenly have come from, except > Mozart's estate? Eisen, Cliff (1997) \\"Another look at the 'corrupt passage' > in Mozart's G Minor Symphony, K550: Its sources, 'solution' and implications > for the composition of the final trilogy.\\" Early Music 25 (3):373‚Äì380. > Quotation is from p. 376. Edge spells out what may have been happening, and partially endorses Eisen's hypothesis: \\"One can easily imagine that Constanze, suddenly faced with the prospect of supporting herself and two children while attempting to sort out her deceased husband's chaotic finances, might quickly have decided to sell some of what seemed to her the less obviously important items from her husband's collection in order to raise ready cash. Although there is currently no direct evidence to support this conjecture, it is at least plausible.\\"Edge (2001:862‚Äì863) Later on, Constanze's dealings with Traeg were less substantial; once her financial situation had become more secure she dealt more often with out-of-town publishers such as Breitkopf & H√§rtel and Johann Andr√©. However, Traeg did issue the first edition (1798) of the Mozart's String Quintet K. 174 (1773), as well a four-hand piano edition of the Fantasia for Mechanical Organ K. 608.Source for this paragraph: Keefe (2007). =Beethoven= Traeg published a fair number of Beethoven's works; particularly early in his career. For the most part, these were works that Beethoven did not assign the dignity of an opus number. The material includes variation sets on themes by other composers, a popular genre. As with Constanze Mozart's choices, the most important works largely went to other publishers. A partial listing of Traeg's Beethoven publications follows.From Clive, Peter (1993) Mozart and his circle.

Rockefeller Jr. to help revitalize Midtown Manhattan. Rockefeller Center is located on one of Columbia University's former campuses and is bounded by Fifth Avenue to the east, Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) to the west, 48th Street to the south, and 51st Street to the north. The center occupies in total, with some of office space. Columbia University had acquired the site in the early 19th century but had moved to Morningside Heights in Upper Manhattan in the early 1900s. By the 1920s, Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan was a prime site for development. Around that time, the Metropolitan Opera (Met) was looking for a new site for their opera house, and architect Benjamin Wistar Morris decided on the former Columbia site. Rockefeller eventually became involved in the project and leased the Columbia site in 1928 for 87 years. The lease excluded land along the east side of Sixth Avenue to the west of the Rockefeller property, as well as at the site's southeast corner. He hired Todd, Robertson, and Todd as design consultants and selected the architectural firms of Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, Hood, Godley & Fouilhoux, and Reinhard & Hofmeister for the opera complex. However, the Met was unsure about moving there, and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 put an end to the plans. Rockefeller instead entered into negotiations with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) to create a mass- media complex on the site. A new plan was released in January 1930, and an update to the plan was presented after Rockefeller obtained a lease for the land along Sixth Avenue. Revisions continued until March 1931, when the current site design was unveiled. A late change to the proposal included a complex of internationally themed structures along Fifth Avenue. All structures in the original complex were designed in the Art Deco architectural style. Excavation of the site started in April 1931, and construction began that September on the first buildings. The first edifice was opened in September 1932, and most of the complex was completed by 1935. The final three buildings were built between 1936 and 1940, although Rockefeller Center was officially completed by November 2, 1939. The construction project employed more than 40,000 people and was considered the largest private construction project at the time. It had cost the equivalent of $ billion in dollars to construct. Since then, there have been several modifications to the complex. An additional building at 75 Rockefeller Plaza was constructed in 1947, while another at 600 Fifth Avenue was constructed in 1952. Four towers were built along the west side of Sixth Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, which was the most recent expansion of Rockefeller Center. The Center Theatre from the original complex was demolished in 1954.  Site  In 1686, much of Manhattan, including the future Rockefeller Center site, was established as a \\"common land\\" of the city of New York. The land remained in city ownership until 1801, when the physician David Hosack, a member of the New York elite, purchased a parcel of land in what is now Midtown for $5,000, equivalent to $ in dollars. In terms of the present-day street grid, Hosack's land was bounded by 47th Street on the south, 51st Street on the north, and Fifth Avenue on the east, while the western boundary was slightly east of Sixth Avenue (also known as Avenue of the Americas). At the time, the land was sparsely occupied and consisted mostly of forest. Hosack opened the Elgin Botanic Garden, the country's first public botanical garden, on the site in 1804. The garden would operate until 1811, when Hosack put the land on sale for $100,000 (). As no one was willing to buy the land, the New York State Legislature eventually bought the land for $75,000 (). In 1814, the trustees of Columbia University (then Columbia College) were looking to the state legislature for funds when the legislature unexpectedly gave Hosack's former land to the college instead. The gardens became part of Columbia's \\"Upper Estate\\" (as opposed to the \\"Lower Estate\\" in Lower Manhattan), on the condition that the college move its entire campus to the Upper Estate by 1827. Although the relocation requirement was repealed in 1819, Columbia's trustees did not see the land as \\"an attractive or helpful gift\\", so the college let the gardens deteriorate. The area would not become developed until the 1830s, and the land's value did not increase to any meaningful amount until the late 1850s, when St. Patrick's Cathedral was built nearby, spurring a wave of development in the area. Ironically, the cathedral was built in that location because it faced the Upper Estate gardens. By 1860, the Upper Estate contained four row houses below 49th Street as well as a wooden building across from the cathedral. The surrounding area was underdeveloped, with a potter's field and the railroad lines from Grand Central Depot located to the east. Columbia built a new campus near its Upper Estate in 1856, selling a plot at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street to the St. Nicholas Church to pay for construction. Shortly afterward, Columbia implemented height restrictions that prevented any taller buildings, such as apartment blocks or commercial and industrial buildings, from being built on its property. Narrow brownstone houses and expensive \\"Vanderbilt Colony\\" mansions were built on nearby streets, and the area became synonymous with wealth. By 1879, there were brownstones on every one of the 203 plots in the Upper Estate, which were all owned by Columbia. The construction of the Sixth Avenue elevated line in the 1870s made it easy to access commercial and industrial areas elsewhere in Manhattan. However, the line also drastically reduced property values because the elevated structure obstructed views from adjacent properties, and because the trains on the structure caused noise pollution. Columbia sold the southernmost block of its Midtown property in 1904, using the $3 million from the sale (equivalent to $ million in ) to pay for newly acquired land in Morningside Heights even further uptown, to replace its Lower Estate. Simultaneously, the low-lying houses along Fifth Avenue were being replaced with taller commercial developments, and the widening of the avenue between 1909 and 1914 contributed to this transition. Columbia also stopped enforcing its height restriction, which Okrent describes as a tactical mistake for the college because the wave of development along Fifth Avenue caused the Upper Estate to become available for such redevelopment. Since the leases on the Upper Estate row houses were being allowed to expire without renewal, the university's real estate adviser John Tonnele was tasked with finding suitable tenants, who could net the university more profit than what the row houses' occupants were currently paying.  Early plans  = New Metropolitan Opera House = old Metropolitan Opera Building (pictured). In 1926, the Metropolitan Opera (Met) started looking for locations to build a new opera house to replace its existing building at 39th Street and Broadway. This was not a new effort, as Otto Kahn, the Met's president, had been seeking to erect a new opera house since he assumed the position in 1908. However, the Met did not itself have money to fund the new facility, and Kahn's efforts to solicit funding from R. Fulton Cutting, the wealthy and influential Cooper Union president, were unsuccessful. Cutting did support the 1926 proposal for a new building, as did William Kissam Vanderbilt. By mid-1927, Kahn had hired architect Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban to come up with designs for the opera house. They created three designs, all of which the Met rejected. Kahn wanted the opera house to be located on a relatively cheap piece of land near a busy theater and retail area, with access to transportation. In January 1928, Tonnele approached Cutting to propose the Upper Estate as a possible location for the Met. Cutting told of Tonnele's idea to Morris, who thought that the Columbia grounds in Midtown were ideal for the new opera house. By early 1928, Morris had created blueprints for an opera house and a surrounding retail complex at the Upper Estate. However, the new building was too expensive for the Met to fund by itself, and it needed an endowment. On May 21, 1928, Morris presented the project during a dinner for potential investors, at which the Rockefeller family's public relations adviser Ivy Lee was a guest. Lee later informed his boss, John D. Rockefeller Jr., about the proposal, in which the latter showed interest. Rockefeller wished to give the site serious consideration before he invested, and he did not want to fund the entire project on his own. As a result, in August 1928, Rockefeller contacted several firms for advice. Rockefeller ended up hiring the Todd, Robertson and Todd Engineering Corporation as design consultants to determine the project's viability, with one of the firm's partners, John R. Todd, to serve as the principal builder and managing agent for the project. Todd submitted a plan for the opera house site in September 1928, in which he proposed constructing office buildings, department stores, apartment buildings, and hotels around the new opera house. In June 1928, Charles O. Heydt, one of Rockefeller's business associates, met with Kahn to discuss the proposed opera house. After the meeting, Heydt purchased land just north of the proposed opera house site as per Rockefeller's request, but for a different reason: Rockefeller was afraid that many of the landmarks of his childhood, located in the area, were going to be demolished by the 1920s wave of development. The writer Daniel Okrent states that Rockefeller's acquisition of the land might have been more for the family name rather than for the Met proposal itself, as Rockefeller never mentioned the details of the proposal in his daily communications with his father, John D. Rockefeller Sr. John D. Rockefeller Jr., who funded the Met project In mid-1928, the Met and Rockefeller were named as prospective buyers for the Columbia site. A lease was agreed to in late 1928 and signed on December 31 of that year. Columbia leased the parcel to Rockefeller for 87 years at a cost of over $3 million per year (equivalent to $ million in ), thereby allowing all the existing leases on the site to expire by November 1931 so Rockefeller could purchase them. Rockefeller would pay $3.6 million per year (equivalent to $ million in ). In return, he would be entitled to the income from the property, which at the time was about $300,000 annually (equivalent to $ million in ). This consisted of a 27-year lease for the site from Columbia, with the option for three 21-year renewals, such that the lease could theoretically last until 2015. (The lease was renewed in 1953 and 1973, and Columbia sold the land to Rockefeller Center Inc. in 1985.) Moreover, Rockefeller could avoid any rent increases for forty-five years, adjusted for inflation. The lease did not include the strip of land bordering Sixth Avenue on the west side of the parcel, as well as St. Nicholas Church's property on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets, and so these were excluded from the plans. Simultaneous with the signing of the lease, the Metropolitan Square Corporation was created to oversee construction. =Architects= In October 1928, before the lease had been finalized, Rockefeller started asking for recommendations for architects. By the end of the year, Rockefeller hosted a \\"symposium\\" of architectural firms so he could solicit plans for the new complex. He invited seven firms, six of which specialized in Beaux-Arts architecture, and asked the noted Beaux-Arts architects John Russell Pope, Cass Gilbert, and Milton B. Medary to judge the proposals. Rockefeller requested that all the plans be submitted by February 1929, and the blueprints were presented in May of that year. All of the proposals called for rentable space of , but these plans were so eccentric that the board rejected all of them. For the time being, Morris was retained until a more suitable architect could be found. However, by the end of 1928, Morris had been fired without pay. He was eventually paid $50,000 for his contributions to the project, and many of his ideas were included in the final design. Rockefeller retained Todd, Robertson and Todd as the developers of the proposed opera house site; and, as a result, Todd stepped down from the Metropolitan Square Corporation's board of directors. In October 1929, Todd appointed Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray; Hood, Godley & Fouilhoux; and Reinhard & Hofmeister to design the buildings. They worked under the umbrella of \\"Associated Architects\\" so that none of the buildings could be attributed to any specific firm.The lead architect and foremost member of the Associated Architects was Raymond Hood, who would become memorable for his creative designs. Hood and Harvey Wiley Corbett were retained as consultants. The team also included Wallace Harrison, who would later become the family's principal architect and adviser to John Rockefeller Jr.'s son Nelson. Hood, Morris, and Corbett were the consultants on \\"architectural style and grouping\\", although Morris was in the process of being fired. Todd also hired L. Andrew Reinhard and Henry Hofmeister as rental or tenant architects, to design the floor plans for the complex, and who were known as the most pragmatic of the Associated Architects. Hood, Corbett, Harrison, Reinhard, and Hofmeister were generally considered to be the principal architects. They mostly communicated with Todd, Robertson and Todd, rather than with Rockefeller himself. Hugh Ferriss and John Wenrich were hired as \\"architectural renderers\\", to produce drawings of the proposed buildings based on the Associated Architects' blueprints. Rene Paul Chambellan was commissioned to sculpt the models of the buildings, and he would later also create some of the art for the center. = Original plan and failure = The Metropolitan Opera was reluctant to commit to the development, and they refused to take up the site's existing leases until they were certain that they had enough money to do so. In January 1929, Cutting unsuccessfully asked Rockefeller for assistance in buying the leases. Since the Met would not have any funds until after they sold their existing building by April, Heydt suggested that the Metropolitan Square Corporation buy the leases instead, in case the Met ultimately did not have money to relocate. The Met felt that the cost of the new opera house would far exceed the potential profits. They wanted to sell their existing facility and move into the proposed new opera house by 1931, which meant that all existing leases would need to be resolved by May 1930. Otherwise, the new opera house could not be mortgaged, and Columbia would regain possession of the land, which would be a disadvantage for both the Met and Rockefeller. In August 1929, Rockefeller created a holding company to purchase the strip of land on Sixth Avenue that he did not already lease, so he could construct a larger building on the site and maximize his profits. The company was called the Underel Holding Corporation because the land in question was located under the Sixth Avenue Elevated. By October 1929, Todd announced a new proposal that differed greatly from Morris's original plan. Todd suggested that the site's three blocks be further subdivided into eight lots, with an \\"Opera Plaza\\" in the middle of the center block. The complex would contain the Metropolitan Opera facility; a retail area with two 25-story buildings; department stores; two apartment buildings; and two hotels, with one rising 37 stories and the other being 35 stories. The Met's opera house would have been located on the center block between 49th and 50th Streets east of Sixth Avenue. The retail center would be built around or to the west of the opera building. According to one New York Times account, the shops in the Metropolitan Opera development would be laid out in a way similar to that of the retail center in the English city of Chester. The main hurdle to the plan was the Met's reluctance to commit to the development by buying leases from existing tenants and handing the leases over to Columbia. Rockefeller stood to lose $100,000 per year (equivalent to $ million in ) if he leased the new opera house. Todd had objected that the opera house would be a blight rather than a benefit for the neighborhood, as it would be closed most of the time. After the stock market crash of 1929, these concerns were mooted: the opera could no longer afford to move. The Met instead suggested that Rockefeller finance their relocation by purchasing a half-interest in the old opera house and the land under it, an offer that he refused. On December 6, 1929, the plans for the new opera house were abandoned completely.  New plans  The former RCA Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza With the lease still in effect, Rockefeller had to quickly devise new plans so that the three-block Columbia site could become profitable. Hood came up with the idea to negotiate with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. This was achievable because Wallace Harrison was good friends with Julian Street, a Chicago Tribune reporter whose wife's great-uncle Edward Harden was part of the RCA board of directors. At Hood's request, Harrison made a lunch date to tell Street about the mass-media complex proposal. Harden, in turn, described the idea to RCA's founder Owen D. Young, who was amenable to the suggestion. It turned out that Young, a longtime friend of Rockefeller's, had been thinking of constructing a \\"Radio City\\" for RCA for several years. Rockefeller later stated, \\"It was clear that there were only two courses open to me. One was to abandon the entire development. The other to go forward with it in the definite knowledge that I myself would have to build it and finance it alone.\\" In January 1930, Rockefeller tasked Raymond Fosdick, the Rockefeller Foundation's future head, with scheduling a meeting with Young. The RCA founder was enthusiastic about the project, expressing his vision for a complex that, according to Daniel Okrent, contained \\"an opera house, a concert hall, a Shakespeare theater‚Äîand both broadcast studios and office space for RCA and its affiliated companies\\". RCA president David Sarnoff would join the negotiations in early 1930. Sarnoff immediately recognized Radio City's potential to affect the fledgling television and radio industries. By May, RCA and its affiliates had made an agreement with Rockefeller Center managers. RCA would lease of studio space; get naming rights to the development's largest tower; and develop four theaters, at a cost of $4.25 million per year (equivalent to $ million in ). NBC was assured exclusive broadcasting rights at Rockefeller Center as part of the deal. = RCA media complex proposals = In January, Todd released a new plan called G-3. Like the previous Metropolitan Opera proposal, this plan subdivided the complex into eight blocks with a plaza in the middle of the center block. It was similar to his October 1929 plan for the Met, with one major change: the opera house was replaced with a 50-story building. The 50-story tower was included because its larger floor area would provide large profits, and its central location was chosen because Todd believed that the center of the complex was too valuable to waste on low-rise buildings. Plans for a new Metropolitan Opera building on the site were still being devised, including one proposal to place an office building over the opera facility. However, this was seen as increasingly unlikely due to the Met's reluctance to move to the complex. A proposal to create roads that crossed the complex diagonally was briefly considered, but it was dropped because it involved decommissioning city streets, which could only be done after lengthy discussions with city officials. Plan G-3 was presented to the Metropolitan Square Corporation's managers in February. At the time, Todd thought that G-3 was the most viable proposal for the complex. Another plan called H-1 was revealed in March 1930, after the Underel Corporation had acquired the land near Sixth Avenue. The leases for the newly acquired land contained specific stipulations on how it was to be used. Under this new proposal, there would be facilities for \\"television, music, radio, talking pictures and plays\\". RCA planned to build theaters on the north and south blocks near Sixth Avenue, with office buildings above the theaters' Sixth Avenue sides. The theater entrances would be built to the west along Sixth Avenue, and the auditoriums would be located to the east, since the city's building code prohibited the erection of structures over the auditoriums of theaters. The delivery lane was eliminated in this plan, as it was perceived as unnecessary: the theaters would only see occasional deliveries. The complex would also contain three tall buildings in the center of each block, including a 60-story building in the center block for RCA (the current 30 Rockefeller Plaza). Todd suggested that this large tower be placed on Sixth Avenue because the Sixth Avenue Elevated would reduce the value of any other properties at the west end of the complex. On Fifth Avenue there would be a short oval-shaped retail building, whose top floors would be occupied by Chase National Bank offices. There would be a plaza between the oval building and RCA's building, and a restaurant atop the former. A transcontinental bus terminal would be built underground to entice tenants who might otherwise rent near Penn Station or Grand Central. Plan H-1 was approved in June 1930. In the middle of the month, The New York Times announced the plans for the \\"Radio City\\" project between 48th Street, 51st Street, Fifth Avenue, and Sixth Avenue. Additional details were released: for example, the $200 million cost projection for the three skyscrapers (equivalent to $ billion in ). To provide space for the plaza, 49th and 50th streets would be covered over, and there would be parking structures both above- and underground, while the streets surrounding the project would be widened to accommodate the heavy traffic. Four theaters would also be built: two small theaters for television, comedy, and drama; a larger one for movies; and another theater, larger still, for vaudeville. Under the plan, the demolition of the site's existing structures would start later in the year, and the complex would be complete by 1933. This plan had not been disclosed to the general public prior to the announcement, and even John Rockefeller Jr. was surprised by the $350 million cost estimate (equivalent to $ billion in ), since a private project of this size was unprecedented. Since Rockefeller had invested large sums of money in the stock market, his wealth declined sharply as a result of the 1929 stock market crash. In September 1930, Rockefeller and Todd started looking for funding to construct the buildings; and by November they secured a tentative funding agreement with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. In March 1931, this agreement was made official, with Metropolitan Life agreeing to lend $65 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation. Metropolitan Life's president Frederick H. Ecker granted the money on two conditions: that no other entity would grant a loan to the complex, and that Rockefeller co-sign the loan so that he would be responsible for paying it off if the development corporation defaulted. Rockefeller covered ongoing expenses through the sale of oil company stock. Other estimates placed Radio City's cost at $120 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) based on plan H-16, released in August 1930, or $116.3 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) based on plan F-18, released in November 1930.  Design influences  Setbacks on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, as specified by the 1916 Zoning Resolution The design of the complex was affected greatly by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which restricted the height that street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls from the streets. Although the 66-story RCA Building was located so far from the street that it could have simply risen as a slab without any setbacks, Hood decided to include setbacks anyway because they represented \\"a sense of future, a sense of energy, a sense of purpose\\", according to architecture expert Alan Balfour. A subsequent change to the zoning resolution in 1931, shortly after the Empire State Building opened, increased the maximum speed of New York City buildings' elevators from to , ostensibly as a result of lobbying from the Rockefeller family. This allowed Rockefeller Center's designers to reduce the number of elevators in the complex's buildings, especially the RCA Building. Originally, the elevators were supposed to be installed by the Otis Elevator Company, but Westinghouse Electric Corporation got the contract after agreeing to move into the RCA Building. This turned out to be a financially sound decision for Rockefeller Center, since Westinghouse's elevators functioned better than Otis's. Hood and Corbett suggested some plans that were eccentric by the standards of the time. One plan entailed the construction of a massive pyramid spanning all three blocks; this was later downsized to a small retail pyramid, which evolved into the oval retail building. Another plan included a system of vehicular ramps and bridges across the complex. In July 1930, Hood and Corbett briefly discussed the possibility of constructing the entire complex as a superblock with promenades leading from the RCA Building. This suggestion was not considered further because, as with the diagonal-streets plan, it would have involved decommissioning streets. Eventually, all of the plans were streamlined into a more traditional design, with narrow rectangular slabs, set back from the street, on all of the blocks. Hood created a guideline that all of the office space in the complex would be no more than from a window, which was the maximum distance that sunlight could directly penetrate the interior of a building at New York City's latitude. At the time, air-conditioned office buildings were rare, and the sunlit offices provided comfortable accommodations, as opposed to offices in many older buildings, which were dark and cramped. = Plan F-18 = During late 1930 and early 1931, the plans were revised and streamlined. March 1931 saw the announcement of Plan F-18, which called for an International Music Hall (now Radio City Music Hall) and its 31-story office building annex to occupy the northernmost of the three blocks, located between 50th and 51st streets. The 66-story RCA Building would be located on the central block's western half, between 49th and 50th streets, and would house RCA and NBC offices as well as broadcasting studios. The oval- shaped retail complex would occupy the block's eastern half, with a rooftop garden. A RKO-operated sound theater would be located in the southernmost block between 48th and 49th streets. In the center of Radio City would be a new three-block-long private street running between Fifth and Sixth avenues, with a concave plaza at the midpoint. The complex would also include space for a future Metropolitan Opera venue on the northernmost block. An underground pedestrian shopping mall, which would be located above the underground bus terminal, was also added in this plan. The complex would include 28,000 windows and more than of structural steel, according to the builders. It would cost $250 million. For the first time, a scale rendering of the proposed complex was presented to the public. The rendering was much criticized, with some taking issue with details or general dimensions of the as-yet-unconfirmed proposal, and others lambasting the location of the tall skyscrapers around the plaza. Daniel Okrent writes that \\"almost everyone\\" hated the updated plans. The renowned architectural scholar Lewis Mumford went into exile in upstate New York specifically because the \\"weakly conceived, reckless, romantic chaos\\" of the plans for Rockefeller Center had violated his sense of style. Mumford's commentary provoked a wave of blunt, negative criticism from private citizens; newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune; and architects, including both Frank Lloyd Wright and Ralph Adams Cram, whose styles were diametrically opposed to each other. The New York Times took note of the \\"universal condemnation\\" of the proposal, and after the complex's architects changed their plans in response to the criticism, the Times stated, \\"It is cheering to learn that the architects and builders of Radio City have been stirred by the public criticism of their plans.\\" Despite the controversy over the complex's design, Rockefeller retained the Associated Architects for his project.  Updated retail building and garden plans  The oval- shaped retail building on Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets was criticized for not fitting in with the rest of Fifth Avenue's architecture, with critics referring to the proposed building as an \\"oilcan\\". The original plan had been for two retail buildings, but was changed to one in response to Chase National Bank's request for a single building. However, the oval building was scrapped in early 1931, after Chase could not win exclusive banking rights at the building's location. An updated plan, F-19, restored two smaller 6-story retail buildings to the site of the oval building, and proposed a new 40-story tower for a nearby site. These buildings not only would provide retail space but also would fit in with Fifth Avenue's architecture. In the new plan, an oval-shaped central plaza would be recessed below ground level, with plantings surrounding a large central fountain. A wide, planted esplanade, between 50th and 51st streets, would lead pedestrians from Fifth Avenue, on the east, to the plaza and to the RCA Building to the west, with steps leading down to the plaza. The western side of the plaza would lead directly to the underground pedestrian mall. A replica of Niagara Falls' Horseshoe Falls would also be built above a reflecting pool, while ivy would be planted on the outside of some of the buildings. In a June 1932 revision to the plan, the proposed plaza's shape was changed to a rectangle, and the fountain was moved to the western side of the plaza. The sculptor Paul Manship was then hired to create a sculpture to place on top of the fountain; his bronze Prometheus statue was installed on the site in 1934. As a concession for the loss of the rooftop gardens planned for the oval building, Hood suggested that all of the complex's setbacks below the 16th floor be covered with gardens. Hood thought this was the cheapest way to make the buildings look attractive, with a cost estimate of $250,000 to $500,000 (about $ to $ million in ) that could pay for itself if the gardens were made into botanical gardens. Hood proposed a three-tiered arrangement, inspired by a similar plan of Le Corbusier. The lowest tier would be at ground level; the middle tier would be atop the retail buildings' low-lying roofs and the skyscrapers' setbacks; and the highest tier would be at the tops of the skyscrapers. A March 1932 update to the rooftop garden proposal also included two ornately decorated bridges that would connect the complex's three blocks, though the bridge plan was later dismissed due to its high cost. Ultimately, only seven disconnected gardens would be built. Since American tenants were reluctant to rent in the retail buildings, Rockefeller Center's manager Hugh Robertson, formerly of Todd, Robertson and Todd, suggested foreign tenants for the buildings. They held talks with prospective Czech, German, Italian, and Swedish lessees who could potentially occupy the six-story internationally themed buildings on Fifth Avenue, although it was reported that Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian tenancies were also considered. The first themed building that was agreed on was the British Empire Building, the more southerly of the two buildings, which would host governmental and commercial ventures of the United Kingdom. In February 1932, French tenants agreed to occupy the British Empire Building's twin to the north, La Maison Fran√ßaise. A department store and 30-story building (later changed to 45 stories) were planned for the block to the north of the twin buildings, between 50th and 51st streets, with the department store portion facing Fifth Avenue. A \\"final\\" layout change to that block occurred in June, when the department store was replaced by the tower's two retail wings, which would be nearly identical to the twin retail buildings to their south. The two new retail buildings, connected to each other, and to the main tower, with a galleria, were proposed to serve Italian, and possibly also German, interests upon completion.  Theaters  Out of the four theaters included in plan , of March 1930, the city only approved the construction of two; and thus, only these two theaters were constructed. Samuel \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel, a successful theater operator who was renowned for his dominance of the city's theater industry, joined the center's advisory board in 1930. He offered to build two theaters: a large, vaudeville \\"International Music Hall\\", on the northernmost block, with more than 6,200 seats; and the smaller, 3,500-seat \\"RKO Roxy\\" movie theater on the southernmost block. The idea for these theaters was inspired by Roxy's failed expansion of the 5,920-seat Roxy Theatre on 50th Street, one-and-a-half blocks away. Roxy also envisioned an elevated promenade between the two theaters, but this was never published in any of the official blueprints. Meanwhile, proposals for a Metropolitan Opera House on the site persisted. Official plans for a facility to the east of the RKO Roxy were filed in April 1932; the projected 4,042-seat opera facility would contain features such as a second- floor esplanade extending across 50th Street. However, the Met was unable to fund such a move, so the proposed new opera house was relegated to tentative status. In September 1931, a group of NBC managers and architects toured Europe to find performers and look at theater designs. However, the group did not find any significant architectural details that they could use in the Radio City theaters. In any case, Roxy's friend Peter B. Clark turned out to have much more innovative designs for the proposed theaters than the Europeans did. The Music Hall was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone and interior designer Donald Deskey in the Art Deco style. Eugene Schoen was selected to design the RKO Roxy.  Pedestrian mall  In December 1931, the Rockefeller Center Corporation put forth its expanded plans for the underground pedestrian mall. It would now include a series of people mover tunnels, similar to the U.S. Capitol subway, which would link the complex to locations such as Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station. A smaller, scaled- down version of the plan was submitted to the New York City Board of Estimate in October 1933. The plan included two vehicular tunnels to carry 49th and 50th streets underneath the entire complex, as well as a subterranean pedestrian mall connecting the buildings in the complex. Additionally, a system of pedestrian passages would be located underground, and a sunken lower plaza would connect to the mall via a wide concourse under the RCA Building. The complex-wide vehicular tunnels were not built; instead, a truck ramp from ground level to the underground delivery rooms was built at 50th Street.  Unbuilt Metropolitan Avenue  An unfulfilled revision to the plan was submitted in May 1931, when Benjamin Wistar Morris, the architect of the original Opera proposal, proposed enhancing the complex's private passageway into a public \\"Metropolitan Avenue\\", which would run from 42nd to 59th streets. The avenue would break up the distance between Fifth and Sixth avenues, which was the longest gap between two numbered avenues in Manhattan. This was not a new proposal, as Mayor William Jay Gaynor had posited a similar avenue from 34th to 59th Streets in 1910, and Wistar himself had proposed the avenue in 1928 or 1929. If built, Metropolitan Avenue would have facilitated traffic through Rockefeller Center, in a manner similar to how Vanderbilt Avenue between Madison and Park Avenues had assisted traffic flow around nearby Grand Central Terminal. Ultimately, only the section between 48th and 51st streets was built; it now comprises Rockefeller Plaza, a pedestrian street. = Art program = Prometheus, one of the works created as part of Rockefeller Center's art program Both Raymond Hood and John Todd believed that the center needed visual enhancement besides the rooftop gardens. Initially, Todd had only planned to allocate about $150,000 toward the building's art program, but Rockefeller wanted artworks that had meaningful purposes rather than purely aesthetic ones. In November 1931, Todd suggested the creation of a program for placing distinctive artworks within each of the buildings. Hartley Burr Alexander, a noted mythology and symbology professor, was tasked with planning the complex's arts installations. Alexander submitted his plan for the site's artwork in December 1932. As part of the proposal, the complex would have a variety of sculptures, statues, murals, friezes, decorative fountains, and mosaics. Expanding upon Hood's setback-garden plan, Alexander's proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings, which would create a \\"Babylonian garden\\" when viewed from above. At first, Alexander suggested \\"Homo faber, Man the Maker\\" as the complex's overarching theme, representing satisfaction with one's occupation rather than with the wage. However, that theme was not particularly well received by the architects, so Alexander proposed another theme, the \\"New Frontiers\\"; this theme dealt with social and scientific innovations and represented the challenges that humanity faced \\"after the conquest of the physical world\\". In theory, this was considered a fitting theme, but Alexander had been so specific about the details of the necessary artworks that it limited the creative license for any artists who would execute such works. Alexander had created a 32-page paper that explained exactly what needed to be done for each artwork, with some of the key themes underlined in all caps, giving the paper \\"a tone more Martian than human\\", according to Okrent. In March 1932, Alexander was fired and replaced with a panel of five artists. The panel agreed on the current theme, \\"The March of Civilization\\", but by that point some of the art of previous themes had already been commissioned, including the works that Alexander had proposed. The process of commissioning art for Rockefeller Center was complicated. Each building's architects would suggest some artwork. Todd would eliminate all of the unconventional proposals, and Rockefeller had the final say on many of the works. There were many locations that needed art commissioned, which prevented any specific artistic style from dominating the complex. Specialists from around the world were retained for the art program: for instance, Edward Trumbull coordinated the colors of the works located inside the buildings, and L√©on-Victor Solon did the same job for the exterior pieces. Gaston Lachaise, a renowned painter of female nudes, executed the commission for six uncontroversial bas-reliefs for Rockefeller Center, four at the front of 1230 Avenue of the Americas (RCA Building West) and two at the back of the International Building. The Prometheus, Youth, and Maiden sculptures that Paul Manship had created for the complex were prominently situated in the complex's lower plaza. Barry Faulkner had only one commission for the entirety of Rockefeller Center: a mosaic mural located above the entrance of 1230 Avenue of the Americas. Alfred Janniot also created a single work for Rockefeller Center, the bronze panel outside La Maison Francaise's entrance. Lee Lawrie was by far the complex's most prolific artist, with 12 works. Most of Lawrie's commissions were limestone screens above the main entrances of buildings, but he had also created two of Rockefeller Center's best-known artworks: the Atlas statue in the International Building's courtyard, and the Wisdom screen above the RCA Building's main entrance. Ezra Winter, who created the \\"Quest for the Fountains of Eternal Youth\\" mural in Radio City Music Hall's lobby, largely adhered to Alexander's original specifications for the mural. One of the center's more controversial works was created by Diego Rivera, whom Nelson Rockefeller had hired to create a color fresco for the wall in the RCA Building's lobby. His painting, Man at the Crossroads, became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes and a clear portrait of Lenin, which had not been apparent in initial sketches (see .) Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, but Rivera refused, so in mid-1933, Rivera was paid for his commission and workers covered the mural with paper. The fresco was demolished completely in February 1934, and it was subsequently replaced by Josep Maria Sert's American Progress mural. As a result of the Man at the Crossroads controversy, Nelson scaled back his involvement with the complex's art, and his father began scrutinizing all of the artworks thereafter commissioned for the center. One of the sculptor Attilio Piccirilli's works at Rockefeller Center would also be contested, albeit not until after the complex was finished. He had created bas-relief carvings above the entrances of Palazzo d'Italia and the International Building North. Piccirilli's relief on the Palazzo d'Italia was removed in 1941 because the panels were seen as an overt celebration of fascism, but his International Building North panels were allowed to remain. = Change in name = During early planning, the development was often referred to as \\"Radio City\\". Before the announcement that the development would include a mass media complex, there were also other appellations such as \\"Rockefeller City\\" and \\"Metropolitan Square\\" (after the Metropolitan Square Corporation). Ivy Lee suggested changing the name to \\"Rockefeller Center\\". John Rockefeller Jr. initially did not want the Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. The name was formally changed in December 1931. Rockefeller Jr. and The New York Times originally spelled the complex as \\"Rockefeller Centre\\", which was the British way of spelling \\"Center\\". After consultation with the famed lexicographer Frank H. Vizetelly, \\"Centre\\" was changed to \\"Center\\". Over time, the appellation of \\"Radio City\\" devolved from describing the entire complex to just the complex's western section; and by 1937, only the Radio City Music Hall contained the \\"Radio City\\" name.  Construction progress  According to Daniel Okrent, most sources estimated that between 40,000 and 60,000 people were hired during construction. One estimate by Raymond Fosdick, the Rockefeller Foundation head, placed the figure at 225,000 people, including workers who created materials for the complex elsewhere. When construction started, the city was feeling the full effects of the Depression, with over 750,000 people unemployed and 64% of all construction workers without a job. At the Depression's peak in the mid-1930s, John Rockefeller Jr. was praised as a job creator and a \\"patriot\\" for jump-starting the city's economy with the construction project. Rockefeller made an effort to form amicable relationships with Rockefeller Center's workers. Even when Rockefeller had to reduce wages for his union workers, he was praised for not reducing wages as severely as did other construction firms, many of which were either struggling or going bankrupt. At the time, the complex was the largest private building project ever undertaken. Carol Herselle Krinsky, in her 1978 book, describes the center as \\"the only large private permanent construction project planned and executed between the start of the Depression and the end of the Second World War\\". = Land acquisition and clearing = For the project, 228 buildings on the site were razed and some 4,000 tenants relocated, with the estimated aggregate worth of the property exceeding $7 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). Rockefeller achieved this by buying existing leases from the tenants. In January 1929, William A. White & Sons was hired to conduct the eviction proceedings. They worked with the law firm of Murray, Aldrich & Webb to give checks to tenants in exchange for property, sometimes for over $1 million. The area was mostly occupied by illegal speakeasy bars, as the Prohibition Era had banned all sales of alcoholic beverages. Although the more tenuous of these speakeasies quickly moved elsewhere at the mere mention of formal eviction proceedings, other tenants, including some of the brothels, were harder to evict. Many tenants only moved on certain conditions; and in one case, the firms acquired a lease from the estate of the late gambler Arnold Rothstein, who was murdered two months before he was set to be forcefully evicted from his Upper Estate building in January 1929. Demolition of the structures started in early 1930, and all of the buildings' leases had been bought by August 1931. The center's managers then set to acquire the remaining lots along Sixth Avenue, and at the southeast corner of the site, so that they could create a larger complex, which led to the formation of the Underel Corporation. The negotiations for the Sixth Avenue properties were conducted by different brokers and law firms so as to conceal the Rockefeller family's involvement in the Underel Corporation's acquisitions. Even so, there were several tenants along Sixth Avenue who initially refused to give up their buildings. In total, Charles Heydt spent $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ) on acquiring the Sixth Avenue parcels, as compared to the $6 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) budgeted for the task. The tenants of two Sixth Avenue properties were ultimately allowed to stay. One lessee, who occupied a plot on the southeast corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, never received a sale offer due to a misunderstanding. The owners of the other parcel, located on the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and 49th Street, demanded an exorbitant price for their property. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was ultimately built around both parcels. On the southeast corner of the site, several property owners also refused to sell. Columbia University was willing to give Rockefeller Center Inc. control of all leases in the former Upper Estate that were no longer held by a third party. However, William Nelson Cromwell, a prominent lawyer and Columbia alumnus, who owned three adjacent row houses at 10‚Äì14 West 49th Street, would not move out of his house when his lease expired in 1927. The disagreement continued until 1936, during which time Cromwell refused to pay rent on 14 West 49th Street, while Rockefeller Center Inc. withheld $400,000 of Cromwell's rent payments to Columbia. Rockefeller Center Inc. would later buy 8 West 49th, thus boxing Cromwell's land in between the two Rockefeller Center parcels. The company allowed Robert Walton Goelet to keep the neighboring lot at 2‚Äì6 West 49th Street because the company considered his \\"interest and concern\\" to be a \\"large concern\\". However, he could not develop the land because Cromwell controlled an easement over part of Goelet's land, and the lots at 2‚Äì6 West 49th Street would be developed in 1932 as a commercial building called 608 Fifth Avenue. The St. Nicholas Church, located on 48th Street behind Goelet's lot, also refused to sell its property despite an offer of up to $7 million for the parcel. = Late 1931: start of construction = Excavation of the Sixth Avenue side of the plot began in late July 1931, commencing a seven-year period of excavation during which of the underlying Manhattan schist would be removed from the site. By late 1931, the empty blocks were pits up to , with a few buildings still standing at the edges of each block. 49th and 50th streets resembled \\"causeways skimming the surface of a lake\\". A field office for the project was erected on Fifth Avenue. It served as the headquarters for the main construction contractors Todd & Brown, which was composed of John Todd's son Webster as well as Joseph O. Brown. Brown was especially involved in eliminating unnecessary costs and selecting firms for supplies. Designs for the RCA Building and International Music Hall, to the north, were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings in August 1931, with both buildings scheduled to open in 1932. The contracts for the music hall and 66-story skyscraper were awarded two months later. Ultimately, the project's managers would submit 1,860 contracts to the Department of Buildings. Rockefeller Center's construction progressed quickly; by October 1931, sixty percent of the digging was complete and the first contracts for the buildings had been let. The foundations had been dug up to below ground, and the first of the RCA Building's 86 piers, descending a maximum of , had been set. Of the brownstones on site, 177 had been demolished by that October, with the majority of the remaining buildings located near the avenues. Work on the new Roxy Theatre, to the south of the RCA Building, started that November. The architects wanted a uniform color for the facades of all 14 of the new buildings. To that end, Raymond Hood, in December 1931, awarded a contract for Indiana Limestone that would make up the facades. At the time, it was the largest order of stone in history, with about of limestone being shipped. Rockefeller Center's managers also ordered of structural steel, the largest such order in history, which cost one-eighth of the projected $250 million total construction cost. The steel order involved a bidding war between Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel. The order ultimately went to U.S. Steel, providing 8,000 jobs for its workers, but resulting in a financial loss, as the bidding war resulted in a price that was too low to cover the cost of making the steel. Rockefeller Center also required nearly 23 acres () of glass for its windows, 25,000 doors, and of granite. As a result of the Depression, building costs were cheaper than projected. Although Metropolitan Life's loan of $126 million remained the same, the final cost of the first ten buildings came to $102 million (equivalent to $ billion in dollars) by the time these structures were completed in 1935. John Todd used the surplus to install extra features in the buildings, such as wider-than-normal utility pipes, a subterranean boiler for the complex in case the steam system malfunctioned, and the complex's limestone facades. Todd even installed sprinklers on the exteriors of the Fifth Avenue retail buildings in case they needed to be converted into factories, since sprinklers were required on industrial buildings at the time. However, not all of the effects were positive: the construction boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s had almost doubled the total amount of real estate in Manhattan, and the construction of Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building would increase the amount of space by another 56%. As a result, there was a lot of undervalued, vacant space. After RKO's bankruptcy in 1931, Sarnoff convinced John Rockefeller Jr. to buy RKO common stock and RCA preferred stock worth a total of $4 million (equivalent to $ million in ), in return for RCA downsizing its lease by . = 1932‚Äì1933 = Work on the steel structure of the RCA Building started in March 1932. Meanwhile, the British and French governments had already agreed to occupy the first two internationally themed buildings, and John Rockefeller Jr. started signing tenants from the respective countries. The cornerstone of the British Empire Building was laid in June, when Francis Hopwood, 1st Baron Southborough, placed the symbolic first stone in a ceremony. Significant progress on the theaters had been made by then: RKO Roxy's brickwork had been completed and the limestone-and-granite facade was almost ready to be installed, while the Music Hall's steelwork was complete. By September, both theaters were almost finished, as was the RCA Building, whose structural steel was up to the 64th floor. That month also saw the opening of the RKO Building, the first structure in the complex to be opened. The British Empire Building's structural steel started construction in October. The Music Hall was the second site to open, on December 27, 1932, although it had topped out in August. This was followed by the RKO Roxy's opening two days later. Roxy originally intended to use the Music Hall as a vaudeville theater, but the opening of the Music Hall was widely regarded as a flop, and both theaters ended up being used for films and performing arts. Radio City's Roxy Theatre had to be renamed the Center Theatre in May 1933 after a lawsuit by William Fox, who owned the original Roxy Theatre on 50th Street. The failure of the vaudeville theater ended up ruining Roxy's enterprise, and he was forced to resign from the center's management in January 1934. The cornerstone of La Maison Francaise was laid on April 29, 1933, by former French prime minister √âdouard Herriot. The British Empire Building was open less than a week later. The RCA Building was slated to be open by May 1, but was delayed because of controversy over the Man at the Crossroads mural in the lobby. In July 1933, the managers opened a 70th-story observation deck atop the RCA Building, It was a great success: the 40-cents-per-head observation deck saw 1,300 daily visitors by late 1935. Work on the rooftop gardens started in October 1933, and La Maison Francaise opened the same month. In December 1933, workers erected the complex's famed Christmas tree in the center of the plaza for the first time. Since then, it has been a yearly tradition to display a large Christmas tree at the plaza between November and January. Simultaneously, the city built the part of the canceled \\"Metropolitan Avenue\\" that ran through Rockefeller Center. The new street, called \\"Rockefeller Plaza\\", was projected to carry an estimated 7,000 vehicles per day upon opening. The first segment, between 49th and 50th streets, opened in 1933, and a northern extension opened in 1934. The new street measured over wide and ran through the complex, with four vehicular levels. = Advertising and leasing efforts = From 1931 until 1944, Rockefeller Center Inc. employed Merle Crowell, the former editor of American Magazine, as the complex's publicist. His first press release, published on July 25, 1931, extolled Rockefeller Center as \\"the largest building project ever undertaken by private capital\\". Thereafter, Crowell supplanted Ivy Lee as the complex's official publicity manager, and his subsequent releases employed a variety of superlatives, massive amounts of statistics and calculations, and the occasional bit of hyperbole. Crowell published many new press releases every day, and by the midpoint of the complex's construction in 1935, he also started staging celebrity appearances, news stories, and exhibitions at Rockefeller Center. The goal was for Rockefeller Center to accommodate 34,500 workers and 180,700 daily visitors once it was completed. Rockefeller hired Hugh Sterling Robertson to solicit tenants and secure lease agreements. It was hard to lease the complex in the wake of the Great Depression, but Robertson managed to identify 1,700 potential tenants, and had held meetings with 1,200 of them by the end of 1933. Rockefeller and his partners were also able to entice some prominent tenants to the center. The Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company moved into the RCA Building in 1934. Over the next two years, several other major oil companies followed suit and took up leases in Midtown buildings, including Sinclair Oil and Royal Dutch Shell, which moved into Rockefeller Center. The United States Post Office Department opened a facility in the complex in early 1934, and would later rent space in the as-yet-incomplete International Building. The New York Museum of Science and Industry leased some of the less- sought-after space on the RCA Building's lower floors after Nelson Rockefeller became a trustee of the museum in late 1935. Westinghouse moved into the 14th through 17th floors of the RCA Building. However, Rockefeller Center's managers had a hard time leasing the buildings past 60% occupancy during the earliest years of its existence, which coincided with the middle of the Depression. The Rockefeller family moved into various floors and suites throughout the same building in order to give potential tenants the impression of occupancy. In particular, the family's office took up the entire 56th floor, while the family's Rockefeller Foundation took up the entire floor below, and two other organizations supported by the Rockefellers also moved into the building. Because the sunken central plaza was mostly leased by luxury stores, the complex's managers opened an outdoor restaurant in the plaza in early 1934 to attract other customers. The complex's willingness to gain leases at almost any cost had repercussions of its own. In January 1934, August Heckscher filed a $10,000,000 lawsuit against Rockefeller Center Inc. for convincing tenants to abandon their ongoing leases within his properties in order to take up cheaper leases at Rockefeller Center. The lawsuit stalled in courts until Heckscher's death in 1941, when it was dismissed. 47th‚Äì50th Streets‚ÄìRockefeller Center station, built by the Independent Subway System (IND) at Sixth Avenue The managers of Rockefeller Center Inc. also wanted the complex to have convenient, nearby mass transit to attract potential lessees. The city-operated Independent Subway System (IND) had opened a subway station at Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street in 1933, drawing workers from Queens. The managers, seeing the success of the business districts around Penn Station and Grand Central, proposed a large rail terminal for trains from Bergen County, New Jersey, so workers from northern New Jersey would be drawn to the complex. Although the managers did decide on a possible location for the terminal on 50th Street, this plan did not work because the IND subway still did not have any stops at the complex itself. The consultants then offered a subway shuttle under 50th Street that would connect to the IND subway station at Eighth Avenue, or a rail line connecting to Penn Station and Grand Central. This plan did not work because the city was uninterested in building the new rail line. The plan was formally dropped in 1934, but proposals for similar ideas persisted until 1939. The city also had plans to construct a line under Sixth Avenue to supplant the elevated railway there, but did not start construction on the Sixth Avenue subway until 1936. Since the IND would be constructing a station at 47th‚Äì50th Streets, near the complex, Rockefeller Center's managers also wished to build their own connections to Penn Station and Grand Central using the subway tunnels that were being constructed. However, this proposal was declined because it would require extensive rezoning of the surrounding residential area. An extension of Rockefeller Plaza northward to the Rockefeller Apartments at 53rd Street was also envisioned in early 1934, with Rockefeller Center's managers, between October 1934 and late 1937, acquiring land for the proposed street. Rockefeller legally condemned some of the buildings he acquired for the planned street expansion. The street was never extended for various reasons. = 1934‚Äì1936 = By July 1934, the complex had leased 80% of the available space in the six buildings that were already opened. The lower plaza's large Prometheus statue had been installed in January that year. The complex's underground delivery ramps, located on 50th Street under the present-day Associated Press Building, were completed in May. The ramps, a vestige of the tunnels originally planned for 49th and 50th streets, traveled underground and stretched for . By the end of the year, Wallace Harrison was the lead architect; Andrew Reinhard was in charge of floor plans for tenants; and Henry Hofmeister was tasked with planning the locations of the remaining unbuilt buildings' utilities and structural framework. Raymond Hood had died, while Harvey Corbett had moved on to other projects. Frederick A. Godley and J. Andr√© Fouilhoux of Hood, Godley & Fouilhoux, as well as William H. MacMurray of Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, never had much to do with Rockefeller Center's development. In May 1934, plans were officially filed for the remaining two International-themed buildings, as well as the larger 38-story, International Building at 45 Rockefeller Center. Work on the buildings started in September 1934. The more southerly of the retail buildings was dubbed \\"Palazzo d'Italia\\" and was to serve Italian interests. The Italian government later reneged on its sponsorship of the building, and the task of finding tenants went to Italian-American businesses. The more northerly small building was originally proposed for German occupation under the name \\"Deutsches Haus\\" before Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1932. Rockefeller ruled this out in September 1933, after being advised of Hitler's Nazi march toward totalitarianism. Russia had also entered into negotiations to lease the final building in 1934; but by 1935, the Russians were no longer actively seeking a lease. With no definite tenant for the other building, the Rockefeller Center's managers reduced the proposed nine-story buildings to six stories, enlarged and realigned the main building from a north‚Äìsouth to a west‚Äìeast axis, and replaced the proposed galleria between the two retail buildings with an expansion of the International Building's lobby. The empty office site thus became \\"International Building North\\", rented by various international tenants. In April 1935, developers opened the International Building and its two wings, which had been built in a record 136 days, from groundbreaking to completion. Aside from the averted controversy with the potential German tenants, the internationally themed complex was seen as a symbol of solidarity during the interwar period, when the United States' entry in the League of Nations was obstructed by American isolationists. By late April 1935, the \\"Gardens of the Nations\\" on the RCA Building's 11th-story roof was complete. Upon opening, its collection of exotic flora attracted many visitors, and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center. However, this novelty soon faded, and the gardens started running a $45,000-per-year deficit by 1937 ($ in dollars) due to the massive expense involved in hoisting plants, trees, and water to the roofs, as well as a lack of interest among tourists. Gardens on the roofs of the two theaters would also be installed in 1937, but they were not open to the public. The underground pedestrian mall and ramp system, connecting the three blocks between 48th and 51st streets, was finished in early May. At the time of the mall's opening, 22 of the 25 retail spaces had been leased, and three more buildings were ready for occupancy that month. The underground concourse contained a post office, payphones, and several public restrooms. The complex was starting to attract large crowds of visitors, especially to Radio City Music Hall or one of the other exhibition and performance spaces. Despite this seeming success in the face of the Depression, construction was considered to be behind schedule: all the buildings had originally been set for completion by mid-1935, yet the central parts of the northern and southern blocks were still undeveloped. Around this time, Rockefeller Center's managers were selling the lots for their failed Rockefeller Plaza extension. In January 1935, newly elected mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia proposed that a Municipal Art Center be built in or near the Rockefeller complex. It would have contained the Museum of Modern Art; the Guggenheim Collection; a costume museum; or broadcasting facilities for the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Initially, the project was supposed to be located in Central Park. However, due to legal challenges, the site for the planned art center was moved several blocks south to a site between 51st and 53rd streets between Fifth and Sixth avenues, immediately north of Rockefeller Center. In October 1936, the Museum of Modern Art acquired a site on 53rd Street, across the street from the Municipal Art Center site. Several plans for an art center were discussed, but none were executed because of the same complications that befell the aborted Rockefeller Plaza extension. Also in 1935, plans were filed for a 16-story western extension of the RCA Building, made of the same material but with extensive links to the pedestrian tunnel system and an elaborate entrance from the under-construction IND station at 47th‚Äì50th streets. The subway connection started construction in 1936 but would not open until 1940. Until the subway connection opened, the underground shopping mall was an elaborate catacomb that dead-ended on all sides. The retail space on the lower plaza was not profitable because the stores in the plaza were hidden underneath the rest of the buildings and behind the Prometheus statue, which made the shops hard for tourists to find. By 1935, there were ten times as many workers entering the RCA Building every day as there were visitors to the lower plaza. After several rejected suggestions to beautify the plaza, the managers finally decided on building the Rink at Rockefeller Center for $2,000 after Nelson Rockefeller found that a new system had been invented that allowed artificial outdoor ice skating, enabling him to bring the pastime to Midtown Manhattan. The new rink was open by Christmas 1936. The rink was originally intended as a \\"temporary\\" measure, but it became popular, and so it was kept.  Completion  Construction progress in 1937, as seen from the east. Most of the original complex was completed, but a parking lot can be seen in the center left on the site of the future 10 Rockefeller Plaza, and the construction of 50 Rockefeller Plaza can be seen in the center right. By 1936, ten buildings had been built and about 80% of the existing space had been rented. The buildings, constituting the first phase of construction, were the International Building; the four small retail buildings; the RKO Building; the Center Theatre; the Music Hall; the RCA Building; and the RCA Building's western extension. The total investment in the center up to that point had been about $104.6 million (about $ billion in dollars), which was composed of $60 million of John Rockefeller Jr.'s money and $44.6 million from Metropolitan Life. = Developing the remaining empty lots = Rockefeller Center Inc. needed to develop the remaining empty lots of the northern and southern blocks. Notably, the southern plot was being used as a parking lot, and at the time, it was the city's largest parking facility. In 1936, Time Inc. expressed interest in moving out of their Chrysler Building offices into a larger headquarters, having just launched their Life magazine. Rockefeller Center's managers persuaded Time to move to a proposed skyscraper on part of the southern empty lot, located on Rockefeller Plaza between 48th and 49th streets. The steelwork for that building was begun on September 25, 1936, and was complete by November 28, forty-three working days later. The 36-story Time & Life Building, as it was known, opened on April 1, 1937, along with the final block of Rockefeller Plaza abutting the building, between 48th and 49th streets. Rockefeller Center's executives had talks with the Associated Press for a building on the northern empty lot, which was occupied by the complex's truck delivery ramp. The lot had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, but the managers could not wait anymore to develop the lot, and in 1937, the opera plans were formally scrapped. The lot had also been planned as a hotel site, but this was also deemed economically infeasible. In January 1938, the Associated Press agreed to rent four floors within the structure at 50 Rockefeller Plaza. In exchange, the building would be renamed for the company. Construction of the steelwork started in April 1938; after 29 working days, the 15-story structure was topped out on June 16. The Associated Press moved into 50 Rockefeller Plaza in December. The presence of the Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio- communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. In 1938, the Associated Press opened the Guild, a newsreel theater, along the curve of the truck ramp below the building. It was impossible to build any smaller buildings in the remainder of the complex, since the demands of tenants stipulated larger buildings. Additionally, it was no longer viable to build a system of rooftop gardens because the 15-story Associated Press Building was much taller than the 7- to 11-story-high gardens on the rest of the buildings, making it extremely hard to create a system of gardens without the use of extraordinarily steep bridges. The final plot on the southernmost block needed to be developed, and several tenants were being considered. In early 1937, the center's managers approached the Dutch government for a possible 16-story \\"Holland House\\" on the eastern part of the plot. The Dutch government did not enter into the agreement because of troubles domestically, most notably the social unrest that preceded Hitler's 1940 invasion of the Netherlands. However, the Rockefeller Center's managers were already in negotiations with Eastern Air Lines. Despite the lack of a definite tenant, the excavation of the 16-story structure at 10 Rockefeller Plaza started in October 1938, and the building was topped out by April 1939. Eastern Air Lines' CEO, Eddie Rickenbacker, did not sign a lease until June 1940. At that time, 10 Rockefeller Plaza was renamed the \\"Eastern Air Lines Building\\". = Change in leadership = The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction.Referenced in and . For the articles themselves, see: At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York. Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza. A viewing platform was set up on the east side of Rockefeller Center, and the facetious \\"Sidewalk Superintendents' Club\\" was founded so the public could view construction, with cards being issued to club members. = Final building = The U.S. Rubber Company Building (now Simon & Schuster Building), the last building in the original complex to be built The western half of the southern plot was still undeveloped due to perceived negative effects of the Sixth Avenue elevated. (The elevated line was closed in early December 1938, to be replaced by the IND Sixth Avenue subway, and was razed the next year.) Ultimately, the United States Rubber Company was convinced to move from their headquarters at Columbus Circle to the proposed 1230 Avenue of the Americas building at Rockefeller Center. The company leased eleven floors in the new building, a decrease of from the 12 stories that they leased at 1790 Broadway. The U.S. Rubber Company Building had been planned as a mirror of the RKO Building, but this was not possible because the symmetrical structure would have entailed constructing an expensive cantilever over the Center Theatre. Excavation of the U.S. Rubber Company Building site commenced in May 1939. The complex was deemed complete by the end of October 1939. John Rockefeller Jr. installed the building's ceremonial final rivet on November 1, 1939, marking the completion of the original Rockefeller Center complex. The installation of the last rivet was accompanied by a celebratory speech by Rockefeller and many news accounts about the event. 10 Rockefeller Plaza, though, was not officially complete until its dedication in October 1940. Although the Dutch government had initially declined to enter an agreement to occupy 10 Rockefeller Plaza, it moved its offices-in-exile into the building once it opened.  Later construction  After the original complex was finished, Rockefeller started to look for ways to expand, even though the outbreak of World War II stopped almost all civilian construction projects. In 1943, the complex's managers bought land and buildings on three street corners near the complex. Rockefeller Center unveiled plans for expansion to the southwest and north in 1944. At the time, the complex's existing rentable area totaled , with 99.7% of the space being leased. = 1940s and 1950s = Esso was one of the tenants that wanted to expand, and the company signaled that it would build its own office tower if Rockefeller Center's managers did not construct a building for them. In 1944, John Rockefeller Jr. officially approved Esso's proposal to construct a building on land that Rockefeller controlled, located at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza. At first, the managers of the property wanted to build a 16-story, $2 million structure on that property, but Hugh Robertson, the original complex's sole remaining architect, stated that the tower needed to be 36 floors high in order to be profitable. In February 1947, the under- construction Esso Building, at the north end of the existing property, became part of Rockefeller Center after ownership of the building was transferred from the Haswin Corporation to Rockefeller Center, Inc. The 33-story Esso Building was topped out the next month. In 1949, in the face of a shrinking congregation, St. Nicholas Church leased the church building to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, who then leased three contiguous lots from Rockefeller Center for a proposed 28-story building. The Fifth Avenue facade of the new building would have a setback at the 11th floor, and the midblock facade on 49th Street would not block the view from La Maison Francaise across the street, as stipulated by an agreement with Rockefeller Center managers. The church moved out of its plot on Fifth Avenue and 48th Street, and the old church building was subsequently demolished. Construction commenced on 600 Fifth Avenue in 1950, and the tower was completed by 1952. The building was named after the Sinclair Oil Company, which leased eight floors. Although 600 Fifth Avenue was not developed by Rockefeller Center Inc., that company was allowed to dictate the general Art Deco design of the building as part of an agreement with Massachusetts Mutual. In return, Massachusetts Mutual stipulated that the building contain an entrance to Rockefeller Center's underground concourse, and that the leases for William Cromwell's remaining lots be transferred to Rockefeller Center. The small Center Theatre was deemed redundant to Radio City Music Hall, and in its final years, had been used as an NBC and RCA broadcasting space. In 1953, NBC and RCA expanded into the office space in 30 Rockefeller Center that Sinclair had just vacated. After the broadcasting studio was abandoned, the U.S. Rubber Company indicated that it wanted to expand its office building into the space that was occupied by the underused theater. In October 1953, it was announced that the theater would be demolished. During the demolition process, the U.S. Rubber Building was put on temporary stilts, with the offices above the former theater still being occupied during the demolition process. No vestige of the former theater remains, since 1230 Avenue of the Americas' annex occupies the same space as the original building. Time-Life also wanted to expand, as its existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza had become insufficient by 1953. In August of that year, Rockefeller Center Inc. bought a tract of land on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st streets. Rockefeller Center's managers originally wanted to build an extra NBC studio or a Ford vehicle showroom on the site. However, they changed their minds once they saw Time Inc.'s expansion needs: the company wanted to have its headquarters in a single building. As they would outgrow their existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza by 1954, the company would have to move elsewhere. Not wanting to lose Time Inc.'s tenancy, the complex's managers hired Harrison & Abramovitz, composed of Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, to create plans for a building on the newly acquired plot that could house both NBC and Time. NBC later dropped out of the deal because its CEO, David Sarnoff, dissented. In 1956, two years after the demolition of the Center Theatre, officials announced the construction of a new tower, the Time-Life Building, on the western side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. The , $7 million building ($ in dollars) would include connections to the existing passageway system and to the Roxy Theater directly to its west. The tower would rise as a 48-story slab, with a plaza to the east and an eight-story annex along its western and northern sides. One of Rockefeller Center's subsidiaries, Westprop Inc., bought the air rights to the original Roxy Theater located next door so that the new tower could conform to the Zoning Resolution of 1916. Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center formed a joint venture, Rock-Time Inc., which would share the tower's rent income between them. Construction on the Time-Life Building's steelwork started in April 1958, and the structure topped out in November of that year. The cornerstone of the building was laid in June 1959, after the building's structure had been completed, and the first tenants began moving into the tower in December 1959. During this time, plans called for Rockefeller Center to expand northward. Rockefeller Center, Uris Buildings Corporation, and Webb and Knapp formed another joint venture, Rock-Uris Corp., to construct a hotel to the west of 75 Rockefeller Center. However, Webb and Knapp faced monetary shortages, and the joint venture found that a hotel was not the most profitable use of the land. The joint venture instead decided to construct a glass-and-concrete 43-story office building on the site, with connections to the complex's underground concourse. In 1961, the building was named after Sperry Corporation, which leased eight floors in the future building. The planned hotel was moved to another site two blocks north, on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 53rd Streets. This became the New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, which opened in 1963. The hotel's name was misleading because it was located outside the complex and not connected to the underground mall. The mall could not be extended anyway because the 53rd Street subway was in the way. Further expansion of Rockefeller Center on the west side of Sixth Avenue, between the Hilton and the new Time-Life Building, was not possible because the Equitable Life Assurance Society had built a tower in between the two properties. = 1960s and 1970s = The three buildings at 1211‚Äì1251 Avenue of the Americas were opened from 1971 through 1974. In 1963, officials from Esso approached Gustav Eyssell, who had been Rockefeller Center Inc.'s president since Hugh Robertson had stepped down in 1948. Esso proposed that Eyssell approve another building for the company, which had outgrown the space that it already occupied in Rockefeller Center. Eyssell seriously considered the proposal because the complex did not want to lose Esso's tenancy, and because the complex's existing tenants were requesting a combined of extra space. Rockefeller Center's managers re-hired Harrison & Abramovitz to design three new towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue, with one tower on each of the blocks between 47th and 50th Streets. The managers purchased the land for the three proposed buildings in private. Simultaneously, they consulted with large potential tenants, and eventually managed to sign Esso, McGraw-Hill, and Celanese as the main tenants for the buildings. Under the plan, Esso (later renamed Exxon) would move into the northernmost tower at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, while McGraw-Hill would occupy the center tower at 1221, and Celanese would have the southernmost tower at 1211. These were called the \\"XYZ Buildings\\" because the three towers were so similar that their placements could be interchanged. Harrison & Abramowitz's plans were influenced by several design elements. Most importantly, the firm wished to include plazas in front of each of the new Rockefeller Center buildings, drawing from their recent design for the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on the Upper West Side, which contained several buildings around a central plaza. The new Rockefeller Center buildings' front plazas would serve as large gathering spaces, similar to the lower plaza in the original complex. The original Rockefeller Center did not include plazas along Sixth Avenue because the elevated line would have overshadowed these spaces, but now that the Sixth Avenue elevated had been demolished, the new buildings' plazas would add open space to the Sixth Avenue side of the complex. As a bonus, the plazas canceled out the imposing visual effects of the buildings on the avenue's east side, which rose straight up from their property lines and made for a cliff-like effect. Finally, per a 1961 revision to the 1916 Zoning Resolution, the inclusion of public plazas would allow the towers' builders to include more office space in each building. Unlike the old complex, which had to satisfy John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s aesthetic desires, the new towers did not need to be excessively beautiful: the present executives of Rockefeller Center were more concerned with the buildings' functionality. However, the proposed design of the new towers strained relations between Harrison and Nelson Rockefeller. This arose from the media's harsh reviews of the proposed expansion, which was described by one critic as \\"the sinister Stonehenge of economic man\\". There were several impediments to the start of construction. Foremost among them was the fact that the proposed floor area of the new buildings was greater than the amount allowed under the 1961 resolution. The Urban Design Group, a division of the New York City Department of City Planning, suggested that the towers include an enclosed walkway with retail space, as well as a movie theater in one of the buildings. The McGraw- Hill Building was to include a basement planetarium with a dome above ground level, which would be operated by a subsidiary, while the Celanese Building was to contain the theater. Neither of these attractions were actually built: the planetarium space was occupied by a small theater after McGraw-Hill had sold its planetarium subsidiary, while the theater plan was scrapped due to a lack of funding and a decline in the area's theater industry. The start of construction was delayed for several years due to these bureaucratic requests. The city finally approved the project after Rockefeller Center Inc. promised to build the enclosed walkway west of the Celanese Building as well as two parks west of the Exxon and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Plans for the new buildings were announced on a staggered schedule from 1967 to 1970. The Exxon Building was announced in August 1967, followed by the McGraw-Hill Building in November 1967 and the Celanese Building in 1970. Complications arose when William A. Ruben, a resident of 132 West 48th Street who lived on the planned Celanese Building site west of Sixth Avenue, refused to move from his home. He finally agreed to move, in July 1968, when he received compensation of over $22,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The construction process was further hampered by labor strikes. During mid-1969, workers on the Exxon and McGraw-Hill Buildings went on strike. Three years later in July 1972, construction workers at several projects across the city, including the Celanese Building, went on strike for over a month. The Exxon Building, the northernmost of the three towers, was the first building to be completed, in 1971. The 54-story tower had of office space. This was followed by the McGraw-Hill Building, the central tower, in 1973. This 51-story building had of office space. The Celanese Building, the southernmost tower, was the last to open, in 1974. The 45-story building had of office space. After the completion of the final building, the center was spread out across of land and contained around of office space across 19 buildings.

A school was opened in 1902. History In 1895, a ranch known as \\"Cienega\\" was purchased by the Catholic Church from a local rancher by Katharine Drexel, at the prompting of Father Stephan of the Catholic Indian Bureau. It included a building which had been built by Billy Meadows as an intended trading post, but which had never been utilized as such. Three years later the building was remodeled in order to be used by Catholic missionaries as a mission. The land was located six miles outside of Fort Defiance, and about one mile outside the boundaries of the Navajo Reservation. There was initial difficulty in finding personnel willing to staff the mission, but Sister Katharine visited the Cincinnati province of Franciscans in 1897, and they agreed to provide the manpower. The mission became operational in 1898, the first permanent Catholic mission to the Navajo people. Part of the new mission contained a chapel, where the first mass was said in October 1898. In the spring of 1899 a nearby log cabin was turned into a boarding school. A second school was opened in 1902, it originally had 56 students. Concurrently with the school, twelve sisters from the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament arrived in late October 1902, housed in a separate building. The mission, led by Fathers Anselm Weber and Berard Haile published numerous papers on the Navajo language, including dictionaries and grammars.National Park Service 1975, p. 8:1. The site is owned by the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, and now consists of . In addition to the still active mission church, there is a museum on site, displaying Navajo artifacts, as well as items from the early Franciscan presence on the site. Description The mission is approximately 27 x 60 feet, with the length running east to west, and has a gabled shingle roof. There are three doors and three windows on the north side, while the south side there are no doors and four windows; both the east and west sides have a single window. The interior walls were plastered, and the original single room was split into six rooms. It contained four bedrooms, three of which you had to pass through to reach the chapel, which was the largest room, and situated on the west side of the building. In the chapel there were wooden stations of the cross, measuring four inches by two inches, as well as four plain wood kneelers. The chapel was heated by a small wood stove, and there was a small organ in the room next to the chapel, which provided music. There was another larger room on the east end which served as a combination kitchen- dining-living room, as well as a reception area. Legacy Some of the tomes penned by Weber and Haile include Vocabulary of the Navajo Language (1912); Manual of Navaho Grammar (1929); Learning Navajo, a four-volume work penned between 1942-1949; and A Stem Vocabulary of the Navaho Language (1951).

Formed in February 1944 with the 4th Ukrainian Front, the division fought in the Crimean Offensive and received the honorific Perekop for its actions there in April. It spent the next several months as a garrison for Crimea with the Separate Coastal Army but rejoined the 4th Ukrainian Front in August during the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive. Advancing westward, the 76th fought in the Battle of the Dukla Pass, the Moravian-Ostrava Offensive, and the Prague Offensive in late 1944 and 1945. From December 1944 it was part of the 38th Army. The division was disbanded by the 1950s.  World War II  37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II The 76th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command was formed with the 2nd Guards Army of the 4th Ukrainian Front in February 1944. It included the 223rd, 416th, and 447th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments, which had previously been independent. Colonel Mikhail Timofeyev was assigned commander on 18 February, but on 31 March he transferred to become chief of staff of another anti-aircraft artillery division. Colonel Vasily Kharitonovich took command of the division in April, leading it in the Crimean Offensive. For its actions the division was awarded the honorific Perekop on 24 April. In May, the 591st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, another previously independent unit, became the division's fourth regiment. At the same time it transferred to the Separate Coastal Army, which remained in Crimea. In July it moved north, joining the Kiev Military District. Colonel Fyodor Bolbat took command of the division in August. The 76th fought in the capture of Drogobych during the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive in August. During the month the division was directly subordinated to the reformed 4th Ukrainian Front, though it supported the 1st Guards Army as well. It subsequently participated in the Battle of the Dukla Pass, advancing west through the Carpathian Mountains. It was briefly transferred to the 18th Army in November, joining the 38th Army in December. The 76th remained with the latter until the end of the war. In the final months of the war in 1945 the division fought in the Moravian-Ostrava Offensive and the Prague Offensive, ending the war in Prague. Under Bolbat's command, the division claimed 51 enemy aircraft downed, as well as 24 pillboxes, 76 vehicles, and 37 guns destroyed in ground combat. It was credited with suppressing the fire of thirteen enemy mortar and artillery batteries, damaging two tanks, and capturing 120 enemy soldiers, as well as scattering and partially destroying up to three enemy regiments.  Postwar  Bolbat continued to command the division until June 1946, when he was sent to study at higher courses. The division was among those anti-aircraft artillery divisions disbanded without being converted into another unit by the end of the 1950s.

History  The Women of Rock Oral History project was started in December 2014 as a collection of digital video interviews conducted by Smith College Ada Comstock scholar and archivist, Tanya Pearson. The inspiration for the project came from a seminar on censorship in the United States Pearson took while at Smith, where she worked as an assistant archivist at the Sophia Smith Collection while completing an undergraduate degree in American Studies with concentrations in oral history and archives. For the seminar, Pearson wrote about women rockers from the 1990s. During the process she was discouraged at the difficulty of finding widely available information about musicians she needed to find source material on, illustrating the fact that bands like L7 were not covered in detail in rock and roll history. Thematic devices she saw seemed to devalue their music and their musicianship, where the musicians were subject to sexism and tokenism, especially in popular journalism. The project highlights the limitations and bias within music scholarship and journalism. Many of the musicians were also active pre-internet, where press and coverage weren't available online and are not digitized. The project includes written transcripts and is housed at the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College. The scope of the project is to document the influence and history of women in rock and roll, and to bring focus to the unheralded role of women musicians. = Methods = The digital interviews with the musicians is the core focus of the project. Nina Gordon and Louise Post, who make up Veruca Salt, were the first band and musicians that were interviewed. The interviews include biographies of their lives and their work as musicians. A portion of each interview includes what it was like to work as a musician in the time period that they were active as well as their experiences in the current day. As a supplemental part of the project, the Women of Rock Oral History Project has conducted panels and roundtable discussions often with some of the subjects of the interviews to discuss issues of gender gap and challenges women face in the music industry. Pearson has also organized concerts, local shows, and events in support of the grassroots project, which often includes performances by subjects of the oral histories. As part of these performances, another component of the project is addressing gender bias on Wikipedia and its coverage of women and gender non-conforming musicians by holding strategy discussions and Wikipedia editathons. = Funding = The project has been funded by a Rosenthal Fund grant from Smith College and a Helen Gurley Brown Magic Grant awarded to Ada Comstock Scholars.  Collection  The project includes over 20 underrepresented female musicians from various rock and roll and punk music bands that were active from the 1970s to 2010, with some musicians and bands still actively performing music. Bands are listed next to each subject below. Each musician participated in video interviews which were digitized and made available on Vimeo. There are over 29 videos that are part of the project. A corresponding transcription project corresponding to the videos is in process of being created. The timeframe of the project is from December 2014 to the present. The collection is ongoing, with additional video interviews being conducted. Pearson has said that the priority of subjects is on women musicians from the 1960s and 1970s, in an effort to capture their stories before their stories are lost. A book that focuses on the stories of pioneering women musicians in rock is planned.

Built in 1940, it is one of a modest number of bridges surviving in the county that was built with New Deal funding. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Salem Township Bridge is located in rural southwestern Turner County, about west of Hurley. It carries 446th Street, a rural gravel road, across an unnamed stream between United States Route 18 and 285th Avenues. It is a single-arch stone structure, its arches in length. A headwall rises above the arches on each side, about above road grade, and extends into angled wing walls. A stone retaining wall extends south on one side of the structure, giving it a total length of about . It is built out of heavily mortared local quartzite and granite fieldstone. This bridge is one of 180 stone arch bridges built in Turner County as part of a New Deal-era federal jobs program. The county administration was able to build stone bridges at a lower cost than then-conventional steel beam bridges because of the availability of experienced stone workers, and the federal subsidy to the wages they were paid. The county was responsible for supervising the work crews and providing the building materials. This bridge was built in 1940 by a county crew to a standardized state design.

It is the 12th overall episode of the series and is written by Amanda Segel and directed by Brad Anderson. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on January 19, 2012. Plot Reese (Jim Caviezel) finally decides to meet with Detective Carter (Taraji P. Henson), who, by helping him and Finch (Michael Emerson) in their next case, is provided a little insight into what he and Finch do. Their case is Andrea Gutierrez (April Hernandez-Castillo), a self-made attorney who specializes in suing the state of New York on behalf of convicts who claim they were wrongfully imprisoned. Reese and Finch believe the threat to Andrea will be associated with her latest client, Terrence King (Curtiss Cook). King's parole officer, Dominic Galuska (Vito D'Ambrosio), has been setting up convicts to go to prison and profiting off placing their children in foster care. In representing King, Andrea has come to the attention of people who want her silenced. Meanwhile, Reese realizes that, despite trusting his life to Finch, his partner is still keeping secrets from him. He follows Finch to a meeting with Will Ingram (Michael Stahl-David), the son of Finch's previous partner, Nathan Ingram. After Finch bails him out of police custody, Will begins asking questions about his father's death, the nature of his work and his connection to Finch.

Boys' toys and games, as opposed to girls' toys and games, are a subset of toy and games that appeal to male children. Research suggests that this appeal may be driven by biological factors, peer pressure, parental choices, marketing, or tradition. Background Research suggests that there may be some biological predispositions at play that drive toy preferences. Kim Wallen, a psychologist at Yerkes National Primate Research Center, found in her study that male rhesus monkeys played with model dump trucks and other wheeled toys, over plush dolls. Infant boys and girls as young as 9 months old have been found to display stereotypical toy preferences, suggesting that there are biological and environmental factors which appear very early in development. A City, University of London study found that in children aged 9 to 32 months, boys preferred balls and toy cars, and that the preference increased with age. In a 2018 study done by developmental psychologist Lauren Spinner, the effects of images of children playing with stereotypic or counter-stereotypic toys was analyzed on kids age 4 to 7 years old. After the subjects were shown one of the images, they were asked to pick whether a boy or girl would play with a selection of toys such as a baby doll, jet fighter, tool kit, tea set, etc. Children who were shown the counter-stereotypic photos were more open to the idea of boys and girls possibly liking toys usually geared toward the opposite gender. However, seeing the photos did not change the child‚Äôs own opinions about which toys they would select.  Themes  =Machinery and technology= Toys often introduce or reinforce interest in, machinery and technology for boys. These toys can also often blur the lines of the man- machine dichotomy, with action figures that represent males as machines on a range from technologically-enhanced humans to cyborgs to sentient robots. One product line by Revell called Beast Machines even depicted figures which had humanoid heads and torsos, but tanks from the waist down. Tomy's Z-Knights toys introduced terms related to computer technology, in effect of masculinizing them by using humanoid robot characters named like Megahertz, CPU, and Kilabyte (kilobyte). The very popular Transformers line, Power Rangers (American adaptation of Super Sentai) and related media depicted sentient robots, almost all of which were portrayed as male, which could transform into various vehicles and animals. This interaction with machinery persists into adulthood. Cultural phenomenon like car races such as NASCAR promote similar ideas of masculinity, competition, and rough play that the stereotypical boy's toy might also encourage.  In entertainment and advertising  In a study done by sociologist Elizabeth Sweet, the history of toys marketed by gender was analyzed in Sears catalogs from the 20th century. In this study, advertisements published from the 1920s to the 1950s often promoted stereotypical roles of men and women to boys and girls. During the Reagan Administration, the regulations limiting advertisers‚Äô ability to reach children became dismantled. Shows such as My Little Pony and Transformers were created to both entertain and advertise simultaneously ‚Äì a revolutionary change for the toy business. According to professor of education Diane Levin, this pattern for companies escalated so as by December 1985, 9/10 popular children‚Äôs toys were associated with television shows. In 2012, sociologist Carol Auster analyzed Disney‚Äôs retail website and realized toys were specifically listed as ‚Äúgirl‚Äù or ‚Äúboy‚Äù toys. Currently, Disney cross-lists its toys under each section yet less than 23% toys appeared on both lists with the majority cross-listed colors more typically associated with boys perpetuating masculinity as the default of gender-neutral children‚Äôs toys.

Founded in Harlem in the 1960s, the Five-Percent Nation was created by Clarence13X, a former member of the Nation of Islam (NOI) who changed his name to Allah. The group represents individuals comprising the five percent of the population aware of the truth and committed to enlightening the public. The movement recognizes Blacks as the original inhabitants of the Earth and emphasized the importance of obtaining knowledge of self. Adherents emphasize this constantly, referring to their fellow Black men as Gods and Black women as Earths ‚Äî hence establishing the culture's other name as the Nation of Gods and Earths (NGE). Despite drawing heavily from Islam, the Five-Percent Nation is not classified as a religion. This is evident in its idea that God, rather than being separate from man as is traditionally thought in Islam, is a human, specifically a Black man. Instead, the Five-Percent Nation is considered a way of life. Tenets are outlined in the Supreme Mathematics and the Supreme Alphabet, a set of principles established by Allah, the Father. These guides state that Five Percenters can interpret numbers and letters as cultural messages from Allah. Five Percenter teachings lent many frequently used expressions to hip hop and hip hop culture like \\"dropping science,\\" \\"What up God,\\" and \\"word is bond.\\" =Rakim= Rakim, considered to be one of the greatest lyricists of all time, was one of the earliest hip hop artists to incorporate references to Islam into their work. Born William Griffin, he later became a Five Percenter, adopting the name Rakim Allah. In his song ‚ÄúMy Melody,‚Äù with Eric B., Rakim references the Supreme Mathematics and the Supreme Alphabet. ‚ÄúI drop science like a scientist/My melodies in code‚Äù In this verse, he references how Gods and Earths will often refer to themselves as scientists in their quest for knowledge and proof. He then describes how Five Percenters view numbers and letters as code for cultural messages from Allah. =Big Daddy Kane= Big Daddy Kane is also a Five Percenter, having been introduced to the movement in high school. In his song ‚ÄúJust Rhymin‚Äô with Biz,‚Äù he states that the ‚ÄòKane‚Äô in his name stands for King Asiatic, Nobody's Equal, an allusion to the Five Percent Nation's teaching that the Original Man was an Asiatic Black man. His other works are also rife with references to Islam and other Five Percent Nation teachings. For example, the final verse of Big Daddy Kane's 1988 hit ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Half-Steppin‚Äô‚Äù explicitly conveys his connection to Islam. ‚ÄúHold up the peace sign, as salaam alaikum!‚Äù This Arabic phrase, meaning ‚Äúpeace be upon you,‚Äù is commonly used among Muslims as a salutation. Later, his 1989 song ‚ÄúMortal Combat,‚Äù referenced the Supreme Mathematics. Also, in his song 1989 song \\"Young, Gifted, and Black\\" Big Daddy Kane samples a Louis Farrakhan speech. ‚ÄúBeginning to end, from Knowledge to Born‚Äù According to the Supreme Mathematics, Knowledge corresponds to the number one, and Born is represented by the number nine. This then indicates that Big Daddy Kane was cleverly repeating the beginning phrase, ‚Äúbeginning to end,‚Äù using Five Percenter terminology. =Lakim Shabazz= Lakim Shabazz was an MC during the 1980s who derived his name from the Tribe of Shabazz. Lakim Shabazz was significantly influenced by Islam, specifically the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. His raps also reflect this, perhaps most obviously in the song ‚ÄúBlack is Back.‚Äù The song encourages African-Americans to recognize their greatness and fight for freedom, justice and equality, as is emphasized in the following lyrics: ‚ÄúYou say it‚Äôs gonna be hard, but I‚Äôm God, I got the proof and truth, and now it‚Äôs time to get loose.‚Äù Shabazz is stating that his words are the truth, as described by the teachings of the Five Percent Nation. =Afrika Islam= Afrika Islam was a prominent hip hop producer during the 1980s. He trained extensively under Afrika Bambaataa, known as the Godfather of Hip Hop, for numerous years before embarking on his individual career. Like his mentor, Afrika Islam worked heavily with the Zulu Nation, an organization originally developed to use hip hop to stop violence and spread peace. As time passed, the Zulu Nation drew increasingly heavily from the Nation of Islam's teachings, sharing the organization's principles with its members. The 1990s In the early 1990s much of hip hop music became politically charged, afrocentric, and militant in nature. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was praised by artists like Public Enemy while albums by Wu-Tang Clan and Busta Rhymes referenced Five Percent Nation. References to Islam in Hip-Hop music became explicit in the 1990s, and they were almost always characterized by a pairing with a quest for political and social justice. =Busta Rhymes= One of the most influential 90's rappers was Busta Rhymes who in 1990 formed the group Leaders of the New School before later starting his own solo career with the hit single Woo-Hah!! Got You All in Check. He was a New York Jamaican, born in Brooklyn and raised in Long Island where he formed his group and signed a deal with Elektra Records at age 17. Leaders of the New School officially started in 1991 with their debut album A Future Without a Past...; however, they only were able to release one more album T.I.M.E. (The Inner Mind's Eye), before breaking up in 1994. In 2007, Busta decided to release his thoughts on Islam to the press, stating, ‚ÄúI try to really understand every aspect of the Most High. For me, the Most High is Allah. All praises due to Allah, the Lord of all worlds, the greatest, the beneficent, the merciful...I live my life by Islam.‚Äù His song Arab Money, released in 2009, got a lot of negative push-back from the Muslim community for its lyrics about making money in off of oil in Arab countries. He later remixed the song to include lyrics from the Qur'an, which only further offended Muslims who did not believe that verses from the Qur'an should appear in song lyrics, however this decision certainly allowed his music to gain more attention among Muslims. =Ice Cube= Ice Cube was born in Los Angeles where he started a group called C.I.A with a friend and eventually started collaborating with Dr. Dre, with whom he later joined Eazy-E‚Äôs Compton-based group called Niggaz With Attitude (N.W.A), for which his most noteworthy role was lyricist, starting with his writing the song \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" in 1988. He later started his solo debut as AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted where he started to tackle social issues like poverty, racism, and drug addiction, along with general critiques to American society. He started acting in 1991 and has appeared in many films since then. In the early 1990s, Ice Cube converted to Islam, and when asked about his faith he stated, ‚ÄúI mean, what I call myself is a natural Muslim, because it‚Äôs just me and God.‚Äù On his 1991 album Death Certificate, Ice Cube samples excerpts of a speech made by Khalid Muhammad. =Mos Def= Dante Smith was born in Brooklyn, and formed a group with his siblings called Urban Thermo Dynamics and then ventured on his own, becoming part of a hip hop collective with the Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest called ‚ÄúNative Tongues‚Äù. Later he began to work alongside Talib Kweli as Blackstar, and his music took a sociopolitical turn. Sociopolitical hip hop gained a lot of attention in the late 1990s, and in 1999 Mos Def came out with his solo debut album Black on Both Sides. The first words spoken on this album, ‚ÄúBismillah ar-Rahman ar- Raheem\\" translate to \\"In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful.‚Äù His father who was a member of Nation of Islam, and he became a part of the community of Imam Warithdeen Muhammad, son of Elijah Muhammad, the founder of Nation of Islam. \\"I got my first exposure to Islam when I was 13,\\" he said. \\"My dad taught me how to make wudhu [the ritual ablution Muslims perform before prayer].\\" At 19 he took the Muslim declaration of faith, shahada, and Islam became the cornerstone of his life. =Q-Tip= Jonathan Davis was born in Harlem in 1970, and at age 20 in 1990 he converted to Islam and changed his name to Kamaal Ibn John Fareed. Before converting he had been agnostic. He grew up in Queens where he went to school with Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg, and Jarobi White with whom he formed the group A Tribe Called Quest, and their debut album People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm was released in 1990. Kamaal released his debut solo album in 1999. At the end of a Tribe Called Quest's song \\"Phony Rappers\\" there is a sample of a speech made by Iman Siraj Wajjah, a Sunni Muslim man from Brooklyn, NY. =Ali Shaheed Muhammad= Ali Shaheed Muhammad started his career along with Q-Tip in A Tribe Called Quest, later expanding into becoming a DJ and producer and later started his solo career in 2004 with his debut LP Shaheedulah and Stereotypes. ‚ÄúWith regards to Islam, it definitely ‚Äî I mean, I walk a different walk than probably a lot of different people in the industry. I'm not saying it like I'm better. I'm in no way any better or a saint, but there's ‚Äî people can depend on me. They have. They do. And they call me the voice of reason. And I suppose that my faith has something to do with that.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt can rip an artist apart, because then you're under the ridicule of, \\"Aren't you Muslim? Don't you believe in this? What you're doing goes against\\" ‚Äî and it's just like, \\"Yeah, I already know everything you're saying to me.\\" I don't know if anyone else gets that sort of scrutiny so I do understand why people keep it to themselves.‚Äù The 2000s Freeway converted to Islam when he was 14 years old. He says, ‚Äú[Islam], it‚Äôs my core, it‚Äôs my soul, it‚Äôs my everything. He recognizes the conflicting values within the Muslim community, especially those whom believe that making music is haram. Nevertheless, he concedes that this is how he chooses to express himself and acknowledges the various paths of Muslim identity. Beanie Sigel converted to Islam early in his life and came to the faith through his knowledge of the Five Percent Nation. He often references and alludes to his faith within his lyrics, but recognizes conflicting values within their communities. Akon grew up in Senegal and was raised as a Muslim. French Montana is from Morocco and is Muslim. The Jacka is Muslim, and raps about his faith. https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music- news/the-jacka-bay-area-rap-hero-dead-at-37-122557/ References Islam in the United States American hip hop Islamic music ","title":"Islam and hip hop in the United States"},{"id":"55858584","text":"Gibbons High School may refer to: * Cardinal Gibbons High School (disambiguation), several schools with the same name * Gibbons High School, in Petersburg, Virginia, merged into St. Vincent de Paul High School (Petersburg, Virginia) * Notre Dame-Bishop Gibbons High School, Schenectady, New York ","title":"Gibbons High School"},{"id":"55858593","text":"This is a list of Papua New Guinea national rugby league team players. 295 players have represented Papua New Guinea Kumuls since 1975 starring with Kumul # 1 Paul Chue and the latest being Dan Russell in 2019 who is PNG Kumul #295https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/402213/sport-png-kumuls- name-strong-side-to-play-fiji Kumuls register { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" !No.!!Name!!Selected!!Matches -

Much of the West End in the 1820s was an undesirable, swampy, crime-infested area on the outskirts of the city, but Smith with Thomas Cubitt and the Cundy brothers, notablely Thomas Cundy (junior) , envisioned several large-scale development projects that transformed the West End into a thriving part of the city. Although most of Smith's buildings in the now affluent Mayfair district have since been demolished, many of his Belgravia buildings still stand including the pantechnicon from which the name of the van derives from. Smith made his home at Eaton Square in Belgravia, which was part of one of his development projects. He died on 18 June 1860 at the age of 68 in the St George Hanover Square parish of London, and he is buried in West Norwood Cemetery. Residence - 33 Eton Square, Belgravia, London. Family He was the son of Rev. Seth Smith, who was from Warminster, Wiltshire. He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Rose of Paddington, on 7 March 1815.

She has written several plays but is known mostly for her mystery novels Trick of the Eye, The Witches' Hammer, Social Crimes, One Dangerous Lady, Mortal Friends, and Bluff, which was the winner of the 2019 Hammett Prize. Hitchcock also wrote the screenplays for Our Time and First Love.  Early life  Hitchcock was born Jane Johnston Crowley on , to Robert Crowley, a surgeon, and Joan Crowley (known professionally as Joan Alexander), an actress known for playing Lois Lane on the radio serial The Adventures of Superman, and Della Street on the radio serial Perry Mason. Joan divorced Crowley and married Arthur Stanton, who adopted Jane when she was nine years old; at which time, Jane came to be known as Jane Crowley Stanton. She attended The Brearley School, The Mary C. Wheeler School, and Sarah Lawrence College, graduating in 1968. In 1975, she married William Mellon Hitchcock, adopting his last name, by which she would hitherto be known as Jane Stanton Hitchcock.  Career  = Film and theatre = Hitchcock wrote a screenplay (under the name Jane C. Stanton) for the 1974 film Our Time, directed by Peter Hyams. The film was set in 1955 at an all-girls boarding school in Massachusetts and dealt with the issue of abortion in a privileged setting. In 1977, Paramount released First Love, a film written by Hitchcock who shared credit with David Freeman, and was directed by Joan Darling. In 1981, The American Place Theatre produced Hitchcock's play Grace under the direction of Peter Thompson. The Off-Broadway play was Hitchcock's \\"first professional New York production.\\" In 1983, another play by Hitchcock, a farce entitled Bhutan, was staged at the South Street Theater in Manhattan. Hitchcock's theatrical adaptation titled The Custom of the Country, based on Edith Wharton's novel by the same name, was staged by Shakespeare & Company at The Mount, Wharton's former home in Lenox, Massachusetts. In September 1985, the play was staged by the Second Stage Theatre under the direction of Daniel Gerroll. In 1990, Hitchcock's Vanilla, a play directed by Harold Pinter, was staged at London's Lyric Theatre. = Novels = Vowing not to rely on the \\"aid of actors and a director,\\" Hitchcock changed mediums from plays to novels. In 1992, she published her first novel Trick of the Eye which was received with what William Norwich, of The New York Times, described as positive reviews. In 1992, the book was nominated in the \\"Best First Novel\\" category for the Hammett Prize, as well as the Edgar Award. The murder mystery novel is narrated from the point of view of the protagonist Faith Crowell, an artist \\"who specializes in trompe l'oeil art\\" and is employed as a decorator to the rich. Crowell is hired to redecorate a ballroom originally designed for the coming-out party of her patron's daughter, who was murdered a few years after the debutante ball. The book was adapted into a television film aired by CBS on October 23, 1994. Hitchcock published The Witches' Hammer in 1994. Her third novel Social Crimes was released in 2002. Social Crimes was the first of a two-book series introducing Jo Slater, a New York socialite who commits murder. According to Norwich, many readers of the same social circle, of which Hitchcock is also a member, had delighted in speculating that the character was in fact based on them. In The New York Times Book Review about Social Crimes, Sarah Haight remarked that \\"Hitchcock depicts the glamour and fickleness of the Slaters' upper-crust life with the witty weariness of a seasoned observer.\\" In June 2005, Hitchcock published the sequel to Social Crimes which was titled One Dangerous Lady. The author and journalist Dominick Dunne, a friend of Hitchcock's who received an early copy, writes in the April 2005 issue of Vanity Fair that he was amused by the resemblance he himself bears to the description of the murder victim in the novel, who is \\"bludgeoned to death.\\" At the end of June 2009, Hitchcock published Mortal Friends, a novel set in Washington D.C. As part of the promotions for the book, she was interviewed by Bob Schieffer on the CBS News show Washington Unplugged. Joanne Kaufman in The Wall Street Journal describes Mortal Friends as a \\"briskly entertaining\\". In 2017, Hitchcock announced that she is working on her sixth novel, Bluff, which is connected to her new found passion for poker. She is an avid poker player and competes in the World Poker Tour and the World Series of Poker. Bluff was released by Poisoned Pen in April 2019. The novel was the winner of the 2019 Hammett Prize awarded by the International Association of Crime Writers.  Personal life  In 1991, Hitchcock divorced William Mellon Hitchcock and later married Jim Hoagland in 1995. Hoagland is a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. He was also a columnist and contributing editor at The Washington Post. They live in Washington, D.C. Hitchcock was a close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and read Psalm 23 at the former First Lady's funeral in 1994. At the time of his death in 1987, Hitchcock's step-father, Arthur Stanton, had left his wife and Hitchcock's mother Joan Alexander Stanton, an inheritance estimated at about $70‚Äì80 million. The estate was to be overseen by Kenneth Ira Starr who the Stantons had met through their daughter. Starr, on Joan Stanton's behalf, eventually began making investments in a number of questionable ventures in which he had a personal vested interest, many of which resulted in a loss. Sometime after 2006, Hitchcock and her mother became suspicious of Starr's dealings. A family friend, Jim Fennell, had discovered a scheme to use their East Hampton home as collateral to obtain a $5 million line of credit under the premise that the funds would be used to make more investments. Instead, Starr had been using Stanton's money to fund his lavish lifestyle. When Hitchcock learned of this, she convinced her mother to seek legal assistance and brought the case to the attention of the New York County District Attorney. Her mother sued Starr in April 2008 but she died in May 2009. Hitchcock settled the lawsuit under undisclosed terms but continued to assist in the ensuing criminal investigation. Starr was charge in criminal court for defrauding several celebrity figures. He pleaded guilty in September 2010 and he was sentenced to seven and half years in federal prison in March 2011. In January 2012, the fraud case was featured in an episode in the sixth season of American Greed which included interviews with Hitchcock detailing how she pursued Starr until his conviction was secured.

History Born in Helsinki to a Finnish father and a German mother, Nordlund spent a typical youth in Germany and was interested in studying physics. However, he began to doubt the viability and meaning of conventional living and decided to try and live a self-sufficient lifestyle. The background to Nordlund's experiment is his conviction that only subsistence living is materially sustainable on a long-term basis. The Experiment Nordlund could not, by his own admission, distinguish between a pine or a fir tree when he started his project, but started by studying books and experimenting to produce goods and obtain food. Eventually, he was able to live in Valtimo, in Finnish North Karelia, for the years between 1992 and 2004 in complete self- sufficiency. According to Nordlund, one person needs about five ares (500m¬≤) of farmland to live on without buying any additional food. The most important food crop for him is the rutabaga, a common Finnish staple. In his self- sufficient economy, Nordlund consumes 200 kg of mushrooms per year and about the same in berries preserved without additives or sugar. He forsook livestock because he projected the maintenance for example, animal feed) to be too time- consuming to make sense. Though he does accept the value of animal husbandry as wool and leather are handy clothing materials able to outlast cotton cloth. Nordlund became accustomed to life without salt, though many believe it to be life-threatening. He argues that he has been able to live without salt for years, although initially leaving out salt caused him some health issues. Instead of toilet paper, he uses dried sphagnum moss. In the early years of self-reliance, Nordlund's days were full of work, but eventually he was able to relax and take up hobbies from his youth, such as flute playing and working on equations. Recent He is an author and a speaker on sustainability topics. Today, he lives with his family, still mostly self-sufficiently.

Her autobiographical novel Ngonda, published in 1958, is one of the first French-language texts to be published by a sub-Saharan African woman.  Biography  = Early life = Marie-Claire Matip was born in 1938 in Es√©ka. Her father, Matip Ma Soundjock or Henri Matip,Daniel Abwa et Ngouo Woungly-Massaga alias commandant Kissamba, Cameroun, ma part de v√©rit√©, Minsi, 2005, 317 p., p. 116. was a tribal leader among the Bassa people, the last traditional chief of the Ndog-Nje clan. He had several wives, and she was one of about fifty children. Her father was part of the local elite and served as an intermediary between the colonial administration and the local population, so her family thus remained part of the aristocratic class even as colonization progressed, well until the 1950s. However, he secretly supported the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, a left-wing national liberation party that was particularly active in Es√©ka. Matip's education began with a tutor at home, before she enrolled in the public school in Es√©ka. At 13 years old, despite her mother's misgivings, she left for boarding school several hours away at the Coll√®ge Moderne de Jeunes Filles in Douala. It was there that she began writing her first novel, Ngonda (\\"Young Girl\\"), an autobiographical about her childhood in Cameroon. = A pioneering writer = Matip's formative years coincided with the turbulent years between World War II‚Äîduring which the three colonial powers present in the region, Germany, France, and Great Britain, clashed violently‚Äîand Cameroonian independence. It was also a period when traditional societal hierarchies were being called into question, schooling was becoming more widespread, and women were slowly gaining new opportunities. It was in this context that Matip wrote Ngonda, a semi- autobiographical work written in French, describing the life of a young woman in Cameroon. She held on to her draft for several years, and in 1958 she managed to get it published, by the Librairie du Messager. It is widely recognized as one of the first, if not the first, books published by a female author in sub-Saharan Africa. While the work is not explicitly revolutionary, it is imbued with a fundamentally feminist viewpoint and, notably, emphasizes the right of women to learn to read and write. = Further education and family = In 1956, she won a contest sponsored by Elle magazine and Air France that allowed her to travel to France; she returned to France the following year after being picked for a radio hosting program. Matip subsequently set up a radio program, Les beaux Samedis, for young Cameroonians and served as its host. In 1958, she studied for her baccalaur√©at at the Lyc√©e G√©n√©ral Leclerc in Yaound√©. She then studied arts and Protestant theology at the University of Montpellier and philosophy, psychology, and sociology at the Sorbonne, receiving a doctorate from the latter institution, with her thesis focusing on roles of African women. She married a Cameroonian student, from the Bafia people, and settled in France. The couple was unable to return to Cameroon for political reasons. They had five children, four daughters and a son. Three of them became singers, at one time performing together as the Blackheart Daughters: Maa Tejomayee Devi (born Esther Dobong‚ÄôNa Essiene and also known as Estha Divine, Esta, and Mataji); Princess Erika; and the late Eva (also known as Sister Hewan). Under her married name Madame Dobong'Na- Essiene, she has worked in various positions including as a secretary, a psychologist, and a market researcher.Beverley Ormerod, Beverley Ormerod Noakes et Jean-Marie Volet, Romanci√®res africaines d'expression fran√ßaise : le sud du Sahara, √âditions L‚ÄôHarmattan, 1994, 159 p., p. 99-100.

He is the second Army general to be court-martialed since the Uniform Code of Military Justice went into effect in 1951 (after Major General Robert W. Grow in 1952) and the first Army general prosecuted after retirement. Hale graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1967 and served as a company commander in the 82nd Airborne Division in the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, he was awarded the Silver Star for picking up an enemy grenade in a foxhole and throwing it away during a firefight. In 1989, he led the 9th Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division during the United States invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause).

In 1998, charges of adultery were brought against him by Donnamaria Carpino, the wife of Colonel Carpino, Hale's subordinate in Izmir, Turkey. Hale accused her of stalking him and sued for defamation of character. After only four months as Deputy Inspector General, however, he retired from the Army with an honorable discharge on February 28, 1999, with the charge still under investigation. In the wake of \\"a string of military sex scandals\\" and under public and congressional pressure (from Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine), Hale's court-martial began in March at Fort Lewis, Washington, under Lieutenant General George A. Crocker. Hale pleaded guilty to seven counts of \\"conduct unbecoming an officer\\" and one count of making false official statements. He was demoted one rank to brigadier general and fined.

It is a shrub with its branches and leaves densely covered with a layer of woolly hairs. The flowers are usually arranged in small groups surrounded by woolly hairs and are bell-shaped and deep purple or deep lilac. It is similar to Dasymalla axillaris and D. terminalis but is distinguished from them by its wedge-shaped leaf ends and more northerly distribution. Description Quoya paniculata is an erect shrub, growing to a height of about and which has its branches densely covered with woolly, branched, greenish-white hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are elliptic to lance-shaped with wedge-shaped ends, long, wide and densely covered with woolly hairs. The flowers are arranged in groups of up to five, the groups long. Each flower is borne on a woolly pedicel long and is surrounded by bracts and bracteoles which are woolly on the outer surface and mostly glabrous on the inner one. The five sepals are deep purple-lilac, hairy on the outside and joined at their bases. The five petals are a deep lilac colour and joined to form a bell-shaped tube with two \\"lips\\" on the end. The upper lip has two lobes and the lower one three. The five lobes are more or less circular with the central lobe of the lower lip about twice as large as the other four. The four stamens are about the same length as the tube, one pair shorter than the other. Flowering occurs mainly from May to December and is followed by fruit which is hairy, almost spherical and has the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming Quoya paniculata was first formally described in 1864 by Ferdinand von Mueller and published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Maitland Brown near Shark Bay. The specific epithet (paniculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"paniculate\\". In 1870, George Bentham changed the name to Pityrodia paniculata but in 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nikola Streiber changed it back to Q. paniculata. Distribution and habitat This quoya grows in sand and gravelly soil on sandplains mainly between Geraldton and Karratha in the Carnarvon, Dampierland, Gascoyne, Murchison and Pilbara biogeographic regions.

A diagram depicting the layout of Suqakollo crop beds.  History and design  Suqakollo were first implemented by Peruvian farmers in the highlands of Peru between 3000 and 1000 B.C. Records indicate that the system declined around 400 A.D before seeing a resurgence in 1000 A.D. No records were made of Suqakollos after 1450 A.D. As of 2015, the Aymara people have begun to revive the practice in the Andean highlands of Peru and Bolivia. The Suqakollo method of farming is intended to conserve water for farming by trapping moisture in trenches in front of and behind a raised strip of cultivated soil. These trenches serve a double purpose, holding water during times of drought while also draining water during heavy rains. Historically, the farming practice was most common at higher revelations where rainfall was less consistent than at lower elevations. In addition to providing protection and resources for food crops, Suqakollo also allow highland grasses to grow around the trenches. This effect creates pasture for Alpacas and Llamas.

Mary was born on 28 September 1836, at Hove in Sussex, England, one of eleven children of the Reverend Robert Thorley Bolton and Jane Martha Ball. On 8 April 1839 the Rev Bolton, his wife and six children, including Mary, left Plymouth, England on the barque Strathfieldsaye, arriving in Sydney, New South Wales on 25 July 1839, and the family moved to Hexham, New South Wales where Rev Bolton was the minister at St Stephen's church. In 1863 Rev Bolton was held to be the father of an illegitimate son.; On 31 December 1857 Mary married William Charles Windeyer, then a barrister and law reporter for the Empire. Coincidentally William's mentor, Henry Parkes, emigrated to NSW on the same vessel as Mary in 1839. William and Mary had nine children between 1859 and 1876, although one child, Wilhelmina, died in infancy, aged 1. Mary was seriously ill in 1874 and in 1876 and during that time stayed with her mother- in-law Maria Windeyer at Tomago House, Tomago, New South Wales. In 1874 Mary was one of a group of wealthy women who established the foundling hospital at Darlinghurst, initially to reduce infanticide by providing a home for infants, then reorganised to provide care for mothers with illegitimate children. The hospital subsequently became The Infants' Home Child and Family Services. In 1879 Mary was a founding member of the Boarding Out Society, along with Mrs Marian Jefferis, Lady Marian Allen and Mrs Mary Ischam Garran. The purpose of the society was to help find homes for children to remove them from state run orphanages. In 1881 the NSW government established the Children's Relief Board, and Mary was one of the first board members. Mary's sister, Anne Jane Bolton, was one of the first women to sit the senior public examination in 1871, winning the Fairfax prize for the best female candidate. Mary was a member of the fundraising committee for the establishment of The Women's College.

She became Lady Mary when William was knighted in 1891. Mary started campaigning for a Women's hospital in 1893, in order to help poor women and to train nurses. This was achieved in 1895 Dr James Graham founded what became the Crown Street Women's Hospital, and Mary was the first president of the hospital.

Biography Xiong Huizhen was born in Zhijiang County, Hubei during the Qing dynasty, and studied under the prominent historical geographer and bibliophile Yang Shoujing, who was also a native of Hubei. Yang spent most of his life annotating the 6th-century geographic work Shui jing zhu. Having completed 40 volumes of annotation, he died in 1915 without completing the work. Xiong carried on the project and wrote another 40 volumes. He also made the final editing of the entire work, painstakingly proofreading the annotations word by word. It took Xiong 22 years to complete the work, known as the Shui jing zhu shu. He refused offers made by Japanese scholars to purchase the book. However, when he learned that the descendants of Yang Shoujing had secretly sold some manuscripts, he committed suicide by hanging himself in 1936. The Second Sino-Japanese War soon broke out in 1937. The Chinese government paid great attention to the protection of the manuscript as well as Yang Shoujing's precious book collection.

Vehicles were primarily built at a production facility in Denver, Pennsylvania, or at a smaller location in Leola. The company built about 70,000 travel trailers, truck campers, fifth wheels, and motorhomes over their 42-year history.  The early days of Sunline, 1964‚Äì1974  The company was founded by Wayne Weaver and Lewis Martin, in a small garage in Hinkletown, Pennsylvania. The pair started with building backyard storage sheds in the early 1960s, and then later built a truck camper for Wayne Weaver's cross-country honeymoon trip in 1964. After the trip, they decided to expand the business and build more truck campers in Schoeneck. Production outgrew that facility and prompted a move to Akron in 1967. The company officially incorporated in 1968 and moved to their final location at 245 S. Muddy Creek Road in Denver. in 1969, near the junction of Route 222 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The factory was recognizable along the turnpike from a large travel trailer shaped billboard, complete with hubcaps, mounted up on the hill. The first Sunline travel trailer was built in 1971, with fifth wheels following shortly after.  1975‚Äì1987  In 1975, Wayne Weaver left Sunline, thus breaking the partnership. John Zimmerman and Wayne Lawrence, Sr. joined the team from nearby RV manufacturer Shasta Industries. Product lines changed to align with the smaller cars and trucks of the time due to the fuel crisis and Sunline focused on lightweight construction methods that could be towed by these new, less powerful vehicles Notable products of the late 1970s were the Sunline Sunspot and the Sunline Solaris. The Sunspot, a small, lightweight, teardrop style trailer with a rear opening chuckwagon kitchen, could be towed by small economy cars such as the Volkswagen Rabbit. The Solaris, a new motorhome built on a Datsun EHL620 chassis, featured a 119 cubic inch four cylinder engine designed for fuel economy. In 1983, the company expanded operations by acquiring the property directly across the street for a new production, parts, R&D;, and customer service facility. The new facility was located at 985 Stone Hill Road.  1988‚Äì1994  While the small, lightweight floorplans remained, Sunline began to offer larger floorplans in the mid 1980s, with more luxurious fabrics and option choices. Luxuries such as air conditioning and plush velour furniture became popular options never available before. Hardwood cabinet doors and other wood accents became optional and standard in the uplevel Seville line of travel trailers and truck campers. Sunline also introduced two entry level models in the late 1980s, the SunRay, and StarRay to attract younger and budget minded customers. With the trend toward larger trailers and needing more room to manufacture, Sunline acquired the former Shasta Industries plant at 40 Hess Road in Leola. It was a considerably smaller facility than Sunline's main campus, but this facility assumed most production of the larger trailers and fifth wheels. The last Leola built Sunline left the plant in 2004, as a 2005 model. 1990 was Sunline's 25th anniversary, with a road ahead theme. The beige exterior of the 1980s was replaced with an all-new light gray in 1990, but it was quickly replaced with polar white in 1992. The new polar white aluminum had Krystal Kote coating, designed to help prevent scratches and dents.  1995-1999  Sunline's 30th anniversary was in 1995, with trailers featuring all new decal packages. An especially notable feature of 1995 model Sunlines was the addition of power slide rooms to two fifth wheel models. The slide room concept had been around in the RV industry since the 1970s and power slide outs since 1990, but this was Sunline's first application of them. 50,000th Sunline, a 2000 T-2370. 8/26/99.The Saturn travel trailer line was launched in 1996. It was an economical/entry level travel trailer, built with the same materials as the rest, just with less features and a lower price point. Most notably, the new 1996 Sunline Saturn line had multiple floorplan options with slide rooms, ranging from 28' to 36' in length. All Sunline Slide Rooms at this time were large couch/dinette combo. The largest Slide Room trailers, the T-32SS and T-36SS, became common choices for destination trailers at a campground seasonal site, and had a new optional sliding glass patio door to encourage more permanent use. With the Slide Room models gaining popularity, the Slide Room idea was moved into its own model for 1998 and 1999, simply called the Sunline Slide Room. The Saturn non-slide models saw a mild visual redesign that allowed the Slide Rooms to rebrand. Sunline's first website was launched in 1997, as was the first email address. The website featured new model information, warranty information, a company store for apparel, and a customer photos section. The 50,000th Sunline was produced in August 26, 1999, as a 2000 Sunline Solaris T-2370.  2000‚Äì2004  Sunline's 35th anniversary occurred in 2000. The celebration brought the introduction of a new exterior decal with shade shifting vinyl. The 2000 brochure featured a large collage of Sunline's past, including the original truck camper, the original Sunline lightning logo, various old pictures of the plant, and the new logo. Sunline launched a new line of apparel for owners to purchase to coincide with the anniversary, both via the online store or in person at the plant. A custom snowglobe was offered as well, with only 1008 hand-numbered snowglobes produced. It featured a camping scene with a 2000 Sunline trailer, mountain backdrop, and plays Willie Nelson's \\"On the Road Again\\". Many of these snowglobes are still seen today at many RV dealerships. Since the entry level Saturn line was discontinued in 1999, a replacement for it was created reviving the Advancer name in 2000. It was designed to appeal to younger buyers, and featured aluminum framing, a tapered body design for better towing, and other unique features. The idea for this design came from employee Skip Hershey and was in the works for five years. The Advancer and Advancer Lite trailers were produced from 2000 to 2002. Trailer Life Magazine tested a 2000 model with a 1999 Cadillac Escalade for the October, 1999 issue. Whether modifying a floorplan to make it wheelchair accessible, adding larger windows or deleting windows, or replacing a queen bed with twin beds, Sunline often modified existing floorplans for a customer's needs. One notable customization is the Breath Express, a custom 2004 Sunline Slide Room built for the American Lung Association of Eastern Connecticut as a mobile exhibit to teach school children about the effects of smoking and asthma. Sunline also assisted one of their dealers, Rayewood Trailer Sales of Sussex, NJ, with providing a 2001 T-360SR to a demolition crew working at the site of the World Trade Center building #7 after the September 11th attacks. Sunline matched employee donations and donated $1200 to the American Red Cross for disaster relief. After the discontinuation of the previous fifth wheel models in 1996, a new fifth wheel line was launched for the 2002 model year. Built only at the Leola plant, these high end fifth wheels featured full fiberglass exteriors, front and rear fiberglass caps, multiple slide outs, oak interiors, and line specific fabric choices. They were built for with full-time/snowbird use in mind, and as such, are known to be quite heavy for their size.  40th Anniversary, 2004‚Äì05  In February, 2004, it was announced that Sunline Coach would be sold. The past owners retired and sold the company to a group of investors known as Sunline Acquisition Company, but the company would operate as Sunline Coach Company as they always had. 1971 Sunline 21RB Contest Winner, the oldest Sunline. Following tradition, calendar year 2004/model year 2005 meant the 40th anniversary of Sunline. Early in 2004, Sunline announced a special contest for the anniversary, the search for the oldest Sunline still on the road. After months of taking customer submissions, all of which were featured on the Sunline website, the oldest Sunline was found nearby in Pennsylvania, a 1971 21' RB travel trailer. The winners of the contest won the option to exchange their 1971 Sunline in for a brand new 2005 Sunline T-279SR, which they did. Ten of the runner up contestants won Sunline memorabilia, including the owner of one original Sunline barn. Sunline joined the toy hauler segment in 2005 with the introduction of the Tran-Sport. Initially offered in one floorplan, the trailer had a patio side ramp to the garage and a vapor barrier wall between the garage and living area. A longer floorplan was later introduced with a larger, rear-ramp garage. Both floorplans had optional fold down bunks in the garage. When Hurricane Katrina caused major devastation to the Gulf Coast in August 2005, FEMA reached out to multiple RV manufacturers to supply the storm ravaged area with temporary housing. Starting in September, Sunline committed to building up to 1000 special 2006 T-30F models for FEMA. Many Sunline employees and local businesses stocked each trailer shipped out with bottled water, canned goods, and other necessities to help the new residents get back on their feet. Sunline T-30Fs were auctioned off by GSA Auctions at the end of use, along with many other FEMA trailers. Early production T-30Fs have Sunline logo decals on the front and rear, but later ones do not, which make it difficult to identify from other FEMA trailers.  The end of Sunline, 2006  Sunline launched an all new trailer called the Que in the 2007 model year. It was the smallest Sunline trailer in many years at just 5.4 meters and had a European caravan style. The Que featured front and rear fiberglass caps, fiberglass sides, modern appointments, and a full bathroom. The new cherry cabinetry introduced in the Que carried over to all 2007 models when they launched two months later. After a four-year hiatus, Sunline revived the Advancer name for a new handicapped accessible model. While any other Sunline model could be modified for a wheelchair, this model was built specifically for wheelchair use and had a built in wheelchair lift. On Friday November 10, 2006, Sunline management announced to all employees that the company would be shutting down after 42 years. Many of Sunline's employees stayed to finish building as many trailers as they could with the supplies they had. News spread quickly around the industry, and many dealers acted fast to buy up completed trailers, despite a lack of factory warranty. Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed for Sunline Coach Company on December 6, 2006 and was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on December 29, 2006. Following the closure and bankruptcy, auctioneer Myron Bowling liquidated the company's assets. On April 17, 2007, Myron Bowling held an auction on site. Following the auction and liquidation, the property was sold. Sunline's intellectual assets were listed on eBay for a few months in 2007, shortly after the closure  Sunline Owners keep the spirit alive  In the 1990s, the Sunliners and Sunline Pioneers were born as camping groups of exclusively Sunline owners, primarily in Pennsylvania. These groups were small and mostly dissolved by the 2000s. 52 Sunlines gathered at Buttonwood Campground in 2009 SunlineClub.com was born August 2, 2006, as a new, free enthusiast site. It was never associated with the company and was slow to grow initially. The site was a very basic forum format, utilizing phpBB code. The site gained significant membership that November when news spread about Sunline's closure. SunlineClub.com was acquired by Social Knowledge LLC in 2010 who continues to own and operate it today. Today, Sunline Club has become a large camping group, with various rallies around the country. An annual large rally is held at Buttonwood Campground in Mexico, Pennsylvania, with a record of 52 Sunlines in attendance in 2009. The website has a huge technical database of Sunline resources and almost 10,000 members.  Sunlines in the news  In 1997, Pennsylvania Cable Network (PCN) did a segment on Sunline as part of their PCN Tours series to feature local businesses around Pennsylvania. The tour was featured on TV, and then available for purchase on VHS or DVD. On April 30, 2017, a Sunline was featured in the local news when a large tree fell on the trailer at Oma's Family Campground in Colerain Township, killing a 10-year-old girl sleeping inside. The trailer was a 1996 Sunline Solaris T-2652.

History  According to historical records, Wat Mahannapharam Worawihan was constructed in the reign of King Rama III (1824-1851) by Prince Annop, a son of Rama III. The construction began in 1850 with the king providing 80,000 baht. However it was only completed in the reign of King Rama IV (1851-1868) when the new king provided a further another 80,000 baht. The name of the temple means \\"the great abode of water\\", referring to the Sea of Samsara, the endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. The first public school in Thailand was established at Wat Mahannapharam by the abbot of the temple after an instruction was issued by Rama V encouraging temples to set up new schools for the common people in 1884. It was the beginning of mass education in Thailand. A statue of Rama V was later erected at the wat to mark the centenary of the founding of the school.

It is bounded on the north by U.S. Route 12, and on the south by 144th Street. Demographics As of the 2010 United States Census, Washington Park had 1459 residents, of whom 38.1% were African American and 60.3% were Hispanic. Local points of interest in addition to the park itself include E. J. Block Athletic Field and St. Catherine's Hospital. History In the earliest years of the 20th century, the East Chicago Company subdivided the 70-acre Washington Park tract and built homes there. But because of the neighborhood's remoteness from local industry. and the tendency of the basements to flood, the homes proved difficult to sell. In 1910, Fred J. Smith and Martin Hausler (a local banker and civil engineer respectively) formed the Washington Park Land Company with the goal of transforming Washington Park into an exclusive residential subdivision for the local elites. As the neighborhood's remoteness transformed from a liability to an asset, living there became a symbol of environmental privilege. The land company used restrictive covenants to prevent racial and ethnic minorities from moving in, and set a minimum home value of $2000 to prevent poor people of any race from moving in. The developers advertised Washington Park as the ‚Äúonly restricted subdivision in Indiana Harbor.‚Äù The land for the later Washington Park was set aside, but the park was not actually built until after the homes. The land company used its growing political clout to steer public improvements, such as sewer and water lines, to the neighborhood. Early investors in the neighborhood included figures associated with the feared \\"Indiana Harbor mob,\\" which was linked to the Al Capone syndicate in Chicago as well as to John Dillinger. These figures included Lake County judge William Murray and East Chicago attorney Hymie Cohen. Several adjacent north-south streets in the neighborhood are named for trees and plants, including the fir, elm, and deodar. The street now known as Grand Boulevard was once likewise named Grapevine Street, but its name was changed to \\"Grand\\" as increasing numbers of local elites settled along it.

In particular, he conducts the chamber choir Les √âl√©ments which he founded in Toulouse and with which he received a Victoire de la musique classique in 2006 and the Ensemble Jacques Moderne in Tours.  Biography  Born in 1962 in Orthez, Suhubiette played the piano very early. He then went on to undertake musical studies at the . He joined the early music department where he studied singing with John Elwes and Guillemette Laurens. At the University of Toulouse Le Mirail he studied musicology and choral conducting with Alix Bourbon,D√©c√®s de la chef de ch≈ìur Alix Bourbon on whose vocal ensemble he joined which allowed him, at a very young age, to sing under the direction of Michel Corboz, Jean-Claude Malgoire, Gustav Leonhardt etc. It was at this time, in 1985, that he founded Les √âl√©ments with friends singers from the Conservatoire and the University, an ensemble that later became the chamber choir he still conducts in Toulouse. He then began his professional career as a singer with Les Arts Florissants of William Christie. In 1986 his meeting with Philippe Herreweghe played a decisive role: for twelve years he sang in his ensembles ‚Äì La Chapelle Royale and the Collegium Vocale Gent ‚Äì with which he took part in more than thirty recordings and discovered the diversity of the vocal repertoire to which the Belgian conductor devoted himself with his two prestigious choirs. Soon, Philippe Herreweghe made him his assistant and he was entrusted with the preparation of the choir for productions and recordings. In 1993, Suhubiette took over the management of the Ensemble Jacques Moderne, whose founder Jean-Pierre Ouvrard died at the end of 1992. It was the beginning of a new musical adventure that immersed him in the universe of a cappella polyphony of the French, English and Spanish Renaissance music to which he dedicated some of his recordings. (Regnard, Jean Mouton, Guerrero, Morales). Very soon, he extended the ensemble's repertoire to the composers of the 17th and 18th centuries, giving a preponderant place to the works of the first German Baroque, (Schein, Sch√ºtz and Buxtehude). A little later, he performed with l'Ensemble the motets, passions, Mass in B minor and short masses by Johann Sebastian Bach, anthems by Purcell and Handel, Purcell's operas (Dido and Aeneas, King Arthur), and the French Baroque repertoire. As early as 1997, with the chamber choir Les √âl√©ments he conducted in Toulouse, he began conducting the a cappella repertoire of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Baroque oratorios (Johann Sebastian Bach, Handel) classical (Mozart, Haydn) and commissioned a large number of works from contemporary composers (, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Hersant, Pierre Jodlowski, Alexandros Markeas, Zad Moultaka, Vincent Paulet, Ton That Tiet, Antonio Chagas Rosa). He also plays Stravinsky, Poulenc, Britten, Dallapiccola, Berio, Mantovani, Dusapin. Thanks to his assiduous practice of the a cappella repertoire, the chamber choir \\"Les √âl√©ments\\" was one of the most important choirs in France, and with it, Suhubiette performed in Europe, the USA, Canada, Tunisia, Lebanon, Egypt. The ensemble was the guest of many conductors (Michel Plasson, Christophe Rousset, Philippe Herreweghe, Christophe Coin, John Nelson, Emmanuel Krivine, Lawrence Foster, Marc Minkowski, J√©r√©mie Rhorer... In 2005, l'Ensemble was laureate of the Liliane Bettencourt Prize for choral singing awarded by the Academy of Fine Arts, and in 2006, it was consecrated \\"Ensemble de l'ann√©e\\" at the Victoires de la musique classique. With his two ensembles, Suhubiette has recorded for record companies Virgin Classics, √âditions Hortus, Calliope, Ligia, l'Empreinte Digitale, Na√Øve Records and Mirare, and many of his records have received awards and critical acclaim. He is also interested in the other vocal world of opera. He conducts Mozart's operas, Don Giovanni, The Magic Flute, The Marriage of Figaro, Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (at the Dijon op√©ra, the Saint-C√©r√© festival), the comedy operas by Jacques Offenbach, the French premiere of Kurt Weill's Der Silbersee at the Massy Opera House, Les caprices de Marianne by Henri Sauguet. In the oratorio domain, the programmes led him to conduct the Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse, the Orchestre de Chambre de Toulouse, the Orchestre Baroque Les Passions, Les Folies fran√ßoises,Les Folies fran√ßoises website the Caf√© Zimmermann, Gli Incogniti,Gli Incogniti Concerto Soave, the Ensemble Baroque de Limoges, the Pau-Pays de B√©arn orchestra, Les Percussions de Strasbourg, Ensemble Ars Nova etc. It is in this spirit of openness to several musical worlds that the Abbey-school of Sor√®ze in the Tarn d√©partement offered him in 2006 to become artistic director of its festival . Since 2008, Suhubiette has been teaching regularly in the choir conducting class of the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur de musique et de danse de Lyon. In 2014, he was awarded the rank of Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture.  Discography  With the chamber choir Les √âl√©ments: * L'√Çme slave.

Highlighted as a priority in a 2013 Transport for New South Wales report, the wharf was originally proposed to be located at Rhodes Point, west of the John Whitton Bridge, before being moved eastward along the Rhodes peninsula after objections from community leaders, lobbyists, and Sydney Ferries operator Transdev Sydney Ferries. The plan has since been incorporated into the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment's Rhodes East \\"priority precinct\\" development project. History A new ferry wharf on the Parramatta River servicing the suburb of Rhodes was first outlined as a \\"preferred wharf for further investigation\\" in a May 2013 report by Transport for New South Wales entitled Sydney‚Äôs Ferry Future. It was listed alongside wharves at Glebe Point, Jacksons Landing, Woolloomooloo, and Elizabeth Bay, and a relocation of Birchgrove ferry wharf. Member for Drummoyne John Sidoti outlined a wharf at Rhodes as an electoral commitment in 2015, with the first community consultation on the project occurring in September 2015. The new wharf was originally planned to be located west of the John Whitton Bridge at Rhodes Point, and was foreseen to be completed in time for the state election in March 2019. Following concerns raised by both the local community and City of Canada Bay councilors, along with an objection from Sydney Ferries operator Transdev Sydney Ferries and a $55,000 lobbying campaign by Rowing NSW, Roads & Maritime Services abandoned the Rhodes Point location for the wharf. While an alternate site at Brays Bay, located on the eastern side of the Rhodes peninsula, attracted a notable amount of popularity in the local community and an endorsement by community leaders and Sidoti as an option, the location of the wharf was kept at the northern foreshore of the peninsula, with the site moved east of the John Witton Bridge and west of the Ryde Bridge. The development of the wharf was later incorporated into the Department of Planning and Environment's Rhodes East redevelopment project, as part of the Leeds Street Foreshore Precinct plan. The project was publicly announced as a \\"priority precinct\\" by the State Government in September 2017. Committed by Transport for New South Wales as part of the Transport Access Program, the Rhodes ferry wharf is planned to be delivered between 2020 and 2022. Design The proposed design for the new wharf includes a pontoon modeled after other pontoons on the Sydney Ferries network redeveloped in the 2010s, with a curved zinc roof and steel base, fitted with glass panels to provide weather protection. A lengthy concrete bridge and aluminium gangway provide access to the pontoon.

He served as a teacher after his ordination in two different areas until he returned to his hometown towards the end of the devastating World War II to tend to wounded and displaced people. But the fierce fighting between the Nazis and Allies plus the partisan forces saw Comini and fellow priest (and future Servant of God) Nicola Capelli captured and murdered after the Nazis made accusations of the pair being spies. Comini's cause for beatification was introduced in 1995 at which stage he became titled as a Servant of God. Life Elia Comini was born in Bologna on 7 May 1910 to Claudio Comini (a carpenter) and Emma Limoni (a dressmaker); one brother was Amleto. He was baptized in the local parish church on 8 May. In 1914 the Comini's moved to Casetta in the Salvaro parish in Bologna on the banks of the River Rhine along the Porrettana road. He attended the Salesian school in Finale Emilia where he later asked to be admitted into their order. He did his novitiate period in Castel de'Britti from 1925 to 1926 before making his first religious profession on 3 October 1926. His father died sometime during 1926 with the Salvaro archpriest Fidenzio Mellini (who himself knew Saint Giovanni Bosco) acted as a sort of surrogate father. Mellini had in fact predicted that Comini would become a priest and held him in high regard due to his goodness and intellect. Comini completed his studies at the Salesian-run high school in Valsalice in Turin (1926‚Äì28) and then graduated in literature from the college in Milan prior to receiving his ordination to the priesthood on 16 March 1935 in the Brescia Cathedral from Bishop Giacinto Tredici. He afterwards served as a teacher at the order's schools in both Chiari in Brescia (1936‚Äì41) and Treviglio at the Salesian Aspirantate (1941‚Äì44). In summer 1944 during World War II he returned to Salvaro to aid his frail mother and to render his aid to the aging Monsignor Mellini. But that area was the epicenter of war between the Nazis and the Allies as well as those partisan forces. To that end he turned his attention to the poor and displaced peoples that the war affected. He made himself available for hearing confessions and for preaching while also using his musical abilities to enliven the people. He soon came into contact with fellow priest (and future Servant of God) Nicola Capelli (in religious \\"Martino\\") and the pair often visited refugees and rendered medical aid to those who were wounded. On 29 September 1944 both he and Capelli were arrested en route to Grizzana where 69 people were about to be massacred. He had just celebrated his last Mass that morning. The Nazi S.S. considered them to be spies and so mistreated the pair and used them to transport their ammunition in terrible conditions. On 30 September he and Capelli spent their time comforting their fellow prisoners. The attempts made to rescue them were useless for Comini said \\"either all or none\\" even after his friend Commissioner Prefect Emilio Veggetti tried to secure his release. He and 44 others were shot dead around dusk on 1 October 1944 in the reservoir of the warehouse of the Industrie Canapiere Italiano. His remains were then cast into the Rhine. Before being shot he and Capelli heard each other's confessions before he granted their fellow hostages absolution in a loud and defiant voice. Beatification process The beatification process was launched under Pope John Paul II on 14 February 1995 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints accepted a formal application to launch the process (providing the \\"nihil obstat\\" edict) and titling Comini as a Servant of God. Cardinal Giacomo Biffi inaugurated the diocesan investigation in Bologna on 3 December 1995 and closed it later on 25 November 2001 after documentation had been compiled to support the cause. The C.C.S. later validated the process on 1 October 2004 after receiving the documentation submitted to them; the Positio dossier was then sent to the C.C.S. for assessment in 2009 following its compilation. Theologians approved the cause with nine affirmative votes in favor at their meeting held on 4 April 2017. The current postulator for this cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

Born in Conejos, Colorado, her family had deep roots in the region, being among the first settlers of the San Luis Valley that overlaps southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. She taught in elementary schools before her marriage and afterward served as postmistress of San Luis for nearly four decades. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. Early life, family, and education Erinea Garcia was born in Conejos, Colorado, in 1903. Her father, Jos√© Amarante Garc√≠a, had eight children from his first wife, Sofia Espinosa de Garc√≠a. After Sofia's death, he married her sister, Teodora Espinosa de Garc√≠a, who bore him four children, including Erinea. Antecedents on both her father's and mother's sides were among the first settlers in the San Luis Valley that overlaps southern Colorado and northern New Mexico, establishing farms and towns on Mexican land grants. After Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876, Garcia's grandfather served in the state legislature. Her father was the sheriff of Conejos County for 19 years and was also a two-term Conejos County judge. Garcia attended elementary school in Conejos and then entered the Loretto Academy for Girls in Pueblo. In 1921 a flood ravaged the town and the school was closed. Garcia went on to graduate from the high school in Antonito. She was among the first Hispanic women in Colorado to attend college. She took courses at Adams State University, Western State Colorado University, and the University of Utah, earning a teaching certificate. Career Plaza de San Luis de la Culebra Historic District For 12 years, Garcia worked as a teacher in elementary schools in Conejos, San Luis, and other towns in the San Luis Valley. She also was a school principal. In 1932 she married and left her job to raise a family. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed her postmistress of San Luis. She and her husband moved into a Gallegos family-owned house adjacent to the post office building on Main Street in San Luis. Dating from the early 1860s, this house had been part of a farm and grain mill complex owned by Nasario Gallegos, Ceran St. Vrain, and Harvey Easterday. Known as the Gallegos-Easterday House, it is part of the Plaza de San Luis de la Culebra Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. A post office permit had been requested by Easterday in 1860 so the grain mill would have its own mailing address. When Garcia Gallegos and her family arrived, the post office building was also owned by the Gallegos family. Garcia Gallegos was the postmistress of San Luis for nearly four decades. During World War II and other battles which saw local men stationed overseas, she assisted post-office patrons with writing and translating letters, and issued money orders. Upon her retirement in 1976, her daughter took over as postmistress. Honors Garcia Gallegos was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. Her family also established the Erinea and Maclovio Gallegos Scholarship Fund at Adams State University. Personal life She married Maclovio Gallegos, a native of San Luis, in 1932. They had seven children. Garcia Gallegos died in 2002.

Life and work  Rohrlich was born in Vienna, Austria in 1921. He was the son of Illy (n√©e Schwarz) and Egon Rohrlich, a lawyer. His family was Jewish. His education was terminated after Austria was annexed by Germany in March, 1938 (the \\"Anschluss\\"). For a time he did forced labor.) In 1939 he emigrated to study at the Technion in Haifa in modern-day Israel, where he was awarded a Diplom in industrial chemistry in 1943. He then began work in Jerusalem as a technician for the British armed forces. He was able to concurrently study physics with Giulio Racah at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which was his ultimate goal. In June 1942, his parents became victims of The Holocaust; they had been deported to the Sobib√≥r Extermination Camp by the authorities in Austria. In 1946, Rohrlich was accepted for graduate studies at Harvard University in the United States. He received a master's degree in 1947 and a doctorate in 1948; his doctoral thesis advisor was Julian Schwinger. At Harvard, he was also a teaching assistant for Norman Foster Ramsey. In 1948, he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey; as Max Jammer wrote much later, \\"For Rohrlich this was one of the highlights of his life: he met Einstein, Pais, Placzek, Uhlenbeck, Dyson, and the mathematicians G√∂del, von Neumann, and Weyl; he was present when von Laue and Yukawa visited the Institute.\\" In 1949, he became a research associate with Hans Bethe at Cornell University. There he met Richard Feynman, which revived his interest in the problems of divergences in the classical electrodynamic theory for charged particles, for which he later became a leading expert. At the same time, he also made significant contributions to the establishment of early quantum electrodynamics, and in particular he demonstrated the equivalence of the various formulations for spin-0 particles, after Freeman Dyson had demonstrated the version of spin-¬Ω particles). In 1951, he became an assistant professor at Princeton University. There he gave lectures on quantum electrodynamics from which his seminal textbook, written with Josef-Maria Jauch, emerged. In 1953 he became an associate professor (and colleague of Jauch) at the University of Iowa; the text The theory of Photons and Electrons was first published in 1955. In 1963 he became a professor at Syracuse University, where he spent he rest of his career; his text Classical Charged Particles was first published in 1965. In addition to his work in theories of quantum and classical electrodynamics, in the early 1960s he also investigated (with T. Fulton and Louis Witten) the problem of the radiation of the free- falling charged particle in the general theory of relativity and the question of whether this violated the principle of equivalence. In the 1980s, he put his focus on the philosophy of science, and wrote the text From Paradox to Reality: Our Basic Concepts of the Physical World. In 1991 he retired and became a professor emeritus. He remained active in research for many years thereafter, and in 2009 was honored by the lifetime \\"outstanding referee\\" designation of the American Physical Society. In 1957 he was selected as a fellow of the American Physical Society. Rohrlich's citation was not archived. In 1974 he received a Fulbright Award to visit the University of Graz, and in 1996 he received an honorary doctorate from that university. Rohrlich received an honorary doctorate in natural science Doctores rerum naturalium honoris causa. Rohrlich died November 14, 2018 in DeWitt, New York.

He worked as a photographer and formerly the artistic director of the cultural center Forum ‚Äì Nutidsplats f√∂r kultur (\\"Forum ‚Äì Contemporary Scene for Culture\\") Stockholm. Arnault became widely known after several accusations of sexual assault levelled against him precipitated a scandal resulting in the resignations of members of the Nobel Committee and the postponement of the 2018 Nobel Prize for Literature. These events occurred against the background of the Me Too movement. In 2018, he was found guilty of two sexual assaults and sentenced to two years and six months in prison. He appealed the sentence to the Supreme Court of Sweden on the basis of judicial disqualification.http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/Om-Hogsta- domstolen/Nyheter-fran-Hogsta-domstolen/Overklagandet-fran-den-man-som-i- media-benamns-som-kulturprofilen--Hogsta-domstolen-skjuter-pa-provningen On 5 May 2019, the court decided not to grant leave to appeal and the verdict from the lower court was subsequently enforced.  Life  Arnault was born in Marseille, France. He won Natur & Kultur's cultural award in 2008. He is married to former Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson. Sexual assault allegations and rape conviction In November 2017, in the context of the Me Too movement, eighteen women accused Arnault of sexual assault, over the course of 20 years. This caused the Swedish Academy to break all financial ties with him. Swedish media have reported that he groped Swedish Crown Princess Victoria at an academy event in 2006. Simultaneously, his wife Katarina Frostenson was accused of corruption for not informing the Swedish Academy about conflicts of interest when distributing subsidies for her husband's cultural center. The Swedish Academy believes he has leaked seven winners of the Nobel Prize in literature. Arnault denied all allegations. On 1 October 2018, Arnault was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to two years in prison as well as a SEK 115,000 fine. Arnault appealed the verdict. On 3 December 2018, the Svea Court of Appeal increased the sentence and found Arnault guilty of two counts of rape and sentenced him to two years and six months in prison. The fine was raised to SEK 215,000. Repercussions In the wake of the accusations, the Swedish Academy suffered a considerable blow to its reputation. Academy member Klas √ñstergren left the academy and academy members Sara Danius, Peter Englund, Kjell Espmark and Frostenson ceased taking part in the academy's work, leading to concerns about the future of the academy. On 27 April 2018, Sara Stridsberg left the academy in solidarity with Sara Danius. Due to the scandal and a perceived tarnishing of the Nobel Committee's reputation, the Nobel Prize in Literature was postponed until 2019. The New Academy Prize in Literature was created as an alternative to the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature. Life in prison Arnault was an inmate in Skogome Prison, a high-security prison for sex offenders; Swedish media reported that he was disciplined for breaking prison rules by making sexist comments towards a female warder. In late 2019 he was transferred to another prison at Tillberga.Kulturprofilen Arnault flyttas till Tillbergaanstalten  References  1946 births Living people Swedish people of French descent People from Marseille 20th-century French photographers 21st-century French photographers People convicted of rape Prisoners and detainees of Sweden Swedish rapists ","title":"Jean-Claude Arnault"},{"id":"55859738","text":"Monika Das is an Indian politician.

He was named the American Champion Sprint Horse of 2017 and 2018. He did not start racing until age three, when he won only one race, and he was winless at age four. In 2017 at age five however, he developed into the best sprinter in North America by winning the True North Stakes, Santa Anita Sprint Championship and Breeders' Cup Sprint. In 2018, he defended his wins in the Breeders' Cup Sprint and Santa Anita Sprint Championship, plus finished second in the Bing Crosby Stakes and third in the Dubai Golden Shaheen. Background Roy H is a bay gelding who was bred in Kentucky by Ramona S. Bass, LLC. His sire is More Than Ready, who won the King's Bishop Stakes and finished fourth in the Kentucky Derby. As a sire, More Than Ready achieved most of his early success when shuttling to Australia but has had growing success in North America as well. His offspring have proven themselves at a wide variety of distances, on both turf and dirt surfaces. Roy H is out of the stakes-winning mare Elusive Diva, by Elusive Quality. Roy H was sold for $115,000 at the Keeneland September Yearling sales, and then resold as a two-year-old-in-training for $310,000 at the Keeneland April sales. He is owned by Gary Hartunian's Rockingham Ranch and David Bernsen, and is trained by Peter Miller. He is named for Hartunian's grandfather. Racing career Roy H did not win his first stakes race until age five, a fact Miller blamed on \\"a lot of little things\\" rather than lack of ability. He made his debut as a three-year-old on April 30, 2015 at Santa Anita Park in a maiden special weight race, finishing second. He won next time out on May 31 over Santa Anita's downhill turf course, winning at a distance of about furlongs in front-running fashion. However, he then went winless in his next nine starts, from June 2015 to July 2016. During this period, Miller tried Roy H on both turf and dirt, at distances from five furlongs to a mile. =2017: five-year-old season= Roy H then received an extended layoff, during which time he was gelded. Roy H returned to racing on April 8, 2017 in an allowance optional claiming race at Santa Anita. Back on the downhill turf course, he raced four-wide around the turn and then kicked clear in the stretch to win by lengths. He made his next start on May 6 in a race that was switched from turf to dirt due to rain. Over the wet-fast main track, Roy H \\"freaked\\", unleashing a powerful finishing burst to win by lengths while earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 106. For his next start, Miller decided to ship the gelding to Belmont Park in New York for the True North Stakes, run over the dirt at a distance of six furlongs. Roy H faced two top sprinters, Stallwalkin' Dude and Whitmore, and went off at odds of 6-1. He raced in mid- pack for the first quarter of a mile, then started his move five-wide around the turn. He pulled away at the head of the stretch, then withstood a late run from Stallwalkin' Dude for a -length win. His time of 1:08.59 earned him a Beyer Speed Figure of 111, one of the best ratings for a sprinter in 2017. Roy H then returned to California for the Bing Crosby Stakes at Del Mar on July 29. He went off as the 8-5 favorite in a nine-horse field that included the 2016 champion sprinter Drefong (Breeders' Cup Sprint) and Ransom the Moon (Kona Gold Stakes). Roy H broke well and vied for the early lead with St. Joe Bay. On the other hand, Drefong ducked in at the start and dumped his jockey. Riderless, Drefong caught up with the early leaders down the backstretch but drifted wide around the final turn, forcing Roy H even wider. Ransom the Moon, who was tracking the pace, ran through the gap on the rail and inherited the lead. Roy H tried to close ground but came up short by lengths. \\"My horse was running really well and then the loose horse changed everything,\\" said jockey Paco Lopez. \\"I was trying to work around him, but we just kept getting pushed out. ... What can you do?\\" Roy H was racing for the Rockingham Ranch, and managed by Brian Trump.https://horsebills.com/episode-03-peter-miller-brian- trump-a-breeders-cup-dynamic-duo/ On October 9, Roy H made his next start in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship. Ridden for the first time by Hall of Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux, he was the odds-on favorite in a field of six. He tracked the early pace set by American Anthem and Mr. Hinx, moving easily while racing three-wide around the turn. In mid-stretch, Desormeaux hit him once with the whip and Roy H responded by pulling away for a one-length victory. \\"He's fast,\\" said Desormeaux. \\"He probably broke a half a length behind the leaders and I had him in absolute reserve all the way.\\" The field for the Breeders' Cup Sprint, held on November 4 at Del Mar, featured the top sprinters from across North America. Drefong was the favorite based on his win in the Forego Stakes in August and his excellent workouts. Other top contenders included Imperial Hint (five straight wins including the Smile Sprint), Takaful (Vosburgh) and Mind Your Biscuits (Dubai Golden Shaheen and Belmont Sprint Championship). Imperial Hint broke quickly from the outside post and vied for the early lead with Takaful, who ran the opening quarter in a swift :21.82. Roy H scrambled to get good position then settled just behind them in third. Rounding the turn, Imperial Hint moved to the lead while Roy H swung wide. Roy H started his move as they entered the stretch and steadily pulled away to win by a length. \\"I had to jockey for position, fighting for a spot two times in 200 yards,\\" said Desormeaux. \\"After that, he had the catbird seat. He raced off my fingertips and gave me a lovely ride. Absolutely exploded turning for home.\\" Roy H earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 111, matching his career best. The Racing Post assigned a rating of 128, tying him world- wide with Harry Angel for the top sprint performance worldwide in 2017. Roy H was named the American Champion Sprint Horse of 2017 at the Eclipse Award ceremonies in January 2018. =2018: six-year-old season= Roy H began his six-year-old campaign in the Palos Verdes Stakes at Santa Anita on February 3, winning easily by lengths. Miller planned to next start the gelding in the Triple Bend Handicap in March, but ultimately scratched from that race. Instead he travelled to Meydan Racecourse for the Dubai Golden Shaheen on March 31. He broke poorly, costing him about eight lengths. He made up most of that ground as they rounded the turn, then entered into a stretch duel with XY Jet. Both horses were caught near the finish line by Mind Your Biscuits, who had made a late run to win the race for the second time. Roy H finished third, beaten by less than a length. On returning to America, Roy H was given some time off, then returned in the Bing Crosby Stakes on July 28. His main rival was Ransom the Moon, who had won the race in 2017 after Roy H was interfered with by Drefong. This time, Roy H raced in fourth behind the early leaders then made his move in the stretch. However, he lacked his usual closing kick and finished second to Ransom the Moon. Desormeaux felt that the gelding needed the race after the long layoff and would improve in his next start. Now ridden by Paco Lopez, Roy H made his next start in the Santa Anita Sprint Championship on October 6. Racing three wide, Roy H settled in third place then moved to the lead as they entered the stretch. He won by lengths over stablemate Distinctive B, with Ransom the Moon closing late to finish third. Lopez commented that Roy H was \\"an easy horse to ride\\" and could be positioned \\"pretty much anywhere\\", letting the jockey adjust tactics as the race developed. Roy H entered the 2018 Breeders' Cup Sprint on November 3 at Churchill Downs as the second favorite behind Imperial Hint. Roy H broke poorly and bumped into the starting gate but soon recovered his stride and took the lead while racing four wide around the turn. He continued to draw away down the stretch, winning by lengths over Whitmore, with Imperial Hint finishing third. \\"He charged today,\\" said Lopez. \\"That horse won today with no problem. He knows what's going on today. He dances. He's very happy today.\\" After the race, Miller laughed at the pre-race commentary regarding Imperial Hint, who had won several major races on the East Coast including the Vosburgh Stakes \\"Well, the East Coast horses get the hype, and the West Coast horses get the money,\\" he said. \\"You guys can hype all you want our here. We'll take the money with us.\\" Roy H was named the American Champion Sprint Horse of 2018 at the Eclipse Award ceremonies in January 2019. =2019: seven-year-old season= Roy H started his seven-year-old campaign on January 19, 2019 in the Palos Verdes Stakes, going off as the 1-5 favorite.

Beginning in the 17th century, Caribbean colonies appointed paid lobbyists, who were called colonial agents, to act on behalf of the legislatures in the colonies. These local legislatures represented the interests of the plantation owning class in the colonies. The agents, who lobbied to protect the interests of plantation owners, were often members of the British Parliament. Lillian Penson identified three distinct interest groups in London, who decided to work together: agents from the West Indian colonies, merchants who traded with the colonies and plantation owners who lived in London. This group supported the Molasses Act of 1733, which sought to tax molasses that was shipped to New England from the Caribbean. This tax was supposed to be collected from the American people. When tensions between the American colonies and the British Crown increased in the years before the American Revolutionary War, the West India Interest sided with the Crown. In the 1780s, the British Parliament acted against the wishes of Caribbean plantation owners by banning American ships from ports in the Caribbean colonies. The relationship further deteriorated in 1790s when the British armed Caribbean slaves during the Anglo-French War. The group's influence declined when sugar prices dropped in the late 1820s, which undermined their financial influence. Other factors that undermined the group's influence included the rise of the anti-slavery Whig Party and the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832. They blamed abolitionists for their increasing economic problems and lobbied for \\"compensation\\" until the Slavery Abolition Act was passed in 1833.

It has a single tubular, bright green leaf and up to twenty brownish-green, white and purplish flowers. It is a very rare orchid with only about four hundred plants known. Description Prasophyllum innubum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single bright green, tube- shaped leaf long and wide. The free part of the leaf is long. Between six and twenty flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long. The flowers are brownish-green, white and purplish and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is a shiny green oval shape, long at 45¬∞ to the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, about and points forwards then downwards. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and joined to each other. The petals are more or less linear in shape, long, about wide and have a pink or purplish stripe. The labellum is oblong, white or pink, long, about wide and turns upwards through about 90¬∞ near its middle. The edges of the labellum are wavy and there is a green or whitish callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in January and February. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum innubum was first formally described in 2007 by David Jones and the description was published in The Orchadian from a specimen collected near Brandy Marys in the Bago State Forest near Blowering. The specific epithet (innubum) is a Latin word meaning \\"unmarried\\". Distribution and habitat Brandy Mary's leek orchid grows on stream edges in a small area near Cabramurra and Talbingo. Conservation Prasophyllum innubum is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. The main threats to the population are logging, changes in drainage patterns due to dam water storage, grazing by livestock, feral horses and pigs and weed invasion. The population is not in a conservation reserve.

It is part of the Binhai Cultural Center, being one of its five central attractions.  Architecture and description  The five-level library has a total space of 33,700 square metres.https://www.mvrdv.nl/projects/tianjin-binhai-library It features floor- to-ceiling, terraced bookshelves able to hold 1.2 million books, and a large, luminous sphere in the center that serves as an auditorium with a capacity of 110 people. The library is nicknamed 'The Eye' because the sphere, which appears like an iris, can be seen from the park outside through an eye-shaped opening. In the first week after opening day, approximately 10,000 people a day came, causing queues outside. The first and second floors contain mainly lounge areas and reading rooms. The floors above have computer rooms, meeting rooms, and offices. There are also two rooftop patios. Because of a decision to complete the library quickly and a conflict with what was officially approved, the main atrium cannot be used for book storage; the rooms providing access to the upper tiers of shelving were not built and book spines were printed onto the backs of the shelf space for the opening-day photographs.  Construction  The library was designed by the Rotterdam-based architectural firm MVRDV along with the Tianjin Urban Planning and Design Institute (TUPDI), a group of local architects. Because of a tight construction schedule by the local government, the project went from preliminary drawings to its doors opening within three years. It opened in October 2017.

It took place from 8-9 February 1968, when the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN)'s 2nd Division attacked the Da Nang Air Base as part of the Tet Offensive. The attack was repelled by U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army units. Background On 7 February 1968, the 1st Marine Division commander MG Donn J. Robertson informed III Marine Amphibious Force commander LG Robert E. Cushman Jr. that the PAVN 2nd Division had evaded Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and Republic of Korea Marine Corps positions south of Da Nang and threatened 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines and 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines positions immediately south of Da Nang Air Base. After sharing these concerns at a meeting that day with COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland, Westmoreland ordered 23rd Infantry Division commander MG Samuel W. Koster to make some of his battalions available to the Marines to bolster their defense. It was decided to deploy 2 battalions from the 23rd Division to support the 3/5 Marines near Cau Do on Highway 1. One battalion was to deploy immediately, with the other to deploy the next day. Both battalions would be under the operational control of the 1st Marine Division. On the afternoon of 7 February Marine helicopters deployed the 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment into the hamlet of Duong Son (1) () 2km south of Cau Do. Battle At 03:45 on 8 February, the PAVN began mortaring the Combined Action Program (CAP) E-4 compound in the hamlet of Lo Giang (1) (), 4 kilometers northeast of Duong Son (1) and by daybreak had surrounded the hamlet. At 07:00, MG Robertson moved the 1/6th Infantry to Lo Giang (5) (), 1 km northeast of Lo Giang (1) where they were quickly engaged by another enemy force. MG Robertson then deployed the 2/3 Marines and 3/5 Marines to support the 1/6th Infantry and they were engaged in battle until late afternoon. Meanwhile, a 15-man Marine detachment attempted to move south from Hoa Vang () to relieve Lo Giang (1), but all but 1 were killed. At 15:50, the CAP platoon in Lo Giang (1) was evacuated by Marine helicopters with gunship and air support. PAVN losses were over 150 killed. On the evening of 8 February, the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment was deployed and the Army task force named Task Force Miracle under the command of Col. Louis Gelling established its command near Duong Son. Col Gelling deployed the 2/1st Infantry in blocking positions south of Lo Giang (1). On the morning of 9 February the 2/1st Infantry attacked north, engaging a PAVN force in a 9 hour battle, later finding 46 PAVN bodies and taking one prisoner who revealed that he was from the 3rd Battalion, 31st Regiment, while the forces in Lo Giang (5) were from the Vietcong (VC) 1st Regiment. West of Lo Giang the 2/3 Marines engaged two companies from the 1st Regiment killing 90. Aftermath Marine intelligence reported on 9 February that the PAVN 2nd Division was moving its headquarters back to its usual positions in the Go Noi Island area (). Task Force Miracle continued to patrol the Lo Giang area for 2 days, but on 11 February LG Cushman released control of Task Force Miracle back to the 23rd Infantry Division. U.S. Marine losses were 14 killed. Army losses were 18 killed, while claiming PAVN/VC losses were in excess of 286.

The Gotham Curve was once the sharpest curve on any standard gauge railway line in the UK. The curve, which was situated in the sparsely populated, exposed limestone uplands in the Peak District of Derbyshire, England, was on the Cromford and High Peak Railway.The curve on a 25\\" Edwardian OS map, with modern overlays National Library of Scotland The single-track main line was inherited by British Railways in 1948. It closed in 1967. Description Although sharper curves were present on industrial sidings and harbour railways, the line through the Gotham curve went through an 80 degree curve with a radius of . The curve was subject to a speed limit of and led \\"the platelayer [..] to keep a supply of rail chairs and other spares to hand in case a driver \\"burst the rails\\" when negotiating the curve.\\" It might have once had a steep camber but none was present in 1954 when there were check-rails in place. History The section of line including the curve opened on 29 May 1830. Initially, trains through the curve were horse-drawn, but the intention, as enshrined in the enabling legislation, was also to use steam locomotives, the first of which started work in 1833. Horse-haulage through the curve had finished by the mid-1860s. Diesel shunter 12006 was tested through the curve in 1959, but was considered unsuitable, largely because it was barely able to climb the line's other extreme feature, the Hopton Incline. A further trial took place in August 1966, using Class 08 diesel shunter D3778. The locomotive was rostered to take over from steam from 31 August 1966 but for some reason it did not happen and steam monopolised the curve until closure the following spring. Trains were conventional, but locomotives and rolling stock nevertheless had to be carefully selected. Only short wheelbase wagons, tenders and brake vans were permitted and few locomotives could negotiate the extreme curvature without putting machine and track under unacceptable strain. This led to a limited number of locomotive types using the curve for unusually long periods. Starting in 1931 several NLR 0-6-0Ts were moved from the London area to the line, remaining there until 1956, when they were progressively displaced by a small fleet of J94 0-6-0STs, which worked the stretch until closure. The last NLR loco, No. 58850, was withdrawn in 1960 and has been preserved. Both classes of locomotive, despite having six-coupled wheels, were specifically designed for low-speed, high power dock and shunting work, where they could encounter severe curves and gradients. Passenger services ran through the curve from 1833 to 1876, some were horse-drawn, the rest steam-hauled. Loadings in this sparsely-populated upland area were very light.Moorsom and the Attempt to Revive the Cromford And High Peak Railway Derbyshire Archaeological Journal 1983 see Appendix 1 Evidence of the forms of provision is patchy and inconsistent, with the clearest sources being anecdotal.A journey on the line in 1837 Manchester City NewsA journey on the line in 1854 Derby MercuryA journey on the line in 1883: Williams, Chap IV, p. 99 Google Books Some horse-drawn provision appears to have been based on stagecoaches, with inside and outside provision similar to the 'Dandy' used on the service to . In locomotive-hauled trains passengers were accommodated by attaching a specially adapted guard's van to conventional goods trains; the adaptation consisted of putting some seating in the van's goods section. Like a number of other features on the line, this vehicle was given a name - Fly - inherited from the canal world, though the term appears to have been used interchangeably to mean the vehicle and the train. Passenger traffic was slight and general goods was substantially less than the line's promoters foresaw, especially after the line was effectively bypassed in the 1860s then truncated in 1892. The sparsely populated, largely agricultural area surrounding the curve meant that coal was the only significant inflow and milk the only significant outflow, except for the one traffic which dominated all ‚Äì stone products, notably limestone and burnt lime. This traffic grew, and kept the line open despite its many operating obstacles, of which the curve was but one. Towards the end the curve's significance grew, as quarrying processes became more efficient and rail sought higher payloads the light trains of short wheelbase-only rolling stock kept trains short and composed of small, slow-moving, obsolescent and uneconomic wagons. There was one other traffic, a 19th Century relic, whereby the line carried water. Limestone uplands drain naturally, so, despite the high rainfall, water supply to outlying properties was a problem. Some railway properties needed water, the railway itself needed water and in the 1960s Prestwich Intake Quarry needed water, so it was carried on trains using former locomotive tenders specially adapted by adding buffers at each end and, where a tender originally had six wheels, the centre wheels were removed. This last adaptation helped on the Gotham Curve, but was required to enable such vehicles to pass over the extreme vertical curves at the feet and especially the tops of Sheep Pasture and Middleton Inclines Tanks were mostly replenished from a spring at the foot of Sheep Pasture Incline, then worked up towards as required, but some replenishment took place at Buxton, the tenders being worked southwards onto the High Peak line. This duality ensured continuity of supply if, for example, Sheep Pasture Incline was out of action. From the early 1960s more modern and more capacious six-wheeled tenders started to appear among the traditional vehicles north of Middleton, especially after Middleton Incline closed in 1963. Special trains The Cromford and High Peak Railway was promoted in the 1820s and opened in two stages in 1830 and 1831. By 1900 it had been reduced by half, but the remaining half had many archaic features, of which the Gotham Curve was one. After the Second World War it attracted a wide following among railway enthusiasts, which is reflected in the volume of print and film material;A journey along the line in 1958, Gotham at 4min 48sec from start YouTube it was also reflected in the number of special passenger trains run between 1953 and closure in 1967. As only short-wheelbase rolling stock could be used, participants paid significant monies to travel in guards vans and open wagons. The highlight of such tours was to participate in trains storming the Hopton Incline, but \\"rumbling, grinding and squealing\\" round the Gotham Curve was seen as a key part of the experience.High Peak Railtour 1961, Gotham at 4min 20sec from start YouTubeHigh Peak Railtour March 1967, includes Gotham Sutherland Davenport Legacy In 1971 the Peak Park Planning Board and Derbyshire County Council bought the track bed from north of the site of Hurdlow station, near Buxton, through Gotham Curve to High Peak Junction, near Cromford and turned it into the High Peak Trail, which is now National Route 54 of the National Cycle Network.

Nieto is a controversial pro-Duterte Filipino blogger who is better known by his pen name \\"Thinking Pinoy\\" (lit. thinking Filipino), which is also the title of his blog site. His blogs focuses on partisan politics. He has drawn controversies and faced legal consequences due to his vocal support of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's polarizing policies and personal attacks against the latter's critics. Background =Work and education= Nieto currently serves as a co-host of the podcast of Karambola sa DWIZ 882, a radio and internet podcast program tackling political issues, together with Jonathan dela Cruz, Trixie Cruz Angeles, Conrad Banal and Larry Gadon. Rey Joseph finished high school in 2002 at St. Mary's College of Baliuag. He attended the University of the Philippines Diliman majoring in Mathematics but later dropped from school in 2005. He worked as a reporter at the Sunstar Davao local newspaper in 2010. He worked for a brief time at the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines from July to October 2017. Blogging career Nieto established his blog site, \\"Thinking Pinoy\\" in November 2015. He initially began to write his own political opinions after realizing that he usually does not agree with political views he reads online. When the campaign period for the 2016 Philippine elections began, he decided to start the blog after noting that \\"there was something different in the air\\". He initially expected a readership of 500 people a week. Nieto claimed that his first article registered 10-15 thousand hits and said that his blog's readership ballooned in December 2015 when he made a post tackling the issue of Senator Mar Roxas' degree from University of Pennsylvania. He said that his site crashed 21 times and that particular post registered at least a million hits. Most of the pro-Duterte bloggers register similarly large numbers of engagement. There has been some debate on whether the numbers for pundits such as Nieto were organic/unadulterated or the fruit of astroturfing and white glove weaponization tactics offered by Facebook to political clients. =Notable posts= ;Aquino and P10.6-B senior citizens‚Äô funds On January 5, 2018, The Manila Times journalist Rigoberto Tiglao wrote in his column regarding alleged corruption of the administration of former President Benigno Aquino III citing ThinkingPinoy's articles which he verified from his own sources. It was alleged that Aquino along with budget secretary Florencio Abad, and health secretary, Janette Garin conspired to embezzle P10.6 billion fund meant for the insurance premium of senior citizens and reallocated it to dubious health department projects not sanctioned by the congress which was alleged to be done \\"at best\\" to boost the Liberal Party's campaign in the 2016 elections. Rigoberto Tiglao is an opinion columnist who has been accused of red-baiting, promoting fake news, allowing personal vendettas to find their way into his opinion column, and favoring unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Tiglao is a known apologist of the Marcos family and their regime, despite the fact that the Marcoses are extensively referred to by journalists, reputable researchers, and other empirically reliable sources as one of the most corrupt leaders in the world in recent history. The Manila Times also publishes several of the most prominent and relevant pro-Duterte \\"Die Hard\\" supporters, raising suspicions amongst pro-democracy, press freedom, and human rights activists and thinkers about the paper's ability to provide non-propagandist coverage of current events in the Philippines. Fake news and misinformation Nieto has posted fake news and misinformation multiple times on his blog and Facebook page. *Donald Trump and Antonio Trillianes - in 2017, Nieto made a post where he alleged that US President Donald Trump called Senator Antonio Trillanes a \\"little narco\\" or a drug lord. The senator called the claims in the article \\"fake news\\" and has filed a libel case against Nieto for the post while the blogger claimed that the primary source for the post was Al Pedroche's column in Pilipino Star Ngayon. Pedroche has apologized for the column saying that the interaction between Trump and Trillanes did not take place. * In June 2017, Nieto accused photojournalist Jes Aznar of endangering government troops during the Battle of Marawi by revealing positions to the public via videos posted online. Contrary to Nieto's claims, Aznar posted the videos when the government troops he was embedded with were already out of the area, and that Aznar's video postings were fully sanctioned by the military. Nieto was condemned in posting his false accusations by the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) for endangering Aznar's life via threats and harassment from Nieto's followers. * In November 2017, Nieto created a post misquoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as saying \\"...Theoretically, it is impossible to get (the garbage) back... even if it originally came from Canada\\" in reference to trash shipped to the Philippines from Canada. In fact, Trudeau's actual quote was \\"Even though it originally came from Canada, we had legal barriers and restrictions that prevented us from being able to take it back. Those regulations and those impediments have now been addressed, so it is now theoretically possible to get it back.\\", which is the complete opposite of what Nieto posted. * On March 4, 2018, he cited a falsified 1979 psychiatric report attributed to the late Fr. Jaime Bulatao, SJ on former President Benigno Aquino III. On March 7, The Ateneo de Manila University Department of Psychology condemned the posting and reiterated that the report was a fabrication. On April 27, 2010, Bulatao had already categorically denied having written and signed the report. * On December 28, in his Manila Bulletin column and blog, Nieto claimed that Philippine mainstream media and journalists were spreading fake news for stating that an amendment to the United States Fiscal Year 2020 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill included a prohibition on entry to the United States for foreign government officials that the U.S. Secretary of State had credible information to have been involved in the wrongful imprisonment of Senator Leila De Lima. Philippine Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo however confirmed on December 29 in a radio interview that he had spoken with Philippine Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Manuel \\"Babes\\" Romualdez the entry ban was true. While the approved U.S. Appropriations Act of 2020, signed on Dec. 20 by U.S. President Donald Trump does not itself expressly mention the ban, the act's accompanying explanatory statement in the Division G section states that U.S. Federal Government entities are directed to comply with the directives and instructions of the reports accompanying the State Department appropriation bills of both the House and Senate. This includes the U.S. Senate Committee Report 116-126 which states: \\"Prohibition on Entry.--The Secretary of State shall apply subsection (c) to foreign government officials about whom the Secretary has credible information have been involved in the wrongful imprisonment of:... ...(2) Senator Leila de Lima who was arrested in the Philippines in 2017.\\" On January 22, 2020, Senator Ronaldo \\"Bato\\" dela Rosa confirmed that his travel visa to the United States had indeed been canceled. * On January 18, 2020, Nieto claimed that Ayala Land was only paying ‚Ç±22 per square meter monthly to University of the Philippines for the lease of land of U.P.‚ÄìAyala Land TechnoHub, citing his expertise as a former Mathematics major at said university (which he did not graduate from) to get to this figure. Office of the President of the Philippines spokesperson Salvador Panelo declared that he wanted to review the lease contract between Ayala Land and University of the Philippines after reading about it on Nieto's blog. In actuality, Ayala Land is bound to pay more than ‚Ç±10 billion for the lease of land owned by University of the Philippines and is currently paying ‚Ç±171 per square meter and not ‚Ç±22 as claimed by Nieto and cited by Panelo. * On March 2, 2020, Nieto claimed that Senator Franklin Drilon fell asleep for five to ten seconds during a February 27, 2020 interview with CNN Philippines anchor Pinky Webb. Contrary to Nieto's claim, Drilon was reading documents in front of him and was not sleeping. According to Webb herself on her Twitter account, \\"Here‚Äôs what happened. As I was laying the premise for my question, I saw Sen Drilon look down at the documents he had on the table. I did not see him fall asleep.\\" Inciting violence against journalists On November 3, 2017, Nieto on his radio program Karambola on DWIZ urged then Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque to throw a concrete hollow block at journalist Pia Ranada. The NUJP denounced Nieto for threatening Ranada on air and added that Nieto may have committed a crime. The Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP - Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines) reprimanded Nieto for making a personal attack against Ranada and found him guity of violating the Broadcast Code, in which Article 4, Section 1 states: \\"Personal attacks, that is, attacks on the honesty, integrity or personal qualities of an identified person, institution or group on matters that have no bearing on public interest are prohibited.\\" The KBP also called out Aliw Broadcasting Corporation which runs DWIZ for allowing Nieto to go on air even if he lacked KBP accreditation. Legal Cases Nieto has been allegedly involved in doxxing, and a cyberlibel case has been filed against him by blogger Jover Laurio, the author of Pinoy Ako Blog. In 2018, Nieto was also indicted for libel for posting on his blog that U.S. President Donald Trump called former opposition senator Antonio Trillanes a narco or drug lord. Nieto filed a not guilty plea and refused to comment on the case, telling reporters, \\"Let's just wait for the trial.\\" Government involvement =Bases Conversion and Development Authority= The Bases Conversion and Development Authority reportedly offered Nieto a consultancy post to help it promote its projects especially the major endeavours under the Duterte administration's Build! Build! Build! infrastructure program but the blogger declined the offer. =Department of Foreign Affairs= RJ Nieto was hired in July 2017 by the Department of Foreign Affairs as its social media consultant and was tasked to be its \\"head of strategic communications for migrant workers' affairs\\". He reportedly resigned in November 2017, a week after attending a Senate hearing which discussed fake news. Cultural Criticism It has been noted by Filipino academics such as Jonathan Corpus Ong and Jason Cabanes (in their published report Architects of Networked Disinformation) that the Duterte regime counts on many members of the LGBTQI+ community as cheerleaders because they possess a control of popular vernacular language and codes, as well as an ability to code-switch easily, from high to low language, between genders on multiple social media accounts, between socialist and extreme right policies. The report also states, in its ethnographic profile of a \\"chief disinformation architect,\\" a quote that summarized much of the criticism hurled at RJ Nieto: \\"It is interesting how corruption in mainstream media is used as a moral justification to dispose of institutionalized practice by replacing it with another version‚Äîequally lacking in scruples, and ultimately benefiting themselves. By expressing statements that normalize or even exaggerate evil or corruption in existing public institutions, these ambitious workers imagine themselves as self-styled agents of positive change.\\" It could be reliably argued that RJ Nieto fits the bill as a \\"chief architect of disinformation,\\" as per the qualifications in this report and as per Nieto's touting of his own relevance as a political opinion maker within a regime that has demonstrably used disinformation to assert its positions. Nieto stated at a senate hearing in 2018 that the Department of Foreign Affairs, where he briefly occupied a position before resigning, needed him more that he needed it, clearly stating that he (and by extension, bloggers like him) are more important than the government institutions that they serve. It has become standard practice in the Duterte administration to reward loyalists with government positions, despite public outcry on all levels at the lack of professional qualifications for the posts they are appointed to. Duterte himself stated that he appointed Nieto's close associate and now government official, Mocha Uson, to her position at the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) because he owed it her (according to Filipino social value of \\"utang na loob\\" or debt of gratitude) for offering her services for free during his campaign period. This casts a shadow on Nieto's own appointment to a position at the Department for Foreign Affairs, a post for which he did not possess previous experience or sector-specific understanding of career civil service in the department.

Biography Japanma was born in c.1902 and was one of the first group of Aboriginal people to arrive at the Roper River Mission (now Ngukurr). Aboriginal people sought refuge at the mission following systematic massacres by the organised hunting gangs of the Eastern and African Cold Storage Company. The Roper River Mission in 1938 Arriving to the mission as a young man, he quickly took a great interest in Christianity and was baptised on 11 May 1913 at the mission's first baptismal service at the age of 11. When the Roper River Mission flooded in 1916, Reverend Alf Dyer recorded a humorous account of Japanma, ‚Äòfloating [by] on a large case reading a book without any apparent concern‚Äô. Japanma went on to become a key leader in the church in Ngukurr, being the first recognised Aboriginal evangelist at the Mission. Japanma was of great value to the work of the European Missionaries as a translator, as almost none of them had knowledge of Aboriginal languages. By 1939, there were roughly 75 Aboriginal people on the Mission, mostly children and young people, and an additional 18 who were then classified as ‚Äòhalf- castes‚Äô. The Mission flooded again in January 1940 and while no lives were lost, the mission was destroyed. It was rebuilt five miles upstream at Picnic Point and in 1941, Helen Alder took over the work of Japanma, freeing him to engage in itinerant evangelism at the surrounding cattle stations. James was an avid reader and could recite huge slabs of the Bible by heart. Japanma married Minnie McLoud, an Aboriginal woman from Borraloola. In 1953, Japanma was one of four Roper River men chosen for possible ordination. A controversy over training requirements and a requirement for six years of theological away from the mission prevented Japanma's ordination. Japanma died in 1962 and his work was taken over by Barnabas Roberts. He is buried at Darwin General Cemetery in Jingili.

It is the largest cement manufacturer of Pakistan with a production capacity of 14,000 tons per day. The company has three active plants which are present in Khairpur, Chakwal, Dera Ghazi Khan and Hub, Balochistan. In 1992, Nishat Group acquired the company under privatization scheme. DG Khan cement stand for Dera Ghazi Khan cement. This is due to fact that first plant was setup in southern Punjab city Dera Ghazi Khan. History The company was started in 1986 to cater the cement needs in Pakistan. The plant was supplied by the Ube Industries of Japan. Initially, it was state-owned company under State Cement Corporation of Pakistan providing jobs to thousands of people. The company established their first active plant in southern Punjab city Dera Ghazi Khan and therefore kick-started their production. This was first step to industrialize the Southern region of Punjab, Pakistan. Then, they established their second plant in Khairpur, Chakwal. This increased their production capacity and became one of well performing cement companies of Pakistan. =Expansion= Pakistan has an attractive market of cement industry. In 2015, it was reported local demand for cement increase by 12% in one year and so the DG Khan cement decided to increase their capacity. Pakistani cement demands are increasing with time due to active construction industry. In 2015, it was reported that local demand increased drastically due to Pakistan-China Economic Corridor. With this hike in demand DG Khan setup their third and one of the largest plant of Pakistan in Hub, Balochistan which is on the edge of Pakistani metropolis Karachi. Cement manufacturing plant usually takes two to three years to complete. So, it is expected that this plant's construction will complete in 2018 making DG Khan cement largest cement manufacture of Pakistan. =Acquisition= The government-owned company was acquired by Pakistani business group Nishat Group in 1992 to expand and diversify their business.  Financial Performance  DGKC posted Rs 2.16 billion loss after tax for the fiscal year 2020, which resulted in Rs 4.93 loss per share.

She plays football for Sion Swifts and the Northern Ireland women's national football team. She plays Gaelic games for Antrim GAA.  Club career  McGuinness, who is left-footed, started playing women's football when she was 14 and was chosen by the Linfield secretary to join them. In 2012, she crossed the Belfast's Big Two divide by joining Linfield's Belfast rivals Glentoran Belfast United. McGuinness helped Glentoran to a Women's Premiership and IFA Women's Challenge Cup double in her first season. However she rejoined Linfield after a season despite alleged interest from English club Arsenal Ladies. In August 2020 Sion Swifts announced the double signing of Kirsty McGuinness and her sister Caitlin McGuinness, both from Linfield.  International career In July 2010, she made her debut for the senior Northern Ireland women's national football team in a 3‚Äì0 win over Estonia. She was 15 years and 262 days old. In November 2011 she scored in a shock 3‚Äì1 win over Norway at Mourneview Park. She had previously played for the Northern Ireland women's national under-19 football team and at under-17s level. Gaelic games McGuinness also plays Ladies' Gaelic football for Antrim GAA. In 2012, she was a part of the Antrim team that won the All-Ireland Junior Ladies' Football Championship. She also represented them in the Ulster Women's Intermediate Championship. She is among a small number of sportswomen who have played association football for Northern Ireland and GAA for Antrim. This differed from men's sport where there are traditionally sectarian divides between the historically majority Protestant association football and historically majority Roman Catholic GAA, which is no longer commonplace in women's sport in Northern Ireland. McGuinness would attend Linfield training wearing an Antrim shirt and vice versa. She is a Celtic F.C. supporter and admits she prefers soccer over Gaelic games.

He was born on 18 October 1956. He was 23 years old at the time of the shooting. Judge Sharon Keller wrote the majority opinion for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, calling the circumstances of the coerced confession a \\"harmless error\\". In 2003, the International Court of Justice issued a preliminary injunction against the United States, ordering that Fierro not be executed while the Avena case was pending. The criminal case against him has been controversial because Mexican police in Juarez, Mexico arrested his parents and threatened to torture them unless he confessed. Speaking about the El Paso police, Fierro said: \\"He told me if I signed, then they'd let them go, and if not, they were going to torture them.\\" At Fierro's trial, Juarez and El Paso police denied any wrongdoing. No physical evidence has linked Fierro to the shooting. The conviction was based on his confession and the testimony of a \\"psychologically impaired\\" 16 year old. In February 1979, Texas law enforcement found the body of taxi driver Nicholas Castanon. Mexican police found his cab in Juarez, Mexico. The El Paso Police Department arrested two men suspected of the crime who were later released.

The visit was headed by Chen Ding-nan, the Taiwanese Minister of Justice, with the highlight being the reception by his American counterpart John Ashcroft, Attorney General of the United States of America in the afternoon of 12 July 2002 local time (early morning of 13 July in Taipei time). Because of this visit, Chen became Taiwan's first government official after 1979 (when the United States cut its official diplomatic relations with Taiwan) to be invited into the White House. Alt URL Meetings and visits Other than with John Ashcroft, Chen met with ranking officials from the United States Department of Justice (such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and the United States Department of the Treasury (such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network), in order to discuss cooperation with regards to the legislation surrounding crime, in particular drug trafficking, commercial piracy and global terrorism. The state visit included meetings with members of the United States House of Representatives such as congressmen Jim Sensenbrenner, Representative for the Fifth Congressional District of Wisconsin (at that time also chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) and John Conyers, Representative for the Thirteenth Congressional District of Michigan. Other than visiting Washington, D.C., Chen visited Harvard University and Yale University and observed local community service programs for criminals and private prisons in New York City, Boston, and the City of Los Angeles. Headed by Chen, the Taiwanese delegation also included the director of the Ministry of Justice's Prosecutorial Affairs Department Tsai Pi-yu, counselor to the Ministry of Justice Chang Tse-wei and Kuo Shih-sung, director of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. The meetings were described to have been friendly and with active cooperation. The trip was described as successful, positive and constructive by media and observers. Lead-up The lead-up to the visit was the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters between Taiwan and the United States on 26 March 2002, the first judicial agreement signed between the countries, laying legal foundations for cooperation in crime investigation matters. Reportedly, the lead up for the Agreement were the September 11 attacks, after which the United States Government wanted to take precautionary measures against terrorism, for which it asked for support from numerous countries, including Taiwan. Low-key visit due to the People's Republic of China's influence It was claimed that, since Chen was a Minister of the Government of Taiwan, his visit to Washington and other cities of the United States of America would give rise to protest by the Chinese government and would impact the trilateral relations between the United States, the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. As far as media go, the trip had been characterized as a low-key visit, with neither media in Taiwan nor overseas announcing it loudly. The Chinese channel of the Voice of America cited Manfred Peng (Deputy Head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States at that time) who claimed that it was not communicated whether or not Chen would meet senior officials during this visit, due to the \\"special relationship\\" between Taiwan and the United States by which, so he said, situations are generally not disclosed in advance. A Taiwanese newspaper also reported of such uncertainty, linking the unsureness of being able to meet Ashcroft in relation to the gazing eyes of the People's Republic of China upon the trip. A documentary about Minister Chen details that, from the start, Minister Chen made it clear to the United States Government that he wanted to meet his counterpart, the Attorney General. Until the day before the meeting, it was reportedly unsure if Chen would be able to meet him, being told that the highest official the delegation would be able to meet would be the Deputy Attorney General. Finally the meeting with the Attorney General did occur. While in the United States during his trip, Chen went to the Chinese Department of the Voice of America and was interviewed during its live- broadcast program called \\"ÊôÇ‰∫ãÂ§ßÂÆ∂Ë´á\\" (). Chen's comments about media in Taiwan While answering questions from reporters in Washington, Chen accused the Taiwanese media of not striving for balanced reporting, illustrated by the reluctance of printing corrections and readers' letters, as well as of being immature, irresponsible, of breaching personal privacy and minimum levels of decency and respect. This lashing out created headlines in the Taiwanese media, reportedly overshadowing the coverage of the fact that he had been the first government official to be invited into the White House in twenty-three years. Abolition of the death penalty in Taiwan One item which was communicated through local Taiwanese newspaper is that, during his state visit, Ashcroft announced that Chen had made a policy statement of moving towards abolishing the death penalty but that, because most people in Taiwan at that time disapproved such an abolishment, it would, so he stated, occur as a phased approach, starting with the amending of the mandatory death penalty ().

Franklin was one of the few Jewish women to raise their profile in the suffrage movement. In 1912 she helped her in-laws Laura and Leonard Franklin form the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage which was open to both male and female members. The organisation sought both political and religious rights for women. It was felt that some Jewish people may be more inclined to join this group in preference to an unspecific women's suffrage group. Other members included Edith Ayrton, Hugh Franklin, her sister Lily Montagu and Inez Bensusan. The organisation was generally moderate but it had radical members. Some were responsible for disrupting synagogue services to make their point in 1913 and 1914. They were labelled as \\"blackguards in bonnets\\" by the Jewish community.

The different groups and clans are tightly connected through an ancient social structure which still has a big impact on their society today.  Geography  Grotto of Didimera Map of Viqueque Municipality The Suco is situated in the east of the administrative post of Uato-Lari. In the south, Babulo stretches as far as the Timor Sea; in the west and northwest, the rivers Bebui and Roliu set the Suco apart from the neighbouring Uaitame, Afaloicai and Matahoi. In the north Babulo borders on the Afaloicai territory and in the east it borders on Vessor. The Metauai river forms the border between the Sucos in the northeast and flows into the Timor Sea through Vessoru as the Oiqui. The Borouai, with its source in Babulo, flows further south and forms an estuary at the river border with Vessoru.Ministerium f√ºr Staatsverwaltung und Territorialmanagement: Karte Uato-Laris , Retrieved 25 January 2017.

(portugiesisch; PDF; 323 kB)  Inhabitants and culture  = Overview = Anthropologist Susana Barnes studied the culture and traditions of the residents of Babulo for several years, keeping a record of the interaction between the different clans and their respective ceremonial duties. The following account is based primarily on her paper Origins, Precedence and Social Order in the Domain of Ina Ama Beli Darlari. The Suco of Babulo has a population of 2,187 (2015), 1,113 of whom are men and 1,074 women. The population density is 31 residents per km2. There are 455 private homes in the entire Suco. Nearly 97% of all residents claim Naueti to be their native language. Just under 2% speak Makasae, a few Tetum Prasa, Tetum Terik, Makalero, Fataluku and Waimaha.Ergebnisse des Zensus 2015 f√ºr den Suco Babulo (tetum; PDF) The Makasae-speaking section of the population stood at 24% before the local government reform. The literacy rate among people aged 15 to 24 is 88.32 per cent, outranking the national average as well as the average of the community of Viqueque. Expanding the age bracket to encompass all people aged 15 and over results in a significantly lower rate, with only 57.2 per cent able to read and write, which is still higher than that of the community of Viqueque (55.9 per cent). 40.83 per cent of the population is under the age of 15 (national average: 39.09 per cent), whereas 15.09 per cent are 60 or over (8.19 per cent). The origin of the Aldeias' unification into the Babulo Suco is unknown. The Aldeias are still formed by clans, whose members are closely related to each other. Neither immigration in the later colonialization period nor the transmigration of Indonesians has destroyed this social structure. The center of each Aldeia is a house of worship (Uma Luli), which used to be located at the center of the baha. Babulo's inhabitants lived in these highland settlements before the Indonesian invasion. The inhabitants were traditionally men who were related to each other through the paternal line, along with their wives and children. Each cult house served a purpose within the rituals and social establishment of the clan. The clans are in turn divided into lineages and sub-lineages (Uma kain), each having its own cult house. The relationship between the individual members of the lineages is described as 'older' (kaka) or 'younger' (wari). The 'older' houses are closer to the ancestors, and thus rank higher than the 'younger' houses. The oldest man of the \\"oldest\\" house of every line of descent is called the Na'i (Tetum for ‚ÄûMaster‚Äú) or Bu Dato (Grandfather-Lord). They are considered direct descendants of their ancestors. The \\"oldest\\" houses of the clans traditionally come from the Aldeia chieftains, who are usually sons or nephews of one of the elders. Marriages, alliances and relationships connect the Aldeia line of ancestry to the foremost house. Marriages are supposed to take place beyond their own line of ancestry to form close relationships between the \\"giver of the bride\\" (uma ana) and the \\"taker of the bride\\" (oa sae). However, people are married within the same line of descent or with other close relatives, although this is disapproved of. Furthermore, the Naueti society is divided into Liurai (aristocrats, where the most powerful ruler is also called the Liurai), Reinu or Ata (slaves). The Ata are descendants of former slaves and prisoners of war. Traditionally, marriages between the three classes are forbidden. Resettlements during the Indonesian occupation have led to half of the population having their ancestral roots in the neighbouring Suco of Afaloicai. They form their own Aldeias and don't consider themselves subordinate to the old and traditional Liurai. They are still, through their culture, tied to their native land, but draw a distinction between their current and their former home. Afaloicai and Babulo have a long and common history of social relations, such as marriages for the sake of political alliances. Nonetheless, the inhabitants of Afaloicai are still oftentimes considered immigrants with less claim to the land and other natural resources. Many traditional leaders complain that numerous inhabitants of the Suco, even some members of the foremost clans, are neglecting old rituals previously followed to ensure the fertility of the soil. Additionally, only a small number of people remain who are aware of the history of the Suco and their ancestors' incantations. Immigrants, on the other hand, bring their own venerated traditions and ancestors. The elders of Babulo describe this situation as \\"chaotic\\", which has resulted in many problems and anxieties since the withdrawal of the Portuguese. = Traditional Faith = Funeral of the Liurai of Babulo (2012) The Sacred House in Borulaisoba, the most important of the Aldeia Aha B Uu The majority of the inhabitants of Babulo officially follow the Catholic religion, as in entire East Timor. In the whole commune of Viqueque, only 52 inhabitants professed to following the traditional faith of Timor, worshipping natural spirits and ancestors. Nevertheless, the traditional religion still has a deep impact, although it is emphasised that even before the arrival of the Catholic missionaries, there had never been a worship of \\"rock and tree\\" (uato no kai) but of the God of Creation Wula‚Ä≤ Lara (known also as Ulu Lara). In the faith of Timor, this god created the world and placed chosen people on Earth in order to control (ei) and tame (masi) the land. A long time before these Chosen Ones arrived, people lived without rules and regulations (). From the time the Chosen Ones took over control of the land, behavioural norms and practices for a social and moral order were established. The descendants of the Chosen Ones, the Clan of the Daralari, have the duty to uphold this order by the continuation of the holy (luli) norms and practices. They influence the interplay of the clans and houses and define the rituals and social life.Barnes, S. 38. The rules that are associated with the founding fathers are the most holy. Within the occupation of the land they were responsible for the naming of the hills, rocks, rivers, springs, forests and fields, and began to use nature and its resources. This created the basis of the relationship with the bu‚Ä≤u, the original owners of the land or so-called guardians, who occupied Earth. The belief in the invisible earth that is occupied by the bu‚Ä≤u in various forms is still widespread today. The most powerful amongst those in the faith are the independent and untamed \\"owners\\" (of the land and the natural resources), who can assume the shape of a human or an animal. They rule over processes of nature and are able to influence the relationships between the people and the land. If people do not respect the luli order and prohibitions, negative consequences, for example, illnesses and even death might result in the imaginations of many inhabitants. To avoid this, one needs the help of the eldest to appease the bu‚Ä≤u. In order to please the bu‚Ä≤u and to gain access to the natural resources, the inhabitants of Babulo \\"follow in the footprints\\" of the ancestors with special rituals, incantations and sacrifices. The spirits of the ancestors have also become part of nature. Places where they are believed to assemble are considered sacred. The deeds of some of the ancestors are recounted in local legends. They were partly connected with great sacrifices, and even death. Some of these deeds include the first harvest, the protection of the borders and the preservation of the land from natural disasters.Barnes, S. 39. The relationship between the living and the ancestors is reciprocal. There are rituals involving the whole community and the individual clans throughout the year that include incantations and sacrifices to the ancestors.Barnes, S. 39 & 40. The masi eka rae rea ena (\\"washing of the corn leaves\\") ceremony is held in small groups in the fields just before the beginning of the harvest. It is held to ask the Owner of the Field (rea bu'u) to watch over the harvest. The ritual transforms the corn from ba'ina (forbidden and sour) to masi (tamed, edible and sweet). It is believed that rea bu'u can take the form of mice, insects, plant parasites and diseases, and destroy the crops. The ceremony involves other bu'u, who, as ancestors, were the first to farm the land. Eggs, rice, and meat form part of the sacrifice, which is laid on the edges and in the center of the field. The rest is shared among those present at the ceremony. Occasionally clothing and Tais are sacrificed, as the spirits and ancestors share the same human needs as the mortals. = Beli and Daralari = Uatosoba, the most sacred house in the Suco. It belongs to the Daralari Aldeia. The highest spiritual and ritual authority is formed by the elders of the Daralari. According to them, the Daralari used to hold the secular power but willingly gave it away to the other clans in order to \\"pass over into the dark\\". It is said that they did this in order to protect the secrets of their land from \\"the outsiders\\", namely the colonialists and the Catholic Church. Extended family members and immigrant groups were also integrated into their social structures, thus preventing any revolt against the powers that be. By passing over into the Spiritual Power, one stands \\"above all things\\"Barnes, p. 30. and has the authority over the secular power.Barnes, p. 32. The elders of the Daralari know all the spiritual secrets. They know the history of their ancestors' arrival and of the first settlement, the founding of the local houses and the arrival of the later groups. They know the old conflicts, alliances, treaties, and oaths (juramento) between the Suco and its neighbours. They also know the ancient rights of land use and the territorial boundaries. However, the most important knowledge is the names of spirits and guardians who control the access to forests, fields, and water. Access to this knowledge is limited to only a select few.Barnes, p. 37 & 38. The \\"oldest\\" houses of Beli and Daralari can be traced back to two brothers, whose direct lineage derives from the mythical Founder of the ancient Realm of Bubulu. According to the stories of the Daralari people, the mythical ancestors came from the sea and took over \\"the entire land, touched by the Sun\\". The ancestral names of both Aldeias' lineages are held sacred and therefore must not be spoken out loud. They derived from the origin of the houses and are kept secret from outsiders. The names of modern Aldeias are used in everyday life and during local ceremonies. The ruling houses of Daralari are also called Uma Buti (white house) and Uma Ita (black house).Barnes, p. 27‚Äì28. The associated shrines were rebuilt in 2000, once the Indonesian occupation had ended. Although the Uma Buti shrine is owned by the Daralari, it belongs to the entire community of the Suco. Uma Ita, the lower-ranked shrine, is referred to as the ruling house, where the traditional symbols of the Daralari political power (rotan) were kept to be later distributed to subordinate houses. Both shrines keep sacred looms, which once belonged to the legendary ancestors. It is believed that the looms carry the essence of the ancestors, and that the ancestors themselves live within certain parts of the shrines. During ceremonies, food, water, betel nuts (bua), betel leaves (malu) and other offerings are deposited in these sacred locations, and are later distributed back to the community. The nuts and leaves are said to have special protective powers. During community ceremonies and healing rituals, they serve as a symbol for community members and as protection for outsiders.Barnes, p. 41. Beli has only one main house, simply referred to as Um Luli (sacred house). According to the local legend (Naueti: tete bo'ona, literally the oldest story) the brothers are said to have lived near the Baha Liurai (The Hill of the Ruler). However, the brothers started fighting, as the elder Beli was said to have abandoned his duties, much to the younger Daralari's dismay. Thus the elder brother lost his privileges and had to abandon the Sacred Land, while Daralari rose to be the leading lineage of the Ancestors.Barnes, p. 27‚Äì28. Note: The detailed reproduction of the legend can be found here. Wai Malu (water and betel nut) - a gift from the giver of the bride's (or the giver of life) family to the family who receives the bride during the inauguration of a sacred house. It symbolizes the blessing of the giver of the bride. The leading houses of the Aldeia still refer to each other as \\"older\\" (kaka) and \\"younger\\" (wari), and see themselves as brothers, whereas the other inhabitants of the \\"land of the ancestors\\" who joined the Aldeia through marriage and other alliances are called Ina Ama Beli Daralari (mother father Beli Daralari). The leading lineage is given the title rea bu‚Ä≤u (Lord of the Land/Owner of the Land) in order to honour their position as seniors. Other names used in the formal and ritual language are \\"Ruler of the Land\\" and \\"Rock of the Land\\". Nowadays, the \\"Lord of the Land\\" is personified by the Bu Dato, the leader of the Daralari clan. He is supported by two other elders from the Daralari. He \\"sits and watches\\" over the sanctuaries of the ancestors in the main cult houses of the Daralari, the white house and the black house. The \\"Lord of the Land\\" is the supreme servant of the land of the ancestors. The elders of the Daralari emphasise that the former borders of their territory reached further than those of the Suco. It was only during colonialism that the region was narrowed down to the benefit of allies of Portugal. The Daralari belong to the original territory in the north and north east. Its inhabitants are called ki butana (people of the white children) and ki itana (people of the black children). These groups can roughly be put on the same level as the leading lineages of Lia Sidi (ki itana) and Balabasiba, Aldeias in the Suco Vessuro (ki butana). They are connected to the Daralari through marriage. According to local legends, the realm of Builo (nowadays an Aldeia in Ossorua) in the northwest is considered a rival of Babulo. At one time the Daralari fought an intense and brutal battle against them about drawing the borderlines between the two powers.Barnes, p. 29. The Portuguese colonial masters are said to have appointed a descendant of the realm of Luca as the superior ruler of Uaitame and Vessoru to mediate between the opponents. The regions along the coastal plains situated west and east of the region of Daralari and Beli are nowadays dominated by descendants of immigrants from Luca. In the southwest the territorial claims of Daralari include the region of the Lugassa river, although the people are very cautious about making public claims in order to uphold the peace in the region. According to Babulo, the Naueti speakers in Beaco (Suco Maluru) are descendants of that place. Their ancestors were brought to the coast as prisoners of war, exchanged for firearms. Nowadays, the land of the Daralari is shared among its five most powerful houses. Rivers, hills and rocks mark the boundaries. These territories are not interconnected, but mirror the traditional shifting land cultivation. Access to these territories is passed on from the founding ancestors to their direct descendants. In order to continue using the land, members of the houses have to keep their ritualistic and communal duties up. Otherwise, they risk provoking the wrath of the ancestors, which may bring misfortune, sickness or even death. By \\"passing over into the dark\\" the Daralari transferred the task of land cultivation as well as watching over natural resources (lai bosa, lai wai) to a subordinate house (um kain) of Daralari, the Uma kabo. At a later date, a Kabo Rai, a primary representative of the Uma kabo, asked the Bu Dato for a symbol of his power. In response, a Makaer Luli, an expert in rituals, was placed at his side. In addition to supervising land and water usage, the Kabo Rai also enforces seasonal harvesting restrictions on certain products, exacts tributes for community ceremonies, and imposes penalties for ignoring the rules. When implementing these tasks, he is assisted by representatives of two other subordinate houses of the Daralari: Asu Rati Reino and Asu Rati Liurai. The Makaer Luli accompanies the tasks spiritually. Not only is he the leader in community rituals, but also an intermediary capable of communicating with the spiritual realm, as well as a guardian of sacred relics kept in the sacred house, the Uma luli of Borolalo. This is the place where the ancestors are said to have settled first after their arrival from the sea. = Aha B Uu and Cota Nisi = Inauguration of the holy house of Ahabu'u The animistic gravesite in Nahasaka The secular leader of the Babulo (Liurai) traditionally originates from either the Aha B Uu or Cota Nisi Aldeias. They represent two lines of the same lineage, called Burmeta, whose patriarchal ancestor is said to have been a man named Boru Buti. The name Burmeta derives from the name of the Matebian in Makasae, where the mountain Bere Meta is also referred to as \\"The Great Black Man\\". According to Daralari lore, the Burmeta are descendants of warriors (asuwain), who arrived in Babulo eight generations previously from the region east of the Matebian, though this claim is debatable. Some sources claim that they had been banished from their ancestral land. The Burmeta are said to have gained their current leadership in the region through their military power and strategic marriages.Barnes, p. 26. According to the Daralari, the Burmeta once camped on the Baha Liurai on their way west to become the vassals of the Luca Empire. In order to forestall the alliance with the powerful neighbour, the Daralari are said to have offered to settle in the Burmeta land, for which they would take over defence of the borders (lai reinu, lai rea, \\"protect the people, protect the land\\"). The Daralari gave them the title ana bo'ona, ana tadana (the oldest and wisest son). Another name known to have been used was ita mata, kai hene (\\"doors and gates\\"), Guardian of the Gate. The Burmeta trace their leadership claim (ukun, \\"to lead/to reign\\") from a staff (rota), which they received from the ruler of the Viqueque. Aha B Uu, the most important sacred house, is located in Borulaisoba. A Makaer Luli (\\"Guardian of the Saints\\") watches over the house. This is where the regalia and other sacred objects are kept. When Babulo came under Portugal's reign, the leader of the Burmeta, as the ruler of the area, was awarded the military title of Lieutenant Colonel (Portuguese: Tenente Colonel). Since then, the village chiefs (Chefe de Suco) have come from the ranks of the Burmeta. Under the Portuguese colonial administration, he was the link to the local population. He was responsible for local disputes, tax collection, and recruitment of a labor force. Nowadays the Chefe de Suco is an elected office. = Roma = The Aldeia Roma is often called \\"Aldeia without land\\". It was founded after the independence of East Timor and consists mainly of the Makasae. The majority of their relatives (Laka Roma) are said to be descendants of slaves (Ata) who came from Quelicai and spoke Makasae. In the meantime, the Laka Roma themselves speak Naueti, having integrated with the indigenous population. According to legend, the Laka Roma were originally servants of a Liurai of the Burmeta, who was in exile in Quelicai. When his family called him back home and made him the ruler, he brought along his followers, who latched onto him like \\"seeds of long grass\\". This is the meaning of laka roma in Makasae. In the past, they served the ruling families of Aha B Uu, Cota Nisi and Daralari. They first herded the water buffalos of their masters and later started to cultivate the land that was situated near the pastures of the buffalos.Barnes; S. 33. = Immigrants from Afaloicai = The most recent group of immigrants comes from neighbouring Afaloicai and arrived in Babulo in three successive waves. The oldest group from the Aldeias Buibela and Lena entered the Suco in the 1930s in the hope of finding land. It is highly likely that these were refugees of the conflict over the fall of the Afaloicai empire. According to local records, Liurai Gregorio from Lena reached Babulo just before the arrival of the Japanese (1942, cf. Battle of Timor). He arrived in Babulo sounding fanfares, drums and flutes and set up camp on sacred land (rea luli) near Baha Liurai. Shortly thereafter a sickness spread among the newcomers, which can be traced back to this breach of taboo. So Gregorio asked the Daralari for permission to settle within their Suco. Marriage consolidated this newly formed alliance and Gregorio, the new son-in-law, was permitted to enter a place known as Tua Rae Laleo (\\"shelter of palm wine leaves\\"). He and his people received farming land in the vicinity of Uato-Lari Leten and Kampung Baru. .Barnes; S. 34. As oa sae (giver of the bride) the family of Gregorio pledged to provide the Daralari with goods and services. But the Daralari point out that while Gregorio and his family merely have the rights to use the land, it is in fact still controlled by the \\"Lord of the Land\\".Barnes; S. 35. After World War II the Portuguese pursued a policy of agricultural development in their colony. They ordered the village chiefs to organise teams to farm the land for the colonial government. As a result, a second wave of immigrants from Afaloicai and the area surrounding Mt. Matebian arrived in the Suco in the 1950s and 1960s, initially working as seasonal labourers on the rice fields constructed on the coastal plains of Uato-Lari. They too eventually settled permanently in the area. Many of them benefited from the family bonds they shared with those immigrants who had arrived and settled there earlier. The third wave of immigrants was forcefully relocated to Babulo by the Indonesians after the resistance base on the slopes of the Matebian was destroyed in 1979, forcing many civilians to submit to the invaders. In contrast to Burmeta and Laka Roma these new immigrants are not familiar with, or embedded in, traditional community structures. Instead they continue their own distinct hierarchies and clans. They are still frequently perceived as temporary co-inhabitants by the native population, as well as labelled \\"people using the land for agricultural and gardening purposes\\" at ceremonies and rituals. = Baha Liurai Festival = Back in the village with the sacrifices of the Baha Liurai Festival Every seven to fifteen years, the Baha Liurai Festival of the Naueti takes place in Babulo on the eponymous \\"Sacred Hill\\" of the region. The festival has not taken place since 1974 because such animistic ceremonies were prohibited by the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999). The first Baha Liurai Festival after the occupation took place in November 2003.Susana Barnes: Customary renewal and the pursuit of power and prosperity in post-occupation East Timor: a case-study from Babulo, Uato Lari, Monash University, 2017. (The date is specified incorrectly as 2004 several times.). Another festival followed in 2015.

History When dealing with trans-regional conflicts, the complex system of clan alliances repeatedly lead to partisan fronts running between clans of the Suco and the entire administrative post of Uato-Lari. Thus the descendants of the Burmeta regard the ruling family of Afoloicai, the so-called Buibela/Lena, as their \\"younger siblings\\". Some members of the ruling house, for example, benefited greatly from the Indonesian occupation (1975-1999), jumpstarting their political and economic careers on a local and national level. Some of them even took part in the Viqueque rebellion.Barnes, S. 36.Barnes, S. 37. Due to repeated eruptions of internal conflicts Uato-Lari is considered a trouble spot.Fundaisaun Mahein: The Everlasting Trouble in Uatulari, 24. April 2012 The last major insurrection against Portuguese colonial power was staged in 1959. This uprising even included the rulers of the Burmeta. After the insurrection had been suppressed, many Naueti lost their estate and cattle, which the Portuguese handed over to loyal Timorese, mostly Makasae.Ernest Chamberlain: The 1959 Rebellion in East Timor: Unresolved Tensions and an Unwritten History , last checked on 7 September 2013. Supporters of the Timorese Democratic Union defeated by Fretilin during the civil war in August 1975 later became collaborators working with the Indonesians and saw their chance for revenge. Funeral of the housekeeper of the sacred house of Aha B Uu Natural gas fuels eternal flame in southern Babulo After the start of the invasion in 1975, Indonesians entered Uato-Lari through Beaco in late 1976. A large part of the population fled their homes and sought shelter from the air raids. Some only managed to stay away for a few days, others fled for several months, building makeshift shelters and even planting fields. Others found refuge in the resistance base on the Matebian until its fall in 1978. The population slowly returned to the Suco by late November 1979. Indonesian settlers forcibly relocated most of the natives to gain more control. Uato- Lari (Leten) was the administrative center of the administrative office in the first half of the 20th century, until it was transferred to Uato-Lari in Matahoi Suco by the Indonesians. A relocation camp was established in Afaloicai, near Uato-Lari Leten.‚ÄûChapter 7.3 Forced Displacement and Famine\\" (PDF; 1,3 MB) from \\"Chega!\\"-Report on the CAVR People from all six Uato-Lari Sucos and from the Baguia and Quelicai subdistricts were interned there. For the first few months, they were guarded by the Indonesian military and their East Timorese supporters, and they were not allowed to leave certain areas without escort. Accommodation and food, as well as access to fields and gardens, was limited. In the early 1980s, a new wave of settlement was started along the main streets in Uato-Lari Leten/Afaloicai, which became known as Kampung Baru. Since the restrictions on selecting a residence were still in place in the 1980s and early 1990s, fields and gardens that were further away could not be selected. Some people even decided to renounce their claims to land, as they feared or did not want to be suspected of collaboration with the Falintil rebels. The lack of land meant that all areas were used for cultivation, regardless of the traditional rules. The destruction of the clan structures and the restrictions on movement obstructed the ritual conversation with the ancestors. Ceremonies were banned, thus contributing to the collapse of the Suco's social system. Part of the structure was only preserved due to the Aldeias resettlements largely being in joint settlements. The Beliand Daralari, for example, came to the Aliambata area, which is located near several sacred structures, such as the \\"Eternal Flames\\". The Chefe de Suco from the Aha B Uu Aldeia also moved there with his family. The Elders of the Daralari continued to perform simplified versions of the usual ceremonies. Since independence, the older population has been moving back to the old villages, while the younger generations have stayed in the Indonesian settlements, as there is usually a better access to education and health care. Many also live in temporary accommodation near the fields during planting and harvesting. After the 2007 parliamentary elections of East Timor had been held and Xanana Gusm√£o had assumed office, civil unrest erupted, instigated by supporters of the defeated Fretilin party. An unspecified number of people fled from their homes and made their way to Mount Babulo. Over 900 inhabitants of Uato-Laris took refuge in Uatucarbau, others in the town of Viqueque.Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (PDF; 464 kB) In early July 2010 flash floods destroyed 95 buildings in the town of Aliambata. Costodio Silveiro Fernandes, the Chefe de Suco, asked the government to relocate the people affected.Televizaun Timor-Leste: Ninety five houses destroyed by flood, 6. Juli 2010.  Politics  Mario Lisboa was elected Chefe de Suco in the 2004-2005 local elections in East Timor. He is from the Aldeia Cota Nisi. Just like in other parts of the country only representatives of the \\"leading lineage\\" were eligible for election as Chefe de Suco. Costodio Silveiro Fernandes won the 2009 local elections in East Timor, although he is not a member of the traditional leading family. Mario Trindade from Aha B Uu Aldeia was elected Chefe de Suco in 2016.  Economy, infrastructure and living conditions  According to the census of 2015, 2.70% of the inhabitants were considered as unemployed, a further 45.02% were registered as inactive, as they were retired or their personal needs depended on agriculture, for example. 43.1% of the households farmed only for their personal needs, 56.2% also sold a small part, only 0.7% produced primary agricultural products for trade. They cultivate manioc, maize, sweet potatoes, beans and other vegetables and roots. Wet rice is cultivated at the Bebui, dry rice on the higher levels. In addition, there are coconut and lightnut cultivating areas which allow many families to earn an income. Families also fish and hunt (illegally). The 2015 census also records that 3800 chickens, 1300 pigs, 950 sheep, 770 goats, 275 horses, 940 beef und 480 water buffalos were kept in the Suco.Barnes, S. 23‚Äì27. In 14.07% of the households there are tools to manufacture Tais, East Timors woven clothes. There is a primary school in both Uai Cai as well as in Aliambata and a medical station in Uai Cai. Most of the residential buildings in the Suco are still simple cottages. At the time of the census, only 19.6% had solid outer walls, at least 58.5% had a roof made of modern materials. 26.6% of the households had access to sanitary facilities, 35.4% to a clean water source and 51.9% an electricity supply. 90.11% used wood as an energy source for cooking, 7.91% electricity. The living conditions for the inhabitants in these sectors have improved since 2010.Results of the 2010 Census for the Suco Babulo (tetum; PDF; 8,4 MB) 79.56% of the households of Babulo possessed a telephone, 19.56% a TV, 9.01% a radio, 13.19% a motorbike, 0.44% a car and 1.98% a computer with Internet access.

He established a natural history store and founded the periodical Random Notes on Natural History (1884‚Äì86). After selling off his natural history store in 1896 he served as a curator of the Roger Williams Park Museum and served as a State Entomologist. He was the first to note the differences between the willet populations in North America, leading to the description of the subspecies inornata by William Brewster. Cover letter for the shop, from Mr Southwick's own archives, given by his great great grand daughter Cover of Random Notes on Natural History (1886) Southwick was born in Newburyport to James M. Southwick and Sarah Martin and went to study at local public schools before moving to Providence at the age of sixteen. Southwick helped run a dry goods store that his uncle Jacob H. Martin had established but he kept a small stock of specimens with a hobby interest in natural history. In 1876 he met nineteen year old Frederick Tingley Jencks who had gathered the skills of taxidermy from J.W.P. Jenks of Brown University. Continuing to work in his uncle's store, Southwick partnered with Jencks to set up a store, named Southwick & Jencks' Natural History Store, on December 1, 1876, that dealt in natural history specimens. They sold minerals, eggs, bird skins, tools and supplies for taxidermists and naturalists. Jencks spent his time running the store and collaborated with Robert Ridgway, with the latter having a right to pick any rare specimens first. In 1886 Jencks suffered from an eye ailment and quit the firm leaving Southwick to partner with J. William Critchley, formerly employed by Henry A. Ward in his taxidermy company. Cover letter for the shop, from Mr Southwick's own archives, given by his great great grand daughter In 1894 the firm was sold off to Walter A. Angell and Harry A. Cash who renamed the store to Angell & Cash. Southwick then became a curator at the Roger Williams Park Museum in Providence in 1896. Here he set up a collection of the birds of the region which he called the \\"Rhode Island Room\\" and also took a special interest in applied entomology. As State Entomologist and member of the Tree Protection Society he took a special interest in gypsy moths, elm leaf beetles and the San Jose scale which were threats to the local trees and crops. He was also a member of other groups including the Audubon Society, the Tree- Protection Society, the Rhode Island Horticultural Society and St. John's AF & AM Lodge. Suffering from poor health he went to Rhode Island Hospital on May 26, 1904 and died of heart failure on June 3rd. The North American subspecies of the willet, inornata which differed from the nominate subspecies, was first noted by Southwick and formally described by William Brewster.

She is the widow of Governor of New York Mario Cuomo and mother of current Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo and CNN presenter Chris Cuomo. The founder of the child advocacy group Mentoring USA, Cuomo was inducted to the National Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame in 2017. Early life and education Cuomo was born Mattia Raffa in New York in 1931 to parents, Mary (n√©e Gitto) Raffa (d.1995) and Carmelo \\"Charles\\" Raffa (d.1988), who had immigrated to the United States from Sicily. After arriving in the United States in 1927, her father Charles worked to obtain his own firm, making supermarket shelves and refrigeration units, and went on to invest in real estate. Cuomo is the middle child of four siblings, with older brothers Frank and Sam and younger brother Joseph and sister Nancy. Cuomo's mother attempted to register her daughter for kindergarten at a Brooklyn elementary school. However, the principal and school registrar threw both out of the registration because her mother could only speak Italian at the time. Years later, Cuomo recalled the registrar yelling, \\"Get Mrs. Raffa out of here and tell her she can come back when she can speak English,\\" at her mother. During elementary school, Raffa's teachers called her Matilda, rather than her birth name, which was Mattia, which she accepted initially out of fear. The name stuck and she has used Matilda ever since. Cuomo attended Midwood High School. A capable student who was accepted at Columbia Teachers College, Brooklyn College, and Hunter, she was persuaded by family to attend school closer to home out of concerns for her safety. She further pursued her studies in teaching at St John's University in Queens, graduating in 1954 from St. John‚Äôs Teachers College. Matilda Raffa Cuomo met Mario Cuomo in 1951 in the cafeteria at St. John's University in Queens where they were both enrolled in school. The pair married on June 5, 1954. Cuomo worked as a teacher and supported her husband while he completed law school at St John's, graduating with a Juris Doctor degree in 1956. Reported as \\"one of the great love stories,\\" their close public and private partnership lasted 64 years until Mario's death in 2015. Notable achievements Cuomo served as a Second and First Lady of New York State (between 1979 and 1994) where she was highly active in advocating for women, children, and families. She created initiatives that mentored children at-risk, facilitated finding long term homes for foster children, and strengthened families through providing education including nutrition and immunization programs. Cuomo founded the New York State Mentoring Program in 1984 with the aim of creating one-on-one mentoring opportunities for children and young adults. The state run program served over 10,000 students and was active with Cuomo as chair until 1995. After the New York State program was discontinued, she transitioned the initiative into Mentoring USA, an international nonprofit child advocacy organization serving to create mentor relationships for youth ages 7‚Äì21. The New York State Mentoring Program was reinstated in 2015. She also chaired the New York State Decade of the Child initiative. To help support her efforts to advocate for mentoring, Cuomo compiled and edited the book \\"The Person Who Changed My Life: Prominent Americans Recall Their Mentors,\\" with proceeds going to the Mentoring USA nonprofit organization. Her mentorship book, first published in 1999, was reprinted in 2002 and 2012 featuring a foreword by Hillary Clinton, and later recorded as an audio book in 2016. Personal essays on mentoring by Joe Torre, Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Nora Ephron, General Colin Powell, and Cory Booker are included in her book. Cuomo has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss her work in support of mentoring programs. Cuomo co-chaired the Governor‚Äôs Commission on Child Care and chaired the NY Citizens‚Äô Task Force on the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. She led New York‚Äôs role in the UN‚Äôs World Summit for Children in 1990 and the USA‚Äôs ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Awards and recognition Cuomo has received numerous honors for her lifelong work as an educator and advocate for women, children, and families. In 1994, she was presented with the International Fellowship Hall of Fame award by the Coalition for Italo- American Associations in honor of her humanitarian efforts as an advocate for children. In 2010, she received the Lewis Avenue Alumni Legacy Award from St. John's University. Cuomo was honored in 2011 with the Champion for New York's Children and Families Award by the Maternity and Early Childhood Foundation in Albany, New York. She was the distinguished honoree in 2016 at the 75th Anniversary Jubilee for Midwood High School. Cuomo was the recipient of the first Liberty Partnerships Program Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017 for her work to improve the lives of New York's children through education and mentorship. In 2017, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. \\"Matilda's Law\\" On March 20, 2020, her son, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, announced a protective order for people over 70 in the state in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. He called it \\"Matilda's Law\\" in honor of his mother, and appealed to all citizens to think of their mothers in abiding by the restrictions.  Personal life  Cuomo and her late husband Mario had five children together, daughters Margaret, Maria, and Madeline, and sons Andrew and Christopher. Her eldest son, Andrew Cuomo, is New York‚Äôs 56th governor. Cuomo's daughter Maria Cuomo Cole is an award-winning film producer of Newtown and The Invisible War. Her youngest son is television journalist Chris Cuomo, a CNN newscaster. Daughter Margaret Cuomo is a noted physician specializing in radiology.

He is buried in Dean Cemetery.Obituary Robert Goodsir. British Medical Journal. 1895;1:232 = Remains = Between 1859 and 1949, skeletal remains representing at least 30 individuals were discovered on King William Island, and most were buried locally. In 1869, American explorer Charles Francis Hall was taken by local Inuit to a shallow grave on King William Island containing well-preserved skeletal remains and fragments of clothing.Woodman, D.C. Unravelling the Franklin Mystery: Inuit Testimony. Montreal: McGill-Queens University Press, 1991 These remains were repatriated and interred beneath the Franklin Memorial at Greenwich Old Royal Naval College, London. The remains were thought to be those of an officer due to the remnants of a silk vest in which the body had been clothed and a gold tooth filling.Owen, R., The Fate of Franklin. London, Hutchinson, 1978. After examination of the remains by the eminent biologist Thomas Henry Huxley,Huxley, T.H., 1872. Report on Skeleton. Imperial College Archives, Huxley Papers 33.70. Imperial College, London. the Admiralty concluded that the remains were those of Henry Le Vesconte, a lieutenant on HMS Erebus. A subsequent examination in 2009 of the \\"well-preserved and fairly complete skeleton of a young adult male of European ancestry\\"Mays, S., et al., New light on the personal identification of a skeleton of a member of Sir John Franklin‚Äôs last expedition to the Arctic, 1845, Journal of Archaeological Science (2011), doi:10.1016/j.jas.2011.02.022 included a facial reconstruction that showed \\"excellence of fit\\" with the face of Harry Goodsir, as portrayed in his 1845 daguerreotype. Strontium and oxygen isotope data from tooth enamel were consistent with an upbringing in eastern Scotland but not with Lt. Le Vesconte's upbringing in southwest England. A further clue suggesting these might be Goodsir's remains was a gold filling in a premolar tooth, unusual at that time. Goodsir's family were friendly with Robert Nasmyth, an Edinburgh dentist with an international reputation for such work. Harry's brother John had served as dental apprentice to Nasmyth.Lindsay L.

Overview  Tane maku Hito was a Japanese proletarian literary magazine published in Akita Prefecture, and later Tokyo, between 1921 and 1923.  Background  Much left-leaning literature had been produced in Japan going back to the beginning of the century. With a few noted exceptions, however, these works tended to be, as Japanese literary historian and critic Donald Keene wrote, \\"immature and sentimental\\". Tane maku Hitos founder, ≈åmi Komaki, a young man from Tsuchizaki (ÂúüÂ¥é, a small town in Akita Prefecture), studied in France as a teenager, and he spent World War I there. There, he was heavily influenced by the pacifist movement and, later, the left-leaning Clart√© group led by Henri Barbusse, Anatole France and others. Komaki personally promised Barbusse that he would organize an equivalent movement when he returned to Japan.  Publication history  The first Tane maku Hito was founded by Komaki and his friends Y≈çbun Kaneko (ÈáëÂ≠êÊ¥ãÊñá) Kenz≈ç Imano (‰ªäÈáéË≥¢‰∏â) and others in Tsuchizaki in February 1921, and lasted for a scant three issues. ≈åmi had recently returned to Japan having participated in Barbusse's anti-war movement. These writers were later joined by Takamaru Sasaki (‰Ωê„ÄÖÊú®Â≠ù‰∏∏) and Masatoshi Muramatsu (ÊùëÊùæÊ≠£‰øä), and the magazine was revived in Tokyo in October. The magazine had an internationalist and anti-militarist outlook, and regularly published literary criticism that emphasized art and literary movements as aspects of the liberation movement. It ceased publication in October 1923, due to government pressure following the Great Kant≈ç Earthquake. Its final issue, as well as the supplement Tane-maki Ki (Á®ÆËíî„ÅçË®ò), were heavily critical of the massacre of Koreans and socialists in the aftermath of the earthquake. In total, 21 issues were published, of which four had been banned by government censors before the earthquake.  Contents  Each issue of Tane maku Hito included an \\"oath\\" that, in (perhaps deliberately) obscure language, expressed apparent support of the Russian Revolution.  Reception and legacy  Tane maku Hito is generally credited with launching the proletarian literature movement in Japan. Reprints of the magazine were published in 1961 and 1986.

Among his designs are three buildings for the National Maritime Union, located in New York City, originally commissioned in 1958 and built between 1964 and 1968. He also designed approximately 40 homes in the New Orleans metropolitan area and various other projects for the National Maritime Union. Personal life and education Ledner was born in Bronx, New York, and moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, as a young child. His mother was noted pastry chef Beulah Levy Ledner. His grandparents on his mother's side are from Hungary. Following his graduation from the New Orleans Public School System, Ledner enrolled in the Tulane University School of Architecture. He left college in his second year to volunteer for the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, where he served as a navigator with the rank of second lieutenant. While stationed at Davis-Monthan Field near Tucson, Arizona, Ledner used his leave time during his military career to visit Taliesin West, which was one of the schools run by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Following his military career, Ledner earned his architectural degree at Tulane University graduating in 1948. He then supplemented his architectural education with studies at Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Spring Green School. Following completion of his formal education, Ledner married Judy, who was a stage actress, whom he subsequently had three children. His daughter Catherine Ledner became a noted photographer. Architectural career Ledner started his independent architectural career in 1951, spending most of his professional career in New Orleans. Through his career as an architect, he followed the \\"design-build\\" approach in which the architect remains involved during the construction phase of the project. In this approach, Ledner devised uncommon approaches to structure and uses of construction materials. By remaining involved in the construction phase of the project, he further could revise details in ways not possible in conventional approaches in which the architect is minimally involved in the construction phase of a project. At times, his designs were characterized as quirky while also functional and expressive. Through this approach to architecture, Ledner developed architectural styles that were uniquely his and distinct from his mentor Frank Lloyd Wright. =National Maritime Union projects= In 1954, Ledner designed and built the National Maritime Union building in New Orleans. The success of the New Orleans project led to his being hired for the much larger National Maritime Union project in New York City. In 1957, he designed and built his own home at 5328 Bellaire Drive in the Lakewood South neighborhood of New Orleans. He lived in this home with his wife and children until the time of his death. The home flooded in 2005 as a result of Hurricane Katrina and was subsequently restored. The success of the National Maritime Union building in New Orleans led to Ledner's commission in 1958 to design the headquarters for the National Maritime Union building in New York City. The National Maritime Union was flourishing at the time and had need for a headquarters that included offices, hiring halls, residences and training centers for the union members. The first of these buildings was the headquarters of the National Maritime Union located at Seventh Avenue between 12th and 13th Streets. This six story building was built on two glass block cylinders. It has walls with overhangs and windows suggestive of portholes, intended to be fitting for a hiring hall of maritime sailors. The second building in Ledner's New York City National Maritime Union project was an annex at 346 West 17th Street, consisting of an eleven story building with 100 porthole windows on a sloping wall. The last of this project was an annex on Ninth Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets said to look like a pizza box with porthole windows. With the decline of the maritime trade unions by the early 1970s, the union sold these buildings and were subsequently converted to alternative uses. Ledner designed buildings for similar purposes in Mobile, Alabama; Baltimore, Maryland; Houston, Texas; Galveston, Texas; Norfolk, Virginia; and San Francisco, California. He also designed a building for the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. =Residential projects= The Kleinschmidt Residence in the Lake Vista neighborhood of New Orleans was Ledner's 1951 project built in a mid-century modern style. This home included clerestory windows with a floor plan providing a light and airy feel. Ledner fabricated light fixtures made of Schlitz beer as another distinguishing feature of the home. Another of Ledner's early residential projects was the Cointreau House, also in the Park Island neighborhood of New Orleans. This house included skylights and light fixtures fabricated from Cointreau liqueur bottles. This home was featured in the June 1953 issue of House Beautiful magazine. In 1961, Ledner designed and built a residence on Park Island in New Orleans that came to be known as the \\"Sunkel House\\" or the \\"Ashtray House\\". A distinguishing feature of this home is its use of 1200 amber-colored glass ashtrays as dentils in its exterior. The name \\"Sunkel House\\" came from the original owners of the home, the Sunkel family, who were Ledner's clients. The home was for a time owned by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. Also, on Park Island in New Orleans, Ledner designed and built the \\"Galatoire House\\", which made use of the client's extensive collection of antique architectural fixtures, especially stained-glass that was obtained from a 19th century convent. The design involved placing the stained-glass in irregular orientations, linked together to form a wall. Other Ledner residential designs included the Goldate House and the Leonard House, both in New Orleans. =Legacy= In addition to architectural projects, Ledner designed and built household and office equipment such as light fixtures, tables, and artwork. He also designed various machines for which he obtained three patents. An example of his patented inventions is an emergency descent device to aid people in escaping from tall buildings.A. Ledner, US3826341A, September 11, 1973. In 2016, filmmaker Roy Beeson, in collaboration with Ledner's daughter Catherine Ledner, produced a documentary film about the life and works of Ledner, entitled \\"Designing for Life: The Modernist Architecture of Albert C. Ledner\\". Ledner attended a preview of the documentary held at the New York City Architecture and Design Film Festival in early November 2017. He also gave a formal presentation at the festival. During this journey, he became ill and died shortly thereafter in Manchester, New Hampshire, on November 14, 2017, at the age of 93.

It is a standalone expansion to Verdun, and entered Steam Early Access on November 17, 2017. Tannenberg left Steam Early Access on February 13, 2019. It was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on July 24, 2020. Tannenberg is inspired by the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg in East Prussia. The game includes historically accurate World War I weapons, authentic uniforms and equipment, detailed injury and gore modeling, and maps based on the real battlefields of the Eastern Front. The game runs on the Unity engine and was developed by independent studios M2H and Blackmill Games. Gameplay Tannenberg is a squad based game set on the Eastern Front of World War I that can be played with up to 64 players (40 players on consoles). There are 3 game modes in Tannenberg: Maneuver, Attrition Warfare and Rifle Deathmatch. In April 2019 a temporary 'Wolf Truce' feature was added to the Maneuver game mode, based on historical reports of armies calling truces to fight wolves. During this event, packs of wolves would sometimes enter the battlefield and attack players. Players would then be able to conduct a truce while wolves were present, or they could break the truce and continue fighting normally. In April 2019, a 'Film Memoir' visual mode was added which switches the game's art and user interface to black and white, while adding a film grain effect. Maneuver game mode In the Maneuver game mode, players join either the Entente or the Central Powers. After choosing a squad type and role within the squad, players join the battle where they have to capture sectors. Holding sectors provides control points (more or less depending on the value of the sector) and the team with the most control points will drain the other side's resources. The game ends when one team runs out of resources, when either team's HQ sector is captured, or when the match time runs out. Some sectors provide accelerated reloading abilities for NCOs, such as calling reconnaissance aircraft and artillery strikes. Supply lines are represented by requiring sectors to be connected to a team's HQ sector before that team can capture it. Attrition Warfare game mode This is a variant of a team deathmatch battle. Each team, the Entente and the Central Powers, start with a number of tickets. These represent the amount of manpower that each side has at its disposal. Every time a player is killed and respawns, a ticket is deducted from the side he belongs to. The goal of the game is to diminish the opposing side‚Äôs tickets before losing all the tickets on your side, because a player cannot respawn if there are no more tickets. Rifle Deathmatch game mode In Rifle Deathmatch, players fight in a free for all battle, armed only with one of the rifles and add-ons they can choose from when joining the game. This is a skill-based game-mode, where marksmanship and tactical cunning are rewarded. Players can earn experience and Career Points by killing other players, and with the Career Points can level up their rifles, gaining extra accessories for it, such as a bayonet. Reception A Rock, Paper, Shotgun Early Access review of the game commended it for portraying war with some nuance: \\"While war shooters typically deal in bombast and screaming and artillery barrages, Tannenberg juxtaposes that with quiet, everyday tragedies.\\" The reviewer described Tannenberg as an improvement compared to Verdun, but also less unique. \\"It's already a better game, certainly a more exciting one, but it's not got as unique an appeal.\\" References External links Developer website for M2H *Developer website for Blackmill Games 2017 video games Early access video games First-person shooters Linux games MacOS games Unity (game engine) games Video games developed in the Netherlands Video games set in Germany Video games set in Russia Windows games PlayStation 4 games Xbox One games World War I video games Video games set in 1914 ","title":"Tannenberg (video game)"},{"id":"55861215","text":"The Irish Council Bill (or Irish Councils Bill; long title A Bill to provide for the Establishment and functions of an Administrative Council in Ireland and for other purposes connected therewith) was a bill introduced and withdrawn from the UK Parliament in 1907 by the Campbell-Bannerman administration. It proposed the devolution of power, without Home Rule, to Ireland within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. A partly elected Irish Council would take control of many of the departments thitherto administered by the Dublin Castle administration, and have limited tax-raising powers. The bill was introduced by Augustine Birrell, the newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, on 7 May 1907. It was rejected by the United Irish League (UIL) at a conference in Dublin on 21 May, which meant the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) aligned to the UIL would oppose it in Parliament. Henry Campbell-Bannerman announced on 3 June that the government was dropping the bill, and it was formally withdrawn on 29 July. Political background In 1893, the Second Home Rule Bill was rejected by the House of Lords.Morton 2014 p.45 Whereas Irish nationalists like the IPP and UIL wanted full Home Rule with a legislature, this was opposed by Irish unionists, who also opposed any devolution scheme that might evolve into Home Rule. The Irish Reform Association and Sir Antony MacDonnell, the Under-Secretary for Ireland, unsuccessfully proposed a devolution scheme in 1904‚Äì1905.Morton 2014 pp.51‚Äì53 In a speech in Stirling in November 1905, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, about to take office as Liberal prime minister, promised \\"an instalment of representative control\\" for Ireland while implying no Home Rule.Jalland 1976 p.427 In 1906 James Bryce as Chief Secretary for Ireland began work with MacDonnell on a bill along the lines of the Stirling speech. When IPP leaders John Dillon and John Redmond were apprised of it, they were \\"as much alienated by the secrecy surrounding Bryce's scheme as shocked by the inadequacy of its proposals\\".Jalland 1976 p.429 Birrell replaced Bryce as Chief Secretary in 1907, and improved relations with IPP leaders. Edward Blake was involved in negotiating revisions to the draft bill with Dillon and Redmond. Originally, MacDonnell proposed that two-thirds of the Irish Council would be indirectly elected by the county councils; as introduced, it was to be three-quarters elected by popular vote.Hepburn 1971 p.486 William O'Brien, a nationalist outside the IPP, supported both the 1904 devolution scheme and the 1907 bill as a step in the right direction, or \\"Home Rule by instalments\\". The IPP MPs were initially uncertain whether to oppose the bill outright or seek amendments to it. They voted for the first reading on 7 May, Redmond saying, \\"if this measure fulfilled certain conditions I laid down we should consider it an aid to Home Rule. I do not know whether it does or not till I have examined it.\\" Dillon was sympathetic but the sudden death of his wife removed him from public debate. The Roman Catholic church in Ireland opposed what it viewed as increased state interference in education. Joseph Devlin and the Ancient Order of Hibernians also opposed it. The Irish Trades Union Congress opposed the proposed council as \\"a constitutional cripple, more likely than otherwise to hamper and irritate industrial improvement in Ireland\\". T. W. Russell, head of the \\"Russellite Unionists\\", supported the bill and alleged most unionists opposed it because it would end Protestant Ascendancy in the senior ranks of the Irish civil service.Campbell 2007 p.636 The antipathy within the UIL and from nationalists more generally forced Redmond's hand and he proposed the rejection motion at the UIL convention, which was overwhelmingly carriedHepburn 1971 MacDonnell retired shortly after the bill's failure. The Liberal Party decided there was no workable middle ground between the Union status quo and Home Rule, and put aside attempts to address Ireland's constitutional status.Jalland 1976 p.430; Morton 2014 pp.54‚Äì55 It was after the 1910 election and the Parliament Act 1911 that the Asquith ministry returned to the issue with the Third Home Rule Bill.Morton 2014 pp.55‚Äì59 Conor Mulvagh suggests the 1907 bill's failure fed into a current of disillusion and malaise in the IPP that opened the way for more advanced nationalist alternatives like Sinn F√©in. William O'Brien wrote in 1923, \\"It is now obvious enough that, had the Irish Council Bill been allowed to pass, the Partition of Ireland would never have been heard of.\\" The Spectator countered that unionists would never have been reconciled to the 1907 scheme.

It original nucleus are the old smithy and corn mill with associated buildings. The site is dominated by the A76 that runs through the centre of Mennock. The village has expanded in recent years with housing on the River Nith side of the A76. History The village was known as 'Minnock Bridge' in 1886 and the river was recorded as 'Minnick Water' with its source away on the north-western slope of Lowther Hill. The water has its confluence here with the River Nith. The area is famous for its association with the Covenanters. A road overbridge lies a little way to the south carrying the B797 Mennock Pass road to Leadhills and Wanlockhead. A toll house stood just to the south of the junction on the western side. A weighing machine was located near this toll house, set into the road surface. By 1898 the toll house had closed and the weighing machine was no longer present. Mennock Bridge School, later Mennock School, was situated near the old entrance to the Mennock Lye Goods Depot with the schoolhouse standing nearby. The Mennock War Memorial has the names of those who served and who died from the village as well as those who attended the school and were killed in WWI. The old smithy in the mainstreet. Glendyne lies about from Mennock and is famous as a onetime hiding place for persecuted Covenanters thanks to its isolation and its depth. In 1832 and absent by the 1850s, a mill is shown on the Mennock Water near the point where the Sow Burn joins it, however by the 1850s a corn mill was present just above the Mennock Viaduct with a caul or weir and a ford. A lane ran up Kiln Hill from the site of Mennock Mill and joined the Mennock Pass road near the site of the old mill. Mennock Mill is no longer in use however the miller's house is still present. A small croft by the name of Ringbrae once stood near Mennock Wood, a path and footbridge connecting it to the village. Eliock House stands on the western bank of the River Nith and was in the hands of the Dalzell family from circa 1388 to 1720 and the Veitch family were in residence until 1905, but by 1914 James Irving McConnel is listed as the owner followed by George W. Greenshields in the late 1930s. The oldest part of the house is a substantial tower, probably dating to the 16th century. Eliock is said to be the birthplace of James Crichton, commonly known as 'the Admirable Crichton', a polymath, highly skilled in languages, the arts, and sciences, murdered in 1582 at the age of 21. Castle Gilmour (NS822093) once overlooked Mennock, named from the clan Gilmour, it stood near Auchengruith Farm however nothing now remains at the site. The Cross Kirk of Mennock is a large cross, said to mark the site of an old chapel, composed of stones and earth and located on a flat area of ground at the bottom of the Glenclauch Brae, just off the Mennock Road. A stell or fold, once used for sheep in winter, stood near by. Transport Mennock lies in Nithsdale, a natural communication corridor that has resulted in both roads and railways cutting through it. The Dumfries to Ayr road runs through on its way to Sanquhar. The Duke of Queensberry constructed around of new road and in addition a road (the B797) through the Mennock Pass to the county boundary and onward to Edinburgh. The village never had a passenger station the nearest today being Sanquhar and previously a station was present at Carron Bridge. =The Dempster Path= This ancient path runs from the village, under the railway viaduct, past the 19th century corn mill ruins and then continues up beside the Mennock Water and crosses the B797 after passing the site of the pre-1850s mill. Eventually the Dempster Path joins the B797 below Middlemoor Hill. The Dempster Road features on the OS 6\\" 1892-1905 edition marked as a footpath. It appears, as it avoids the toll house, to be an alternative to the then turnpiked B797 which runs closer to the Mennock Water. The name 'Dempster' suggest a much older origin as a 'Dempster' until 1746 was the official at Scottish baronial courts responsible for executing the judicial decisions and announced the \\"doom\\" as the sentence was called. =Mennock Lye Goods Depot= The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle line The Mennock Lye Goods Depot or Mennock Siding on the railway opened in 1850 and stood close to the Mennock Water and the five arched viaduct that carries the line across, just downstream from the old Mennock corn mill ruins. The facility would have had transported such items as lime for the fields, cattle, horse and sheep movements, milk delivery, coal deliveries, etc. The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway originally opened the sidings for the Leadhills and Wanlockhead mines. The lead mines lay about to the northeast via the steep Mennock Pass. On 7 Dec 1882 an accident took place at 'Mennock Siding' resulting in a passenger fatality. The sidings have long been removed as has the signal box, track cross-over, etc., leaving plain double track. The ruins of the old goods depot office building remains on the western side of the site. An engineers track access point and materials storage area exists slightly to the south of the old depot's location. Etymology The earliest recorded version of the Mennock Water name in 1660 is 'Minnock' and the derivation may be from the Scots Gaelic 'm√®ineach', meaning 'abounding in ore or mines'. Eliock may originate in the Scots Gaelic 'ailcheach' meaning 'stony place'. Micro-history The Leadhills and Wanlockhead Railway has named a locomotive 'Mennock' in the honour of the connection of the mines with the village. 'Mennock' is a narrow gauge locomotive that was built by Hunlset- Barclay in 1994 and was used in the tunnelling work for London Olympic Park. In British usage Mennock is technically a hamlet rather than a village as it has always lacked a formal dedicated church of its own.

He performed his show Kurd Your Enthusiasm at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2017. He has featured as a guest on the BBC Asian Network and has written for iNews and TotalPolitics. He is the UK's only professional standup comedian from a Kurdish background. Kurd came to Britain at 6 months old as a refugee. His parents had been part of the Kurdish resistance movement against Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government and were forced to flee as refugees. 'At my age, my father was running at tanks', he told one interviewer. His parents first fled as a result of the al-Anfal campaign against Iraq's Kurds to Iran, where Kurd was born in 1990. Partly as a result of his father being injured in a poison gas attack in Iraq, his family were accepted as refugees and settled in Brixton, South London, where he still lives. Kurd's stage name came initially from the fact that his classmates at school could not pronounce his name. People would introduce him as ‚ÄúK, he's a Kurd‚Äù. After he was then announced on stage as 'Kae Kurd', decided he liked the name and adopted it as his Twitter handle. He told Festmag that, ‚ÄúI'm not complaining. It's nice to have some separation of your identity and stage persona.‚Äù Kurd's comedy focuses on issues of race, identity, and growing up Kurdish in the UK. He started out on the black comedy circuit in 2011 and some of his material revolves around imagining white comedians trying to pitch their routines to a black audience. As someone from a nation without an independent state, ‚Äúyour whole existence is about trying to find an identity or to speak up for your identity‚Äù, Kurd said.

The company is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, and operates about 500 (as of January 2019) company-owned and franchised restaurants in the Southwestern United States. Fare A typical El Pollo Loco restaurant El Pollo Loco prepares primarily Mexican chicken entrees. The company describes its chicken as \\"citrus-marinated and fire-grilled.\\" The American company also offers Mexican-style food, such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas. In a bid to compete with such companies as KFC and Chick-fil-A, El Pollo Loco experimented with offering deep fried chicken in the form of breaded chicken tenders at selected locations in the United States for a limited time during the Fall 2016. This experiment is a big departure from its previous marketing campaigns that tout their fire-grilled chicken as a healthful alternative to fried chicken. History Juan Francisco Ochoa started the restaurant in Guasave, Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1975. By 1979 the chain had expanded throughout northern Mexico. On December 8, 1980, Ochoa opened his first U.S. restaurant in Los Angeles, California, at 503 Alvarado Street, near Sixth Street. The first American location was only and it grossed more than $125,000 per month during its first year of operation. Alternate Link via ProQuest. The initial menu was very simple: a choice of a half or whole chicken with a packet of warm tortillas and a cup of salsa. A second location was opened in Santa Ana in the fall of 1981. In 1983, the 19 American restaurants in the chain were acquired by Denny's with an agreement that the Ochoa family would continue to operate the restaurants in Mexico under the corporate name El Pollo Loco, S.A. de C.V. where it continue to operates. After 18 months of new ownership, the American owned El Loco Pollo, Inc. had increased the number of locations in Southern California from 19 to 29 while adding 6 locations in distant Houston, Texas, with almost all of the new locations were franchise operations. Four years later the 70-unit El Pollo Loco was acquired by TW Services when TW Services purchased El Pollo Loco's then parent Denny's Inc. in 1987 for $218 million in cash. In May 1990, El Pollo Loco opened its 200th restaurant. That new restaurant was located in Yorba Linda, California. Alternate Link via ProQuest. During the early 1990s the company experimented with many different concepts to increase marketshare in the competitive Southern Californian fast food industry. In 1994 the company test marketed at a select few locations: a side-dish bar, salsa bar, and barbecue at some locations, while other locations tried selling french fries or ice cream. Link via ProQuest. Only salsa bars survived the test and were introduced chainwide the following year. Link via ProQuest. The company also tested home delivery and catering in 1995. In August 1995, El Pollo Loco earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for building the world's largest burrito in Anaheim, California. The burrito was long and weighed two tons. In December 1995, John A. Romandetti replaced Raymond J. Perry as president and chief executive officer. Sixteen months later, Romandetti was replaced by Nelson J. Marchioli as president and chief executive officer in April 1997 when Romandetti was transferred to sister company Denny's as its new CEO. American Securities Capital Partners acquired the 274-location El Pollo Loco in 1999 for $114 Million from Advantica (formerly called TW Services) and later sold it to Trimaran Capital Partners in 2005 for $400 Million with 328 locations. In April 2001, Stephen Carley replaced Nelson J. Marchioli as president and chief executive officer. Marchioli left EPL, Inc., to head its former parent company Advantica. In January 2007, El Pollo Loco was featured on NBC TV's hit show The Apprentice: Los Angeles where contestants competed by creating and selling versions of El Pollo Loco's Pollo Bowl. El Pollo Loco was recognized by the World Franchising Network as a Top Franchise for Hispanics in 2010. New locations were first open by franchisees in the states of Utah and Oregon in 2008. The 400th location was opened in Chelsea, Massachusetts in May 2008. In August 2010, president and chief executive officer Steve Carley unexpectedly resigned to head Red Robin Gourmet Burgers. In January 2011, Steve Sather was officially named president and chief executive officer after serving since the previous August as acting CEO. In July 2014, El Loco Pollo () became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ. In October 2016, the company announced that it had teamed up with a Louisiana-based franchisee who plans to build and open two units in Lafayette, Louisiana, sometime in 2018. In the following year, the Louisiana- based franchisee announced that construction of the first Lafayette was going to start in the upcoming month with an anticipated opening in the late spring of 2018.

Temporary expansion eastward Throughout its history, El Pollo Loco, Inc., tried at various times to expand beyond its core territories of California and the American Southwest, but all of these attempts were so far not very successful. In 1987, then owner TW Services began to open restaurants in the Orlando, Florida area, starting in Winter Park. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Five restaurants were eventually built but all five were forced to close in 1991. A second expansion attempt, mainly though franchises, was started in 2006 under then-owner Trimaran Capital Partners. All of these locations were closed within six years. During this time, El Pollo Loco or its franchisees briefly operated several restaurants in metro Atlanta, and Boston, New Jersey, and in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia; these closed by 2011. The chain's franchised restaurants in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area also closed in 2011. An El Pollo Loco in the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut closed in spring 2012.

The first of these opened in Tokyo in 1988. All of the Japanese locations closed by 1994. By 1997, EPL, Inc., had franchises located in Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. The franchise licenses for both Malaysia and Singapore has since lapsed. In July 2016, the Delgado family, owners of the El Pollo Loco franchise in the Philippines, filed a lawsuit against EPL, Inc. in the Regional Trial Court so it could retain the El Pollo Loco trademark in that country after the franchise contract had terminated. Charity partners The brand created Fire-Grilled Fundraisers, an initiative for nonprofit organizations to raise funds for their cause while dining at the restaurant.

It was founded by Juan Francisco Ochoa, whose family still owns the Mexican chain. The El Pollo Loco locations in Mexico are not affiliated with or operated by the American El Pollo Loco, Inc. El Pollo Loco operates in over 50 locations within Mexico City and the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n, Michoac√°n, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas, of which 28 are located in Nuevo Le√≥n. History of the Mexican chain Ochoa opened his first location in Guasave in the state of Sinaloa on January 6, 1974 at a small roadside location containing ten tables and with a starting working capital of 15 thousand pesos. His wife Fl√©rida created a fruit-based marinade which was used to coat the chicken for several hours prior to grilling. After a few hours of operations on their first day, they sold out all 43 chickens. Three years later, Ochoa's brother Jaime quit his job and opened the company's second location in San Luis Potosi. This was quickly followed by other locations that were opened and operated by Ochoa's other brothers and sisters in Guadalajara, Morelia, Monterrey, and Saltillo. By the end of 1979, Ochoa had 85 restaurants in 20 cities throughout Northern Mexico with many of the locations operated by family members or close friends. At that time, Ochoa thought about expanding north of the borders into areas of the United States that he had previously visited. In 1980, Ochoa opened his first U.S. location on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles, an area which had a high concentration of immigrants from Sinaloa. The company rapidly expanded on both sides of the international border during the early 1980s. However a number of bad decisions caused by a non-related manager caused the company to accumulate $3 million in debts and created a cash flow problem that forced Ochoa to sell his properties outside Mexico to help cover those debts. In September 1983, Ochoa sold the 19 U.S. locations, all of which were located in Southern California, to Denny's Alternate Link via ProQuest. for either $12.6 million or $11.3 million. At the time of the sale, Ochoa had retained 92 locations within Mexico. As part of the agreement, Denny's promised to assist Ochoa in opening new locations in the parts of Mexico that Ochoa's company did not then occupy. In 2004, the Mexican company filed suit in U.S. Federal Court against the American company for failure to fulfill the joint expansion agreement. After three years of litigation, the Court ruled against the American company and ordered the American company to pay $22 million in damages and to return the ownership of the \\"El Pollo Loco\\" trademark and intellectual property within Mexico back to the Mexican company. As a result of the debt debacle created during the early 1980s by a non-family manager, the number of locations has since shrunk to approximately 40 locations, all of which are managed and operated by family members. After the sale of the American locations in 1983, Ochoa restricted his business activities to Mexico. However, the lure of new business activities north of the Rio Grande was too hard to resist and Ochoa opened his new business, called Taco Palenque, in Laredo, Texas in 1987. Fare Unlike its American counterpart, the Mexican chain has kept its menu simple and focused on the grilled chicken. Deboned chicken or other meats like shrimp or carne asada are not available. Standard Mexican-American fare such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are also not available. Controversies In January 2016, the Secretar√≠a de Salud de Nuevo Le√≥n, the Health Ministry for the Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n, closed several franchised locations of El Pollo Loco for several health code violations. At least one of the locations was owned by Mexican politician Marco Gonz√°lez who claimed that the closures were politically motivated.

Pura Kehen was mentioned three times in three copper inscriptions dated from the late 9th-century, the early 11th-century, and the 13th-century. The copper inscriptions mentioned the temple under different names. In the late 9th-century inscription, the temple was mentioned as Hyang Api (\\"god of fire) by the Brahmans who maintain the temple. In the second inscription dating to the early 11th-century, the temple was named Hyang Kehen; the word Kehen is derived from the Balinese word keren which means \\"flame\\". In this period, the Pura Hyang Kehen was the official temple where oath ceremonies took place for royal officials. In such ceremonies, those who are proven unfaithful will be subjected to the terrible sapata (\\"curse\\") to him, his families, and his descendants. The oath ceremony was performed in front of the figure of Hyang Api or Hyang Kehen, the god of fire Agni. A vessel known as bejana sarpantaka was used for such performance; this vessel, which is decorated with four serpents winding around the vessel, was kept in an enclosed pavilion to the east of the main shrine of Pura Kehen. The temple was named Pura Kehen in the 13th-century inscription. All inscriptions mentioned the association of Pura Kehen with the village of Bangli. Temple layout The innermost sanctum (jero) of Pura Kehen featuring the 11-tiers meru tower dedicated to the main god and patron of the temple. Pura Kehen temple compound is built over a hilly outcrop. The temple is aligned north- south, with the north part being the highest part of the temple. It is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). Three sets of stairs lead visitors to the outer sanctum of the temple from the street. The landscape is terraced and is decorated with stone statues representing characters from the Indian epic Ramayana. Three gateways mark the entrance into the outer sanctum (jaba pisan). The central gateways or portal is in the form of paduraksa, which is unusual since paduraksa normally used to mark entrance into the inner main sanctum. The outer sanctum (jaba pisan) features a banyan tree of at least 400 years old. The enormous banyan tree features a monk's cell high up in the branches. The tree is considered sacred by the people of Bangli. It is believed that if a branch of the tree broke, a disaster (grubug) would follow, usually the death of a person. The location of the broken branch indicates the person that would die; if a branch is broke on the kaja-kangin (north-east) side, a king will die; if it is broke on the kaja-kauh (north-west) side, a brahmin will die; the kelod-kangin and the kelod-kauh means that a common people will die. Several bale (Balinese pavilions) located in the outer sanctum are the bale gong (\\"gong pavilion\\") where the gamelans are stored. The middle sanctum (jaba tengah) is accessed via a candi bentar gateway. The middle sanctum acts as a transitional area between the outer sanctum and the inner sanctum. Several shrines (pelinggih) are located in the middle sanctum. Other southwest side of the middle sanctum, the perantenan area, is used as a place to prepare ceremonial offerings. The uppermost inner sanctum (jero) is the most sacred courtyard of the Balinese temple. The courtyard features an 11-tiered meru tower, the most sacred shrine of the Pura Kehen dedicated to the God that protects the temple. A padmasana lotus shrine is also located in this courtyard, dedicated to the highest Hindu Trimurti of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. Several other shrines surround the main meru tower, dedicated to the gods of the local geography e.g. the mountain gods. Porcelain plates decorate the wall below the inner sanctum. Some of these depict a scene of rural England, with a watermill and a coach drawn by four horses. Rituals The major Balinese feast of Pagerwesi was held once every six months at the full moon of the Rabu Kliwon Wuku Sinta day to honor Hyang Widhi and His manifestations. Another major feast, the Ngusaba Dewa or Karya Agung Bhatara Turun Kabeh, is held on Purnama Kalima (early November) on the Saniscara Pon Wuku Sinta day. Other smaller feasts held at Pura Kehen are ceremonies to honor other gods e.g. Saraswati, Ulian Sugimanik, Purnama, Tilem, Kajeng Kliwon and Buda Kliwon.

This symbol signifies love, bonding and faithfulness in marriage. The symbol is represented by a half moon with a star slightly hanging within the circumference of the moon. Adinkra are symbols that carry a message or a concept. They are very much used by the Bono people of the Bonoman and the Gyaman, an Akan people of Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire. Osram ne nsoromma symbols are incorporated into walls and other architectural features and quite recently has become common with tattoo designers. The most common ways through which the Adinkra messages are carried out or conveyed is having them printed extensively in fabrics and used in pottery. Adinkra is an Akan name which means farewell or goodbye. Osram ne nsoromma are two different powerful objects of creation put together (Moon and Star). Both co exist in the sky to produce magnificent light or brightness at night. There are some wise sayings closely related to the Osram ne nsoromma symbol,often linked with proverbs  Related proverbs  The Akans of Ghana use an Adinkra symbol to express proverbs and other philosophical ideas or traditional wisdom, aspects of life or the environment. Some of the familiar proverbs are: Awaree nye nsafufuo na waka ahwe, which means marriage is not palm-wine that you can decide to have a taste before you get served. It can also be interpreted to mean marriage is not a venture,committee or an organization that you can be a member today and withdraw your membership tomorrow. This proverb frowns upon break ups or separations in marriages or relationships. Woreko awaree a bisa, This proverb talks about due diligence before marriage. it is wise to do a background check on your partner before marriage or the worse will happen. Making the wrong choice is sometimes costly. Similarly,most of the proverbs seem to put value on the object being addressed. This symbol signifies Love,bonding and faithfulness but one must carefully choose the right partner. Ahwenepa nkasa, can be interpreted to mean \\"Ahwenepa\\"( Good waist beads) \\"nkasa\\" (makes no noise). This can be related to mean a good man or a good woman needs no introduction to be known.

It is attributed to Francesc Eiximenis and it was written in Latin between 1378 and 1379.Perarnau i Espelt, Josep. ‚ÄúDocuments i precisions entorn de Francesc Eiximenis (c. 1330-1409)‚Äù. ATCA, I. 1982. 191-215. This opuscule was transcribed and published by Albert Hauf in 1979.‚ÄúEl De Triplici Statu Mundi de Fr. Francesc Eiximenis, O.F.M.‚Äù. EUC, XXIII. 1979. 265-283. Content As the title states, this work deals with the division of history of mankind in three states or ages, that would be the following ones: * First state Men of these state were bad and warlike, and thus God sent them several punishments for this reason: The great flood, the flight from Egypt with Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah, the golden lamb of Sinai and the punishment of God, the seizure of Aaron's priesthood by Dathan, Abiram and Korah and their death because of this fact; and finally, the destruction of Jerusalem during the time of Titus and Vespasian. The author considers that God's people during this state is the Jewish people. * Second state God sent punishments in this state also, but not so many as in the first state. Moreover God sent in this state in order to help the mankind Bernard of Clairvaux, Francis of Assisi and Dominic of Guzman. At the end of this state, and maybe before the end of the century when this opuscule was written (XIVth century), there will be great problems and challenges, that will be greater than the ones of the first state. Finally the Mystical Antichrist will appear, who is a very common character in medieval eschatology. Eight features that show that it would happen are listed. The eighth one must be pointed out. This is the division of the Church during the Western Schism. Then the author of this opuscule defends the Pope of Rome Urban VI and criticises the popes of Avignon. It seems as well that some of the signs of the next coming of Mystical Antichrist are the attacks that were made to the Church by the emperors Frederick Barbarossa and Frederick II Hohenstaufen. The tasks that this Mystical Antichrist will do are commonplace in medieval eschatological thought: The conquest of the Holy Land and the conversion of infidels. This Mystical Antichrist will be so terrible, that it will be totally similar in this respect to the final Antichrist. As a relief for mankind some behaviour rules for these last times are given. According to Albert Hauf these rules would correspond to the Regulae pro tempore persecutionis (Rules for the time of persecution), written by a different author and that were included also in other works. * Third state After the great tribulations that this Mystical Antichrist will bring, there will be general peace through the world and a general purgation of clergymen. In this third state only the good and chosen ones will remain. Regarding the length of this state, no answer is given. It will end with the coming of the final Antichrist, who will be defeated and killed by Christ. Soon afterwards, the Last Judgment will begin. Influences As sources, Hildegard of Bingen, Joachim of Fiore and the hermit of Lampedusa are explicitly quoted. In the division of the world history in three stages, and the way that this division is shown, a clear influence of Joaquim de Fiore can be seen. Therefore, for the abbot of Fiore since there are three consubstantial persons in God, similarly there are three great stages in the world history, that correspond to the Trinity. The first stage includes pre-Christian history. During this time men lived earthly, in fear and slavery. The second one, where mankind lived between blood and spirit, took place between the coming of Christ and the year 1260. After that year, according to the Calabrian abbot, people would live according to the spirit.Crocco, Antonio. Gioacchino da Fiore e il gioachinismo. Napoli. Lignore Editore. 1976. Pp. 76-6, 80-1. It could have also the influence of Arnau de Vilanova.

Biography Daughter to farmer John Rowe and his wife, Margery was named after her mother and baptized on 29 June 1742 in the Blaxhall church. She was married to John Beddingfield, a farmer, on 3 July 1759. They had one daughter Pleasance and one son John; the latter died when he was four months old. Four years into their marriage, Margery developed an illicit relationship with Richard Ringe, one of the house servants whom she promised to marry as soon as he \\"destroyed her husband\\". He at first persuaded a housemaid, Elizabeth Riches, to poison Beddingfield. After her refusal, he bought white arsenic from Aldeburgh and mixed it in John's water, who, fully unaware of their intentions, refused the cup after noticing the sediments. On the night of 27 July 1762, Margery shared the bed in the nearby kitchen chamber with Elizabeth Cleobald, another maidservant, and Ringe strangled Beddingfield while he was sleeping. To silence the maid, Margery gave her a gown. The coroner's inquest of Beddingfield's body showed signs of willful murder. He was buried on 30 July. Both Ringe and Margery were tried at Lent Assizes before Baron of the Court of Exchequer Richard Adams. Ringe confessed to his crime and added that Margery's previous affection for him had turned to hatred. She too eventually gave her confession. Since Beddingfield was Ringe's master and Margery's husband, both of them were convicted of petty treason. Margery was strangled and burnt while Ringe was hanged at Ipswich on 8 April 1763 before a huge gathering of onlookers.

Birth and Education Frydman was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he completed his undergraduate studies in chemistry in 1986 at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1990 he received his Ph.D. in chemistry from the same university. Career In 1990 Frydman started working in his post-doctoral research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and at the University of California, Berkeley, under the direction of Alexander Pines. In 1992 he was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he became Associate Professor in 1996, and Full Professor in 1999. In 2001 Frydman moved to Israel, where he was appointed Professor in the Department of Chemical Physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Since 2015 he holds the Bertha and Isadore Gudelsky Professorial Chair; in 2017 Frydman was appointed Head of the newly formed Department of Chemical and Biological Physics. He was Director of the Fritz Haber Center for Physical Chemistry from 2007 to 2012, and again since 2017. He is Director of the Helen and Martin Kimmel Institute for Magnetic Resonance Research since 2012 and he became the Director of the Clore Institute for High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy since 2015. In 2012 Frydman was appointed Chief Scientist in Chemistry and Biology at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. Research Frydman‚Äôs research focuses on the fields of MRI, NMR and solid-state NMR. His scientific work has produced over 200 scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals. In 1995 Frydman and his coworker John Harwood developed the Multiple-Quantum Magic-Angle-Spinning (MQMAS) NMR experiment. The article describing this experiment received more than 1000 citations and the experiment became widely used for acquiring solid- state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei. In 2002 Frydman and his coworkers introduced a new approach to collect NMR data that allows the acquisition of arbitrary multi-dimensional NMR spectra within a single scan. Provided that sufficient sensitivity is available, this method can yield 2D NMR correlations that are orders of magnitude faster than hitherto possible and it has found applications in many areas of chemistry. Recently, Frydman and his coworkers further developed this spatio-temporal encoding (SPEN) strategy to collect MRI images in a single scan. This method allows the acquisition of real-time MRI spectra and can be used to monitor processes in functional MRI (fMRI) and in diffusion MRI.

Retrieved 22 November 2017. Aged 17, she became personal secretary to Bob Peliza, the Gibraltarian politician who later became Chief Minister and led the Integration with Britain Party. After five years of working with him, in 1970 she moved to London and worked for the National Data Processing Service for four years. In 1974, she returned to Gibraltar to work in shipping for Blands. = Politics = While she was working for Blands, Montegriffo met Joe Bossano, a member (and future leader) of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party. He was impressed by her and encouraged her to stand for election as the shop steward for a private sector union; she was subsequently elected. Despite her uncle, Aurelio Montegriffo (who was an Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR) member of the House of Assembly) asking her to join his party, she was convinced that it was moving rightwards and in 1980 she joined the GSLP instead. She was elected to its executive council in 1983 and then stood in the 1984 election, becoming the fourth successful candidate with 3,815 votes, which gave her a seat in the House. Bossano made her shadow Minister for Medical and Health Services with an enlarged portfolio covering the environment, sport and computerisation. After the GSLP won the 1988 election, Montegriffo became the Minister for the positions she had shadowed in opposition. In 1988, she was appointed Mayor of Gibraltar by the House of Assembly‚Äîthe first woman to hold that post‚Äîand served until 1996. She remained in the House as a GSLP member until retiring in 2007. During her tenure in Government, the administration reclaimed land, provided scholarships for further education pupils and privatised utilities companies. As Minister of Sport, Montegriffo allowed schools and communities to use the country's sporting facilities and oversaw the renovation of the Victoria Stadium; in 1995, Gibraltar hosted the Islands Games. As Minister of Health, she refurbished St Bernard's Hospital and expanded the healthcare budget from ¬£8 million in 1988 to ¬£23 million when she left office eight years later. She also abolished private practice by doctors working for the Health Authority and private rooms in St Bernard's were stopped. Doctors had to be registered with the General Medical Council.

The film stars Danielle Campbell, Joel Courtney, Madelaine Petsch, and Cameron Palatas, with Meg DeLacy, Nicholle Tom, Richard Karn, Jill Cimorelli, Luke Bilyk, Brendan Calton, Michael Chey, Adan Allende, Diamond White, Cheri Oteri and Ian Ziering in supporting roles. It was released online and on-demand on December 5, 2017. Plot Best friends Maddy Datner and Cole Reed attend their first day of high school at Charles Adams High. Cole is subjected to a prank by a fellow student, revealing his briefs and earning him the nickname \\"Tighty\\". Rather than stand up for him, Maddy decides not to intervene, and refuses to talk to Cole from that point on. Three years later, Maddy is at the top of the social hierarchy, and is dating the hottest guy at school, Kane. Cole, still shunned by his peers, has decided to apply to a prestigious art college. Maddy catches her best friend Marissa making out with Kane. Revealing her disgust with Maddy's recent self-centered behavior, Marissa explains that she intends to be crowned Queen at the upcoming senior prom, which Maddy was expected to win. That night, Maddy goes to Cole's house, and they reconnect, reminiscing about their former friendship. Maddy suggests that they ruin the prom, enlisting Cole's friend Felicity to help. Felicity refuses to help at first, but when Maddy stands up for Cole against Kane, she agrees, and enlists the help of other social outcasts to execute the plan. Maddy announces that she intends to take Cole to the prom, which greatly increases his status. Marissa tries to steal Cole's affections, but he rebuffs her. Kane, meanwhile, seeks forgiveness from Maddy. Felicity reveals that at one time, she and Kane were together, until Marissa manipulated Kane into dumping her for Maddy. As the date for prom approaches, Maddy forgives Kane and reneges on her commitment to take Cole as her date. Feeling hurt, Cole nearly calls the plan off, but his father intervenes. A former prom king himself, he has come to regret his behavior in high school, and believes his lack of humility was the reason why he and Cole's mother ultimately separated. He urges Cole to humble the popular kids so they do not turn out like him. The night of the prom, Felicity and the other conspirators rig the voting system, drug Marissa's punch, and turn the popular kids against each other using social media, including posting fake pornographic images of one boy. At the end of the night, Maddy is crowned prom queen, and is thus doused with tar‚Äîthe punishment intended for Marissa‚Äîbefore one of the kids pulls the fire alarm. Marissa takes revenge on Cole for rejecting her by once again pantsing him in front of the crowd. Enraged, Cole delivers a lengthy speech in which he criticizes how the students have hurt each other in pursuit of popularity that is ultimately without meaning or worth. Cole ignores Maddy for the rest of the school year due to her betrayal at prom and the fact that she could‚Äôve helped him all the past years in High School and just stood idly by and watched as he was tormented by other students. After graduation, Felicity explains to Cole that the only reason he got into the College he's been trying to attend is because Maddy sent his profile in to a recruiter. Unaware of this information, Cole stops by Maddy's house to give her a graphic novel of his drawings as both a thank you and a going-away present, since he leaves for school that weekend. He also confesses his feelings for her. Maddy reciprocates, and they kiss, but Cole ultimately rejects her offer of a relationship, wishing to remain friends instead.

His efforts saw the creation of a library and art gallery focused on Australian heritage of European settlement, and his interest in preserving the memory of horse-drawn transport contributed to a museum collection. __TOC__ Personal life Born to Henry Fossey Bolton and Flora Grace Mackay, Bolton was one of six children ‚Äì Agnes (b. 1904), Heather (b. 1907), Henry (b. 1908), and Grant (b. 1913). A young Bill Bolton was raised in a Brisbane suburb, before some primary school education at the town of Charleville in western Queensland. In sheep-farming country, the area was serviced by the horse-drawn Cobb & Co. transport company, which was to make an impression on Bolton. In April 1918 the family, now living in the large provincial town of Toowoomba, started to experience financial hardship when the twelve-year-old Bill found the body of his father who had committed suicide. A scholarship allowed Bolton to attend the Toowoomba Grammar School, and in 1920, he became a junior clerk with the Queensland Government's Lands Department in Brisbane. In 1935, Bolton married Marion Isabel Salisbury at the Sandgate Presbyterian Church, Brisbane, and moved back to Toowoomba. Additional to his philanthropic endeavours as a benefactor, Bolton celebrated his Mackay clan heritage and was an inaugural member of the Society of Saint Andrew of Scotland (Queensland branch). The strain of the legal proceedings in his business life affected his health, and Bolton died in 1973. His Australian heritage collections were donated to various public institutions. Business interests Studying accountancy, he established this business when returning to Toowoomba in 1935. In 1943 in partnership with Percy Morgan Redman, Redmans Transport was formed at the same time as the military in World War II required the large-scale movement of supplies. Contracts with Paul's Dairy Company also ensured success. The business was renamed in 1948 to Cobb & Co. Redman Transport. This commenced legal action by the last company secretary George Studdert of Cobb & Co. stage coaches and transport, with a settlement made by Bolton in 1954. The heavy road haulage firm traded on the name association with the former Cobb & Co. The year 1957 saw the commencement of conflict with the Queensland Government until 1966 with a Privy Council decision against Bolton. The dispute challenging the control of the government over business, often personal with the state minister for transport, Gordon Chalk, was to circumvent newly introduced transport licensing fees. The court action however had later developments elsewhere that led to an Australian goods and services tax in 2000. Bolton's keen interest in cricket saw the business in 1963 bring fast bowler Ray Lindwall to Queensland as an employee so he could play cricket for the State. A Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) was awarded in 1966, ‚Äòin recognition of his charitable endeavours in the Toowoomba region'. Whilst the nomination was endorsed by the Queensland premier Frank Nicklin, the same government had earlier sought to question Bolton's integrity. Bolton continued owning the Cobb & Co transport bus and trucking company in Toowoomba, Queensland until his death in 1973. Legacy Not forgetting the charity provided to his family when his father died, Bolton provided many bursaries to youth in country areas, and funded several other community-minded facilities and services. He was made a life member of the Royal Flying Doctor Service for his visible and financial support. In 1962 to fund-raise for the RFDS, twenty-five horses trained by Bolton's son undertook to draw a Cobb & Co. coach from Cairns to Melbourne. Throughout his life, Bolton collected twenty-eight horse and carriage vehicles for his own private museum which was opened to the public in Toowoomba in 1965. Today that collection forms part of the Cobb & Co Museum in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. Over the years archival material was assembled, including interviews with past Cobb & Co. employees. His interest in the Australian pioneer lifestyle led Bolton to form a friendship with Australia's bush balladist of the Outback, Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963). With the intention of giving 'regional Queenslanders access to the European history of Australia', the Lionel Lindsay Gallery and Library, Toowoomba Regional Art Gallery was established through the funding by Bolton, being opened on 4 April 1959 by the Australian prime minister Robert Menzies. The Bolton Reading Room is named in Bill's memory. There are over 500 artworks and 3000 books, manuscripts and maps in the library. Part of the 'Bolton Collection' of Australian history and art formed the book Celebrating Bill Bolton's vision of Australia : Toowoomba Regional Art Gallery 22 September - 25 November 2001.

The site is located in the Satpura Range of the Gawilgarh Hills in Betul District of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, north of Dharul village in Amravati district of Maharashtra. Studies of various rock paintings and petroglyphs present in the caves suggest, that the Ambadevi rock shelters were inhabited by prehistoric human settlers since around 25,000 years ago. First discoveries of clusters of numerous rock shelters and caves were made by Dr. Vijay Ingole and his team beginning on 27 January 2007.Ingole Vijay, Padmakar Lad, Manohar Khode, Dnyaneswar Damahe, Shirishkumar Patil, and Pradeep Hirurkar: 2007, Discovery of Painted Rock-Shelters from Satpura-Tapti Valley, 153‚Äì158, Purakala 17. Named after the nearby ancient Ambadevi Cave Temple, the site has also been referred to as the Satpura-Tapti valley caves and the Gavilgarh-Betul rock shelters. The Ambadevi rock shelters rank among the most important archaeological discoveries of the early 21st Century in India, on par with the 20th Century discovery of the Bhimbetka rock shelters. Location The rock shelters are situated in the Betul District of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, around north of the city of Amravati. in the Vidarbha region, located on the southern slope of the Satpura-Gawilgarh hill ranges, at about above sea level. The site lies west of the Salbardi pilgrimage destination, near Morshi town, Amravati District. By 2015 an area of by had been explored. The sandstone shelters are covered by lush vegetation and bear a striking resemblance to other rock art sites in India, Australia, South Africa and France. Discovery The previously unrecorded site was discovered by Dr. Vijay Ingole and his colleagues (Padmakar Lad, Dr. Manohar Khode, Shirish Kumar Patil, Dnyaneshwar Damahe, and Pradeep Hirurkar) on the 27th of January 2007.Vineet Godhal, Ashish S. Shende: 2011, Reflection of the Ecological Aspect of Animal depicted in Rock Art of Satpura-Tapti Valley and nearby Region, pp 216=223, Puratattva 41 (Indian Archeological Society, New Delhi), November 2011. Amateur naturalists and bird watchers also explored the area until 2012. More than 100 rock shelters were identified of which at least 30 contain hundreds of pictographs, petroglyphs and stone artifacts. The settlement period of the site ranges from the Upper Paleolithic (25,000 to 15,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (10,000 to 5,000 BCE), the Chalcolithic (after 5,000 BCE) and the Iron Age (1,200 to 600 BCE). Sediment, artefact and stratigraphy studies suggest a continuous sequence of human presence during the entire period. In 2011, further exploration was undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) under Dr. Sahu and her team.Bhattacharya- Sahu Nandini and Prabash Sahu 2012: Decorated Rock Shelters of Gawilgarh Hills, Madhya Pradesh, Session Paper on International Conference on Rock Art- Understanding Rock Art in Context, IGNCA, New Delhi. More than 225 rock shelters were identified that contained paintings, engravings, and stone tools. Stone tools fashioned out of a cryptocrystalline material like chert, chalcedony, or jasper were discovered in and around several shelters. Rock art and paintings The rock shelters of Ambadevi contain hundreds of paintings and pieces of rock art. The oldest paintings are considered to be between 15,000 and 20,000 years old.Nandini Bhattacharya-Sahu and Prabhash Sahu: 2014, pp 63‚Äì78, Artistry in the Rock Shelters of Gawilgarh Hills: Recent Discoveries, Puratattva 44 (Indian Archeological Society, New Delhi), 2014. According to the Hope group of researchers (scientist Dr V T Ingole, wildlife writer PS Hirurkar, Padmakar Lad, Shirishkumar Patil, Dnyaneswar Damahe and Manohar Khode), the high number of pictographs and petroglyphs on walls and boulders within the shelters make this site unique. =Pictographs= Most of these paintings are red in color and the pigment appears to have been prepared from hematite, red blood, fat and plants. In a few places, green, white, black and yellow pigments have been used. The paintings mainly depict animals (tortoises, fish, birds), humans, hand impressions, geometric figures, hunting scenes, war scenes, and abstract geometrical figures. Pictographs are painted on vertical wall surfaces, ceilings and hollow rock cavities. The oldest pictograph, known as Animal Zoo, depicts carnivorous mammals, such as tigers, leopards, hyenas, jackals, aardvarks (an extinct ant-eater) and wild dogs. Further paintings feature omnivores, like bears, herbivores like Nilgais, spotted deer, barasingha, sambar, the Indian rhinoceros, the now extinct sivatheriumand numerous unidentifiable species. All animal pictures face to the right. Carnivorous and omnivorous animals have distinctive thick foot pads. Herbivorous animals have no foot pads. All paintings are red with colorful bodies. The paintings are well preserved and have been well protected from monsoon rains as they faced northeast. In one shelter, wild boar, tortoises, fish, porcupines, monkeys and vultures are depicted in line drawings. another shelter includes an abstract human drawing with exaggerated male genitals (phallus and testicles) (Bhairao-an incarnation of Shiva) and in a nearby river a natural stone projection that resembles a phallus was identified to have been worshipped. This is considered to be one of the oldest places of an idolatry of the lingam. A nearby tomb-like entity covered with stones includes a painting of a human figure riding an elephant. A number of figures in the Indian Warli style were also identified, as were geometric figures and motifs colored in red and white. Several animal paintings are decorated with geometric lines. =Petroglyphs= Many rock shelters feature carvings shaped like animals, trees, humans and female genitals (vulvae). In one of the shelters an engraving of four bulls was identified on the face of the shelter. An image of a lotus flower with petals painted in a way to mimic a vulva was also found. Some petroglyphs found depict standalone humans, elephants with riders, tree, deer and a flying squirrel.

Because written sources are largely absent or of dubious reliability, research often relies on archaeological findings, which can be interpreted differently. In the past, the monocausal assumption was that the Romans had been forced by armed events and external aggressors in the context of the so-called Alamannic Storm to withdraw from the area east of the Rhine and north of the Danube. Archaeological finds, however, suggest that this process was the result of years of development during the so-called Imperial Crisis of the 3rd century with a decline of the border provinces; and even civil wars within the Empire seem to have played a role. All this finally led in 259/260 to the de facto abandonment of the so-called Agri Decumates territory and the withdrawal of the Roman military border to the Rhine and the Danube.Hans Ulrich Nuber: Staatskrise im 3.

The act specifies that residents must provide consent for major development projects on the island. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda passed the act on January 17, 2008. In 2016, the act was altered to increase the standard price of a major development required for a country-wide vote. Gaston Browne, the current prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, has expressed interest in transitioning to a privatized land system. Barbuda is a non-mountainous, 161 km squared Caribbean island located about 50 km away from Antigua. In 2011, the census measured that just over 1,600 people live in Barbuda.  Details of the Act  = 2007 Act = The act states that all people in Barbuda own the land collectively. Any citizen over 18 years old has the right to occupy residential land, graze animals and use land for commercial purposes, as long as projects are not considered major developments. Major developments, in this act, are defined as anything that costs over $5.4 million and will affect the island in a major way, through the economy, infrastructure or environment. The act also gives citizens the ability to voice their support or discontent for development on the island. The majority of citizens must support a major development project in order for a land lease to be granted. The governing Council and Cabinet must approve development projects as well. = 2016 Act = In 2016, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda amended the 2007 act in order to change the value of major developments from $5.4 million to $40 million. Moving forward, development projects worth less than $40 million are not subject to a vote from citizens.  Communal land history  Map of Barbuda. Since British occupation, the community-driven relationship with the land has been maintained through a communal land tenure system. In 1685, the British crown leased the island to Christopher Codrington. This lease lasted until 1898. The main town on the island is named after Codrington. During the Codrington family's lease, cattle was bred and traded for use at sugar plantations in Antigua and other nearby Caribbean islands. The Royal Navy also purchased cattle for consumption. Traditional, open cattle grazing methods fared better than the enclosed, private pastoral methods typically used by colonial regimes. The Codringtons attempted to transform Barbuda into a large-scale agricultural and plantation economy, but the island's dry weather patterns made this very difficult. In letters from Codrington's assistants who monitored the island, they indicated that the citizens of Barbuda felt the land was their own. One such letter is from a man named R. Jarrit. In 1820, he wrote to the Codringtons that the people \\"acknowledged no master, and believe the island belongs to themselves\\". In 1904, the British Parliament granted Barbudans with crown tenant status. Many people in Barbuda think that this signifies they have communal ownership. In 1969, Barbuda reached statehood and some occupants recognized themselves as co-owners of the land. Barbudan citizens continued to see the land as their own, even as the islands of Antigua and Barbuda integrated into one nation in 1981. But in that same year, an act was passed in British Parliament that transferred any crown lands, those that belonged to the British, into the ownership of the government of Antigua and Barbuda. Residents are shifting away from communal agricultural methods. There is decreasing demand for Barbudan beef, as Antigua (its main export market) imports greater amounts of foreign beef instead. Barbudan citizens are consuming more foreign beef as well. There is also stigma in choosing herding as an occupation, as younger generations are looking for more profitable opportunities off the island. Declines in rainfall in the past 100 years also make it more difficult for livestock to travel freely and drink from outside water sources.  Recent developments  = Robert De Niro and James Packer = In 2015, actor Robert De Niro and billionaire James Packer purchased a resort on the island. The duo will renovate the former K Club resort for a projected US$250 million. Residents voted on the proposed venture in March, 2015. 206 people voted in favour of the project, outscoring the 175 who contested the development. According to the Antigua Observer, some voters did not think the voting process was fair because there was no system in place to ensure all voters were citizens and that people only voted once. These same people also claim the vote was not anonymous. Before the vote, the government chairman of the event expressed his support for foreign investment to voters. He spoke about potential jobs opportunities the resort would bring to the area. While there was some discontent in the crowd, the room after the vote was filled with loud cheers of approval. The current Prime Minister of Barbuda and Antigua, Gaston Browne, is a large advocate for external development projects, believing that a strong, developed economy is beneficial to residents. = Hurricane Irma = The aftermath of Hurricane Irma in Barbuda. Hurricane Irma destroyed 90 percent of the island and left a majority of the island's population homeless and exiled in nearby Antigua. The event brought attention to the issue of land ownership on the island. Prime Minister Browne wants citizens to purchase their current plots of land for $1. In return, landowners would receive deeds exchangeable for bank loans. These loans are needed in order to rebuild homes destroyed during the hurricane. Browne says this proposed measure will empower citizens to own their land. Trevor Walker, former member of council, believes that this is not a plan to empower citizens, but a way to take away land rights that are enshrined in the 2007 act. Browne has expressed the need to have citizens come back to an environmentally conscious island that is self- sustainable and open for tourists. The island's only hospital was destroyed during the hurricane and is one of the main priorities for the Barbudan government. Browne has also indicated the possibility of having tourists come to the island to take advantage of lower health care costs once the hospital is rebuilt.

Between 1995 and 2016 she presided over the 232nd District Court in Harris County, Texas. She had previously served as assistant district attorney in Harris County. She received her undergraduate degree in English from the University of Texas in 1982. She received her law degree from the University of Houston Law Center in 1985. Her husband, Jim Hippard Jr., is an attorney. They have three children. She ran against incumbent Larry Meyers, who was expected to lose after he switched party allegiance to become a Democrat. In the Republican primary, she ran against Collin County District Judges Chris Oldner and Ray Wheless. Keel described Wheless as 'deceptive and inaccurate.\\" When she ran she had 31 years of criminal legal experience. In 2012 the Texas Department of Public Safety found out that an analyst at the Houston crime lab, Jonathan Salvador, had intentionally falsified lab results, calling into question the validity of nearly 5,000 drug cases. Four hundred of those cases were in Harris Country where Keel was serving as a State District Judge. The district attorney's office requested help from the Harris County Public Defender's Office to retry hundreds of cases, but a dispute arose between Judge Keel and the public defender's office. The Houston Press reports that the dispute was about \\"how, or even if, public defenders were allowed to help those 400 people get new trials.\\" Keel was unwilling to work with the public defenders after the dispute, and between 2014 and 2016 she appointed only one public defender in her court. On this issue she has said \\"They think 'oh we're doing all this great work, We're gonna be the hero [...] They certainly wanted to take on all these easy cases‚Äîit makes their stats look good. If they can get a bunch of these slam-dunk writs where almost everyone's going to be granted relief, yeah, they got carried away‚Äîbut not out of the goodness of their heart.\\" The public defender's office has denied this saying \\"If you talk to anyone at the DA's office, they'll say they asked us to do this.\\" In a second controversy it was discovered that hundreds of defendants had pleaded guilty to drug possession in order to get out of jail because of backlogs in drug testing at the Houston Police Department crime lab. Some of those drugs tests came back negative several months or years later. By the summer of 2016, it was estimated that nearly 300 people had been wrongly convicted. The public defender started filing writs of habeas corpus on behalf of the defendants in various courts, including Keel's. However, because public defenders are only appointed to represent defendants after a judge finds that the defendants are indigent, Keel's position was that the public defender had circumvented her judicial authority by not seeking permission or official appointment from the court before filing the writs. She said, \\"There was no authority whatsoever for them to take those cases[...]And this is the thing that kills me: They tried to double-talk their way out of it and pretend like there was some arrangement that gave them the authority. And they have still not come clean on it.\\" Personal life Keel is from a well-known Austin political family and has five brothers.

The organisation sought both and political and religious rights for women. History When \\"votes for women\\" was a major political question in the United Kingdom there was resistance from conservative members of the Jewish community who worried that their involvement might prompt an anti-semitic backlash. On 3 November 1912 Laura and Leonard Franklin formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage. It is thought that it was the only Jewish suffrage organisation in the world. It was open to members irrespective of their gender. The organisation's aim was to improve both political and religious rights for women. It was felt that some Jewish people may be more inclined to join this group in preference to an unspecific women's suffrage group. Other members included Edith Ayrton, Inez Bensusan Hugh Franklin, her sister Lily Montagu and her sister Henrietta. Henrietta Franklin was one of the few Jewish women to raise their profile in the suffrage movement. Her sister Lily Montagu led a liberal Jewish movement in Britain and in 1902 they had arranged the first meeting of the Jewish Religious Union for the Advancement of Liberal Judaism at Henrietta Franklin's house. Lily and Henrietta were key members of the league's all female executive. Lily would lead the meetings in prayer and she would in time become a rabbi. Henrietta achieved wider acceptance and became President of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1916. The organisation was generally moderate but it had radical members. Some disrupted synagogue services to make their point in 1913 and 1914. The organisation was the major Jewish discussion point for two years. Women protesters were ejected from synagogues and they were labelled as \\"blackguards in bonnets\\" by the conservative Jewish community. The organisation's campaign caused some synagogues to give equal or partial rights to women inside their own organisation, but changes on a national basis took a lot longer to achieve.

Henderson played club rugby with North of Ireland F.C., was capped forty times for Ireland, and was a member of the British and Irish Lions team that toured in 1950. Early life Henderson was born in Drumahoe, County Londonderry on 10 August 1928. He attended Foyle College in Derry, and then Queen's University Belfast. Playing career His first appearance for Ireland came against Scotland in 1949 when he was 20 years old. He also played in the following game against Wales, where Ireland clinched both the Triple Crown and the Five Nations Championship. During the 1950 Five Nations, Henderson made only a single appearance for Ireland due to injury, but was still included in the British Lions squad that travelled to New Zealand and Australia that year. He played in a total of 15 matches during the tour, including in the third test match against New Zealand where he played out of his normal position on the wing. The other matches Henderson played in were 10 tour games against local opposition in New Zealand, the match against the New Zealand Maori team, 2 tour games in Australia and an unofficial match against the Ceylon national team during a stopoff on the journey home. Henderson played in all of Ireland's games in the Five Nations Championship between 1951 and 1955, with Ireland winning the Championship in 1951. In 1956, Henderson was made captain of the national team. Ireland recorded their first victory over a team from the southern hemisphere in January 1958, when they beat Australia during their tour of Europe. Henderson captained the side and with the scores tied at 6 points each, scored the try to give Ireland their win by 9 points to 6. In his last game as Ireland captain in 1958 against France, Henderson switched position from centre to full-back. He finished his international career at full-back, playing all four games in the 1959 Five Nations championship in the position. Henderson's 40 caps for Ireland placed him fourth at the all-time international appearances list at the time of his retirement from international rugby. Henderson played four times for the Barbarians invitational rugby team, against East Midlands in 1951, Cardiff and Swansea in 1955 and as captain against Swansea in 1956. Post-playing career Following his retirement from playing rugby, he continued to play a role as an administrator for his club NIFC and for the Ulster branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU). He was elected president of the Irish Rugby Football Union for the 1990-91 season.

Stan Stewart, Distribution Switchgear, IET, 2004 ,pp. 135-138 The metal enclosed unit connects to the transformer either through a bus throat of standardized dimensions, or else through cables and is usually installed outdoors. Ring main cables enter and leave the cabinet. This type of switchgear is used for medium-voltage power distribution, from 7200 volts to about 36000 volts. The ring main unit was introduced in the United Kingdom and is now widely used in other countries. In North American distribution practice, often the equivalent of a ring main unit is built into a pad-mounted transformer which integrates switches and transformer into a single cabinet. Categories Ring main units can be characterized by their type of insulation: air, oil or gas. The switch used to isolate the transformer can be a fusible switch, or may be a circuit breaker using vacuum or gas-insulated interrupters. The unit may also include protective relays to operate the circuit breaker on a fault.

Captain Gincks (fl. 1705-1706) was a privateer based in New York. He is best known for sailing alongside Adrian Claver, and for a violent incident involving his sailors while ashore. History Gincks‚Äôs 130-man brigantine Dragon arrived in New York in August 1705 alongside Adrian Claver‚Äôs Castel del Rey and two other privateers, de Wint and Willoughby. They had captured a richly-loaded 300-ton, 20-gun, 140-man Spanish ship near Havana, which they brought to New York as a prize ship. Claver rowed alongside the Spanish ship and captured it without waiting for Gincks, though his crew suffered several casualties in the attack. They set most of the prisoners ashore but brought a few prisoners back with them, including two Friars. The captured ship‚Äôs cargo consisted of, among other things, ‚Äú350 pipes of wine and brandy.‚Äù The following month a Spanish prize ship taken by Thomas Penniston arrived, also laden with wine and brandy. Shortly afterwards the two privateer crews (mostly from the Dragon) began a drunken riot, where they ‚Äúassaulted the Sheriff at his door without any provocation, & beat and wounded several persons that came to his assistance.‚Äù Soldiers from the local fort assembled alongside marines from docked Royal Navy ships to break up the gathering. Two soldiers returning home stumbled into the mob and were attacked; after Ensign Alcock was beaten and badly wounded, the rioters stole his sword and killed Lieutenant Featherstone-Hough with it. The militia arrived immediately afterwards, breaking up the riot and capturing several privateers involved with the attack. A sailor named Erasmus Wilkins was caught and charged with Lieutenant‚Äôs murder. Of the privateers‚Äô behavior the Boston News-Letter wrote, ‚Äúit would be too tedious to relate the particulars, but their insolence is beyond expression.‚Äù Gincks soon sailed again, this time to Puerto Rico where in early 1706 the Dragon engaged two French privateers, the Trompeuse and another sloop. They damaged the Dragon‚Äôs sails and rigging, leaving Gincks unable to pursue them. He claimed he had the battle nearly won and would have been able to capture both at once ‚Äúhad they not run,‚Äù but he still managed to send them back to port heavily damaged: ‚Äúthe French Privateers got into St. Thomas being much shatter'd, and several men killed and wounded.‚Äù The Dragon‚Äôs damage was quickly repaired, enabling Gincks (with help from a Dutch ship) to capture another French privateer and two other vessels with which he returned to Jamaica, the last report of his activities.

White regard the neoauthoritarians as resonating with technocracy, emerging in the 1980s as a result of \\"dramatic\\" policy shifts in 1978 that promoted such to top posts, while Canadian Sociologist Yuezhi Zhao considers them as having attempted to avoid an economic reform crisis through dictatorship.Yuezhi Zhao (1998), p.43. Media, Market, and Democracy in China. https://books.google.com/books?id=hHkza3TX-LIC&pg;=PA43 Background Post- Mao China stressed a \\"pragmatic approach to rebuilding the country's economy\\", employing \\"various strategies of economic growth\\" following the 1978 Third Plenum that made Deng Xiaoping paramount leader of China and began the Chinese economic reform. By 1982 the success of China's market experiments had become apparent, making more radical strategies seem possible, if not desirable. This led to the lifting of price controls and agricultural decollectivization, signaling the abandonment of the New Economic Policy, or economic Leninism, in favour of market socialism.Chris Bramall (2008), p.330. Chinese Economic Development. https://books.google.com/books?id=A9Rr-M8MXAEC&pg;=PA330 Alongside economic development, political changes were made as well, departing from totalitarianism towards what Harry Harding characterizes as a \\"consultative authoritarian regime.\\" One desire of political reform was to \\"restore normalcy and unity to elite politics so as to bring to an end the chronic instability of the late Maoist period and create a more orderly process of leadership succession.\\" With cadre reform, individual leaders in China, recruited for their performance and education, became more liberal, with less ideological loyalty. Emergence Having begun in the era of Mao Zedong's cultural revolution, decentralization accelerated under Deng Xiaoping. Writing in 1994, in a seemingly neoauthoritarian/neoconservative vein, Zheng Yongnian considers of the era that \\"Deng's early reform decentralized power to the level of local government (with the goal) to decentralize power to individual enterprises... But this attempt... ran afoul of the growing power of local government, which did not want individual enterprises to retain profit (and) began bargaining with the central government over profit retention, (seizing) decision-making power in the enterprises. This intervention inhibited the more efficient behavior that reforms sought to elicit from industry; decentralization... limited progress.\\" Though the government took a clear stance against liberalization in December 1986, political discussions centered in Beijing would nonetheless emerge in academic circles in 1988 in the form of democracy and Neoauthoritarianism.Petracca, M., & Xiong, M. (1990). The Concept of Chinese Neo-Authoritarianism: An Exploration and Democratic Critique. Asian Survey, 30(11), 1099-1117. doi:10.2307/2644692 Neoauthoritarianismisn would catch the attention of the CCP in early 1988 when Wu Jiaxiang wrote an article in which he concluded that the British monarchy initiated modernization by \\"pulling down 100 castles overnight\\", thus developmentally linking autocracy and freedom as preceding democracy and freedom. A central figure, if not principal proponent of Neoauthoritarianism, the \\"well-connected\\" Wu was an advisor to Premier Zhao Ziyang,Peter Moody (2007), p. 153. Conservative Thought in Contemporary China. https://books.google.com/books?id=PpRcDMl2Pu4C&pg;=PA153 * Michel C. Oksenberg, Marc Lambert, Melanie Manion. p. 194?. Beijing Spring 1989: Confrontation and Conflict. https://books.google.com/books?id=8pIYDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT194 the latter being a major architect of the Deng Xiaoping reforms. Wu went on to restate some ideas of Marxist scholar Rong Jian and through him Samuel Huntington.Peter Moody (2007), p.152-153. Conservative Thought in Contemporary China. https://books.google.com/books?id=PpRcDMl2Pu4C&pg;=PA152 * Michel C. Oksenberg, Marc Lambert, Melanie Manion. p. 194?. Beijing Spring 1989: Confrontation and Conflict. https://books.google.com/books?id=8pIYDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT194  Theory  Samuel Huntington's Political Order in Changing Societies rejected economic development or modernization as transferable to the political sphere as a mere variable of the former. He preconditioned democracy on institutionalization and stability, with democracy and economic change undermining or putting strain on political stability in poor circumstances. He considered the measure of a political system to be its ability to keep order. Writing in the 1960s, he lauded the United States and Soviet Union equally; what the Soviet Union lacked in social justice was made up for in strong controls. By the late 1980s, many elements of Maoism had been abandoned in China and a complete transition to capitalism seemed possible to many given past performance. Though needing restating by Wu Jiaxiang to receive attention, Marxist scholar Rong Jian proposed a neoauthoritarianism requiring a strong state and reform- minded elite, or \\"benevolent dictatorship\\", to facilitate market reform and with it democracy. Chinese theory does not generally advocate repression and despite its dictatorial program neoauthoritarianism seems to be viewed even by its more-progressive opponents among the Chinese to have democracy as a long- term goal through building markets, with which democracy is ultimately co- dependent (and may have been rejected as too radical partly for this reason). With a more Marxistic foundation Neoauthoritarianism is differentiated from both Maoism and Huntington by holding economic change to be a condition for political change while late Maoism considered either as being able to facilitate the other. Moreover, the idea that superstructural development was necessary to facilitate economic growth seemed vain to Chinese leadership given the explosion of the market, giving credence to the idea.Chris Bramall (2008), p. 328-239, 474-475. Chinese Economic Development. https://books.google.com/books?id=A9Rr-M8MXAEC&pg;=PA475 * https://www.thechinastory.org/key-intellectual/rong-jian-%E8%8D%A3%E5%89%91/ Wu considered the market an inseparable condition for democracy. The market reduces the number of public decisions and therefore the number of people seeking political rights and therefore \\"cost\\" of political action. The separation of the political and economic spheres lays a foundation for a further separation of powers, thereby negating autocracy despite the centralizing tendency of the state. The market also defines interests, increasing \\"responsibility\\" and thereby decreasing the possibility of bribery in preparation for democratic politics. On the other hand, political actions become excessive without a market, or with a mixed market, because a large number of people will seek political posts, raising the \\"cost\\" of political action and making effective consultation difficult. To avoid this problem, a country without a developed market has to maintain strongman politics and a high degree of centralism.Michel C. Oksenberg, Marc Lambert, Melanie Manion. p. 194?. Beijing Spring 1989: Confrontation and Conflict. https://books.google.com/books?id=8pIYDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT194  Criticism  With neoauthoritarianism emerging to scholarly debate, Rong Jian opposed his old idea as regressive, favoring the multiparty faction and would become famous for a news article on the matter. Henry He considers the main criticism of neoauthoritarianism to be its advocacy of an \\"old\\" type of establishment, relying on charismatic leaders. His view is corroborated by Yan Yining and Li Wei, with the addition that for Yan what is needed is law, or Li democracy, administrative efficiency and scientific government. Li points out that previous crisis in China were not due to popular participation, but power struggles and corruption and that an authoritarian state does not usually separate powers.Li Wei 2016. Beijing Spring 1989. \\"New Authority\\" Going Astray. https://books.google.com/books?id=8pIYDQAAQBAJ A criticism by Zhou Wenzhang is that neoauthoritarianism only considers problems of authority from the angle of centralization, also considering the main problem of authority to be whether or not it is exercised scientifically.  Persistence as Neoconservativism  Neoauthoritarianism lost favor after the June Fourth Incident. Henry He considers that, while June 4 halted the movement for democracy, because neoauthoritarianism avoids the issue of popular involvement, it would therefore be a downfall for it and General Secretary Zhao Ziyang as well. He considers it to have transformed into a kind of \\"neo- conservatism\\" after that. New Conservatism or neoconservatism () argued for political and economic centralization and the establishment of shared moral values. The movement has been described in the West by political scientist Joseph Fewsmith. Neoconservatives are opposed to radical reform projects and argue that an authoritarian and incrementalist approach is necessary to stabilize the process of modernization. With the failure of democracy in Russia and the performance of Singapore, neo-conservatism would seem to continue to infiltrate the upper echelons of the Communist Party. Most associated with Shanghai intellectuals, Wang Huning, a leading advocate in the 1980s, would go on to become a close advisor to Jiang Zemin in the 1990s. The neo-conservatives would enjoy Jiang's patronage. Joseph Fewsmith writes that, the 1989 crackdown aside, the government lacked the resources to fundamentally address the problems of the worsening agricultural sector, shifting the past conservative-reform dynamic to one of guiding marketization and managing the consequences of reform.Fewsmith, Joseph (July 1995). \\"Neoconservatism and the End of the Dengist Era\\". Asian Survey. 35 (7): 635‚Äì651. JSTOR 2645420 Writing in 1994, Zheng Yongnian considered capitalism as providing a check on state power by dividing public and private spheres, and that \\"Neoconservativism\\" was becoming popular at that time, in contrast to liberal intellectuals who argued for the collapse of the centralized state as necessary to economic growth. He writes that \\"In order to introduce a true market economy, Beijing has to free individual enterprises from local administrative meddling and regain control over funds for central investments in the infrastructure. The state must first recentralize in order to deepen decentralization, as many authors suggest.\\" Still considering democracy a long term goal, the events of June 4 seemed to confirm the \\"neoconservatives\\" belief in a strong state, considering China's autocratic model to actually be weak and ineffectual. They also consider a strong state important in economic growth along the lines of Asian Tiger economies and continued to draw ideas from Samuel Huntington, particularly his book Political Order in Changing Societies. Whatever his use as a foreigner who advocated limiting the scope of democracy, his ideas seemed to have merit on their own.Peter Moody (2007), pp. 151-152. Conservative Thought in Contemporary China. https://books.google.com/books?id=PpRcDMl2Pu4C&pg;=PA151 Social critic Liu Xiaobo believed that the Communist Party grew conservative in response to 1989, without any new ideas, and apart from \\"neo- conservativism\\" conservatism itself became popular in intellectual circles along with the revival of old Maoist leftism.Peter Moody (2007), p.151. Conservative Thought in Contemporary China. https://books.google.com/books?id=PpRcDMl2Pu4C&pg;=PA151 An important neoconservative document was the 1992 China Youth Daily editorial \\"Realistic Responses and Strategic Options for China after the Soviet Upheaval\\", which responded to the fall of the Soviet Union. \\"Realistic Responses\\" described the end of the Soviet state as the result of \\"capitalist utopianism\\", and argued that the Communist Party of China should transform from a \\"revolutionary party\\" into a \\"ruling party\\". The authors believed that the party should depart from the legacy of the Bolshevik Revolution and reformulate socialism according to China's particular national conditions. The neoconservatives enjoyed the patronage of Jiang Zemin during his term as Paramount leader and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (1989‚Äì2002), and Jiang's theory of the Three Represents has been described as a \\"bowdlerized form of neoconservatism\\". Prominent neoconservative theorists include Xiao Gongqin, initially a leading neoauthoritarian who promoted \\"gradual reform under strong rule\\" after 1989, and Wang Huning, who became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party's highest executive body, headed by Party general secretary Xi Jinping in 2017.  Socialistic resurgence  Although China's Leninist, or New Economic Policy (NEP) type model had been abandoned by 1982,Chris Bramall (2008), p. 328. Chinese Economic Development. https://books.google.com/books?id=A9Rr-M8MXAEC&pg;=PA475 there was not initially any attempt at privatization. Dictating that nothing short of market socialism ought to command industry, the neoauthoritarian current for rapid industrialization lead to privatization in the countryside and the encouraging of commerce, but decollectivization was very slow. The agricultural system remained largely unchanged following the program for family farming that had been begun in the 1970s, which was finished by late 1983. The death of Deng Xiaoping would seem to have removed the last barrier to Jiang Zemin's neoauthoritarian program. However, though the market performed very well, and China's state could be considered \\"strong\\" enough for neoauthoritarianism, privatization, even while maintaining a mixed economy, would require a massive program that might threaten the regime with unemployment, and given the problems in Eastern Europe it would appear that the party took a more realistic route than neoauthoritarianism suggested. Despite Jiang Zemin's rapprochement with Dengist reformism, reception of free trade remained shallow, with a higher level of state ownership than any of the other East Asian economies. With price liberalization appearing much more feasible, the party took on a massive program in 1996. Howevever, the ideological vision followed for the 1990s continued to be market socialism, of a sort advocated by the conservative Chen Yun and which might be compared to John Roemer, with price liberalization being completed in 2003. Moreover, price liberalization can be considered as \\"merely continuing a policy begun in the 1980s.\\" ‚ÄúMarket socialism‚Äù was seen as doing away with the informational problems of the planned economy while possibly avoiding the inequalities of share ownership.Chris Bramall (2008), p. 328-330 ,337-338, 475. Chinese Economic Development. https://books.google.com/books?id=A9Rr-M8MXAEC&pg;=PA475 Growth aside, the economic expansion and price liberalization of the 1980s led to inflation, contributing to the growth of the democratic movement preceding the June 4th incident, while the old Leninist or NEP model continued to attract Old Left intellectuals. The 1990s also saw the emergence of the New Left of Wang Shaoguang and Cui Zhiyuan against market socialism, with Wang providing powerful arguments against decentralization and inequality and Cui for workplace democracy based on Mao's Angang Constitution. On the other hand, the nationalistic He Xin portrayed the attempts by the World Bank to impose neoliberalism as cultural imperialism if not suicide, gaining him many allies.Chris Bramall (2008), p. 328. Chinese Economic Development. https://books.google.com/books?id=A9Rr-M8MXAEC&pg;=PA328 More generally, Chinese leadership saw parliamentarism, independent judiciary and a free media as key components to (more real) private property if China was to develop a market, decreasing its appeal.  Legacy  Though apparently taking a backseat to market socialism, on Neoauthoritarianism's side, China's measures for successful economic and political stabilization led many scholars and politicians to accept the role of an authoritarian regime in fast and stable economic growth. Although the Chinese state is seen as legitimizing democracy as a modernization goal, economic growth is seen as more important.Zheng, Yongnian. \\"Development and democracy: are they compatible in China?\\" Political Science Quarterly, vol. 109, no. 2, 1994, p. 235+. Gale Academic Onefile, https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A16083653 In his 1994 article Zheng Yongnian elaborates that, \\"Administrative power should be strengthened in order to provide favorable conditions, especially stable politics, for market development. Without such a political instrument, both 'reform' and 'open door' are impossible... A precondition of political development is the provision of very favorable conditions for economic progress. Political stability must be given highest priority... without stable politics, domestic construction is impossible, let alone an 'open door' policy. So, if political reform or democracy undermines political stability, it is not worthwhile. In other words, an authoritarian regime is desirable if it can produce stable politics.\\" Deng Xiaoping explains: \\"Why have we treated student demonstrations so seriously and so quickly? Because China is not able to bear more disturbance and more disorder.\\" Given the dominance of the Chinese state, Zheng believes that, when it is finally implemented, democracy in China is more likely to be a gift from the elite to the society rather than brought about by internal forces. A 2018 study of schools of political theory in contemporary China identified neoconservatism, still alternatively named neoauthoritarianism, as a continuing current of thought alongside what are now the academically more prominent Chinese New Left, New Confucianism, and Chinese liberalism.

She had been added to a list of people banned from entering Peru, as her political meetings had breached the terms of her tourist visa. She remained at the airport, unable to enter the country and unwilling to leave despite calls for her release. El Mokhtar refused to leave willingly for the SADR and was, on 28 September, placed on a flight to Spain against her will.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1956. with the extent of the designation expanded in 1988. Overview The tumulus is a \\"two conjoined rectangles\\" type kofun () located on a low plateau approximately 10 meters in elevation above the southern bank of the Nitagawa River. It is part of a cluster of 37 tumuli, both large and small, spread over a 900 meter section of the same river terrace, of which twelve survive. The kofun drew much attention when first excavated by a team from Meiji University in 1955 as it was the largest kofun then known in the T≈çkohu region. Subsequently, larger kofun have been found, but the Sakurai Kofun remains the third largest of its type in the region, with a length of 74.5 meters and height of 6.8 meters. . The head of the tumulus is in the form of an earthen step pyramid 45 meters on each side, with a height of 6.35 meters. From the design and artifacts recovered, it is estimated to have been built in the middle of the 4th century. During excavations by the Haramachi Board of Education in 1983, traces of a surrounding moat with width of 7 to 20 meters wide and depth of 60 to 70 cm. The area including the moat was added to the designated Historic Site designation in June 1988. It was also found that the southern end of the rear portion of the mound had been truncated in antiquity, so that its original length was once longer than 74.5 meters. No haniwa or fukiishi were discovered; however, fragments of two bamboo-shaped wooden sarcophagus were found at the top of the rear portion of the tumulus. At present, the kofun is maintained as part of Sakurai Kofun Park, and is located approximately 10 minutes by car from Haranomachi Station on the JR East Joban Line.

Most of the others are small -style circular tumuli with diameter of about 10 meters. The internal structures of the excavated tombs exhibited a great variety, including flagstones, a box-type sarcophagus, and a pit-type stone burial chamber. The grave goods included many straight swords, horse harnesses, and jade jewelry, and stone facsimiles of everyday objects such as axes, and sickles, belonging to the late Kofun period, or the 5th to 6th centuries AD.

He was one of several Craiove»ôti pretenders to the throne, a category which also included his father, Preda Craiovescu. MƒÉrƒÉcine himself entered historical record in 1532, when, as an opponent of Prince Vlad VI, he had his estate confiscated. He returned to favor later that year, with the crowning of Vlad VintilƒÉ de la Slatina. Like Preda before him, MƒÉrƒÉcine served as Ban of Oltenia, becoming the last of his family to hold that title. According to various accounts, he turned against his new lord, from organizing armed resistance in Oltenia to involving himself in Vlad VintilƒÉ's assassination. He was able to maintain his position following the crowning of Radu Paisie, but was eventually toppled by the latter in mid 1535. MƒÉrƒÉcine's own bid for the throne was embraced by some factions of the local boyardom, who took up arms against Paisie in 1536. Since the Craiove»ôti claim contradicted the standards of Wallachian customary law, MƒÉrƒÉcine depicted himself as a son of Neagoe Basarab; he was perhaps Neagoe's nephew. The resulting civil war allegedly involved a hand-to-hand duel between the two rivals, and also saw Paisie's mutilation by the rebels. Barbu probably seized the Wallachian throne with Ottoman acquiescence, before being driven out by the returning Paisie later in 1536. Various records suggest that he lived in exile with his son Nicolaus Bassaraba, and that both of them continued to claim the throne. Barbu was ultimately killed in Istanbul, having encountered the wrath of Suleiman the Magnificent; Nicolaus escaped punishment and fled to the Spanish Empire, but still styled himself a Prince. His male descendants continued to be involved in intrigues in both Wallachia and Moldavia, down to the 1650s. MƒÉrƒÉcine's memory survived in Romanian folklore, which identifies him as the patron of various places around Dolj County. A modern legend also claimed him, anachronistically, as the ancestor of French Renaissance poet Pierre de Ronsard. This invented tradition probably found its first complete form in an eponymous ballad by Vasile Alecsandri, published in the 1850s. It later also inspired prose by, among others, N. D. Popescu-Popnedea, and verse drama by V. A. Urechia. MƒÉrƒÉcine's name and his legendary career remain associated with a dance routine and a variety of Romanian wine. Biography =Origins and early causes= A tributary of the Ottoman Empire from 1417, Wallachia was frequently troubled by civil wars, with various branches of the House of Basarab fighting each other for the throne. MƒÉrƒÉcine's birth coincided with the political advent of his family, the Craiove»ôti, which claimed descent from the DrƒÉcule»ôti Basarabs, through Prince Neagoe Basarab. The latter's own dynastic claim was doubtful, and, as various historians note, relied on him being recognized as the natural son of Basarab IV »öepelu»ô.C√Ærstina, p. 112; Donat (1996), pp. 39‚Äì40, 154; Rezachevici, p. 54; Stoicescu, pp. 18, 74 A competing hypothesis is that Neagoe's mother and »öepelu»ô's wife, Negea, was in fact a Craiove»ôti by birth.Donat (1996), pp. 82, 154 Historian Ion Donat also notes that the Craiove»ôti and Br√¢ncoveni were related to the Basarabs not only through Neagoe, but also through a 1450s Prince, Vladislav II.Donat (1996), pp. 39‚Äì40, 154‚Äì155, 178‚Äì180 Beyond this dispute, it is likely that Neagoe and all other Craiove»ôti descended from one Vlacsan Florev, which made them relatives of three other kingmaking boyar families: the Florescus, the Buze»ôti, and the DrƒÉgoe»ôti.C√Ærstina, p. 115 According to standard interpretations, Neagoe's official father was the Vornic P√¢rvu Craiovescu; P√¢rvu's daughter (and MƒÉrƒÉcine's presumed aunt) Marga was the matriarch of another Craiove»ôti branch, centered on the estate of Br√¢ncoveni.Donat (1996), pp. 39‚Äì41, 52, 56, 62, 77, 82, 157‚Äì162, 166, 168, 170‚Äì171, 173; Stoicescu, pp. 18‚Äì19, 47, 49, 62‚Äì63, 70 MƒÉrƒÉcine's father, the Ban Preda Craiovescu, was very likely P√¢rvu's son: historian N. Stoicescu provides sources that describe Preda as either Neagoe's cousin or brother.Oprea, pp. 159, 161‚Äì162; Stoicescu, pp. 18‚Äì19, 46, 74 Another scholar, Radu Oprea, argues that the Prince and Ban were indisputably brothers.Oprea, pp. 159, 161‚Äì162 Teodosie's body being held up by his mother, Princess Milica, in a contemporary votive icon. The Prince's death transferred his claim to collateral Craiove»ôti, including MƒÉrƒÉcine Neagoe was succeeded in 1521 by his son Teodosie. Preda Craiovescu, who fashioned himself a regent, died the same year, in battle against Teodosie's enemy, Vlad Dragomir CƒÉlugƒÉrul.Oprea, p. 159; Rezachevici, p. 54; Stoicescu, p. 46 All the main DrƒÉcule»ôti lines were probably extinguished with the deaths of Princes Teodosie and Moise; the Craiove»ôti took over their claim, even though this broke the laws of succession: their only probable link to the DrƒÉcule»ôti was maternal. Between 1530 and 1532, the family split into rival camps, with some supporting Vlad VI and others conspiring to have him removed.C√Ærstina, pp. 115‚Äì116; Donat (1996), pp. 56‚Äì58, 102; Oprea, pp. 160‚Äì164 In late 1530,Oprea, p. 160 another member of the family, DrƒÉghici Gogoa»ôƒÉ, passed himself off as Neagoe's son, rather than his cousin, in an effort to usurp Vlad VI. His forgery sparked the wrath of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who oversaw his hanging at Istanbul.C√Ærstina, pp. 112, 116; Oprea, p. 164; Rezachevici, p. 54; Stoicescu, pp. 18, 95. See also Donat (1996), pp. 53‚Äì56, 102, 141, 143, 159, 163 As noted by scholar Constantin Rezachevici, historians were prone to identify DrƒÉghici and MƒÉrƒÉcine as one and the same person, until documents discovered in 1976 proved them wrong.Rezachevici, p. 54. See also Oprea, p. 164 The actual MƒÉrƒÉcine, or Barbu III Craiovescu, also appears to have been entangled in the conspiracy to topple Vlad VI, but, according to Oprea, only from March 1532. A writ of the period notes that the estates of \\"Jupan Barbul and Preda the Ban\\" were confiscated by the Prince, then assigned to MƒÉrƒÉcine's loyalist nephew, Hamza of Obislav.Oprea, pp. 160‚Äì161. See also Donat (1996), pp. 57‚Äì58, 102, 141 MƒÉrƒÉcine reached prominence following Vlad VI's accidental drowning, when Vlad VintilƒÉ de la Slatina took over as Prince. The new monarch confirmed him as Ban of Oltenia on March 17, 1534, some three months after Hamza had been removed from that position.Stoicescu, pp. 47, 62‚Äì63. See also C√Ærstina, p. 116; Rezachevici, p. 54 Like his father, MƒÉrƒÉcine probably established his regional court southwest of Craiova, in his family's fortified church, and built primitive defenses along the Jiu River.Donat (1937), p. 8 By then, the political landscape of Wallachia had been complicated further, with Vlad VintilƒÉ and some of the boyars remaining loyal to the Ottomans, while others began hatching plots to align the country with the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, which was fighting the Little War. A contemporary report by Alvise Gritti alleges that Barbu, on surface a pro-Ottoman, also sided with the Hungarians. This text suggests that \\"Barbul Ban\\" was removed from office, but still withdrew to Craiova; in retaliation, Oltenia was invaded by loyalists from BuzƒÉu County. These were supposed to exercise terror in Vlad VintilƒÉ's name, but also to help the Prince in preparing his own anti-Ottoman uprising.Decei, pp. 125‚Äì126, 132, 146, 152 According to medievalist Irina F. C√Ærstina, Gritti's account should be disregarded as entirely spurious.C√Ærstina, pp. 116‚Äì117 Nevertheless, other scholars also highlight the mounting conflict between the Prince and the Ban. Valentin Gheonea attributes Vlad VintilƒÉ's assassination in June 1535 specifically to the Craiove»ôti boyars. \\"The most powerful group at the time\\", they became \\"annoyed by the prince's exceedingly authoritarian manner\\".Gheonea, p. 50 This is also proposed by Claudiu Neagoe. Unlike Gritti, he describes MƒÉrƒÉcine and the Craiove»ôti as Ottoman loyalists who resented Vlad VintilƒÉ's push for emancipation.Claudiu Neagoe, \\"Cultura oralƒÉ »ôi rolul ei social √Æn »öƒÉrile Rom√¢ne (sec. XV‚ÄìXVIII)\\", in Argesis. Studii »ôi ComunicƒÉri. Seria Istorie, Vol. XXIII, 2014, p. 36 He also notes that Barbu organized the hunting trip which created an opportunity for assassination. This account originates with Macarious Zaim, who claims that the boyars killed the Prince before he could kill them, and locates these events in Craiova. =1536 uprising and exile= The new ruler was a former monk, Radu Paisie, alleged son of Radu the Great. Though appointed by a boyar consensus, he soon had conflicts with the more prominent families. Barbu III was last mentioned as Ban on July 30, 1535, stripped of his office by August, and ultimately replaced with »òerban of Izvorani.Rezachevici, p. 54. See also Oprea, p. 159; Stoicescu, p. 47 According to Oprea, the demotion \\"probably occurred after August 9\\".Oprea, p. 159 Now established as a dissenter, MƒÉrƒÉcine also stated a claim to the throne, taking up the family tradition. This also implied falsifying his lineage and describing himself as Neagoe's son, rather than nephew.Rezachevici, pp. 54‚Äì55 Paisie was subsequently faced with a boyar rebellion, which may have ended with his dethronement. As noted by Gheonea, Paisie's ouster may be verified by the absence of writs issued in his name at any point between August and December 1536, and again between August and October 1537. This is corroborated by the writings of Nicolaus Olahus. Olahus claims that Paisie and the rebel leader, who may have been Barbu III, fought a duel in front of their boyar armies; the latter was defeated and captured, but his partisans freed him from prison, then assailed Paisie, mutilated him, and sent him into exile.Cornelia Popa-Gorjanu, \\"Despre originea lui Nicolaus Olahus (1493‚Äì1568)\\", in Terra Sebus. Acta Musei Sabesiensis, Vol. 6, 2014, p. 318; Rezachevici, p. 53 Rezachevici and other historians believe that the episode was a Craiove»ôti ascendancy, and that MƒÉrƒÉcine was the actual Prince of Wallachia between February and April 1536.Luca, p. 658; Oprea, pp. 159‚Äì160; Rezachevici, pp. 54‚Äì55, 56 As Rezachevici notes (based on the account in Olahus), MƒÉrƒÉcine was, at least in the beginning, supported by Sultan Suleiman and the Ottoman Army.C√Ærstina, p. 128; Rezachevici, pp. 53, 55 Also backing him were Tudor of DrƒÉgoe»ôti, the country's Logothete, and Ban Toma of Pietro»ôani. Both were swiftly executed by Paisie, who retook his crown with assistance from the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom.C√Ærstina, pp. 117, 128; Rezachevici, p. 58 Traditional historiography held that Barbu died childless, and was therefore the last notable member of his family. Rezachevici argues against this interpretation, noting that it is only true in the sense that no other Craiove»ôti served as Bans.Rezachevici, pp. 53, 54. See also Oprea, p. 164; Stoicescu, p. 47 Rezachevici proposes that MƒÉrƒÉcine may have traveled through Europe before moving to Istanbul with his wife, his unnamed daughter, and a son, Nicolaus Bassaraba.Rezachevici, pp. 54‚Äì55, 58 The latter was also identified as MƒÉrƒÉcine's son by genealogist G. D. Florescu.Stoicescu, p. 46 Other records may suggest that MƒÉrƒÉcine also continued to involve himself in intrigues, both in Wallachia and, with time, in neighboring Moldavia. In July 1536, Bo≈æidar Vukoviƒá \\"della Vecchia\\", who spied on behalf of the Holy Roman Empire, noted that an unnamed \\"king of Wallachia\\", present in Istanbul, had signed up to the project of anti-Ottoman rebellion. Rezachevici believes that this was \\"very probably Barbu himself\\",Rezachevici, p. 55 while Gheonea reads it as a reference to Paisie and his secretive anti-Ottoman agenda. Several historians believe that, in 1563, Nicolaus conspired with Moldavia's Prince, Iacob Heraclid, to take over as a Wallachian vassal. The primary source which provides evidence for this refers to Heraclid's associate as the \\"son of Basarab\\". According to Claudiu Neagoe, \\"Nicolae Basarab, son of Barbu Craiovescu\\" was to be installed as puppet ruler following Hercalid's defeat of Peter the Younger. This plan was vetoed by Suleiman, and abandoned as Heraclid withdrew to Moldavia.Claudiu Neagoe, \\"'Uniuni dinastice' »ôi proiecte matrimoniale √Æntre »öƒÉrile Rom√¢ne √Æn a doua jumƒÉtate a veacului al XVI-lea\\", in Argesis. Studii »ôi ComunicƒÉri. Seria Istorie, Vol. XI, 2002, p. 197 Rezachevici also argues that Nicolaus Bassaraba remains the relevant source for MƒÉrƒÉcine's later life and death. Nicolaus claimed that \\"my father Barbulus Bassaraba\\" was strangled in 1565, on the orders of Sultan Suleiman, after engaging in a conspiracy. He himself escaped a similar fate by fleeing to Hospitaller Malta, and then fought for the Spanish Empire as a mercenary.Rezachevici, pp. 54‚Äì56, 58 A German diplomatic letter of August 15, 1565 seemingly backs this account, noting that on August 1 a \\"former despot of Wallachia\\" had been decapitated, then thrown into the Sea of Marmara. As noted by Rezachevici, the source \\"could only refer to Barbu III Craiovescu\\".Rezachevici, pp. 55‚Äì56. See also Oprea, pp. 159‚Äì160 Legacy =Early posterity= Latin signature of Nicolaus Bassaraba, referring to himself as heir to \\"Transalpine Wallachia\\" Although much of the family was expunged from Wallachia, its matrilineal descendants continued to claim and hold high offices at the court of successive Princes.Donat (1996), pp. 40‚Äì42, 56, 107, 110; Stoicescu, pp. 47, 70, 144, 153 Still living in Wallachia, MƒÉrƒÉcine's aunt Marga was the mother of two sons, V√¢lsan and Matei.Donat (1996), pp. 56, 77, 158‚Äì162, 166; Stoicescu, pp. 51, 70 She sold her estate Bistre»õ to Paisie, as a means to free both brothers from Ottoman slavery.Donat (1996), pp. 62, 158, 159 Arma»ô Detco of Br√¢ncoveni, who was Marga's in-law and possibly also more directly related to the clan, remained loyal to Paisie and received many of the old Craiove»ôti estates.Donat (1996), pp. 32, 56, 63, 67‚Äì68, 142, 146, 149, 162, 164, 172 Despite their conflict with Paisie, both V√¢lsan and Matei were forced into exile by his rival and successor, Mircea Ciobanul.Donat (1996), p. 77 From his own exile, Nicolaus Bassaraba pleaded with the crowned heads of Western Europe to help him obtain the Wallachian crown, and also canvassed financial support. Though he never occupied the throne, in 1569, at Segovia, he created his sponsor, Hans Heher, a \\"Marquess of Ialomi»õa\\".Eugen Denize, \\"Rom√¢ni √Æn Spania secolului XVI\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1996, p. 53 He disappeared from records in 1574.Luca, pp. 658‚Äì659, 661 One hypothesis in the community of historians argues that Nicolaus was the father of Cremonese Basarab, who in November 1599 tried to replace Nicolae PƒÉtra»ôcu as Wallachian Prince, with Ottoman backing.Luca, pp. 656‚Äì661; Rezachevici, p. 58 Another theory, advanced by historian Cristian Luca, identifies Cremonese as the natural father of a daughter, born before 1574, and the adoptive father of two other girls, whose real father was the Veneto-Cypriote Carlo Cornelio Zamberlan. According to this reading, Cremonese married Zamberlan's widow, Franceschina Ghisi.Luca, pp. 654‚Äì661 Based on this identification, MƒÉrƒÉcine's grandson converted to Catholicism in the 1580s, but was rebuked by Pope Sixtus V for keeping \\"four wives\\".Luca, p. 659 Cremonese's only son was probably born to Franceschina,Luca, pp. 659, 661 and styled himself Neagu vodƒÉ Basarab; he may have been Barbu III's last direct descendant. Unlike his ancestors, Neagu set his sights on obtaining the throne of Moldavia.Luca, pp. 659‚Äì661; Rezachevici, p. 58 The other surviving Craiove»ôti line briefly took the Wallachian throne in 1603, with Radu »òerban, widely seen as the second reigning member of the house, after Neagoe.Donat (1996), p. 153 In the 1630s, another collateral line of the Craiove»ôti, claiming descent from Marga and Detco, took over with Matei Basarab seizing the throne. In the years after his coronation, and leading up to the battle of Finta, Matei backed Neagu's Moldavian project.Luca, pp. 659‚Äì660; Rezachevici, p. 58 According to Luca, Neagu never got to see either Wallachia or Moldavia, instead spending his entire life in Istanbul.Luca, p. 660 With time, Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine became a character in Romanian folklore, the hero of several Oltenian legends. The first one of these, preserved by the peasants of Dolj County, was written down in 1830. These stories establish strong links between MƒÉrƒÉcine, described as Prince of Wallachia, and various landmarks in and around Co»ôoveni, and along BƒÉnesele River; some also describe his burial site as Sadova Monastery, which may be the result of confusion between various Craiove»ôti.Rezachevici, pp. 53, 56. See also Donat (1937), p. 68; Stoicescu, p. 47 Other oral traditions refer to his paramour, a boyaress from Ghindeni,Rezachevici, p. 56 and claim that MƒÉrƒÉcine had fathered several daughters. A folk song, known as Vlad VodƒÉ VintilƒÉ, apparently records MƒÉrƒÉcine's involvement in the regicide of 1535. =MƒÉrƒÉcine as a Ronsard= Birth of the myth The Ban is also the inspiration for a romantic myth involving the French poet Pierre de Ronsard. In his El√©gie XX, first published in 1554, Ronsard imagined himself as the heir of a \\"Thracian\\" marquess. The pedigree, described as a \\"joke\\" by the erudite Alexandru Odobescu,Odobescu, p. 249 contradicts another poem by Ronsard, where he fashions himself as being de nation germain (\\"of the German nation\\").Rezachevici, p. 57 It also clashes with a 1586 oration by Jacques Davy Duperron, which depicts Ronsards as Moravians.Brezianu, pp. 199‚Äì200 In 1844, the \\"Thracian\\" account was picked up by historian Jean Alexandre Vaillant, who argued that it was entirely based in fact, and who suggested that Ronsard meant to say he was Wallachian.CiorƒÉnescu, p. 84; Rezachevici, p. 57 This then inspired a Moldavian-born poet, Vasile Alecsandri, who identified Ronsard's legendary ancestor with MƒÉrƒÉcine, ignoring that Ronsard himself was born in 1524. He recorded his reading into an eponymous ballad, localized in the 14th century but otherwise heavily indebted to the Oltenian tradition about the 16th- century Ban.Rezachevici, pp. 53, 56‚Äì57 Moreover, Alecsandri claimed that the story of MƒÉrƒÉcine's career in the Kingdom of France had been found in his folkloric source.Eliade, p. 5 Philologist Alexandru CiorƒÉnescu, who doubts that MƒÉrƒÉcine even existed, sees the work as a sample of Alecsandri inventing tradition, as he had already done elsewhere. It remains \\"the strangest of all the so-called popular ballads of Alecsandri\\", in that \\"it enacts a false tradition that is not even R[o]manian\\".CiorƒÉnescu, pp. 83‚Äì84 This is also noted by scholar Ion Donat, according to whom Alecsandri's MƒÉrƒÉcine was \\"substantially different\\" from the folkloric character. Donat, who established the connection between MƒÉrƒÉcine as a folkloric character and the historical Barbu III, also noted that \\"the local tradition of Dolj proved closer to reality than Ronsard's poetic whim.\\" Elena VulcƒÉnescu, \\"Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine‚ÄìPierre de Ronsard, un mit bicefal\\", in Ramuri, Nr. 2/2008 Matei Millo in drag, appearing as a French lady in V. A. Urechia's Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine. Photograph by Carol Szathmari In addition to picking up ideas from Vaillant, Alecsandri may have been inspired by the writer Gheorghe Asachi, who endorsed a version of the legend which identified Ronsard's ancestor with a \\"Romanian knight\\". Asachi believed that this figure was active ca. 1345, leading troops into battle in the Hundred Years' War.Pop II, p. 4 Published in French by Abdolonyme Ubicini (1855), Alecsandri's poem also functioned as propaganda, canvassing French support for the United Principalities.CiorƒÉnescu, p. 84; Odobescu, pp. 249‚Äì250; Rezachevici, p. 57 Over the following decades, it inspired other literary works, including an 1874 novella by N. D. Popescu- Popnedea and an 1878 historical drama, in verse, by V. A. Urechia.Pop III, p. 4 The latter premiered at the National Theater Bucharest for the benefit of Alsace-Lorraine refugees.Brezianu, p. 206 By 1899, when recorded by critic George Ionescu-Gion, the story had it that a \\"Baldovin MƒÉrƒÉcine\\" had settled in France ca. 1320, before the very foundation of Wallachia, becoming Baudouin de Ronsard.George Ionescu-Gion, Istoria Bucurescilor, p. 671. Bucharest: Stabilimentul Grafic I. V. Socec≈≠, 1899. ; Vasile Novac, \\"Gole»ôtii √Æn istoria Bucure»ôtilor\\", in Bucure»ôti. Materiale de Istorie »ôi Muzeografie, Vol. IX, 1972, p. 213 Ramifications A competing hypothesis, suggested by the heraldist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, argued that Ronsard truly had Romanian ancestors, but that these came from B√¢rlad, in Moldavia.N., \\"Lettre de Roumanie (de notre correspondant particulier). Visite des deux cents Fran√ßais en Roumanie ‚Äî La France acclam√© ‚Äî L'origine roumaine de Ronsard\\", in La Croix, October 20, 1909, p. 4 Alecsandri's modern legend was nevertheless accepted as factual by Ronsard experts Achille de RochambeauBrezianu, pp. 202‚Äì203 and Prosper Blanchemain,Rezachevici, pp. 57‚Äì58 and credited in an intertextual poem by Anna de Noailles. Sonia Cuciureanu, \\"Meridiane: De la obsesia dezrƒÉdƒÉcinƒÉrii la visul Europei Unite\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 24/2013 In 1911, the Frenchman Rou√´t de Ceresnes, inspired by the legend, rewrote it as a novel, titled Le Chevalier de Ronsard et le Ban Maratchine.\\"Bibliografii. Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 70/1911, p. 9 By then, the story had been denounced by the Romanian critic Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion as a sample of \\"chauvinistic\\" Romanian nationalism, carried only by \\"insufficient proof\\". Although again debunked by Romanist Henri Longnon in 1912, it was still being viewed as a reliable hypothesis by L√©o Claretie, who revisited the topic shortly before his death in 1924. He and other authors believed that the Ban had died in France in 1341.Pop II, pp. 3‚Äì4 Claretie also viewed Ronsard as a cultured version of the Wallachian LƒÉutari. This was already being contrasted by other verdicts. A 1915 monograph by Alexandru Resmiri»õƒÉ showed that Alecsandri's derivation of Ronsard from ronce (\\"bramble\\", and therefore MƒÉrƒÉcine) was highly improbable. In 1927, researcher C. Radu concluded that Alecsandri had not only fabricated the story, but also his own genealogy, with an \\"obvious resemblance\\" between the two narratives: the fictitious Alecsandri patriarch was a Venetian knight.\\"Ecouri. FreamƒÉtul (II, 1‚Äî2, Ian.‚ÄîFebr. 1927‚ÄîFoc»ôani)\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 5/1927 Historian Nicolae Iorga viewed Alecsandri's ballad a \\"youthful idiocy\\", although he concluded that Ronsard's claim to a \\"Thracian\\" origin was not entirely baseless.Nicolae Iorga, Despre preclasicism. Conferin»õƒÉ la Institutul frances, p. 7. VƒÉlenii de Munte: Datina Rom√¢neascƒÉ, 1938 Similarly, scholar Mircea Eliade proposed that Ronsard, while unrelated to MƒÉrƒÉcine and Oltenia, could have taken his family name from the town of R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat.Eliade, p. 6 In later decades, the myth was again revisited as a somewhat plausible account by scholars such as Fr√©d√©ric Boyer (1965) and Elena VulcƒÉnescu (2008)‚Äîthe latter believes that Ronsard may have hailed from the Vlachs of Moravia. In the 1920s, a popular dance evoking the Alecsandri legend, and named after Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine, was still being performed in Greater Romania.Pop III, p. 4. See also Brezianu, p. 206 According to CiorƒÉnescu, Alecsandri had managed to invent folklore: \\"this legend [of Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine] has become popular and is even sung and danced in certain rural circles.\\"CiorƒÉnescu, p. 84 The myth still inspired Romanians to name things in honor of the Ban. \\"Banul MƒÉrƒÉcine\\" landmarks include a street in Timi»ôoara, which took that name in the interwar years, and, as of 1965, a wine-producing region centered on Piele»ôti. Here, a secondary myth emerged, describing MƒÉrƒÉcine's Oltenian grapes as the source of Burgundy wine. A short adventure novel, also based on the earlier legend, was penned in 1967 by Grigore BƒÉjenaru for Editura Tineretului company.\\"Cronologie\\", in Grigore BƒÉjenaru, Ci»ômigiu & Comp.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2011 by the Japanese government. Overview The site is located on a 40-50 meter hilltop about 7 km distant from the Pacific coastline, and extends almost along a long, narrow tongue-shaped hill 240 meters north-south by 60 meters east-west. Excavations from 2007 to 2009 confirmed the ruins of seven iron smelting furnaces, and 26 charcoal-making kilns along with the remains of 31 additional depressions in the nearby woods also believed to have been smelting furnaces together with another 23 possible charcoal kilns. In addition, at the adjacent Tategoshi Steel Production Site are the remains of an additional three iron smelting furnaces and 16 charcoal kilns. The smelting furnaces are designed as a bloomery, with a chimney made of heat-resistant earth and clay, located in a 1.5 meter deep pit and surrounded by an annular (doughnut-shaped) ridge 20 meters in diameter. Up to six bloomeries were located within one annular ring, which pieced with tuyeres to allow air to enter the furnace and molten pig iron to be extracted. The furnaces and slag dump are at the northern end of the ridge, and charcoal kilns were found at the center and southern areas. In addition, from the first half of the 9th century, a rectangular box-shaped furnace with a length of about 180 cm and a width of about 50 cm, which had a bellows in the center was found. This produced high purity iron, of which several large lumps were also found. Four slag sites have been identified, and over 68 tons of slag have been excavated. The coastal area of Fukushima Prefecture is rich in iron sand, and the ancient Uda and Namata counties were active areas for steelmaking. Near this archeological site, a late 7th century iron-production ruin has been found in the Kanazawa area near the coast. In the latter half of the 8th century to mid-9th century, production moved inland to the Yokodaid≈ç site, and disappeared in the first half of the 10th century. It is one of the largest steelworks in the T≈çhoku region in terms of scale, and is an important archeological site for understanding the political and social situation at the time. During this period, the conflict between the Yamato state and the Emishi tribes of northern Japan was growing and the demand for mass production of iron products such as weapons was rapidly increasing. The site is about a 31-minute walk from Odaka Station on the JR East J≈çban Line.

The large wooden mosque, together with the royal palace of Kraton Kadriyah, was among the first buildings constructed in the city following the establishment of Pontianak in 1771. History The 'Jami Mosque of Pontianak was built following the founding of Pontianak by its founder Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie. Alkadrie was the son of al Habib Hussein, a Muslim scholar from Semarang who moved to West Kalimantan in 1733 and was received by the Sultan of Matan, Kamaluddin, and then elected to be his Mufti of Religious Matters. He married the daughter of the Sultan, Nyai Tua. From this marriage, Syarif Abdurrahman Alkadrie was born. Because of a conflict between Hussein and Sultan Kamaluddin, Hussein moved to the Mempawah Kingdom. He died in Mempawah, and so his role as a Muslim scholar was replaced by his son Alkadrie. To establish a Muslim Sultanate in Kalimantan, Alkadrie disembarked to the downstream of the river Kapuas together with his envoys of fourteen boats. Alkadrie's entourage reached the confluence of the Kapuas River and Landak River on October 23, 1771. They cleared the area near the estuary to start a new settlement. From this spot, Alkadrie founded a new Sultanate, the Pontianak Sultanate, where he established a royal palace and a royal mosque. The original mosque was a small-sized wooden mosque topped with thatched roofs. Alkadrie died in 1808 AD, leaving a son named Sharif Usman. Sharif Usman was a child when Alkadrie's died, so he could not continue his father's sovereignty. The royal administration decided that the kingdom would be led by the brother of Syarif Abdurrahman, named Sharif Kasim. When Syarif Usman matured, he succeeded his uncle as the Sultan of Pontianak from 1822 to 1855. Syarif Usman rebuilt the mosque in the month of Muharram year 1827. At its completion, he named it Abdurrahman Mosque as a tribute to his father. Architecture In a typical feature of Indonesian mosques, the mosque consists of main posts (saka guru) which supported the multi-tiered roofs. These main posts numbered six and was created out of belian wood, a type of high-quality hardwood native to the island. The most prominent feature of the mosque is its multi-tiered pyramidal roofs. There are three tiers of roofs, topped with the fourth tier in the form of a bell-shaped cupola. Glass windows provide light into the interior between the lowest and second-lowest tier. On the upper terrace situated above the second-lowest tier, four rooms or gardu topped with cupolas acted as a kind of finials on the upper ridges of the second roof-tier. A six-sided cupola roofed the mihrab of the mosque. The roof is covered in shingles made of belian pieces. In the typical architecture of West Kalimantan, the mosque is built over a wooden platform, a common feature of river settlements in West Kalimantan. This stage is approximately high above the ground. Today, a cement base improves the stability of the mosque.

The Kraus‚ÄìWeber test involved six simple movements and took 90 seconds to administer. Some early studies using this test were performed by Bonnie Prudden. In 1940s and 1950s, she applied this test to students in her conditioning classes. To her surprise the new students failed the test at 58% while the students who had been in the program failed at only 8%. Over a period of seven years, Prudden and her volunteers tested 4,458 children between the ages of 6 and 16 in the United States. The failure rate was 56.6%. While climbing in Europe, Prudden and Kraus arranged to test children in Europe. In Italy, Austria and Switzerland, the children tested exhibited an eight percent failure rate. In 1952, Prudden and Kraus began writing papers for medical and physical education journals concerning their findings on Hypokinetic Disease: Role of Inactivity in Production of Disease and various media outlets began to pick up the story. spanish In 1955, armed with statistics and a personal invitation to the Eisenhower White House, Bonnie Prudden presented her findings on the fitness level of American public school children compared to that of their peers in Europe.

The devices were revealed at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on 25 February 2018, as the successors to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ have nearly identical features to the S8 batch, with the same display size and aspect ratio, just like their predecessor. One highly regarded change to distinguish between the models is the location of the fingerprint sensor. While the S8's is found beside the camera, the S9's is directly underneath it. Most notably, however, the S9 line is equipped with several camera improvements over the S8. The phone received generally favorable reviews, with critics mostly noting the enhanced camera and better positioned fingerprint scanner. Critics, however, still criticize the lack of improvement to other features compared to its predecessor. It is available in seven colours (Lilac Purple, Midnight Black, Titanium Gray, Coral Blue, Sunrise Gold, Burgundy Red, and Polaris Blue). It was succeeded by the Samsung Galaxy S10 in March 2019.  Launch  Many Galaxy S9 features and design changes were leaked weeks before the official launch, and the official launch video was leaked a few hours prior to the unveiling.  Specifications  = Hardware =  Display  On the front, the Galaxy S9 and S9+ look identical to the S8 and S8+. They both feature 1440p Super AMOLED displays, with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The S9 has a 5.8-inch panel, while the S9+ uses a larger 6.2-inch panel. The displays have curved sides that slope over the horizontal edges of the device.  Cameras  The cameras on both phones received improvements. The S9+ has a dual-lens camera setup on the back, like on the Galaxy Note 8, while the S9 only has a single camera on the back. Both phones have a Dual Aperture rear camera which can switch between 1.5 and 2.4, depending on lighting conditions, making it the first mobile phone since the Nokia N86 (2009) with a variable aperture camera. The phones can record video with 4K (2160p) at 60 frames per second (limited to 5 minutes), 1080p at 240 frames per second and 960 frames per second \\"Super Slo-Motion \\" video at 720p for 0.2 seconds, all three of which have been featured on any Samsung flagship phone for the first time.Galaxy S9 specification sheet on GSM Arena AR Emoji, similar to Apple's Animoji feature on the iPhone X, is a new feature that lets the user make emojis based on themselves with the help of artificial reality face recognition. Third party app support is provided for this feature.  Chipsets and storage  In most countries, the S9 and S9+ both come with a Samsung Exynos 9810 SoC. Versions sold in the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Latin America come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC instead. The S9 comes with 4 GB of RAM; the S9+ comes with 6 GB of RAM. Both devices come with storage options of 64, 128 and 256 GB, and feature the ability to use a microSD card to expand the storage to a maximum of 400 GB.  Batteries  The battery capacities are the same as their predecessors: 3000 mAh for the S9, and 3500 mAh for the S9+. The batteries are not user- replaceable. Just like its predecessor, the S9 supports AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA) and Wireless Power Consortium's Qi wireless charging standards. Wired charging allows for up to 15 Watts via Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 while wireless charging is possible with up to 10 Watts.  Audio  The S9 and S9+ now have stereo speakers tuned by AKG and the phones also have Dolby Atmos surround sound support; furthermore, the S9 and S9+ are two of the few smartphones that still retain the 3.5mm headphone jack.  Exterior  Where the S9 and S9+ have the most noticeable change from the S8 line is on the back of the phone. The fingerprint sensor has been moved from the right of the camera to a more centralized location just below the camera like on the Galaxy A8 and A8+ for convenience. A more secure unlocking method has been added, where face recognition and iris scanning have been merged into one and called Intelligent Scan. There are also several construction improvements compared to S8 and S8+ models, mostly to increase physical durability, such as thicker glass, thicker metal rim and different (less prone to deformation) metal alloy used for the frame. = Software = The S9 and S9+ ship with Android 8.0 \\"Oreo\\" with the Samsung Experience user interface and software suite. It is mainly unchanged over the versions found on the S8 and Note 8, but adds additional features such as new customization options, live language translation in the camera app, and landscape orientation support for the Samsung home screen. The S9 and S9+ also support Project Treble, making it easier to update than previous generations of Galaxy Devices.https://www.xda- developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-aosp-android-oreo-project-treble/title= This is the Samsung Galaxy S9 running on AOSP Android Oreo thanks to Project Treble In December 2018, Samsung began to release Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" for the S9. This update introduces a major revamp of Samsung's Android user experience known as One UI. A main design element of One UI is intentional repositioning of key user interface elements in stock apps to improve usability on large screens: many apps include large headers that push the beginning of content towards the center of the display, while navigation controls and other prompts are often displayed near the bottom of the display instead.  Reception  John McCann from Techradar complimented the improved camera and the new location of the fingerprint sensor, but criticized that it was too similar to its predecessor (Galaxy S8) and had limited AR Emoji functionality. Brian Heater of TechCrunch reviewed the S9+ on 8 March 2018, and said that the phone is built on the \\"success [of the S8] in a number of ways\\".\\"Samsung Galaxy S9+\\", TechCrunch, Brian Heater, 8 March 2018 Computerworld gave the phone a positive review and said it was \\"measurably better than its predecessor\\", but did note there wasn't a new feature that was particularly \\"exciting\\".\\"Review: Samsung's new Galaxy S9 phones make excellence routine\\", Dan Rosenbaum, Computerworld, 12 March 2018 PC Magazine also gave the Galaxy S9 and S9+ positive reviews.\\"With the Galaxy S9, Samsung's Redemption Is Complete\\", Tim Bajarin, PC Magazine, 12 March 2018 CNBC's Todd Haselton said on 8 March that the S9+ was superior to the S9, for reasons such as the larger screen and second camera, as well as more RAM and battery power.\\"If you're looking to buy the new Samsung phone, get the Galaxy S9+ instead of the Galaxy S9\\", CNBC, Todd Haselton, 8 March 2018 Samuel Gibbs from The Guardian gave the S9+ 5/5 stars, with the headline it was \\"the best big-screen smartphone by miles\\". Screen and camera were praised, but the review noted battery life could be better. He also appreciated the inclusion of a headphone jack, despite many other phones not having one.\\"Samsung Galaxy S9+ review: the best big-screen smartphone by miles\\", The Guardian, Samuel Gibbs, 8 March 2018 The larger S9+'s camera received a score of 99 from DxOMark, which, at the time was the highest score awarded by them to a mobile device camera. It was soon surpassed by the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro, which scored 102 and 109 respectively. Dan Seifert of The Verge gave the S9 a score of 8.5, stating that its performance, camera and design were satisfactory. However, he was not amused by the average battery life and the addition of Bixby, also saying that Samsung has a poor history of updating their smartphones. = Sales = Samsung has described the sales of the Galaxy S9 as \\"slow\\" in their Q2 2018 earning report. Analysts predicted that the phone would be the worst selling Galaxy S flagship since the Samsung Galaxy S5. During its first two sales quarters, a record low 19.2 million units were sold.  Issues  = Touchscreen issues = About a week after the release of the devices, users started experiencing an issue in the touchscreen, where it would fail to register input in any particular area of the screen, even after a factory reset. This was termed as \\"dead zones\\" by the users. Samsung has responded by issuing a statement that they were \\"looking into a limited number of reports of Galaxy S9/S9+ touchscreen responsiveness issues\\". = Black Crush issues = Some users of the Galaxy S9 have reported the so-called \\"Black Crush\\" issues, where the display has issues displaying different shades of dark colors. Samsung has responded with a statement that they are aware of \\"a limited number of reports of Galaxy S9/S9+ displaying dark colors differently than intended in certain instances\\" but has not provided an official fix for it yet. = Battery life issues = Many users with the Exynos variant of the phone experienced subpar battery life. Analysts discovered that the four Samsung-designed cores had been poorly tuned, resulting in decreased battery life. This issue, however, has been addressed in part with the release of the August 2018 update. = Exynos 9810 performance = In previous Galaxy S phones, the Exynos processor performed similar to the Snapdragon version. The S9 powered by the Exynos 9810 performed relatively slow for a flagship and compared to the Snapdragon-powered S9. This was not very evident in synthetic benchmarks, but more so in benchmarks that simulated real world performance, such as PCMark.

She was listed in the Louisiana census as 'Col', or colored. Her daughter, author Gail Lukasik, kept the secret for seventeen years before publishing her story in a book, \\"White Like Her: My Family's Story of Race and Racial Passing.\\" Personal life Alvera Frederic was born in 1921 to Camille Kilbourne and Azemar Frederic. Camille was of English and Scottish heritage and Alvera considered her father's lineage to be of French stock. Theirs was a brief union, both later remarried and had separate families. Albert Girard, Azemar's maternal grandfather and Celeste Girard Frederic, his mother, were both listed in the 1900 census with the appellation, B.- in the column for race, indicating that they were black. Azemar's father was Leon Frederic, who lived in the Girard household at 379 Ursuline Avenue in New Orleans. Azemar and Camille married and moved to 2921 St. Ann St., where Alvera was born. Under the rules of the day in the south, (the 'One-Drop Rule'), this made Alvera, their daughter and a descendant of French-Creoles, also black. However, the 1930 census has her father Azemar Frederic classified as W, - or white. The 1940 census listed Alvera Frederic as black. She was working as a server in a teashop at the time and moved north to Ohio four years later, married A. Kalina, a white man. Like some black Americans at the time, Alvera passed as white for socioeconomic benefit. She feared her friends finding out what was for the time, a 'dirty secret'. She did not inform their children of their racial heritage. The Vow In 1997, 2 years after the death of her father, Gail Lukasik confronted her mother with what her genealogy search had uncovered, namely that Alvera was listed as colored in the census and on her birth certificate, which had been confirmed by the State of Louisiana in a letter. Denial was the initial response, then Alvera broke down and shamefully confessed. She made Gail swear not to tell a soul, not even her brother, until she died.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid;=11946672 It was a solemn promise Gail would keep for 17 years. Suddenly all her mother's quirks seemed to fall into place. Wearing make-up to bed, \\"in case you suddenly took ill and went to a hospital you had to look your best!\\". Or her fear of sunlight, and the obsessive neatness of her house, where you could eat off the floor, or the dramatic Sunday church entrances where they took the first pew and a neighbor royally derided them as 'the first family'. Gail confided to her husband and her children, who seemed not the least encumbered by their newly found black heritage. Genealogy Roadshow Gail's son, a Phd candidate, became the family researcher and he compiled a binder that contained the family history. Then came the Genealogy Roadshow, who did follow-up investigations and a DNA test. Gail's story was chosen for a television episode that traced her genealogy from a free man of color, Leon Frederic, who served in the Louisiana Native Guards during the Civil War. Gail's reservation about signing a contract was ameliorated when the producers altered it to allow her to retain the rights to the story.

Biography  Jorge Cabral was a son of Jo√£o Fernandes Cabral (), Senor de Azurara, and his mother was Joanna de Castro (). He was also the nephew of Portuguese explorer and navigator Pedro √Ålvares Cabral which discovered Brazil. Bassein (c. 1539), drawn by Nuno da Cunha, Governor of Portuguese India (1528-38). To get along in Porturuese India, the wife of Jorge Cabral was Lucretia Fialho, she was the first wife of one of previous Viceroys of Portuguese India. Jorge Cabral arrived in India in 1525 and, the same as his predecessor, held the posts of Captain Malacca in 1526‚Äì1528 years and after the post of Captain of Bassein. He became famous for being the first Viceroy of Portugiese India, who brought his wife to Goa from the mother country. Jorge Cabral himself came from a not very noble family, so many hidalgoes in Portuguese India refused to obey his orders or ignored them. However, his wife was a powerful and assertive woman. Jorge Cabral contended for many years in India before becoming a governor of Portuguese India after the death of Garcia de S√° (). Don Garcia de S√° (), who was the Governor of Portigese India in 1948‚Äì1949, died on June 13, 1549. After the death of Garcia de S√°, the colony council proposed to Jorge Cabral the post of a Governor of Portuguese India because his name was on the list of applicants for this position in an emergency situation. Jorge Cabral was going to abandon the new appointment, because he believed that the post of Viceroy of India is very troublesome and not too stabl—É, and arrival of the new titled Governor (or even the Viceroy) should be expected in the near future, which will inevitably lead to the loss of all privileges and incomes for Jorge Cabral. He would prefer to remain in the position of a captain of the Bassein due to it gave a regular income. But his wife, for the temporary triumph, demanded of her husband to accept the proposal of the colony council and become governor of India, even temporary. Jorge Cabral took office as Governor of India on June 13, 1549 and occupied it for less than a year and a half. On his shoulders, The responsibility for preparing a war against the Samorin fell on his shoulders and soon rumors appeared that the Turks were collecting a huge fleet in the Red Sea to attack Portuguese India. Reliable information from this region was not received any more, as the Portuguese lost their positions in Aden in February 1948, and the new governor had to work with not too reliable information. All year the Governor Jorge Cabral spent in alarming preparations, and only in August 1550 the information came that the Turks really collected a large fleet, but for unknown reasons they have till abandoned the idea of going to India. Ottoman fleet in the Indian Ocean in the 16th century. The Ottoman Empire fleet was not the only problem during the reign of Jorge Cabral. At the same time, Jorge Cabral was dragged into the conflict on Malabar Coast, which arose due to the black pepper transportation. The main flow of this cargo passed through the territory, which in the XVI century was called (island) Bardela, but modern historians, even Indian, can not accurately identify this place on the map of modern India. All agree only on the fact that this area was south of Cochin and probably was an island. Since the main stream of pepper on the coast came through Bardela, his Raja wore an unofficial title of \\"king of pepper\\". Raja of neighboring Cochin was very envious of this circumstance and repeatedly tried to seize the territory of Bardela, but without success, although both sides suffered significant losses, as they say, in manpower. In the second half of 1549, Raja of Cochin enlisted the support of the Portuguese and once again attacked Bardela. \\"King of pepper\\" realized that it was bad and turned to the help of the Samorin, who was glad of any occasion to rub his nose to the ally of the Portuguese. Samorin gathered a large army and moved south along the Malabar coast, bypassing the Portuguese strongholds. Raja Tanura and his army immediately joined Samorin. At the same time, the rulers of the principalities, which were lying mainly to the south of Cochin, also began to gather their military troops, so that by the beginning of the fighting the Samorin could already have an army of 140,000 men. Captain of Cochin by the name of Francisco da Silva did not have diplomatic talents and wanted to extinguish the conflict using brute force. He demanded sharply that Samorin had to go back, to Calicut, and local rulers must unconditionally obey the Raja of Cochin, that means to obey the Portuguese. Samorin was offended, and the rulers of Malabar Coast refused to obey Raja of Cochin; Then Francisco da Silva with a detachment of Portuguese marched along the Malabar Coast and attacked the allies in the territory of Bardela. In the battle, the Portuguese defeated the Allied army and even killed Raju of Bardela, the \\"king of pepper\\", but Francisco da Silva also died during this battle. Upon learning of the \\"king of pepper\\" death, the Samorin vowed to avenge the Portuguese, collected a large army and moved closer to Cochin. 18 local rulers joined him there, so that the number of Samorin's army exceeded 100,000 people. A third of this army was located on unknown for historics island, perhaps Bardal, and the rest of the forces remained on the continent. At this time Portuguese forces were under command of the already known to us Manuel de Sousa Sepulveda, who broke enemy allied forces into two parts with the help of his fleet and interrupted the connection between them. Soon the command of the army took over the governor Jorge Cabral, who began preparations for the destruction of enemy forces on the island. But Jose Cabral did not have time to attack the enemy due to the new Viceroy of Portuguese India, Afonso de Noronha (1510‚Äì1575), arrived in Cochin with a fleet in October 1550. All captains and officers involved in this military operation hastened to abandon their positions and rushed to greet the new ruler. The fighting activity ceased actually, but the tense situation in the South of Malabar remained for quite some time, which had a negative impact on the pepper supply to Portugal. Also Jorge Cabral had to return to Cochin, to hand over all cases to the new Viceroy of India. Afonso de Noronha has solemnly entered a post on 6 of November, 1550. And Jorge Cabral went to Portugal at the first opportunity due to the new ruler of Portuguese India did not offer him any position in his administration, and the captaincy in the Bassein was already lost. Oh, these women! Nothing is known about the fate of Jorge Cabral, and even the date of his death and his burial place is unknown. By the way, the Raja of Cochin time was hostile to the Portuguese from that: first, they treacherously threw him into the midst of the war with Samarin; secondly, soon after the departure of Jorge Cabral, the Portuguese plundered a highly revered temple near Cochin. 16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.

Hugh Boyle established a mill along the Skunk River in the mid- to late-1840s, and he built this vernacular stone house (c. 1850) to the south for his family's residence.

Boyle died in 1854 and is buried in the small cemetery to the west of the house. Three of his children were previously buried there. The mill continued to operate and the area became known as Boyleston. A post office was established in the lower level of the house in 1868 and it operated there until 1871. There is also an indication that a store was also located on the lower level of the house.

Aging in dogs causes many changes to occur physiologically that will require a change in nutrient composition of their diet. A major change that occurs is the decrease in energy requirements which is addressed by lowered caloric content of senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages. Senior dog foods include a higher protein content as well as highly digestible protein sources to deal with this. Nutrients included for joint and bone health include glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3 fatty acids as well as two main minerals; calcium and phosphorus. Sources of fiber included in senior dog foods include beet pulp and flax seed as well as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). These act to increase gastrointestinal health. Brain and cognitive health decline as the dog ages which leads to the inclusion of vitamin E and L-carnitine in senior dog diets to combat this decline. Skin and coat health can also decline in older dogs due to various reasons. The inclusion of linoleic acid as well as vitamin A into senior dog diets helps to improve or maintain the skin and coat of senior dogs. Immune system health is important to maintain in older dogs to prevent the development of various diseases. By including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vitamin E, Œ≤-carotene as well as pre- and pro-biotics, the immune system can be boosted and maintained to help improve overall health.  Energy demand  The maintenance energy requirement (MER), or the energy that is required to maintain normal activity, decreases significantly as a result of lean body mass loss in aging dogs. The MER can decrease by up to 25% as dogs age due to this loss. Basal metabolic rate is maintained by lean mass energy expenditure, which accounts for 96% of the function of lean mass. The metabolizable energy, or the amount of available energy which is left after the losses in urine, feces and combustible gas is subtracted, can be found on the food bag or calculated using the modified Atwater equation: ME (kcal/kg) = 10[(3.5 x Crude Protein) + (8.5 x Crude Fiber) + (3.5 x Nitrogen Free Extract)] This equation takes into consideration the amount of energy availability from crude protein, crude fiber, and the nitrogen free extract from pet foods in order to calculate the amount of energy the animal is receiving from the food. It is important to consider the metabolizable energy content of senior or mature pet foods using this equation, as energy requirements will vary with age.  Protein  A dog's requirements for protein increases as a result of a reduced ability to synthesize proteins as it ages. As a result, it is extremely important to not restrict protein consumption to a senior dog as it can be as just as harmful as protein deficiency in young dogs. To ensure good health, it is important to provide dogs with the 22 amino acids which they require. Of these 22 amino acids, 12 can be synthesized. The rest must be provided by good sources of dietary protein in adequate quantities. Good sources of protein include eggs and fish, which have a high biological value. This value describes the percentage of usable amino acids within the protein. It has been recommended that a minimum of 2.55 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should be fed daily to ensure that protein requirements are met. It is important to understand that protein requirements based on weight are variable and that many factors influence the protein requirements of each senior dog.  Bone and joint health  Joint deterioration occurs as dogs age. As their joints become less lubricated there is increased friction between the bone and the cartilage. With this increased friction, the cartilage deteriorates and wears away. The reduction of this cushion in the joints causes bone-on-bone contact to occur, causing the animal great discomfort. This can cause various related issues such as altered gaits and changes in activity levels resulting in a greater possibility of obesity and other conditions related to mobility and activity levels. Joint and bone health deteriorate as dogs age. There has been research done in human medicine that indicates the positive effect that a combination of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine can have on moderate-to- severe knee pain. This effect is likely very similar to the effect these two ingredients have on the joints of aging dogs. It is important to note the effects of these supplements is not instant and the aforementioned studies showed approximately a 3-month period between the beginning of supplementation and the reduction of symptoms. = Glucosamine = Glucosamine is a building block for the synthesis of cartilage tissue. It is found naturally in the body, mainly in the fluid which surrounds the joints. This can help aging joints by maintaining the cartilage, thus reducing the pain caused by bone-on- bone contact within the joint (this is the primary source of joint pain in aging animals). This will increase the mobility of the dog which is vital for the maintenance of a healthy weight and general body function. There have also been some studies which have showed anti-inflammatory properties of glucosamine which would also help joint function in aging dogs. Glucosamine is usually provided in supplements in the form of glucosamine sulfate, or by the inclusion of chicken meal in the diet, as it contains glucosamine as well as chondroitin. = Chondroitin = Chondroitin is a major component in the composition of cartilage. It helps the cartilage retain moisture, lubricating the joint and allowing ease of movement of the bone across the cartilage. This reduces the damage to the cartilage over time. Chondroitin is produced naturally in the boy but older dogs can often benefit from a supplemental dose of chondroitin. Chondroitin is commonly supplied as a supplement in the form of chondroitin sulfate. = Omega-3 fatty acids = Omega-3 fatty acids include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These two fatty acids have been shown to improve gait score and lameness in dogs with osteoarthritis. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to have noticeable anti-inflammatory properties. It is for this reason, among other benefits, that they are routinely included at supplemental levels in senior dog diets. A good source of omega-3 fatty acids in dog foods include fish oils and other fish sources (especially salmon and herring) as well as flaxseed. = Calcium and phosphorus = One of the most basic requirements of the aging dog's body is the requirement for maintenance of their bones. In order for the bones to be able to heal from any injury or erosion, as well as maintain their strength to avoid these problem, they need a ready supply of calcium and phosphorus. Both of these are essential nutrients according to AAFCO guidelines, and should be included in a senior dog diet. Calcium and Phosphorus are also very valuable in the maintenance tooth health of dogs. In order for calcium to be properly absorbed into the body dogs will require another nutrient, vitamin D. adequate vitamin D is needed to form enough calcitriol, known as the active form of vitamin D. If enough is not present the body will begin to draw from stores of vitamin D within the body like the bones and teeth for its needs. This can lead to bone weakening and the inability to repair bone damage.  Gastrointestinal health  = Sources of Fiber = Beet pulp is a good source of insoluble fiber.  Beet pulp  Beet pulp is a common ingredient in dog diets as it is a very versatile and useful fiber source. Beet pulp provides fiber to the diet which acts as a stool hardener and aids in lower tract ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù. The composition of beet pulp is such that it is an insoluble and moderately fermentable fiber. This means it can add bulk to the diet as well as moisture to the stool while also supplying the animal's cells lining the intestine with energy due to the moderate fermentation that occurs.  Flax seed  Flax seed is the whole seed of the flax plant which contains both soluble and insoluble fiber. The insoluble fraction includes cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These components have a very good water binding capacity which aids in adding bulk into the diet of the dog. This has varying benefits for dogs depending on their lifestyle. In some dogs, it aids in digestion by preventing constipation, in others it acts to improve satiety and encourage weight loss. Flaxseed is also a good source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which have multiple health benefits for the animal such as improving coat quality. Flax seed is also one of the richest sources of alpha linoleic acid (ALA). ALA can be converted by the dog to DHA and EPA to carry out various functions in the body. = Fructooligosaccharides and mannanoligosaccharides = Fructooligosaccharides, commonly known as FOS, consist of many different types of indigestible oligosaccharides. FOS is shown to be beneficial in providing a source of energy for the good gut bacteria in dogs. Mannanoligosaccharides are also known as MOS which also have an effect on the overall gut health in dogs. These compounds both contain oligosaccharides however; they work in different manners. Constipation prevention and treatment can be carried out by the supplementation of FOS by its subsequent effect on gut bacteria. MOS works in a different manner by effecting the attachment of bad bacteria in the gut of the dog. These bad bacteria attach to the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract and can cause the beginnings of pathogenic diseases. MOS works to counteract these by preventing the binding of these deleterious bacteria. A study carried out in dogs determined that these two compounds when supplemented together can help with overall immune function. This is due to the decrease in overall bad bacteria and an increase in good bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These two compounds also were not found to have any detrimental effects on food consumption, stool quality or stool output.  Brain and cognitive health  A dogs brain undergoes many pathological changes during the aging process. Some of these changes can include damage to the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), a decrease in the amount of myelin overlay on nerve cells as well as a buildup of protein in the brain which can potentially have toxic effects. Due to these physiological changes senior and aging dog can have possible impairment of proper cognition. This impairment can include complex learning tasks as well as memory issues. = Vitamin E = The addition of Vitamin E as an antioxidant in senior dog food can have a positive effect on brain and cognitive health. Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin which works to prevent oxidative damage from occurring. Reactive oxygen species can develop in the brain and can have a harmful effect by causing oxidative stress on the tissues if they are not subdued by antioxidants. Mitochondrial aerobic metabolism is thought to be the largest source of reactive oxidative species. As the mitochondria age their function declines which causes an increase in the production of oxidative species. Studies carried out in aging dogs looking at the effects of antioxidant supplemented diets have shown that older dogs supplemented with antioxidants including Vitamin E were able to correctly perform tasks more often than senior dogs whose diets were not supplemented. It has also been shown that in senior dogs consuming these antioxidant enriched diets there was an increase in positive behavioural actions during the feeding period compared to senior dogs consuming diets that were not supplemented. = L-carnitine = L-carnitine is an amino acid and precursor of acetyl-L-carnitine which is a mitochondrial cofactor. It acts to help with overall mitochondrial function as well as lipid metabolism which is an important function of mitochondria. This is important as an increase in mitochondrial function will help to reduce the rates of oxidative reactions in the brain which overall decrease damage to DNA and stimulates better cognitive function.  Skin and coat health  Several physiological changes in the senior pet can lead to a decline in skin and coat health. Some of these changes include a loss of elasticity in the skin which leads to wrinkling, hair follicle atrophy which can cause hair loss, a decrease in oil secretion which can lead to dry and flaky skin as well as a loss of melanocytes which causes the loss of pigmentation of the hair follicles. Skin and coat health is one of most noticeable aging changes due to the fact that it results in a change in appearance of the senior dog. Skin and coat health are important to upkeep as dogs age and there are many components in senior dog foods that can benefit this important area of health. Soybean oil is a good source of linoleic acid. = Linoleic acid = Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is classified as an omega 6-fatty acid. Linoleic acid plays an important role in the maintenance of the water barrier of skin. This helps prevent the dryness and scaly skin that occurs during the aging process. Omega 6-fatty acids can also have a slight anti-imflammatory role. Good sources of linoleic acid to look for in senior dog foods include corn oil, soybean oil and poultry fat. = Vitamin A = Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin that aids in the keratinization process of hair. This process is important in maintaining a healthy coat in the aging dog and preventing the deterioration of epithelial tissues. Dogs do not directly need a source of Vitamin A as they can convert beta-carotene (a precursor to Vitamin A) into Vitamin A. However, Vitamin A supplementation in senior dog diets can assist senior dogs in maintaining their coats as their sebaceous activity and skin elasticity decrease. Vitamin A supplements can be included in senior dogs diets however there are also other good sources of Vitamin A. These include milk, egg yolk, and liver. The inactive form of Vitamin A, beta-carotene can be found in high amounts in carrots. = Zinc = Zinc is among one of many trace minerals recommended for dogs of all ages. Dogs experience loss of elasticity and dryness of the skin as they age. The addition of zinc in the diet aids in the development of collagen and wound healing, and also will prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky. Senior dogs can obtain zinc in their diet through the addition of various ingredients, including; red meats, whole grains, poultry by-product meals, and fish meals. = Copper = Loss of hair pigmentation is a common concern for senior dogs. Copper has been shown to improve coat conditions by reducing dry skin and improving the overall pigmentation of the coat. Therefore, copper may able to delay the natural aging process of the whitening of a dog's coat. = Riboflavin = Senior dogs require a larger amount of riboflavin for maintenance compared to adult dogs. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, plays an important role as a cofactor for the metabolism of carbohydrates. Riboflavin is required in the diet to prevent cracking and dry skin, as well as a darkening of the pigmentation of skin. Riboflavin is also important for the vision of the senior dog as deficiencies can cause alterations in blood supply to the cornea which may lead to impaired vision and potential blindness. A source of riboflavin in senior dog diets is important to help prevent changes that aging can cause on skin.  Immune system health  Immune functions start to decline due to compromised ability to efficiently produce various proteins and cells that are important for the body's defense system as dogs age. Free radicals can cause oxidative stress, killing the cells or impairing the functional capability of the cells, which leads to weakening of the immune system. Therefore, providing dietary antioxidants can be an effective method to prevent the oxidative stress and support the immune system. = Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids = Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are very important for a strong healthy immune system and for preventing chronic disease in dogs. It is crucial in pet diets that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is properly balanced in order to achieve optimal health. It is recommended to have a ratio of 5:1 to 10:1, with there being more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3's. AAFCO has a maximum ratio listed of 30:1. For ideal health and decreased risk of low-grade chronic inflammation, it is more beneficial to have a lower ratio versus a higher one. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and therefore need to be supplemented in a closer ratio to omega-6's which are more inflammatory. Out of all of the omega-3 fatty acids that could be used, the most potent are found in fish oil in the forms of EPA and DHA, these have the highest immunomodulatory activities. Omega-3 fatty acids tend to increase antioxidant requirements because they oxidize so rapidly, therefore when they are in a closer ratio to omega-6 fatty acids, as recommended, antioxidants must also be supplemented in the diet. = Vitamin E = Vitamin E is an antioxidant that can be supplemented in the diet in order to strengthen the effect of fatty acid supplementations. This vitamin works to decrease the production of pro- inflammatory markers that are found in synovial fluid of the joints. With the help of this antioxidant, chronic inflammation can be avoided which aids senior dogs in maintaining a healthier immune system as well as helping to ease the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Also, formation of , which is a reactive oxygen species that suppress lymphocyte proliferation, can be decreased by vitamin E. =Œ≤-Carotene= Beta-carotene can be found in certain vegetables and it is a highly potent antioxidants. The number of T-cells is naturally decreased with age, leading to compromised immune function. However, in old dogs supplemented with dietary beta-carotene had no statistical difference in the amount of CD4+ T cells when compared to younger dogs. It can also enhance cell-mediated immune responses and help prevent cancer. Dogs supplemented with high dose of dietary beta-carotene may show red discolouration of feces and staining of hair. However, toxicity level of beta-carotene in dogs is not clearly understood as dogs can also cleave beta-carotene into vitamin A in their intestines. =Prebiotic and probiotic= Since the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to foreign materials from ingested food, a healthy microbiota in gut is very important component of the immune system. Prebiotic and probiotic supplements can help maintain healthy gut flora. Examples of common prebiotic ingredients in dog foods are Fructooligosaccharides(FOS), Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), and beta-glucan. Examples of common probiotic ingredients in dog foods are Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecium.

Biography  McIlwraith was born in Newton upon Ayr, Scotland to Thomas McIlwraith, a weaver, and Jean Adair Forsyth. He was the seventh of ten children. In 1846 he moved to Edinburgh where he studied for three years and he returned to his hometown and briefly apprenticed as a cabinet maker before taking up work in the management of the Newton Gas Works. In October 1853 he married Mary, daughter of Baillie Hugh Park and moved to Hamilton, Canada the next month.

Photon-counting CT has the potential both to offer significant improvements to existing CT imaging techniques and to make possible completely novel applications. A photon-counting CT system employs a photon-counting detector (PCD) which registers the interactions of individual photons. By keeping track of the deposited energy in each interaction, the detector pixels of a PCD each record an approximate energy spectrum, making it a spectral or energy-resolved CT technique. In contrast, typical CT scanners use energy-integrating detectors (EIDs), where the total energy (generally from a large number of photons as well as electronic noise) deposited in a pixel during a fixed period of time is registered. Typical CT detectors thus register only photon intensity, comparable to black-and-white photography, whereas photon-counting detectors register also spectral information, similar to colour photography.  Advantages  There are several potential advantages of using a PCD over using an EID in CT imaging. These include improved signal (and contrast) to noise ratio, reduced X-ray dose to the patient, improved spatial resolution and, through use of several energy bins, the ability to distinguish multiple contrast agents. Due to the large volumes and rates of data required (up to several hundred million photon interactions per mm2 and second) the use of PCDs in CT scanners has become feasible only with recent improvements in detector technology. As of February 2016 photon-counting CT is in use at three clinical sites. Some early research has found the dose reduction potential of photon-counting CT for breast imaging to be very promising. Description When a photon interacts in a PCD, the height of the resulting electrical pulse is roughly proportional to the photon energy. By comparing each pulse produced in a pixel with a suitable low-energy threshold, contributions from low-energy events (resulting from both photon interactions and electronic noise) can be filtered out. This effectively eliminates contributions from electronic noise at the expense of discarding photons with energy comparable to the noise level (which are of little use since they are indistinguishable from noise counts). In an EID, on the other hand, the contributions from individual photons are not known. Therefore, an energy threshold cannot be applied, making this technique susceptible to noise and other factors which can affect the linearity of the voltage to X-ray intensity relationship. The removal of electronic noise gives PCDs two advantages over EIDs. First, higher signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios are expected from using PCDs compared to EIDs. This can either be used to increase the image quality at the same X-ray exposure level, or to lower the patient X-ray dose whilst maintaining the same image quality. Second, it is difficult to manufacture energy-integrating detectors with smaller pixel size than approximately 1√ó1 mm2 without compromising dose efficiency. The reason for this is that reflective layers must be placed in the scintillator between the pixels to prevent cross-talk between pixels, and these cannot be made too thin. In addition, the measured signal is proportional to the pixel area whereas the electronic noise is fairly independent of pixel size, so that noise will dominate the measured signal if the pixels are made too small. These problems do not occur in a photon-counting detector with a low-energy threshold, which can therefore achieve higher detector resolution. By introducing more energy thresholds above the low-energy threshold, a PCD can be divided into several discrete energy bins. Each registered photon is thus assigned to a specific bin depending on its energy, such that each pixel measures a histogram of the incident X-ray spectrum. This spectral information provides several advantages over the integrated deposited energy of an EID. First, it makes it possible to quantitatively determine the material composition of each pixel in the reconstructed CT image, as opposed to the estimated average linear attenuation coefficient obtained in a conventional CT scan. It turns out such a material base decomposition, using at least two energy bins, can adequately account for all elements found in the body and increases the contrast between tissue types. Further, the spectral information can be used to remove beam hardening artefacts. These arise because of the higher linear attenuation of most materials at lower energy which shifts the mean energy of the X-ray spectrum towards higher energies as the beam passes through the object. By comparing the ratios of counts in different energy bins with those of the attenuated beam, the amount of beam hardening can be accounted for (either explicitly or implicitly in the reconstruction) using a PCD. Finally, using more than two energy bins allows to discriminate between on the one hand dense bone and calcifications and on the other hand heavier elements (commonly iodine or gadolinium) used as contrast agents. This has the potential reduce the amount of X-ray dose from a contrast scan by removing the need for a reference scan before contrast injection. Although spectral CT is already clinically available in the form of dual-energy scanners, photon- counting CT offers a number of advantages. A PCD can implement more than two energy thresholds with a higher degree of separation than what is possible to achieve in dual-energy CT. This improvement in energy resolution translates to higher contrast-to-noise ratio in the image, in particular in contrast- enhanced and material-selective images. Also, it can be shown that at least three energies are necessary to simultaneously decompose both tissue and contrast medium. More energy bins also allow for simultaneously differentiating between different contrast agents.  Challenges  Despite encouraging research, there are several challenges which have until recently prevented incorporating PCDs in CT systems. Many challenges are related to demands on detector material and electronics resulting from large data volumes and count rates. As an example, each mm2 of a CT detector may receive several hundred million photon interactions per second during a scan. To avoid saturation in areas where little material is present between the X-ray source and the detector, the pulse resolving time must be small compared to the average time between photon interactions in a pixel. Even before saturation, the detector functionality starts to deteriorate because of pulse pileup, where two (or more) photon interactions take place in the same pixel too close in time to be resolved as discrete events. Such quasi-coincident interactions lead to a loss of photon counts and distorts the pulse shape, skewing the recorded energy spectrum. Due to these effects, the demands on the physical response time of the detector material as well as on the electronics responsible for pulse-shaping, binning and recording pixel data become very high. Using smaller image pixels decreases the per-pixel count rate and thus alleviates the demands on pulse resolving time at the expense of requiring more electronics. Partial energy deposition and single photons causing signals in multiple pixels poses another challenge in photon-counting CT. Charge sharing, where an interaction takes place close to a pixel boundary, causing the released energy to be shared between neighbouring pixels and thus be interpreted as several lower-energy photons, is one cause of such events. Others include the emission of K-escape X-rays and Compton scattering, where the escaping or scattered photon results in a partial energy deposition in the primary pixel and may go on to cause further interactions in different pixels. The effects mentioned take place also in EIDs but cause additional problems in PCDs since they result in a distorted energy spectrum. In contrast to saturation and pileup effects, problems caused by partial energy deposition and multiply interacting photons is aggravated by smaller pixel size. Anti- coincidence logic, where simultaneous events in nearby pixels are added, can be used to somewhat counteract counting the same photon in different pixels.  Image reconstruction  Using multiple energy bins opens up new possibilities when it comes to reconstructing a CT image from the acquired projections. One possibility is to treat each of the N energy bins separately and use a conventional CT reconstruction method to reconstruct N different images. The material at any given position within the imaged volume can then be calculated by comparing and/or combining the intensities of the N images at this point. This method is referred to as image-based material decomposition and although intuitive it relies on good agreement between the energy thresholds of different detector pixels (or requires pre-processing to account for different pixel responses) and does not inherently remove artefacts caused by beam hardening. Another option is to perform the material base decomposition directly on the projection data, before the reconstruction. Using projection-based material decomposition, the material composition measured by a detector pixel for a given projection is expressed as a linear combination of M basis materials (e.g. soft tissue, bone and contrast agent). This is determined from the recorded energy histogram, for example through maximum likelihood estimation. The reconstruction is then performed separately for each material basis, yielding M reconstructed basis images. A third option would be to employ a single-step reconstruction, where the material basis decomposition is performed simultaneously with the image reconstruction. This approach, however, is not compatible with the reconstruction algorithms used in current clinical CT systems. Instead, novel iterative algorithms specific to photon-counting CT are required.  Detector technologies  Experimental PCDs for use in CT systems use semiconductor detectors based on either cadmium (zinc) telluride or silicon, neither of which need cryogenic cooling to operate. Cadmium telluride and cadmium zinc telluride detectors have the advantage of high attenuation and relatively high photoelectric-to-Compton ratio for X-ray energies used in CT imaging. This means the detectors can be made thinner and lose less spectral information due to Compton scattering. (Although they still lose spectral information due to K-escape electrons.) However, detectors made of Cadmium telluride (zinc) have longer collection times due to low charge carrier mobility, and thus suffer more from pileup effects. Further, it is currently difficult to produce such crystals without defects and impurities, which cause detector polarisation and incomplete charge collection. Silicon detectors, on the other hand, are more easily manufactured and less prone to pileup due to high charge carrier mobility. They do not suffer from K-escape X-rays but have a lower photoelectric-to- Compton ratio at X-ray energies used in CT imaging, which degrades the collected energy spectrum. Further, silicon attenuates X-rays less strongly and therefore silicon detectors have to be several centimetres thick to be useful in a CT system.

Her works were often listed in guidebooks for the country and in 1976, she was awarded the Order of the Quetzal for her artistic merit. Some of her paintings are in the permanent collection of the Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing. Early life Carmen Dorotea Gehrke de Mar√≠a y Campos was born and baptized 6 March 1900, in Sagrario Parish, of Guatemala City, Guatemala to Mar√≠a Magdalena Soledad Isabel de Mar√≠a y Campos Hoffmann and Arthur Henry Theodore Gehrke (aka Arturo Enrique Teodoro Gehrke). Her father was a British agent for the import-export company Rosing Brothers and Company, while her mother was from Veracruz, Mexico. When the couple immigrated to Guatemala, they settled with two children, Enelda Francisca and Arthur Richard in the Jocotenango neighborhood of Guatemala City. While in Guatemala, the family grew, adding Carmen and another son, Conrad in 1903. In 1904, Arthur was transferred with Rosing Brothers to London. In 1909, Gehrke entered the Tunbridge Wells Girls' Grammar School, a boarding school, in Royal Tunbridge Wells, where she began studying painting and developed an interest in nature, spending hours in Kew Gardens. In 1917, she began studying at the Royal Polytechnic Institution on Regent Street in London. Near the end of the war, she met Leif Lind Pettersen, who was visiting from Guatemala with his uncle Walter Lind. Walter Lind (born Lind Pettersen) was an Englishman, born to Norwegian parents, who also worked in Guatemala for Rosing Brothers and owned a coffee plantation. Earthquakes in Guatemala between 1917 and 1918 had devastated the country and in 1923, Arthur was asked to return to the country. He traveled with Mar√≠a and his two daughters, and the family took up residence on one of Walter Lind's farms, known as Helvetia, as Guatemala City was uninhabitable. Gehrke and Leif Lind Pettersen renewed their friendship, which quickly turned into a romance and the couple were married in 1925 in Retalhuleu. At the time of their marriage, Leif was suffering from malaria and immediately after the ceremony, Carmen took him to Guatemala City to recover. Career After Leif‚Äôs recovery, the couple bought a coffee farm known as \\"La Colonia\\" near El Tumbador. They managed it for several years, until 1929 when the plummet in coffee prices due to the Great Depression forced them to sell and buy a cinchona farm known as El Zapote, in the Escuintla Department on the slopes of the Volc√°n de Fuego. This turned out to be a precipitous purchase, as during World War II, the Japanese captured Indonesia, cutting off the supply to the seeds of the cinchona, which were needed to make quinine. The demand and Leif's agreement with the United States government and Merck and Company, soon made their farm one of the largest in the area producing chinchona. In the 1930s, Lind Pettersen began gardening on the farm and painting the landscapes she saw, focusing on the diversity of the trees and flora of the Guatemalan coastal piedmont, which few had painted or studied. Her works documented the era of transformation of jungles to rural coffee plantations, showing agricultural migration as well as environmental change. Studying design at Kew Gardens, in 1958 with the help of Venancio Tubac Salazar, she created a botanical garden which became the largest in the region. It featured three lagoons, which became a haven for migrating coastal herons, as well as large trees which were filled with parrots and other tropical birds. As an observer of her world, she began to study the costumes of the farm workers and domestics that helped on the farm. Noticing that over time the dress styles were changing, Pettersen began to draw and catalogue them. A friend sent her a collection of Mayan costumes, which Pettersen duplicated in watercolor, having her employees and friends pose as models. The work took six years to complete, and she is now known mostly for these watercolors of the traditional costumes of Guatemala. In 1976, Lind Pettersen published Maya of Guatemala: Vida y Traje/Life and Dress, a bilingual book, which is the most complete reference work on the textiles of the Guatemalan high plateau. That same year, she received the Order of the Quetzal for her artistic merit of preserving the cultural heritage. In 1984, Pettersen began losing her sight and rather than give up art, began teaching. She held an exhibit of her works in 1986 at the National School of Visual Arts and was listed in guidebooks for Guatemala as a reference for the study of textiles and for her watercolors with works on display in the 1990s at the Ixchel Museum and the Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno \\"Carlos M√©rida\\". Death and legacy Lind Pettersen died in 1991. She has over sixty paintings in the permanent collections of the Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing in Guatemala City. After her death, the garden she developed on their farm became a nature reserve and is opened once a month to the public. In 2017, the Ixchel Museum hosted an exhibit of around thirty of her works throughout the month of February.

As a two-year-old he was one of the best colts of his generation in Europe when he was unbeaten in four races including the Marble Hill Stakes, Coventry Stakes and Phoenix Stakes. In the following year he took his winning run to six with victories in the Lacken Stakes and the Commonwealth Cup but his only success in four subsequent starts came in the Flying Five. He was retired from racing at the end of 2017 having won seven of his ten starts. Aidan O'Brien described him as the fastest horse that he had ever trained. Background Caravaggio is a grey horse standing 15.3¬Ω hands high bred in Kentucky by Windmill Manor Farms & Petaluma Bloodstock. As a foal in November 2014 he was scheduled to be auctioned at Keeneland but was withdrawn from the sale. He was then acquired by John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation and was then sent to Europe where he entered training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. During his racing career he was officially owned in partnership by Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith but usually carried the dark blue colours of Susan Magnier. He was ridden in all but two of his races by Ryan Moore. He was sired by Scat Daddy, who won the Champagne Stakes in 2006 and the Florida Derby in 2007 before his racing career was ended by injury. Scat Daddy's other offspring include No Nay Never, Daddy Long Legs and Lady Aurelia. Caravaggio's dam Mekko Hokte, from whom he inherited his grey colour, showed some racing ability, winning three of her eight races including the Delta Miss Stakes at Louisiana Downs in 2002. She was descendant of the French broodmare Never Again (foaled 1934) who was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Olwyn, Al Bahathri and Haafhd. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Caravaggio made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over five furlongs on the all-weather Polytrack surface at Dundalk Racecourse on 18 April. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan and starting at odds of 1/3 he took the lead approaching the final furlong and on \\"comfortably\\" by one and three quarter lengths from his stablemate Lundy. On 21 May the colt was switched to the turf and stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Marble Hill Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh Racecourse. Starting the 4/7 favourite in a nine-runner field he tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong and drawing away to win by two and quarter lengths from Mister Trader with the filly Roly Poly taking fourth place. Ryan Moore described the winner as \\"a big baby\\" whilst Aidan O'Brien expressed his satisfaction saying \\"I'm very happy with that. That's his first run on grass and he will have learned a lot today\\". In June the colt was sent to England to contest the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot and started the 13/8 favourite in an eighteen-runner field, with the best fancied of his opponents being Psychedelic Funk (unbeaten in two races), Mehmas (runner-up in the National Stakes), Mokarris, Yalta and Thunder Snow. Racing down the centre of the straight course, Caravaggio was restrained by Moore before making a forward move in the last quarter mile. He took the lead entering the final furlong and drew away to win in \\"impressive\\" style by two and a quarter lengths from Mehmas. O'Brien commented \\"He has always been very exciting. He has loads of scope, loads of length and has a very good mind. He is a very relaxed and powerful horse. We always thought this horse was very smart.\\" When Caravaggio was moved up to Group 1 level for the Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh on 7 August he started the 1/8 favourite with the only one of his four opponents to start at less than 25/1 being the Railway Stakes winner Medicine Jack. With Heffernan in the saddle he went to the front a furlong and a half from the finish and quickly went clear to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths from his stablemate Courage Under Fire. O'Brien said \\"Everything went 100%. In his last piece of work he hit a top speed of 45 miles per hour ‚Äì no horse in Ballydoyle has ever been able to do that... He's the fastest we have ever had\\". The colt was being prepared for a run in the Middle Park Stakes when he sustained a muscle injury on 18 August and did not run again that year. =2017: three-year-old season= Although Caravaggio had been considered a contender for the 2000 Guineas but in 2017 he was campaigned in sprint races. He began his season in the Group 3 Lacken Stakes over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 21 May and started the 8/15 favourite against six opponents. After racing towards the rear of the field in the early stages he took the lead in the final furlong an drew away to win easily by four and three quarter lengths from Psychedelic Funk. O'Brien reiterated his high opinion of the winner saying \\"He's an unbelievably quick horse... I've never seen a quicker horse and that's why we went this way with him\\". On 23 June the colt ran for the second time at Royal Ascot and started 5/6 favourite for the Group 1 Commonwealth Cup. His main rivals appeared to be the Godolphin pair Harry Angel and Blue Point and the American challenger Bound For Nowhere. Caravaggio raced in mid-division as Harry Angel set the pace but was then switched to the right to make his challenge a quarter of a mile from the finish. He went to the front inside the final furlong and won by three- quarters of a length and half a length from Harry Angel and Blue Point, with the trio finishing well clear of the other nine runners. Moore commented \\"I think that was a fairly exceptional race. He's beaten two very good horses there. They made him work and it's the first time he's ever been asked a question so he was a bit unsure when he got the message but he responded well\\". Thre weeks after his win at Ascot, Caravaggio attempted to take his unbeaten run to seven when he was matched against older horses for the first time in the July Cup at Newmarket Racecourse. He was restrained by Moore in the early stages before making progress in the last quarter mile but was unable to reach the leaders and finished fourth behind Harry Angel, Limato and Brando. The colt was widely expected to return to winning form in the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August but never looked likely to win and came home sixth of the thirteen runners behind Brando. On September 10 Caravaggio was dropped back to Group 2 class for the Flying Five at the Curragh in which he faced ten opponents headed by Caspian Prince (Sapphire Stakes) and Cotai Glory (World Trophy). He produced his customary late run to take the lead in the closing stages and won comfortably by a length from the 50/1 outsider Alphabet. Caravaggio ended his track career in the British Champions Sprint Stakes at Ascot on 21 October. For the first and only time in his ten races, he did not start favourite, being made the 9/2 second choice in the betting behind Harry Angel. After starting poorly he stayed on very strongly in the closing stages to take third behind Librisa Breeze and Tasleet. Assessment and awards In the Cartier Racing Awards for 2016, Caravaggio was one of four nominees for the Champion Two-year-old Colt title, but lost out to his stablemate Churchill. In the official classification of European juveniles Caravaggio was given a rating of 116 making him the fifth-best colt behind Churchill, National Defense, Thunder Snow and Lancaster Bomber. Stud record Caravaggio was retired from racing at the end of the 2017 season to become a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud. He initially stood at fee of ‚Ç¨35,000.

Widespread across the continent, the variable fat-tailed is most commonly found in sandy desert habitats dominated by Spinifex grasses. They have also been bred in captivity by zoos and as pets.  Description  The variable fat-tailed gecko is small-medium-sized gecko with a pale fawn to reddish-brown body. It has a dark brown reticulated pattern over the dorsal aspect of its body and pale to white speckles covering the body. Limbs, lips and underside of the geckos are paler than the rest of the body and a dark streak presents between the snout and eye, sometimes continuing beyond the eye. Variable fat-tailed geckos have a stout body, short limbs and a broad, flat tail of similar size to the head. They are approximately 60mm long, snout-to-vent (SVL = measurement taken from the tip of an animal's nose to the opening of the cloaca) with a tail around 40% of the SVL (approximately 24mm). The dorsal scales are large and homogenous, continuing into plate-like scales over the tail. Nostrils are separated from the rostral scale by an anterior nasal scale and the mental scale is hemispherical in shape. They have a large primary supralabial scale followed by small, granular supralabials no larger than the adjacent loreals. Like most gecko species, the variable fat-tailed gecko lacks a moveable eyelid and instead relies on a long, flexible tongue to keep their eyes moist and clean. Both male and female geckos possess paracloacal (parallel to the cloaca) spurs, small clusters of around 3-8 spines. It is important to note that although present in both sexes, paracloacal spurs in females are rarely more than 50% larger than adjacent body scales. In addition to paracloacal spurs, a key identifying feature of the variable fat-tailed gecko is a lack of pre-anal pores.  Taxonomy  Diplodactylus conspicillatus was first identified in 1897 by Arthur Henry Lucas and Charles Frost. The Diplodactylus genus consists of 27 gecko species commonly referred to as stone or fat-tailed geckos. Species within the genus are morphologically similar but genetically distinct. For example, Diplodactylus kenneallyi, Diplodactylus savage, Diplodactylus pulcher and Diplodactylus conspicillatus all share similar morphological traits. As a result, many Diplodactylus species have been reclassified and redescribed over the years to more accurately represent the diversity within the genus.  Distribution and Habitat  Sandy desert and Spinifex grass habitat Diplodactylus conspicillatus is widely distributed across mainland Australia within arid and semi-arid habitats. They range from inland New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia to northern regions of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. They are also found in coastal regions of north- western Western Australia and north-eastern Northern Territory. These terrestrial geckos inhabit a variety of ecosystems including sandy deserts, open grasslands, shrublands, rocky outcrops and stony ranges, although are most commonly found in sandy deserts dominated by Spinifex grasses. They are often found sheltering in fallen trees, cracks in the soil, among rocks and in abandoned lizard/spider burrows.  Ecology  Variable fat-tailed geckos are nocturnal (active during the night) and like most lizards are ectothermic, absorbing warmth and energy from the sun during the day, so they can then hunt and digest their food at night. As a nocturnal species, the variable fat- tailed gecko seeks out warm places to shelter in during the day such as rocks, fallen trees and abandoned burrows or spiders and other lizards. Shelter- seeking behaviour is observed in many desert dwelling species to provide protection of diurnal (active during the day) predators and prevent body temperatures from exceeding the preferred body temperature (PBT). Endemic to remote areas of Australia, there is little known about the behaviours and ecology of the variable fat-tailed gecko. This dilemma is also contributed to by the difficulties often faced identifying this species correctly due to similarities with other Diplodactylids. Further research into breeding, hunting and adaptive behaviours as well as the ecophysiology of this species is needed.  Diet  Variable fat-tailed geckos are specialist feeders, feeding almost exclusively on termites. In addition to termites, these insectivores will also eat crickets, spiders, ants and other small insects. Water sources in many arid zones of Australia are scarce and so, variable fat- tailed geckos most likely obtain water from morning dew and other water residues.  Reproduction  Diplodactylus conspicillatus are oviparous meaning they lay eggs as opposed to giving birth to live young. They breed from September to February and November to March in more northern areas. Little is known about their mating behaviour; however, it is thought cloacal spurs are most likely used to grasp the female during copulation. Gravid females exhibit a marked increase in girth before laying their eggs in shallow scapes of moist sand or on the sand surface beneath fallen trees and other vegetation. Typical clutch size is 1-2 eggs, with females laying multiple clutches per season. Eggs are 15.5 x 9.25 mm (length x width) in size and reach full incubation around 59‚Äì65 days. The average hatchling size is 24‚Äì27 mm (SVL). In captivity, the variable fat-tailed gecko has been observed to reach sexual maturity at 70-80% of adult SVL around 12‚Äì18 months of age.  Predators and Threats  Natural predators of the variable fat-tailed gecko include birds of prey, snakes and other lizards. Many of these predators are avoided during the day by seeking shelter. The variable fat-tailed gecko is currently listed on the IUCN Red List as of least concern. However, although not currently threatened like many Australian species they are still susceptible to increasing environmental threats such as habitat degradation, habitat loss, climate change and predation by feral species such as cats, dogs and foxes.

She served as president of the Legislative Assembly of Macau, the first woman to hold the position. Ritchie was born in Macau to a family with both Chinese and Portuguese ancestry; both of her grandmothers were full-blooded Chinese. Her parents, both Macanese, were civil servants. She gained a master's degree in Germanic philology from the University of Lisbon in 1971, following it with a diploma in pedagogic sciences from the same institution. She taught in Lisbon from 1971 until 1974 before returning to Macau, where she continued teaching from 1975 until 1986. In that year she was appointed to a seat on the Legislative Assembly, of which she served as vice-president. In 1992 Carlos Augusto Corr√™a Paes D'Assump√ß√£o, then serving as president of the Assembly, died suddenly, and Ritchie was elected to succeed him. She served in the post until the handover of Macau to China in 1999, when she was required to relinquish the position because she opted to keep her Portuguese nationality. She was succeeded by Susana Chou as president, but remained a member of the Assembly until 2001, serving six terms in total. During her career in the Assembly, Ritchie was often accused of being too pro-Chinese in her outlook. Since the end of her political career she has remained involved in local affairs, acting as a member of the Executive Council of Macau and later serving on the University Council of the University of Macau. She is a supporter of the Macau Basic Law, passed while she was a member of the Assembly. Ritchie is married to prominent Macanese doctor Alfredo Maria Sales Ritchie and have two children.

Description The gecko typically has a length from snout to vent of around . It is oviparous and lays a clutch of two eggs. It belongs to the Diplodactylus conspicillatus group and is one of the larger members. D. custos has a canthal stripe which is well-defined and an enlarged first supralabial. It has large plate-like mid-dorsal scales on the trunk and smaller dorsolateral scales. The original tail has a short extension at tip that is acute and attenuated. A regenerated tail tends to have a rounder distal end and more uniform scales. The dorsal surface has scales that are arranged in uniform sized transverse rows. The crown and snout have darker pigmentation. The diffuse body pattern can also have wavy, dark transverse bands. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the herpetologists Couper, Oliver & Pepper in 2014. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word custos meaning guard which refers to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's conservation efforts in the Kimberley region where the species in endemic. Distribution The gecko is reasonable widespread throughout the Kimberley region in the north west of Australia. Its range extends from Kununurra in the north down to Derby in the south west and Purnululu National Park in the south. Specimens have also been found on Yampi Peninsula and on Koolan Island.

(2010). Oenopota subvitrea. In: MolluscaBase (2017). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=533203 on 2017-11-22 Description The length of the shell attains 13.5 mm. (Original description) The white shell is translucent, thin but firm. It has a fusiform shape. The shell is moderately stout, with a high, regularly tapered, acute spire, consisting of about six rounded whorls. These are crossed by rather thin, prominent ribs, strongly bent in a sigmoid curve, and having on the lower whorls rather faint spiral sculpture. The four to five whorls below the protoconch are strongly convex and a little swollen at the rounded shoulder, which is rarely somewhat angulated, and wnthout a definite subsutural band. The suture is strongly impressed, the upper part of the whorl rising rather abruptly from it. The protoconch consists of about two small, prominent whorls. The first is small, rounded, slightly mamilliform, and a little prominent. The next, constitutes the greater part of the protoconch, increases rapidly and is decidedly prominent and somewhat obliquely placed, and bears about four or five raised, revolving lines, which are sometimes crossed by distinct lines of growth. The suture between the last whorl of the protoconch and the next is strongly marked and more oblique than any of the others. The remaining whorls are crossed by rather conspicuous, sharp, and rather elevated ribs, which are strongly excurved at and just above the shoulder, curving forward rapidly to the suture, and bending forward more gradually below the shoulder, forming a distinct sigmoid curve. The interspaces between the ribs are much wider than the ribs themselves, distinctly concave, and crossed by rather feeble cinguli, which are usually not apparent ou the ribs themselves. On the upper whorls the spiral lines are usually more conspicuous than on the lower ones, but are often indicated chiefly by rather close, shallow furrows. On the body whorl the ribs extend to the base of the siphonal canal before they fade out, and the spiral sculpture becomes coarser and a little more evident on its anterior part and on the canal. The surface is also a little roughened by faint lines of growth, parallel with the ribs. The aperture is oblong-ovate and rather narrow. The thin outer lip is sharp, projecting forward in the middle in a broadly rounded curve, and slightly receding just above the shoulder, so as to form a broad and shallow sinus a little removed from the suture. The siphonal canal is nearly straight, a little prolonged, distinctly constricted at its base by the incurvature of the outer lip. The columella is straight, tapering anteriorly, its inner edge forming a well- marked sigmoid curve. The epidermis is indistinct. The color is translucent bluish white. The surface is not glossy.Verrill, A. E. 1884.

As one of the earliest 20th-century European artists to master the modernist woodcut, she was influential on other artists. Education and travels Martha Cunz was born in St. Gallen, Switzerland. She received most of her art training at the Women's Art School in Munich, where her teachers included Christian Landenberger, Ludwig Schmid-Reutte, and Peter Paul M√ºller. In 1900, she went to Paris to study with Luc-Olivier Merson and Lucien Simon. The following year, back in Munich, a course in lithography with Ernst Neumann sparked her interest in printmaking. By the following year, she had moved on to woodcuts, and in 1903 she became a founding member of the German Association of Graphics. Until the outbreak of World War I, Cunz lived in Munich and only returned to Switzerland for an annual visit. She also traveled around Europe, spending time in Holland (1904, 1911) and Italy (1914). In 1920, she built a studio built at her parents' home in St. Gallen and lived there for the remainder of her life. Artwork For the first three decades of her career, Cunz specialized in lithographs and woodcuts, especially color woodcuts printed using a Japanese multi-block technique. She was one of the first 20th century European artists to take up color woodblock printmaking. Her style is characterized by the play of subtly graded contrasting colors that overlap to create a luminous surface. By 1905, Cunz was showing in the annual Glass Palace Exhibition in Munich, and some of her earliest woodcuts were published in April 1905 in the journal Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration alongside work by Wassily Kandinsky and other Munich artists. The last of her 71 woodcuts was made in 1927, and her last lithographs were made in 1931. For the following two decades, she devoted herself to painting, mainly landscapes and portraits. Cunz is known to have influenced the work of contemporaries like Carl Thiemann, and she also taught printmakers, including Rosa Paul. References Sources This page is translated from :de:Martha Cunz.

The pura is dedicated to the goddess Sarasvati. Pura Taman Saraswati is notable for its lotus pond. History Pura Taman Saraswati was designed by I Gusti Nyoman Lempad following a commission by the Prince of Ubud Cokorda Gede Agung Sukawati. I Gusti Nyoman Lempad was a well known Balinese sculptor and undagi (Balinese architect for ritual paraphernalia e.g. cremation towers and wooden sarcophagi). I Gusti Nyoman Lempad arrived in Ubud after moving away from the royal court of Blahbatuh, following a serious disagreement which provokes the wrath of the King of Blahbatuh. In Ubud, he was employed by the Sukawati royal family and built several palaces and temples in Ubud and the neighboring villages. Construction of Pura Taman Saraswati started in 1951 and was completed in 1952. The pura is dedicated to Sarasvati, the Hindu deity of learning, literature and art. Temple compound padmasana of Acintya in the holiest sanctum of the pura. Pura Taman Saraswati is one of the most popular landmarks of Ubud. The most notable feature of the pura is its lotus pond and water garden, marking the outer area of the actual temple. Plumeria (frangipani) trees decorate the edges of the pond, while the straight bridge- like access is decorated with paras (volcanic tuff) sculptures of Hindu mythological figures. Many of these statues are the works of Lempad. Access to the inner sanctum is provided by three red-bricked kori agung gates. The central kori agung is the largest of these gates and is flanked with two tall plumeria trees. The straight route into the inner courtyard is blocked by an unusual aling-aling, a wall device which is used to disorient evil spirits in the architecture of Bali. This wall is actually the back of a -tall statue of the rakshasha figure Jero Gede Mecaling. A padmasana shrine is located at the most sacred, kaja-kangin (north-east) side of the temple. The base of this padmasana is decorated with paras carvings of the cosmic turtle and several nagas, these represent the world of demons (bhur). The uppermost part of the padmasana is topped with a golden empty throne decorated with the image of Acintya, the highest deity in the Balinese Hindu pantheon. A pavilion (bale) with three empty thrones on the inside is dedicated for the Hindu Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Several meru towers are located on this side as well. The temple also contains the bale barong, a pavilion to keep the barong figures used by villagers for exorcizing rituals. Normally there are two barong figures in the bale barong: the lion-like Barong Ket and the boar-like Barong Pangkal). There is also statue of the goddess Sarasvati.

It has locations in Niagara Falls, Williamsville and Lewiston. It is known mainly for its biscotti, in particular, the Biscotti Di Vino (red wine biscuits topped with sesame seeds) introduced in 1979. History DiCamillo bakery was founded by Tomaso and Addolorata DiCamillo in 1920 on 14th Street in Niagara Falls, NY. They were joined in business by their 11 children. DiCamillo‚Äôs was one of the first Italian bakeries to open in Niagara Falls. It operated in the basement of a three-story building with fresh bread delivered to locals by horse-drawn wagons. In 1931, the bakery was bombed and the subject of an armed attack after eldest son Tom was approached by a mob collector looking for protection money and refused to pay. =Second generation 1940s1970s= Tomaso DiCamillo died in 1941 leaving the family business in the hands of his four sons. In 1942, they moved the bakery from 14th Street to 20th Street where the bakery operated until 1976. By 1954, the company had three stores in Niagara Falls and offered a variety of products including traditional Italian bread and pizza, wedding and birthday cakes, doughnuts and √©clairs. =Third generation 1970s1990s= In the late sixties, a third generation of DiCamillo family entered the business. David, Thomas, Francis and Michael opened a new production facility on Linwood Ave in 1976. In 1979 the company started to deliver products in tin boxes by mail orders. It opened a Gourmet Department headed by Michael DiCamillo and catered to gourmet departments at Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, Bloomingdale's in New York and Marshall Field's in Chicago. In 1980, DiCamillo also opened their first store outside of Niagara Falls in Lewiston at the historic Hotchkiss building. The bakery maintained its business model, Micahl DiCamillo saying, \\"There are no brokers, no distributors, no agents. Everyone has to buy directly from us. There are no salesmen, no one else but us, which is an oddity in this business.\\". DiCamillo‚Äôs most popular product in the 1980s was biscotti, especially Biscotti Di Vino (red wine biscuits topped with sesame seeds) introduced in 1979 and sold in a brown coffee style bag. In 1990, the name \\"Biscotti Di Vino\\" was registered as a trademark. Another popular product of the 1980s was traditional focaccia introduced in 1983. The DiCamillo family were featured on the cover of Allison and Margaret Engel‚Äôs 1984 book Food Finds : America's Best Local Foods and the People Who Produce Them. The authors praised the Biscotti Di Vino, stating that it \\"has a taste, crunch, and flavor that is unequalled.\\" In 1989, an article by Margaret Engel in The Washington Post said of DiCamillo‚Äôs \\"Dolcetti Delicati\\" tin \\"as with all of the DiCamillo products, the presentation, from the magical graphics on the burnished gold tin to the neatly arranged cookies, equals the quality of the baked goods.\\" =Fourth generation= In 2002, the bakery was operated by four brothers, each overseeing a particular business area: production, finance, marketing, retail operations. DiCamillo added new varieties of cookies and sweets which were sold at retailers including Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. In 2006, the bakery opened its fifth retail store in Williamsville at an historic 1840 Greek Revival building.

Ibiza Years  Escohotado in Ibiza, 1976 In 1970, Ibiza offered traditional country houses (casas payesas) designed following ancestral techniques, without electricity or water, but very cheap. They were converted into quasi-monasteries, devoted to collective life and to orgiastic traditions. Although only a minority had vehicles, walking or hitchhiking was sufficient for getting around and this sustained an intense social life. Experiences with visionary substances such as LSD,Escohotado recounts his most disturbing trip of LSD: in a certain moment, ‚Äúthe barrel of a gun announced that I was on the verge of losing my memory, and I heard myself say: I will find a system of thought that will enable us to live without memory, a kind of Faustian bargain which in practice equates to composing a philosophical treatise‚Äù Escohotado, in M.

In 1976, he transformed a large old country house into the ‚Äútribe‚Äôs‚Äù meeting place outfitted with musical instruments. This house became Amnesia, one of the most well-known discoth√®ques in the world.See: amnesia.es (http://www.amnesia.es/history/es). = Whores and Spouses = Family Stories, four myths about sex and duty was his first anthropological essay. This work reviews the marital model illustrated by Mary and Joseph, in the light of the comparison with the relationships between Gilgamesh and Ishtar, Zeus and Hera, and Hercules and Deainira. In Escohotado's estimation, these timeless figures suggest a primordial tension in the archetypal family. The book was reworked and issued as Whores and Spouses. = Indictment = Troubles with the local police started with the foundation of Amnesia, and culminated in 1983 with prosecution for cocaine trafficking, being accused of leading the so-called ‚Äúhippie mafia‚Äù, using his status of writer and professor as a front. Eschotado had returned to the National University of Distance Education in Spain (UNED) as a part-time assistant professor in 1980. The journal Diario 16 commented: ‚ÄúThe professor of ethics is a hard drug dealer‚Äù. The scandal heated up when, two days later, El Pa√≠s newspaper published an opinion page written by Escohotado¬´La droga, la polic√≠a y la trampa¬ª. 31st March,1983. in which he claimed to have been a victim of an entrapment in a drug trading operation where both buyers and sellers were policemen.

This unleashed a slew of TV debates on drug prohibition.

After analysing various manifestations of each, Escohotado concludes that condemning voluntarily requested services between adults, or publicly manifested prohibited thoughts actually create crimes against a victim who is merely alleged, where the grievance is not received by a specific flesh-and-blood person but by an authority of religious origin that declares itself the offended party even without having participated in the incident. All these crimes derive from ‚Äúthe archaic unjustness par excellence which is the crime of l√®se-majest√© or injured majesty, a challenge to the prince‚Äôs powers that secular societies shift towards the new majestic powers, sometimes camouflaged by scientific pretexts such as the ‚ÄúPharmacracy‚Äù described by Thomas Szasz.e.g. Pharmacracy: Medicine and Politics in America, by Thomas Szasz, 2001 Escohotado claimed that freedom is incompatible with any crime of mere challenge and ‚Äúany prosecution of l√®se-majest√© is finally a crime against humanity...‚Äù This analysis aroused the interest of criminologists, public prosecutors and judges. In April 1989, two years after the appearance of the essay, the jurisprudence issued the first judgment of acquittal due to provoked crime (delito provocado). Since then, the Spanish judiciary has been reluctant to conflate morality and law, and nearly all crimes of l√®se-majest√© ‚Äì starting with blasphemy ‚Äì lost validity. Escohotado has continued to draw the attention to the legal status of euthanasia (contempt of Divine Providence), and even more so about the crime of suicide assistance (contempt of the medical authority).  General History of Drugs  Escohotado produced a book that thoroughly documents the pharmacological enlightenment. > ‚Äú(‚Ä¶) Replacing conjectures and future possibilities ‚Äì what would happen if > this or that drug changed its status ‚Äì by a comprehensive list of examples > about what happened and when.

Among the first reviews was that of Fernando Savater in El Pa√≠s‚Äô literary supplement: ‚ÄúA new phenomenology of consciousness ‚Ä¶ A unique book in the world bibliography, not only because of its wideness and complexity but also due to its purpose and depth.‚Äù Since then, this work has become a major reference. An abbreviated version was translated into many languages.Brief History of Drugs, Anagrama. Barcelona, 1994, translated into English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Czech. Esochotado completed it in 1992 with an appendix dedicated to personal experimentation, Learning from Drugs: uses and abuses, prejudices and challenges, which involved experimentation with about a hundred compounds such as alcohol, heroin, hemp, ether, benzodiazepines, cocaine, LSD, coffee, ketamine and MDMA. Following its publication, he gained ‚Äúan army of followers and a legion of detractors‚Äù.A. Lucas, El Mundo, 8/20/2013. The book analyzes drugs as a way towards self-discovery, maturity and dialogue or even simple entertainment: > ‚ÄúDrugs prompt chemical modifications which can also induce solitude, > silence, abstinence, pain, fear. Chemically, there is no way to distinguish > a person who is under the effects of drugs from one under the effects of > yoga. Chemically, we are nothing but a set of reactions. The problem is that > society tells you that, even if you are chemically the same, that one came > in the good way and the other through the back door.‚Äù¬´Entrevista a Antonio > Escohotado¬ª. Consulted on the 27th of January 2010. Instead of classifying drugs as legal or illegal, hard or soft, or according to their respective chemical bases, the author arranges them in groups by function. They are evaluated on the extent to which they meet the expected or promised level of satisfaction, and the needs are defined as ‚Äúpeace, verve and travel‚Äù. The author examines each substance by variables such as minimum active dose, median lethal dose, tolerance factor, subjective and objective effects, synergies, antagonisms, and withdrawal symptoms. In addition, it includes sections dedicated to the cultural framework (‚Äúmain uses‚Äù), as well as the mythology linked to each of them. The epilogue begins by saying: ‚ÄúThe same rope used by the alpinist to climb, is also used by the suicidal man to hang himself, and by the sailor so the wind can fill the sails.‚Äù Hence the proposal stated in the last paragraph: > ‚ÄúThe illustration notes that certain compounds, when used reasonably, may > provide moments of peace, energy and mental tripping. Its goal is to make > their use less and less toxic, and those who use them more aware of their > inalienable freedom. This is the oldest human aspiration: to go deeper into > responsibility and knowledge.‚Äù  Mature Work  A quote by Escohotado in his book Learning from drugs was celebrated with the song ‚ÄúFrom My Skin Inwards I‚Äôm in Charge‚Äù by the band Mil Dolores Peque√±os (Soul Shack, 1994). This turned Escohotado into a media figure for a decade. The Spirit of Comedy won the 1992 Anagrama Essay Award. Notwithstanding its title, it deals with the sociology of executive power. The book analyses the political class that emerged from the democratic transition, reflecting on the institutional horizons of parliamentary democracy and its alternative, direct democracy. He describes terrorism as a feedback loop or vicious circle, in which the interests of the terrorist and the antiterrorists always coincide. He also provides an alternative virtuous circle by analysing when a group is able to claim the right of self-determination. He examines the Swiss model as well as centralism, federalism and confederation. The texts gathered in Portrait of a Libertine outline a contemporary theory of health, suggesting that our nature inevitably merges being and thinking. The first and most extensive essay concerns the Victorian anonymous text My Secret Life. Years before, Escohotado translated and prefaced For La Sonrisa Vertical (The Vertical Smile) by Tusquets Editores, a collection of erotic writings led by Luis Garc√≠a Berlanga of which the first four titles were also translated by Escohotado. a two-volume abbreviated edition of the twelve-volume set published around 1888. According to poet and critic Jaime Gil de Biedma, it is ‚Äúthe most extensive and detailed report about a male human being‚Äôs erotic experience ever to be written.‚Äù In fact, ‚Äúbesides offering a rich picture of the era ‚Äì precisely the part omitted in Dickens, Hardy, and contemporary English authors ‚Äì he describes in detail carnal relations with about two thousand women‚Äù. Escohotado discusses the many ways to experience carnal love, passions such as domination, lust or jealousy.As an inaugural conference for the multidisciplinary meeting celebrated in the Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco, 18/10/1996. Notes about eugenics reviews the policy of denying terminal patients the use of euphoriant analgesics not only as palliatives but as remedies. In A Better Way to Die, he reflects on euthanasia, and on each individual‚Äôs right to choose when and how to die of his own death. The volume concludes with the similarities between Ernst J√ºnger and Albert Hofmann, who were elderly at that time, proposed examples of good living and good dying. Chaos and Order criticises from a number of different perspectives ‚Äúprofessional infallibility.‚Äù The work compares open and closed-order ways of thinking, some aware of the environment, such as the thermostat, and others isolated from it such as the clock. Dogmatic thinking works by reducing, abstracting or forgetting as necessary. But, according to Escohotado, doing so implies choosing a vicious circle to the detriment of a virtuous one ‚Äì as Wiener says in his Cybernetics ‚Äì ‚Äúignoring the environment‚Äôs signals, as the clock which is sensitive only to its mainspring, in contrast with a thermostat which is permanently re-fed.‚Äù This Espasa Award-winning essay sold out five editions in one semester. = The Enemies of Commerce = Escohotado at a conference in Madrid Escohotado See first part of Pienso luego existo (I think therefore I am) (http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/pienso-luego- existo/pienso-luego-existo-antonio-escohotado/1231044/) wrote a history of communism, The Enemies of Commerce, a moral history of property, with the theme of stating who ‚Äúhas held that private property is robbery and trade is its tool.‚ÄùThe enemies of commerce, p.19 The author goes back to the Essenian sect, which interpreted the sixth commandment as ‚ÄúThou shalt not trade‚Äù, the Ebionite creed (‚Äúpoor-ist‚Äù), and the Sermon on the Mount. It includes research on slave-owning societies‚Äô origins. Escohotado reframes history with a thread provided by the idea of profit as vileness and impurity, combined with the impact of economic anthropology on the history of institutions. He shows to what extent the collapse of the Roman Empire is inseparable from its anti- trade spirit, as well as how the Dark Ages were in fact a golden age of evangelical criticisms of wealth. Capable of effectively abolishing the buying and selling of lands, banishing traders, and short-circuiting other market exchanges, it culminated in a society where the market for goods and services was replaced by that of captives. In Escohotado's narrative, the trading society culminated in the Renaissance's peasant wars. In the meantime, the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation abandoned idealizing the poor and proposed that good Christians should be foresighted and prosperous. Two centuries of accumulation followed, with Mandeville‚Äôs Fable of the Bees as a summary. Finally came the French Revolution, a battlefield for liberals and authoritarians, followed by the Conspiracy of the Equals and its leader Babeuf, the first professional communist. The first volume was published in 2008 and the second in 2013. They were well received on the Internet. The work links the history of terror to profit, adding each economic environment‚Äôs details as well as the evolution of credit facilities, guilds and trade unions, the first very large-scale businesses, social welfare systems, the introduction of banknotes, and patent law. There is also an analysis of the political revolutions in North America, England, France, Spain, Germany and Russia. The second volume specifies the dilemma between the messianic and democratic models of socialism.Escohotado elaborates upon the subject in an interview with Alfonso Armada. The third volume was published in 2016. It delves into communism's economic context, the evolution of trade unions, large-scale enterprises, property defended by copyright, and insurance systems. It begins with Lenin and discusses populist movements emerged in the 20th century in Latin America, and their reflection in 21st century Europe through political parties such as Syriza in Greece or Podemos in Spain.

He is best known for his legal battle with life insurance company Aviva.  Early life  George is the youngest child in the family, born March 1989, he grew in Metz, France with his brother and sister. From a very young age George showed great interest in economics and finance. After completing his BA in economics at the Institut Pilare De Roziers in 2008, George went on to study law at University of Paris X. Seeking to concentrate on his professional career he abandoned studying in 2010, having completed only two years.  Professional career  = Early career = As early as 2007, George took part in the litigation case instigated by his parents in his and his sibling's name against the French branch of the Insurance giant Aviva. = Recent years = He participated to the purchase of a land, near Geneva, Switzerland and designed, developed and oversaw the construction to completion and launch of a commercial complex. He subsequent exited the transaction. In the same year, he associated with Byron Baciocchi to purchase the Sport Hotel Rutti in Gstaad In 2013, the Sport hotel was demolished and work started on a construction which was to become Ultima Gstaad. In 2015, George launched the Duchessa brand. The first boutique opened in Etoy in June 2016.  Aviva Lawsuit  = Background = In the 1980s, multiple insurance companies, including Abeille Vie, created life insurance contracts with a clause called \\"known price arbitrage\\" (√† cours connu) destined to their best clients, therefore, shielded from market volatility. These contracts allow the investor/subscriber to place their money in an investment at a price 8 days prior to the day of the investment. For example, if the Asian market rose, the investor was able to instruct the insurance company to move their money into Asian investments at the price before the rise, realising an instant and certain capital gain that the insurance company must cover. With the development of technology and the instant access to market prices, these contracts become a danger to insurance companies' assets. Virtually all insurance giants taking measure of the danger, including AXA and AGF started to purchase the contracts back from their clients. But not Aviva which had purchased Abeille vie in 2002. Instead Aviva drastically decreased the list of authorized investments in the contracts allowing the certain gains and refused to execute the investment orders of clients/investors who complain opening the door to litigation. = George's case = Having subscribed life insurance contracts with known price clauses for their 3 children, George's parents instigated legal action in the French court against Aviva in 2002. In 2007, having come of age, he became party to the litigation himself. As of 2017, he has been fighting Aviva for 10 years, 15 if the years fought by his parents are taken into account. By 2015, up to 50 court decisions had been rendered against Aviva France. In September 2014, the French Supreme court, the Cour de Cassation, ruled in favor of the George family, determining that the life insurance contracts, as drafted with the \\"known price\\" clause, are legally binding under French law. Nevertheless, George is still in court against Aviva, having won on the principle of the legality of the contracts, he now needs to have his prejudice recognized and valued in a second ongoing battle. It is reported that at least 30 other people are in litigation with Aviva, with the possibility of thousands of similar contracts existing. Aviva has been repeatedly criticized for not disclosing the measure of the risks related to the \\"known price\\" contracts, \\"failing to show these potential losses on its books, it is also neglecting its duty to its shareholders and policyholders\\".

Additionally, those who live in rural areas may experience more stigma related to mental health issues. Internet interventions can increase the possibility that those who suffer from PTSD can seek help by eliminating these barriers to treatment.

A web- based self-management program for recent combat veterans with PTSD and substance misuse: Program development and veteran feedback. Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, 22(3), 345-358. Doi:10.1016 Often these internet interventions also pull from Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and exposure therapy as well. There are two types of internet interventions. Those that are ‚Äútherapist-assisted,‚Äù which means there is an actual therapist guiding the patient through some, but not all of the intervention, and those that are self-guided, which means they do not provide this service. In therapist assisted interventions, patients have access to a live therapist either via video conferencing, instant messenger, or telephone.Morland, L., Ruzek, J., & Rosen, C. (2015). Technology and PTSD care: An update. PTSD Research Quarterly, 26(2), 1-10. Therapists can provide feedback to the patient's assignments, and help them process their trauma. In self-guided interventions, patients do not have contact with therapists, unless there is an emergency in which they are a risk to themselves or others. Throughout these interventions, patients are given coping skills and resources. The resources available to patients participating in a self-guided intervention are typically crisis lines, emergency services, and outside sources in which the person can seek help or treatment. The resources provided in a self-guided treatment protocol are not a part of the intervention itself. While there is a recent shift toward completely removing the need for a therapist in many internet interventions, most of the online interventions currently being researched and used for PTSD still use therapists as part of their protocol. The involvement of the therapist in the intervention varies across interventions. For example, while one study had therapists in direct communication with clients via the Internet every session, another study only had therapists for intake and follow-up purposes. The existing interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD with varying causes such as war in Iraq or miscarriages. This effectiveness is consistent across follow-ups up to a year out from the interventions, but one randomized control trial does report that more structured and highly therapist-assisted interventions are more effective than purely psychoeducational or inspirational interventions.  Therapist- Assisted Internet Interventions  = High Therapist Involvement = One example of an internet intervention with a high level of therapist involvement is Interapy, which was created and named by Alfred Lange and a team of psychologists at the University of Amsterdam in 2003.Lange, A., Rietdijk, D., Hudcovicova, M., Van De Ven, J. P., Schrieken, B., & Emmelkamp, P. M. (2003). Interapy: a controlled randomized trial of the standardized treatment of posttraumatic stress through the internet. Journal of consulting and clinical psychology, 71(5), 901. Interapy uses a CPT approach and assigns two 45-minute writing sessions each week for five weeks. The writing sessions are assigned via the Internet and guide the participant through three phases of treatment. The first phase, Self-Confrontation, involves describing the traumatic event in great detail within the writing assignment. This phase is a self-guided exposure to the traumatic event aimed at reducing the avoidance and distress of memories or reminders of the event. The second phase, Cognitive Reappraisal, helps the participant to instill new views concerning the traumatic event. This is achieved by a writing assignment that asks the participants to write a letter with encouraging advice to a hypothetical friend who experienced a similar traumatic event. The last phase of Interapy, Sharing and Farewell Ritual, involves participants writing a letter to themselves or others who were involved in the traumatic event about how the event changed or impacted their lives. Therapists are highly involved in the entire process of Interapy. They not only customize each writing assignment personally for the participants under their care, but also give written feedback about each assignment turned in by the participants. So far, Interapy shows promising results for participants in the Netherlands, Germany, and Iraq, and has been shown to have positive effects on PTSD symptoms as far as three months from the end of treatment. = Medium Therapist Involvement = PTSD Online is an example of an internet intervention that requires a medium level of therapist involvement. PTSD Online was created by Britt Klein and a team of psychologists in Victoria, Australia in 2010. The intervention was a ten-week interactive program that guides the participant through a different module each week. The first module focuses on psychoeducation about trauma and trauma responses (including stress and anxiety). Modules 2 and 3 are directed at anxiety and stress reduction tools, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Modules 4 through 6 focus on cognitive restructuring and aid the participant in challenging their negative beliefs. Modules 7 through 9 engage the participant in self-guided exposure to images and memories of the trauma. Lastly, the tenth module gives information and tools to prevent relapse into the trauma response. The therapists involved in PTSD Online have less week-to-week interaction with the participants, as they are not providing feedback to them regarding their progress or adherence to the intervention. Instead, therapists conduct telephone interviews at the start of treatment and then provide audio files unique to each participant regarding their specific trauma that help guide them through the intervention online. Although PTSD Online is no longer live, it showed promising effects early on, with positive treatment effects found at a 3-month follow-up. = Low Therapist Involvement = David Ivarsson and a team of psychologists in Sweden created an unnamed internet intervention for PTSD in 2014 that required very little therapist involvement. The intervention is an eight-week text-based intervention that delivers a different module to participants each week. Within the first module, participants are given psychoeducation about PTSD and are invited to commit to change through a treatment contract. The second module is focused on anxiety coping skills such as controlled breathing or relaxation. Modules 3 through 6 guides the participants through exposures to memories and images of the trauma, using both imaginal and in-vivo techniques. Module 7 focuses on cognitive restructuring and module 8 is relapse prevention. The structure of the intervention was very similar to PTSD Online, but in this intervention, therapists did not tailor the assignments each week and provided only minimal feedback to participants on their progress. Therapists were, however, available to provide encouragement or help. Again, the intervention showed promising results with significant positive treatment effects at a one-year follow-up.  Self-Guided Internet Interventions  One intervention under development is Coming Home and Moving Forward. This treatment protocol has not been implemented for public use. It was utilized as a randomized control trial (RCT) to investigate if it would be a feasible tool for reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans. This intervention is meant to treat veterans who have recently moved back home from deployment, and have been using excessive amounts of substances. One of the characteristics that sets this intervention apart from other emerging internet interventions, is that it is tailored toward Vets who would rather seek help for their physical complaints, rather than focus on their psychological symptoms. Therefore, primary care providers can recommend it to their patients. This intervention applies CBT tools to treat veterans, which means it focuses on challenging distorted cognitions related to trauma, increasing coping and self-management skills, and preventing social isolation. The study in which this intervention was implemented utilized veteran feedback 6 months after they completed the protocol. Veterans felt this intervention was ideal for individuals who had been home from deployment for a period of 3‚Äì4 months. They did not believe someone who had only been home for month or two would find this intervention useful, because most veterans do not realize something is wrong until they have had time to adjust. Most veterans who participated in Coming Home and Moving Forward thought this treatment would be ‚Äúa foot in the door,‚Äù for veterans who were on the fence about seeking treatment. Due to issues related to stigma, veterans are wary of seeking help. Those who engaged in this online intervention felt it could decrease this stigma and enable veterans to feel comfortable enough in seeking psychological services. Veterans‚Äô feedback regarding Coming Home and Moving Forward was not all good, there were some downsides to this intervention as well. While most veterans felt this tool allowed other Vets to participate in treatment in the privacy of their own homes, they also felt that sharing their personal information online felt unsafe. Veterans were afraid their identifying information such as their demographics, and their responses to homework assignments would be leaked somehow. Due to this fear, some veterans who participated in the online intervention admitted that they were dishonest throughout some aspects of it. These veterans believed that other Vets participating in this intervention would do the same based on their fears. In conclusion, online treatment interventions for Post-Traumatic stress is a growing field. Its increased popularity is related to its ability to combat barriers to treatment such as lack of time, geographical access, and increased stigma related to mental health issues. Due to the demand for web-based treatments, researchers have worked to implement therapist assisted and self- guided interventions to treat PTSD. Most of these interventions utilize a CBT orientation, and have both upsides including increased comfort in seeking treatment, and downsides including lack of security.

It was released by Tusk Music in November 1995. In 1996, Eat a Mango won a SAMA in the category \\"Best Adult Contemporary Performance: English\\" at the second annual South African Music Awards. The band recorded music videos for three songs from the album: \\"Eat a Mango\\", \\"New World (Beneath Our Feet)\\", and \\"Right Time\\". Eat a Mango was the last studio album Mango Groove released until Bang the Drum in 2009. In the interim, the band members pursued other creative projects. In a 2014 interview, lead singer Claire Johnston offered an explanation for the hiatus: \\"We experienced a creative lull.

They reissued it on CD in 2011, in a release that also included the band's 1990 album, Hometalk. This CD reissue was part of the label's \\"Two on One Collection\\" series.

The museum is located in a noted Lake Huron port city, and the museum specializes in the maritime history of the Great Lakes with an emphasis on the lives of marine personnel. Description The Great Lakes Lore Maritime Museum remembers many of the seafarers and seamen of the Great Lakes. Rogers City is a noted producer of aggregate. A thick stratum of limestone is quarried nearby and shipped all over the U.S. Midwest for construction purposes and to serve as flux in the steelmaking process. Many youngsters from Rogers City have \\"shipped out\\" over the years. Some have returned as retirees to help staff the museum, and others have been lost and are memorialized here. A boat of particular importance to the history of maritime Rogers City is the SS Carl D. Bradley, once the largest vessel carrying bulk freight on the Great Lakes. The Bradley, caught in a severe storm off Gull Island in Lake Michigan while returning to her home port in ballast, broke apart and foundered on the night of November 18, 1958. Only two men survived, while 33 were lost. Of the men killed, 23 were from Rogers City. The museum contains displays in honor of the lost vessel.

Offering credit and debit service to corporates, banks, and financial institutions, the service, aimed at integrating all regional ECS into one National Payment System, is claimed to be better than its predecessor, Electronic Clearing Service. According to the service's website, \\"NACH System can be used for making bulk transactions towards distribution of subsidies, dividends, interest, salary, pension etc. and also for bulk transactions towards collection of payments pertaining to telephone, electricity, water, loans, investments in mutual funds, insurance premium etc.\\" In March 2017, NPCI via a circular notified a paperless way for corporates to register NACH mandates for its customers, which can be later used to debit customer accounts. Electronic Clearing Service Electronic Clearing Service, or ECS, is an electronic clearing service that facilitates funds transfer between bank accounts. The service was started by Reserve Bank of India providing, both, debit and credit which can be used to pay utility bills.  API based E-mandate Process  User can authenticate a NACH API E-mandate on the web. The customer gets directed to the NPCI website, where customer has to choose their bank, and then authenticate via one of the two methods - 1. Net banking credentials 2. Debit card. Kotak Mahindra Bank became the first bank to allow customers to choose both methods for authentication. Since then, 38 banks allow customers to authenticate API based e-mandates as of September 2019. API based E-mandate process is expected to make the process fast, frictionless and paperless. Membership NPCI has categorised members of NACH system in three entities: Sponsor Banks are allowed to originate transactions the system required, they have a mutual agreement with NPCI and also are members of any payment system approved by the Reserve Bank of India. Destination Banks are allowed to do transaction, process mandates and update the Aadhar mapper through the use of the system. On necessary agreement, all the banks that are members of any payment system participate on NACH system as Destination Banks. The corporate/government departments, on submission of necessary agreement with their Sponsor Banks, participate on NACH system as Users. For this, to facilitate settlement on their behalf, the departments indicate the names of the Sponsor Banks with whom accounts are maintained. NPCI notifies all of the members if a new member is added to the NACH network or if suspension or termination of a NACH member occurs. Comparison with ECS *Registration for NACH takes approximately 15 days over ECS taking 30 days for registration. *For future reference, NACH provides a unique number called Mandate Registration Reference Number.

Early life  Suniti Chowdhury was born on 22 May 1917 in Comilla of Comilla District of Bengal (present Bangladesh) to Umacharan Choudhury and Surasundari Choudhury. She was a student of Foyjunessa Balika Vidyalay of Comilla.Trailokyanath Chakravarty, Jele Trish Bachhar: Pak- Bharater Swadhinata Sangram, ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶™‡¶¶ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶®, ‡¶¢‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ, ‡¶¢‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡¶á‡¶Æ‡ßá‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡ß®‡ß¶‡ß¶‡ß™, ‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶†‡¶æ ‡ßß‡ßÆ‡ß®‡•§  Revolutionary activities  Chowdhury was influenced by the revolutionary activities of Ullaskar Dutta, who also lived in Comilla. She was recruited to the Jugantar Party by Prafullanalini Brahma, another pupil. She was also the member of Tripura Zilla Chhatri Sangha. Chowdhury was selected as the Captain of the Women's Volunteer Corps in the Annual Conference of Tripura Zilla Chhatri Sangha, held on 6 May 1931. During this time, she was known by the alias of 'Meera Devi'. She was selected as the ‚Äúcustodian of firearms‚Äù and was in charge of training female members (of the Chhatri Sangha) in lathi, sword and dagger play.  Assassination of Charles Stevens  On 14 December 1931, Chowdhury, then 14, and Santi Ghose, who was 15, walked into the office of Charles Geoffrey Buckland Stevens, a British bureaucrat and the district magistrate of Comilla, under the pretense that they wanted to present a petition to arrange a swimming competition amongst their classmates. While Stevens looked at the document, Ghose and Chowdhury removed automatic pistols which were hidden under their shawls and shot and killed him. = Trial and sentence = The girls were taken into custody and imprisoned in the local British jail. In February 1932, Ghose and Chowdhury appeared in court in Calcutta. Being a minor, both of them were sentenced to jail for 10 years. In an interview, they stated, \\"It is better to die than live in a horse's stable.\\" She was held captive in Hijli Detention Camp as a \\"third class prisoner\\". The effects of her activities were also faced by her family, with her father‚Äôs government pension being stopped, and her two elder brothers being held in custody without trial. Her younger brother died from consumption, exacerbated by years of malnutrition. She was released with Santi Ghose in 1939, after having served seven years of her sentence, because of the amnesty negotiations between Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the government of British-occupied India. = Public and media response = Contemporary Western periodicals portrayed the assassination as a sign of \\"Indians' outrage against an ordinance by the Earl of Willingdon that suppressed the civil rights of Indians, including that of free speech.\\" Indian sources characterized the assassination as Ghose and Chowdbury's response to the \\"misbehaviors of the British district magistrates\\" who had abused their positions of power to rape Indian women. After the verdict was announced, a flyer was found by the intelligence branch of police in the Rajshahi district praising Ghose and Chowdbury as nationalist heroines. The poster read, \\"THOU ART FREEDOM'S NOW, AND FAME'S\\" and displayed photographs of the two girls alongside lines from Robert Burns' poem Scots Wha Hae: \\"Tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty's in every blow!\\"  Later life and death  After her release, Chowdhury studied and passed M.B.B.S. and became a doctor. In 1947, Chowdhury married Trade Union Leader Pradyot Kumar Ghosh.

Fuyuki-gun was originally founded by Fuyuki in WAR in 1994 and they became the first WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Champions, winning the title a record five times. They left WAR in 1996 and competed as freelancers before being signed by FMW to a full-time contract, where they held the FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The group would merge with the trio of Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido to form Team No Respect. Fuyuki-Gun disbanded after Fuyuki left FMW (kayfabe) due to losing a match to Masato Tanaka at the 10th Anniversary Show. Fuyuki formed a new offshoot group called \\"Shin Fuyuki-Gun\\" (New Fuyuki Army) which lasted until 2001. History =WAR (1994-1996)= Hiromichi Fuyuki had been wrestling in Wrestle Association R (WAR) since 1992 and took Jado and Gedo, who just joined WAR after their home promotion, W*ING, folded, under his wing to form the villainous stable Fuyuki-gun and became the lead villain of the company.

Fuyuki-Gun defeated the trio in a street fight at 8th Anniversary Show. They defended the title on their own Fuyuki Army shows before it was vacated on July 8 to be defended in a tournament. Fuyuki-Gun participated in the tournament, beating Eagle Sawai, Lioness Asuka and Shark Tsuchiya in the quarter-final and Daikokubo Benkei, Keisuke Yamada and The Great Kabuki in the semi-final but lost to Funk Masters of Wrestling's Mr. Gannosuke, Hisakatsu Oya and The Gladiator on August 5.

However, Fuyuki-Gun returned to FMW to work full-time for the promotion on November 15. The group began feuding with Atsushi Onita's ZEN due to Fuyuki's hatred with Onita. On December 5, Fuyuki-Gun defeated Onita's alter ego The Great Nita, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido. Team No Respect (1998-1999) On January 7, 1998, Fuyuki-Gun's Kodo Fuyuki and Jado joined former ZEN members Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido in attacking ZEN members Atsushi Onita, Koji Nakagawa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda after the latter defeated the former. Fuyuki, Jado, Gannosuke and Kanemura merged to form Team No Respect to feud with FMW and ZEN. Gedo joined the group upon returning to FMW on February 4. Fuyuki-Gun had now been merged in TNR and the trio continued to team with each other as TNR members in various matches throughout 1998. On January 6, 1999, Fuyuki turned fan favorite for the first time by quitting villainous tactics. Jado disagreed with Fuyuki and left TNR while Gedo chose to stay in the group, leading to a feud between Jado and Gedo. The two former tag team partners met in a match on May 5, where Gedo defeated Jado. Later in the night, Fuyuki-Gun reunited as Jado re-joined TNR. Fuyuki-Gun continued teaming together as TNR members until Fuyuki was forced to leave FMW in storyline due to losing a loser leaves FMW match to Masato Tanaka at 10th Anniversary Show. =Shin Fuyuki-gun= On May 28, 2000, Koji Nakagawa turned on his Team No Respect allies Jado and Gedo during a defense of WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship against Kodo Fuyuki, Kyoko Inoue and Chocoball Mukai by hitting Gedo in the back of the head with a title belt, allowing Fuyuki to get the easy victory. Fuyuki formed a new version of Fuyuki-gun called Shin Fuyuki-gun (English: New Fuyuki Army) with Mr. Gannosuke, Chocoball Mukai, Kyoko Inoue, Koji Nakagawa, Hideki Hosaka, Yoshinori Sasaki and Shoichi Arai. On June 16, Kintaro Kanemura ended TNR and joined Shin Fuyuki-gun. They would be based on Team No Respect as the top villainous group in FMW and mainly feuded with FMW's top wrestler H. Nakagawa changed his character to \\"GOEMON\\". On May 30, Shin Fuyuki-gun kidnapped Ricky Fuji during an autograph signing and planned to blow him after Kodo Fuyuki and GOEMON's match against H and Hayabusa on June 16. H and Hayabusa won the match and then Mr. Gannosuke took Fuji away to blow him and a dynamite exploded but both wrestlers were away from the explosion. On June 26, Fuyuki, Inoue and Mukai lost the 6-Man Tag Team Championship to H, Hisakatsu Oya and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. H eventually returned as Hayabusa on July 23 and defeated Shin Fuyuki-gun in a gauntlet match to earn a title shot at Fuyuki's WEW World Heavyweight Championship and Fuyuki managed to retain the title. On September 15, Gannosuke, Fuyuki and Shinjuku Shark won the 6-Man Tag Team Championship from Hayabusa, Hisakatsu Oya and Tetsuhiro Kuroda, but lost the title to Jado, Gedo and Kaori Nakayama two days later when Nakayama pinned Fuyuki for the title. Gannosuke became upset at Fuyuki losing the title to a girl. Fuyuki retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Hayabusa while GOEMON began feuding with Onryo. Gannosuke grew tired of FMW's sports entertainment style and attacked Shoichi Arai, forcing Arai to fire him. He became unstable and attacked Tetsuhiro Kuroda and cost him matches leading to Arai reinstating him for a match against Kuroda at Deep Throat pay-per-view, where Onryo defeated GOEMON, Kuroda defeated Gannosuke which stipulated that Gannosuke must retire if he lost and Fuyuki defeated Hayabusa to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Hayabusa was taking time off to heal his injured elbows until Kuroda attacked him. On November 28, Kuroda and Masato Tanaka took on Fuyuki and Kanemura and Jado and Gedo in a three-way match, during which Kuroda turned on Tanaka to join Shin Fuyuki-Gun and the match was turned into a six-man tag team match, with Kuroda, Fuyuki and Kanemura gaining a win over Tanaka, Jado and Gedo. The latter would form a trio called Complete Players. The event also saw Onryo get his second consecutive win on GOEMON. GOEMON and Onryo had a third match together on December 10, which ended in a no contest after GOEMON died during the match and was put into a casket. On December 20, GOEMON quit Shin Fuyuki-Gun by returning as Onryo's mystery partner against Azusa Kudo and Naohiko Yamazaki. On December 23, Fuyuki and Kuroda defeated Tamon Honda and Naomichi Marufuji to win the WEW World Tag Team Championship at Pro Wrestling NOAH's Great Voyage pay-per-view. On January 7, 2001, Kuroda turned on Fuyuki during a title defense against Masato Tanaka and Gedo, allowing Gedo to pin Fuyuki for the title. As a result, Fuyuki turned fan favorite to end Shin Fuyuki-Gun and begin feuding with Kuroda and his new villainous stable Team Kuroda. On April 1, Kuroda defeated Fuyuki to win the World Heavyweight Championship with the help of Mr. Gannosuke.

Often, the fraud involves telling the victim that he or she owes the utility company money and that their power, gas, or water will be shut off immediately unless payment is made.  Background  Each year, according to the Internet Crimes Complaint Center, Americans are scammed out of approximately $239 million. A Harris poll found that around 17.6 million Americans are scammed via the telephone each year. A portion of fraudulent emails and phone calls are utility scams.  How it works  Utility scams are cropping up everywhere nationwide, according to Energy Times. A scammer calls or stops by the residence of a utility customer and claims that the utility company has not received payment for the customer's bill. The scammer demands immediate payment and usually threatens immediate shut-off of electricity, gas, or water if a payment is not made. Customers can have difficulty distinguishing scammers from legitimate utility employees because the scammer can look and sound legitimate. Sometimes, a customers will panic after receiving such a call or in-person visit. The customer finds a quick way to pay, which can include a range of payment types including credit card, Apple iTunes, store gift card, or a money transfer. According to the Star Tribune, \\"Often the caller demands that the customers drive to a store and buy a prepaid debit card to make the payment. Usually there is a strict deadline, often less than an hour to pay.\\" ‚ÄúThis is very much a science,‚Äù said Lisa Jemtrud, of the Better Business Bureau of Minnesota and North Dakota. ‚ÄúWhat works is urgency, that they have to act fast, and also scare tactics.‚Äù Usually, the scammer tries to get a few hundred dollars from the victim. Another type of fraud occurs when a scammer calls a utility customer and offers a rebate if the customer makes a payment or gives out personal information. These are red flags, experts say. Some scam artists can disguise their phone number to make it look as though the real utility company is calling. Some scammers \\"use the legitimate company‚Äôs hold music and typical automated introduction to deceive customers who call them back.\\" Some scammers can mimic what a legitimate utility company employee may sound like. Among the largest targets for this type of fraud are elderly people and people with language barriers. Experts warn people to watch for callers that are aggressive and threaten to shut off utility services within a short period of time, and who often demand payment via a pre-paid credit card. According to a consumer warning by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, \\"Once you wire money or use a prepaid card, your money is gone for good.\\"  Prevalence  Utility companies have reported getting thousands of attempted fraud each year. Duke Energy said that from June 2015 through October 2016, it received customer calls related to 7,497 scam attempts; out of those attempts, 634 customers paid the scammers and lost $631,000 collectively. Between June 2015 and July 2017, there were approximately $1 million in total losses reported by Duke Energy customers among 15,000 scam reports. According to Hiya, a company that makes caller blocking software, \\"We've seen triple digit growth in utility scams in the past year [2016-2017].\\" When winter begins, reported scams increase around 30 percent.  Industry response  Utility companies are trying to stop these types of scams from taking place. A coalition of utilities (including electric, natural gas, and water) across North America started a public campaign called \\"Utilities United Against Scams\\" (UUAS) in 2016. More than 100 utility companies and other groups are part of the coalition. In November each year, the UUAS hosts a \\"Utilities United Against Scams Day.\\" In 2016, the U.S. House of Representatives designated Utility Scam Awareness Day each November. All 1-800 phone numbers must be registered with Somos, a non-profit group. When a utility gets a customer complaint about a possible fraud, the utility can send the 1-800 number used by the scammers to Somos to have the number investigated, and ultimately disconnected. As of September 2017, the UUAS coalition has had Somos cancel between 250 and 300 scammer phone numbers.  Types of utility scams  = The shutoff swindle = In this type of scam, a utility customer receives a phone call from a scammer pretending to be from their utility company. The scammer warns the customer that their service is about to be shut off because of unpaid bills. They typically tell the victim that in order for their water, gas, or power to stay on, the victim must provide an immediate payment using a credit card or prepaid debit card. According to the AARP, people across the country have fallen prey to this type of scam. The AARP warns people that most utilities will mail at least one past due notice before turning off water, gas, or electricity. = The supplier switch = In this swindle, a scammer will call an unsuspecting victim and tell them that they qualify for a discount on their utility bill if they provide their customer account number. After doing so, the scammer switches the customer to a different utility; after a brief introductory period, \\"rates may suddenly skyrocket\\" and victims can find themselves locked in long-term contracts even if they didn't agree to them. \\"Slamming\\" is the illegal practice of changing a customer to another provider without the customer's permission. = Inspection deception = The AARP warns elderly Americans to \\"beware of utility company impostors or independent 'energy auditors' that tend to appear unannounced at your front door.\\" In this type of scam, an imposter or \\"independent energy auditor\\" appears unannounced at the victim's home. They typically offer a free inspection of their thermostat, furnace, or home's energy leakage. The scammers are usually salespeople or \\"home improvement hucksters\\" selling unnecessary expensive products. For example, some scammers will sell a $4,000 solar blanket for the attic \\"that in fact can't live up to its claimed ability to capture the sun's rays through roofing materials.\\" The Consumer Federation of America listed free energy audits as an expanding problem in its top customer complaints list.

Beem, who attained the rank of captain of Company H, 14th Indiana Infantry Regiment, fought in numerous battles in the eastern United States before he mustered out of the Union army in June 1864. After the war Beem resumed his law practice in Spencer and became involved in local banking ventures. He was also active the state's Republican Party and civic affairs. Beem, a graduate of Indiana University, class of 1860, served on Purdue University's board of trustees for eighteen years. He also participated in the Grand Army of the Republic at local and state levels. Beem's papers and letters are preserved in the collections of the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis. The David Enoch Beem House, his former residence in Spencer, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early life and education David Enoch Beem, the son of Levi and Sarah (Johnson) Beem, was born on June 24, 1837, in Spencer, Owen County, Indiana. Levi Beem (1803‚Äì1888), a farmer and a native of Kentucky, came to the Indiana Territory as a boy around 1810. David's grandparents, Daniel and Mary Beem, settled their family in Owen County on land that became the present-day site of Spencer, Indiana. Sarah Beem (1807‚Äì1889) was the daughter of David Johnson, another early settler who came to Spencer in 1818. Levi Beem and Sarah Johnson were married in Spencer in 1825. David, was the sixth of the family's twelve children, two of whom died in infancy. Beem completed his early education in Spencer. In 1856 he entered Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana, and graduated with a degree in law in 1860. Marriage and family Beem married Mahala Joslin (1841‚Äì1929) on April 10, 1862, while home on leave during the American Civil War. She was a daughter of Amasa Joslin, a physician who came to Owen County in 1820, and Mary Ann (Allison) Joslin. David and Mahala Beem had three children: a daughter, Minnie Montrose, and two sons, David Joslin and Levi Amasa.Blanchard, p. 572. The David Enoch Beem House, an Italianate-style residence on a hilltop property in Spencer, was also known as the \\"Beem Mansion\\" and \\"The Hill.\\" Built in 1874, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. See: and accompanying photographs. Career In 1860 Beem established a law practice in his hometown of Spencer, Indiana, where he was also involved in banking ventures. Beem also served for three years as an officer in the 14th Indiana Volunteer Regiment during the American Civil War. In addition to his law practice and business interests, Beem was active in the Grand Army of the Republic and Republican Party at the state and local levels and served on Purdue University's board of trustees. =Early career= Beem was admitted to the bar in 1860 and established a law partnership in Spencer, Indiana, with Samuel H. Buskirk of Bloomington. The following year he began three years of military service as an officer in the Union army. =Military service= In response to a call for troops to serve in the Union army, Beem was the first man to enlist from Owen County and helped raise the county‚Äôs first company of troops. He enlisted on April 19, 1861, as a first sergeant. Beem served in the 14th Indiana Volunteer Regiment, which initially organized for one year of service; however, it was reorganized for a three years of service in May 1861. Beem and his Spencer County company mustered into service as Company H, 14th Indiana Volunteer Regiment, on June 7, 1861, at Camp Vigo, near Terre Haute, Indiana, under the command of Colonel Nathan Kimball.Blanchard, pp. 626‚Äì27. On July 10, 1861, the 14th Indiana arrived at Rich Mountain in Virginia and served as a reserve force in the Battle of Rich Mountain the following day. The 14th Indiana also pursued Confederate troops as far as Cheat Mountain. Beem was promoted to first lieutenant of his company in August 1861. During the winter of 1861‚Äì62, the regiment was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley. On March 23, 1862, Beem was severely wounded in the chin during the first Battle of Kernstown, near Winchester, Virginia. He returned to active duty with the 14th Indiana following a sixty-day leave of absence. Beem was promoted to captain in May 1862. From July 1862 until June 1864, Beem and his regiment fought in battles at Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, Spottsylvania, and Cold Harbor, as well as other campaigns as part of the Union's Army of the Potomac. In August 1863 the 14th Indiana was detached for duty in New York following the New York City draft riots and remained in New York City until September 6, 1863. Beem and the other men of the 14th Indiana who had served three years of service mustered out of service on June 20, 1864 (backdated to June 6, 1864).Sources differ on the backdated discharge date. The more likely one is June 6, 1864, when the 14th Indiana left the front after the Battle of Cold Harbor (June 1‚Äì6, 1864), three years after mustering into service on June 6, 1861. See See also: Capt. David E. Beem, \\"Military History of Owen County,\\" in Beem returned home to Spencer. =Post-war career= After the war, Been resumed his legal career in Spencer as a partner in the firm of Rose and Beem. The firm later dissolved, but Beem continued to practice law in Owen, Green, and Clay counties. In addition, Beem organized the First National Bank of Spencer and became its cashier and acting manager. In 1870 he organized Beem, Peden and Company, a banking firm in Spencer, and managed the business for thirty-nine years. Not all of his business ventures were as successful. Beem and others established a pork-packing operation in Spencer in 1873 that failed. In 1878 Beem formed another law partnership in Spencer named Beem and Hickham. The firm continued for fifteen years before the partnership was dissolved. Afterwards, Beem continued to practice law and remained active in banking. Beem was also active in the Republican Party, but never held public office. Instead, he served as chairman of the Owen County Republican Central Committee during three political campaigns. In 1880 Beem was a delegate from the Fifth Congressional District to the Republican National Convention in Chicago, where James A. Garfield was eventually nominated as the party's presidential candidate. In 1886 Beem was a candidate for state treasurer at the Republican state convention, but he did not win his party's nomination. Beem served as a presidential elector for his Congressional District in 1888 and voted for Benjamin Harrison in the electoral college. In 1893 Beem formed a law partnership with Joseph W. Williams of Owen County and remained active in community affairs.Taylor, p. 665. Been served on the board of trustees of Spencer's public schools for several years and was a member of the Masons. He joined the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1860 and represented the Indiana Conference as a delegate to the Methodist Episcopal Church's conference in New York in 1888. Beem also served for eighteen years on Purdue University's board of trustees. In addition, he held leadership roles in the state and local chapters of the Grand Army of the Republic. Beem was a charter member and the first commander of the GAR's Gettysburg Post at Spencer. In 1894 Beem served as a judge advocate for the GAR's Department of Indiana. Death and legacy Beem died after an extended illness in Spencer, Indiana, on October 23, 1923, at the age of eighty-six. Beem and his wife, Mahala, are buried at Riverside Cemetery in Spencer. A collection of letters that Beem exchanged with his wife, and other family members and friends are preserved at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis. Many of the letters provide details of Beem's military service in the 14th Indiana Volunteer Regiment.

She was the first female Danish chef to win a star. After eight years Klemensen closed the restaurant at the end of 2017. In 2018 the restaurant re-opened under new management. Career Den R√∏de Cottage Anita Klemensen was born in 1977, and grew up in North Jutland County. She wanted to become a chef, so one day offered to work for free at the restaurant S√∏ller√∏d Kro, where she was offered an apprenticeship. She trained under pastry chef Markus Grigogav and head chef Casper Vedel. Klemensen opened the restaurant Den R√∏de Cottage, and the cafe Den Gule Cottage in 2010, at Cottageparken located around ten miles away from Copenhagen. She had previously worked as head chef in central Copenhagen. At Den R√∏de Cottage, Klemensen served New Nordic cuisine. This means that all of the elements served are sourced from in the local area, with a few exceptions which are sourced from elsewhere in Denmark. The restaurant itself is within a forest, which offers a plentiful supply of herbs during warmer months. She kept to a seasonal menu, featuring dishes such as Onions, Onions, Onions which had onions served in four different ways during the winter. She took British chef Rick Stein foraging while he was researching his book Rick Stein's Long Weekends. When she was told that she had won a Michelin star at the restaurant, she did not believe it. The first she heard of it was when a friend telephoned her with congratulations. She knew that the restaurant had been visited on three occasions by the inspectors prior to the 2012 guide, but did not anticipate winning a star. When it was awarded, Klemensen became the first Danish woman to win the accolade. Klemensen wanted to take some time off and closed down Den R√∏de Cottage as well as Den Gule Cottage just before Christmas 2017.
