In 1910, she was jailed and tortured by Sultan Abdelhafid as the wife of El-Bacha Benaïssa, the Governor of Fez and one of the principal aides of his brother Abdelaziz whom he had overthrown in 1908. In 1910, writing for The Times, Walter Harris revealed that Batoul had been imprisoned in a palace cell in Fez. Harris describes the events as follows: > [The sultan] gave orders that the fortune [of the governor of Fez] was to be > found; and thus fresh privations and more floggings ensued, but all to no > avail. Then the women were arrested, amongst them the aristocratic wife of > the Governor of Fez, a lady of good family and high position. It was thought > that she would know, and disclose the hidden treasure. She was tortured, but > disclosed nothing. The torturing consisted of her being chained to irons and hung naked on a wall in the crucifixion position. Under the personal supervision of Abdelhafid, she underwent flogging sessions while her breasts were seized in a vice. The reason for her capture and torture was Abdelhafid's intent to arrest all the aides who had served his brother Abdelaziz. These included Batoul's husband, El-Bacha Benaïssa, one of his closest aides, together with over 20 members of his family. In 2013, the Moroccan historian Maati Monjib discovered documents in the colonial archives in Nantes which revealed that Lalla Batoul was not only an intelligent and cultured aristocrat, she had a well-developed set of connections with Europeans living in Morocco. Her torture in the presence of the sultan demonstrates how the monarchy was ready to repress women who exceeded their assigned roles.

He was also friends with Carson McCullers who used him as inspiration for a character in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. Biography Edwin D. Peacock was born in 1910 in Thomasville, Georgia, the son of a druggist. His mother was born on her family's ante-bellum Greenwood Plantation. After graduating from high school and working for a couple of years for his father, Peacock moved to Columbus, Georgia and worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps. In Columbus he met Carson McCullers, and it was Peacock who encouraged her to write and introduced her future husband James Reeves McCullers Jr.. Peacock is fictionalized as the homosexual deaf-mute, John Singer, in her first novel, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. Peacock met his eventual lifetime partner John Zeigler in July of 1940 at Isle of Palms, South Carolina. Roberta Johnson, a mutual friend of Peacock and Zeigler, was the one to introduce the two. Peacock had been working in Fort Moultrie's finance office when he and Zeigler first met. Shortly after, the pair moved to Tesuque, New Mexico, and then to San Francisco, California in 1941. Zeigler and Peacock decided to enlist together in the Naval Reserve in April of 1942 as apprentice seamen. Their training was started in San Diego, California. Afterwards, both men attended radio school in Boulder, Colorado after volunteering to change to the rating of radioman. Zeigler's was stationed in Yukutat, Alaska while Peacock was stationed in Cape Chiniak, Alaska. In 1946 the partners Edwin Peacock and John Zeigler opened a bookshop \\"The Book Basement\\", in Charleston, on the ground floor of 9 College Way. The Book Basement became a leading independent bookstore, the meeting place for various civil rights groups. Gay men passing through Charleston knew to visit the bookshop, including Maurice Sendak and Langston Hughes, who became friends of the owners. A drawing of the building by Prentiss Taylor was used on advertising events for the store for many years. They closed the bookstore in 1971. Today a plaque in front of the building remembers Peacock and Zeigler. Zeigler published a cycle of memorial poems on their relationship, The Edwin Poems.

Heinicke was a native of Maria Kulm, Bohemia. His wandering years led him via Berlin and Budapest to Venice to Eugenio Degani (1875). However, the effective time at Degani is not documented. Since the construction of his violins clearly show Italian influences but does not allow direct references, some dealers tend to interpret this section of his curriculum vitae as an advertising measure. Heinicke himself used clear indications of this on his opulently designed letterheads and envelopes. Heinicke developed into one of the main representatives of violin makers in Bohemia in the first half of the 20th century. After his return in 1897, he set up his own workshop in Wildstein near Eger. Formal and decisive for his instruments were the old masters Stradivari and Amati, after whose models he made his own violins. Heinicke did an excellent job and his violins achieved, well preserved, prices between 3.000-6.000 EUR. Heinicke died in Skalná, in what is today the Czech Republic.  Violin making  Heinicke often used materials that he could use from old woods from church buildings. This meant that he had access to stored wood, as the tonewoods of the southern Italian Alpine region were not available to him. Although the maple he used was beautiful to look at, it was more noticeable for its beautiful, dense flaming than for its excellent acoustic properties. Heinicke used a double stripe with light stripes in the middle as an ornamental inlay for his violins. These works have not always been carried out with the same care that is known from his violins. In order to improve the colour appearance of his violin wood, he added pink pigments to his yellow shellac. The curvature of the instruments was made by Heinicke according to tonal aspects rather than favours for the eye. However, this promoted the full tone of his instruments. He cut the F-holes almost steeply and precisely. Heinicke's instruments are characterised by a full, warm tone, with a strong presence in the lower range. Characteristic are its narrow screw designs, which he carved in deep engraving. File:Matthias-Heinicke-Violine-Detail-Vergleich-EXIF- Marked.jpgDetailed comparison of the F-holes of a Saxon manufacture violin around 1920 (left) with those of a violin by Mathias Heinicke from 1921 (right) File:Matthias Heinicke Violine.jpgViolin of Matthias Heinicke von 1920 File:Heinicke-violin-letter.jpgEnvelope by Mathias Heinicke for his correspondence around 1931 File:Heinecke-violin-bill.jpgInvoice for the sale of a Heinicke violin from 1931 File:Heinecke-violin-front.jpgTop side of a Heinicken Vioilin from 1931 File:Heinecke-violin-brand.jpgBrand Stamp of Mathias Heinicke as of 1931  Instruments  Some of the violins by Heinicke are still in remarkably good condition on the market today. Nevertheless, their origin can seldom be proven without gaps in order to calculate a value date at the time of creation. However, violin dealer Martin Swan has received the bills and the accompanying letter for a Heinicke violin, which means that the value of the instrument can still be calculated today. The violin from 1931 shown here was sold for 1403 Czech crowns. The exchange rate of the Crown against the Reichsmark was 0.85 in 1932. This results in a price of around 1200 Reichsmark. This corresponded to the cost of living for half a year for a family of three in 1935. Converted to the cost of living 2016, this would result in a price of 20,000 EUR according to today's standard. Heinicke's violins were thus in the upper segment for orchestral musicians, both in 1935 and, adjusted for value adjustments, in 2016.

He always wanted to simplify and engage more people with the Bible. He finished his works in 2000. Due to the lack of technology, Wiedmann was not able to find a printery which had the prerequisites to publish the concertina book. Eventually he stored the Bible in his gallery's attic, including essays about his works, where it fell into oblivion. It was only after his death that his son discovered the four containers. He had all 3,333 images scanned and digitalised. In 2017 the Swiss light show artist Gerry Hofstetter featured the Wiedmann Bible's images during his performances in which he illuminated the Grossmuenster in Zurich and monuments in each US state. Since its discovery in 2013, the original Wiedmann Bible has only been exhibited a few times. In 2015 it premiered in June at the German Evangelical Church Assembly (Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag) in Stuttgart, Germany. From November 27, 2016 through February 5, 2017 it was on display at the Weygang-Museum in Öhringen, Germany. The Wiedmann Bible is showcased in an exhibit at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. from October 27, 2018 through April 28, 2019. In 2017 the Wiedmann Bible already participated in two of the Museum of the Bible's exhibition \\"Our Book\\" in Germany from April 7 through May 13 in Augsburg and from May 22 through September 10 in Wittenberg. Both events were curated by the German linguist and theologian Roland Werner from Marburg and organised in cooperation with local partners. On May 7 a facsimile of the artwork was completely unfolded for the first time at a length of 1517m (almost 1 mile). Occasion for the event was the celebration of the 500th Protestant Reformation anniversary in Magdeburg. At the same time a world record was set. In December 2017 the Wiedmann Bible was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest concertina folder with a size of 645.2 m² (6944 ft² 121 in²). Until August 2018 when the record was broken.

On January 3, Naqeebullah was kidnapped along with two of his friends, Hazrat Ali and Mohammed Qasim, by Rao Anwar's men in plainclothes from Gul Sher Agha Hotel in Sohrab Goth, Karachi. On January 6, both of his friends were freed by the police, but Naqeebullah was kept in captivity, tortured, and then killed on January 13 in a fake encounter in which he was shot twice in the back. Alongside Naqeebullah, three other men namely Muhammad Sabir and Muhammad Ishaq from Bahawalpur and Nazar Jan Mahsud from South Waziristan were also killed by the police in the staged encounter, the latter of whom was shot from a close range. On January 17, Naqeebullah's dead body was handed over to his relatives at the Chhipa Welfare Association morgue in Karachi. On January 18, his body was taken by his relatives to Tank, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Islamic funeral prayer was performed for him, and on the same day, he was buried at his hometown Makin, South Waziristan. The fake encounter sparked countrywide protests against extrajudicial killings in Pakistan. Referring to the killings, the police alleged that they killed four suspected terrorists in a shootout. Rao Anwar claimed that Naqeebullah had links with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Daesh). However, the claims were contested by Naqeebullah's relatives and human rights activists, especially the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (Pashtun Protection Movement), who launched a campaign to seek justice for him. An inquiry committee consisting of senior police officers was formed to investigate the killing, which found Naqeebullah to be innocent, and declared that the alleged police encounter staged to kill him and three others was fake. Naqeebullah was survived by his wife, two daughters, and a son. On January 24, 2019, a Pakistani anti-terrorism court declared Naqeebullah and the three other persons murdered as innocent. Background=Naqeebullah Mehsud= Naqeebullah was born in 1990 in the Makin Subdivision of South Waziristan. He belonged to the Abdullai Mahsud tribe of the Pashtuns. In 2009, his family was forced to flee Waziristan by the Pakistan Army during Operation Rah-e-Nijat. After migrating to Karachi, Naqeebullah had been working as a labourer. He was passionate about modeling and was an aspiring model. He had three brothers, one of whom had settled in Dubai, UAE. Naqeebullah was planning to start a business in garments and had rented a shop in Sohrab Goth, Karachi just before being kidnapped and murdered. =Rao Anwar= Rao Anwar Ahmed, the senior superintendent of police (SSP) led the team staging the fake encounter and was already known for carrying out controversial police encounters in Karachi. He was known as the \\"encounter specialist\\" of the Sindh Police. =Killing of Gul Saeed= On January 16, 2018, when the inquiry against Rao Anwar was about to start following the extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, Rao Anwar claimed that he came under attack in Karachi's Malir Cantonment while he was heading towards his house. He alleged that a suicide attacker detonated explosives near him and his squad but they remained unhurt, and that two accomplices of the attacker then opened fire on the police, both of whom were shot dead in the exchange of fire. He also alleged that a few militants escaped the site under the cover of fire while the police and Pakistan Rangers were conducting search operation. The alleged suicide attacker was later identified as Gul Saeed Afridi, a 34-year-old driver from Orangi Town, Karachi, who had gone missing a few months earlier. Gul Saeed's body was found to be burned badly, but not blown up and still in one piece, although it had allegedly fell far from Rao Anwar's armoured vehicle. Gul Saeed's family was outraged at the demands of the police from them after the killing. They protested and took Gul Saeed's body away from the police by force, but returned it to the mortuary after negotiations. The police placed the three dead bodies at the Chhipa Welfare Association morgue in Karachi. The other two bodies besides Gul Saeed, which were still unidentified, had been riddled with bullets. The Tehrik-i- Taliban Pakistan immediately claimed responsibility of the alleged suicide attack. Gul Saeed's family, however, appealed against Rao Anwar's allegations and claimed that Gul Saeed was innocent and had no links with terrorists. They asked how a suicide attack could even be possible in a sensitive area surrounded by the military like the cantonment, and asserted that Rao Anwar had in fact murdered Gul Saeed extrajudicially. The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) probing the case doubted if a suicide attack had even taken place at the site. Suggesting that it was a fake encounter, a senior CTD officer Omar Khattab said: “This has been observed for the first time that the suicide bomber, despite having himself blown up with explosives, was only burnt. While examining the site of the attack, no traces of any explosive material were found. Even there was no smell of explosives.” The investigators found out that contrary to Rao Anwar's claim, no exchange of fire had taken place. According to the investigators, the alleged suicide attacker Gul Saeed was first riddled by the police with bullets, then a suicide vest was wrapped around his body, and then the vest was set on fire which burned his body. Investigation The inquiry committee of senior police officers probing the case found no sign of an exchange of gunfire at the site of the alleged police encounter, which was an abandoned poultry farm. Although the police officers who had taken part in the alleged shootout claimed that militants were hiding inside the poultry farm who attacked them when the police encircled the hideout, the inquiry committee found out that there was no gunfire from inside the poultry farm during the incident. Some marks of firing were found in a room and on walls of the poultry farm, which the inquiry team declared to be post-incident fabrications by the police team. The committee found out that during his service as a senior police officer in the Malir District of Karachi between 2011 and 2018, Rao Anwar carried out at least 444 killings in 192 alleged encounters, whereas the total number of alleged police encounters led by him was 745, including 553 cases which did not involve any killings. However, not a single policeman was ever killed or even injured during his 745 alleged encounters. Eight people were killed in Rao Anwar's two alleged encounters in the first 19 days of January 2018 alone. Senior police officers in Karachi, on condition of anonymity, claimed that the majority of the people killed during Rao Anwar's encounters were ethnic Pashtuns. They added that men were airlifted to Karachi from as far away as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas for Rao Anwar to deal with them. Another senior police officer stated: “[Rao Anwar] led a team of killing machines. There was no one to stop him.” Explaining why no notice was taken of Rao Anwar's actions earlier, the senior police officer revealed that “even the police command is afraid of him because of his close connections with criminal political bosses and within the security establishment.” A mid-level police officer at the Malir police station, who had worked under Rao Anwar, remarked that money was the motive behind the picking up of Naqeebullah. He said: “Rao’s touts amongst the Sohrab Goth shopkeepers came to know that Naseem [Naqeebullah] was in possession of a hefty amount of money with which he wanted to buy a shop. Two policemen — SI Yaseen Dhukku and ASI Akbar Mallah — picked him up along with two of his friends from a restaurant on Abul Hassan Ispahani road. While they let his friends go, they continued to torture him even after extracting Rs9 million, demanding he pay them Rs20 million more. By then, he was in such bad shape that they decided it would be unwise to set him free.” The inquiry committee termed the allegations by Rao Anwar against Naqeebullah as baseless and suggested to add Rao Anwar's name to the Exit Control List. They stated that the claims made by Rao Anwar, including the claim that Naqeebullah was unmarried, were untrue. The committee concluded that Naqeebullah was innocent and had no history of militancy or criminal activity, but was rather killed in a fake police encounter carried out by Rao Anwar. The four men including Naqeebullah were killed in two separate rooms of the abandoned farm by Rao Anwar's team and then their bodies were dumped in a single room. On January 20, 2018, Rao Anwar was removed from his post as senior superintendent of police (SSP) Malir on the recommendation of the committee. On January 23, Rao Anwar attempted to flee the country in a Dubai-bound flight from Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Islamabad, but the Federal Investigation Agency foiled his attempt and stopped him at the immigration counter of the airport after observing that his No Objection Certificate was inauthentic. Pashtun Tahafuz Movement The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), under the leadership of Manzoor Pashteen, launched a campaign to seek justice for Naqeebullah Mehsud soon after his murder. PTM organized a series of protest marches and sit-ins at various cities. They held public gatherings in Islamabad, Quetta, Peshawar, Lahore, Swat, Karachi, Dera Ismail Khan, Swabi,Pashteen vows to continue struggle for Pakhtun rights. Dawn. August 13, 2018.

He is known as the \\"encounter specialist\\" of the Sindh Police because of his extrajudicial encounter killings. He carried out at least 444 killings in alleged encounters between 2011 and 2018. After the killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, Anwar was suspended from his post on January 20, 2018. On December 10, 2019, Anwar was blacklisted by the United States Department of the Treasury for his atrocities during his tenure, including the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud.  Career  Anwar was initially recruited as assistant sub-inspector of police (ASI) in 1982 after working as a clerk for a year. From 1992 to 1999, Anwar played a main role in the operations against the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) in Karachi, in which many MQM members were either arrested or killed. When MQM came into power in 2002 during the Pervez Musharraf government, Anwar disappeared from Karachi. When the Pakistan Peoples Party came into power in 2008, Anwar returned to Karachi. He was promoted from inspector to deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Kiamari and then to superintendent of police (SP) Gadap within a short space of time in 2008. He was considered close to the former President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari. Anwar became senior superintendent of police (SSP) Malir in 2011. In 2012, he was demoted to the sub-inspector rank by a Supreme Court order but the President Asif Ali Zardari reinstated him as SSP Malir using his executive powers. In 2013, Anwar was temporarily suspended by the Supreme Court following the deadly Abbas Town bombing. In 2015, he was briefly suspended for \\"misusing authority\\" because of his controversial press conference, in which he alleged that MQM sent its workers to India to get them trained by the Indian intelligence agency RAW for spreading terror in Pakistan. The MQM activist Tahir Lamba, who had been arrested by Anwar before the press conference and accused of being a RAW agent, was released by the court later due to lack of evidence. In September 2016, Anwar was suspended for raiding the house of the MQM leader Khawaja Izharul Hassan and detaining him without the permission of the Sindh Assembly speaker. Anwar challenged the suspension order in court and was reinstated a few weeks later. On 13 January 2018, Anwar led a police operation that led to Naqeebullah Mehsud and three others being shot dead in Shah Latif town. Anwar said they were members of the Tehrik-i- Taliban Pakistan. On 19 January, Anwar appeared before a departmental inquiry committee to give a statement. He claimed one member of the committee was biased and forced police personnel to record false statements about him. On 20 January, the committee declared that Mehsud was innocent and had been wrongfully killed and Anwar was dismissed from the police. On 22 January, Anwar refused to appear before the committee for a second time, calling the inquiry ‘one-sided’. He claimed he was neither responsible for the investigation nor the capture of Mehsud. Anwar tried to flee Pakistan via Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad on 23 January. His name was added to the Exit Control List and a First Information Report was lodged against him. Anwar demanded the formation of a ‘Joint Investigative Team’ from intelligence agencies and called the case against him ‘baseless’. On 27 January, the Supreme Court issued a three-day deadline to the Sindh Police Department for Anwar's arrest, saying cell-phone positioning evidence confirmed Anwar's presence at the site of the encounter killing. On 31 January, Anwar refuted reports he had left the country after police so far failed to arrest him. On 3 March, his accounts at the State Bank of Pakistan were frozen on the orders of the Supreme Court, which made the judgement in a 16 February hearing for contempt of court. On 17 February, Asif Ali Zardari, former President of Pakistan, voiced support for Anwar calling him a ‘brave child’ for surviving the fight against the Muttahida Qaumi Movement. Zardari later said he ‘misspoke’. On 21 March 2018, he was arrested after appearing before the Supreme Court. Anwar took retirement on 1 January 2019 while facing trial under suspension. Apart from his controversial police encounters, Anwar has also been notorious for being involved in land grabbing and gravel and sand mining in the Malir and Gadap areas of Karachi.  Personal life  Anwar has three wives and nine children. His family lives in Punjab within Pakistan, but they visit Islamabad sometimes, especially during vacations. He had made 74 trips to london since his appointment as SSP Malir until his removal from the job, that is about one trip per a month on average.

She showed promise as a two-year-old in 1928 when she won her only race by a wide margin. In the following year she won two races including a very impressive victory in the Epsom Oaks. She failed when made favourite for the St Leger and was retired from racing after sustaining a serious leg injury in autumn. She became a very successful broodmare, producing several major winners. Background Pennycomequick was a brown mare \\"of great power and quality\\" bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. She was sent into training at Manton, Wiltshire with Joseph Lawson who had inherited the stable from Alec Taylor, Jr. in 1927. She was from the eighth crop of foals sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making her a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Apart from Pennycomequick, Hurry On sired numerous major winners including Captain Cuttle, Coronach, Call Boy and Precipitation. Pennycomequick's dam Plymstock was a daughter of the Oaks winner Winkipop and a half-sister to Blink who finished second in the Derby. Like her dam, Pennycomequick was named after a suburb of Plymouth, for which Lord Astor's wife Nancy Astor was the Member of Parliament. Racing career=1928: two-year-old season= On her only appearance as a two-year- old, Pennycomequick defeated seventeen opponents to win the Dalham Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. =1929: three-year-old season= Pennycomequick was entered for the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket but was not among the placed finishers. She then won the Haverhill Stakes over nine furlongs at the same course. On 5 June Pennycomequick started the 11/10 favourite in a field of thirteen runners for the 151st running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. On the way to the start she unseated her Belgian jockey Henri Jelliss but then stood \\"stock still\\" and allowed her rider to remount. She tracked the leaders as Golden Silence set the pace, before moving into the lead approaching the final turn and quickly drew away from her rivals and won \\"with great ease\\" by five lengths from Golden Silence, with Sister Anne two lengths back in third. Jelliss eplained that he had briefly shown the winner whip as at the filly appeared to think that the race was over and wanted to stop. Her winning time of 2:35.8 was 0.6 seconds faster than that recorded by Trigo in winning the Epsom Derby over the same course and distance. The filly was then dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot but ran poorly in a race won by Daumont. In September Pennycomequick was matched against male opposition and started 3/1 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse. She moved up to join the leaders in the straight but faded in the last quarter mile and finished sixth of the nineteen runners behind Trigo. Jellis commented \\"I thought we would win but... I felt the filly just \\"dying\\" in my hands. It looks as if she just does not stay as well as we thought\\". It was announced shortly after the race that the filly had suffered a split pastern and would be retired from racing. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pennycomequick an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. She is repeatedly alluded to in Monica Dickens' 'World's End' series of children's books. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Pennycomequick was retired tobecome a broodmare for Lord Astor's stud. She produced at least nine foals and seven winners between 1931 and 1943: *Adept, a bay colt, foaled in 1931, sired by Gainsborough. Winner. *Bookseller, bay colt (later gelded), 1933, by Buchan.

The experimental drug, developed by ADC Therapeutics is being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of B-cell Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Technology  The human monoclonal antibody is conjugated via a cleavable linker to a cytotoxic (anticancer) pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer. The antibody binds to CD25, which is the alpha chain of the interleukin 2 receptor IL2RA. This molecule is expressed mainly on activated T- and B-cells, both of which are types of white blood cells that play a role in the human immune system. CD25 is over-expressed in a wide range of hematological malignancies, such as leukemias and lymphomas. After binding to a CD25-expressing cell, the antibody is internalized into the cell where enzymes release the cytotoxic drug. PBD dimers work by crosslinking specific sites of the DNA, blocking the cancer cells’ division that cause the cells to die. As a class of DNA- crosslinking agents they are significantly more potent than systemic chemotherapeutic drugs. Clinical trials  Two phase I trials are evaluating the drug in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and relapsed or refractory CD25-positive acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At the 59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, interim results from a Phase I, open-label, single agent dose- escalating study designed to evaluate the treatment of camidanlumab tesirine in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma were presented.

It was built in 1271 CE (670 AH) by the Marinid Sultan Abu Ya'qub Yusuf and was the first of many madrasas built by the Marinid dynasty during their reign. It is located just south of the 9th-century Qarawiyyin Mosque on Saffarin Square (or Place Seffarine), which is named after the coppersmiths () who work in the square.  History = Role of madrasas in Fez = Madrasas were a type of institution which originated in northeastern Iran by the early 11th century and was progressively adopted further west. These establishments served to train Islamic scholars, particularly in Islamic law and jurisprudence (fiqh). The madrasa in the Sunni world was generally antithetical to more \\"heterodox\\" religious doctrines, including the doctrine espoused by the Almohad dynasty. As such, it only took hold in Morocco under the Marinid dynasty which succeeded the Almohads. To the Marinids, madrasas played a part in bolstering the political legitimacy of their dynasty. They used this patronage to encourage the loyalty of Fes's influential but fiercely independent religious elites and also to portray themselves to the general population as protectors and promoters of orthodox Sunni Islam. The madrasas also served to train the scholars and elites who operated their state's bureaucracy. The Saffarin Madrasa, along with other nearby madrasas like the al-Attarine and the Mesbahiyya, was built in close proximity to the al- Qarawiyyin, the main center of learning in Fes and historically the most important intellectual center of Morocco. The madrasas played a supporting role to the Qarawiyyin; unlike the mosque, they provided accommodations for students, particularly those coming from outside of Fes. Many of these students were poor, seeking sufficient education to gain a higher position in their home towns, and the madrasas provided them with basic necessities such as lodging and bread. However, the madrasas were also teaching institutions in their own right and offered their own courses, with some Islamic scholars making their reputation by teaching at certain madrasas. They also served as centers of their communities and hosted ceremonies.Saffarin Madrasa. Archnet. Retrieved January 23, 2018. = History of the Saffarin Madrasa = View of Saffarin Square in front of the madrasa The Saffarin Madrasa was the first one of its kind to be built by the Marinids. It was completed in 1271 by commission of Sultan Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, who was also notable for his creation of Fes el-Jdid (the new citadel of Fez and capital of Morocco). Modern scholars view its layout and design as an early and not yet refined model of Marinid madrasas, which would be subsequently perfected in the madrasas of the early 14th century. Over the centuries, the madrasas in the area around the al-Qarawiyyin also became known for each housing students from particular regions of Morocco. Those staying at the Saffarin Madrasa were generally from nearby Zerhoun, from the northern region of Beni Zerwal, and from the southern region of Sous. In the 18th century the Mohammadia Madrasa was built next the Saffarin Madrasa as an annex to house more students. It covers an area of 752 square meters and also features two levels of rooms centered around a long courtyard. In the 1930s and 1940s the Place Seffarin and many surrounding buildings were renovated. The adjoining Mohammadia Madrasa is also renovated and expanded on the initiative of Mohammed V between 1935 and 1942. By the late 20th century the madrasa was in a relatively dilapidated state and had lost much of its decoration, though it underwent some restoration in the 1960s. On the initiative of King Mohammed VI, it recently underwent a major restoration which was completed in 2016-2017 at the cost 8 million dirhams. The madrasa is still in use (both before and after the restoration) as housing for the students of the al-Qarawiyyin University.مدرسة الصفارين.. أول مدرسة بنتها الدولة المريني. Maghress. Retrieved January 23, 2018. Architecture A skyline view of the madrasa (before its most recent restoration): the green pyramidal roof on the right belongs to the prayer hall, while the small minaret is visble to the left. = Layout = The madrasa is entered via a bent passage which leads directly to a large rectangular main courtyard (sahn), at the center of which is a large rectangular water basin. Around this courtyard are a multitude of rooms which serve as sleeping quarters for the students, distributed across two stories. On the courtyard's eastern side, opposite the entrance, is a large high room which acted as a prayer hall (like a small mosque or oratory). The room is covered by a pyramidal roof and contains a mihrab (niche symbolizing the qibla or direction of prayer). However, because the alignment of the madrasa's street facade is different from the orientation of the qibla, the prayer hall is not aligned with the rest of the courtyard and stands at an angle to it. On the north side of the prayer hall (and following the same orientation), and reached via a long corridor from the corner of the main courtyard, is the madrasa's ablutions house (). It consists of a smaller courtyard with a central water basin, around which are many small rooms containing latrines. Lastly, a small brick minaret stands next to the entrance. = Decoration = The madrasa has lost most of its decoration, but parts of it have survived, especially in the prayer hall. These remains indicate that the madrasa once had carved stucco decoration around much of this room and the main courtyard, along with painted wood ceilings and zellij tilework. The small minaret is decorated with blind horseshoe arches around its windows and a band of simple polychrome ceramic tiles around its top, while its eastern facade is covered with a darj-wa-ktaf or interlacing arch motif. = Comparison with later madrasa architecture = The madrasa presents some early features which reappeared in later Moroccan madrasas but is also different from the others in important respects due to it being one of the Marinid architects' earliest attempts to conceive of a purpose-built madrasa building (which did not yet have precedents in Morocco). Both the bent entrance and the central courtyard with a water basin were common features of later madrasas. However, the awkward arrangement of the prayer hall and other elements of the floor plan, as well as the fact that the sleeping quarters of the students opened directly onto the courtyard on the ground floor, are all aspects which were revised and not repeated in the design of later madrasas. The presence of a minaret was also not a feature of other madrasas (with the exception of the Bou Inania Madrasa which had the special status of a Friday mosque) seeing as the prayer hall of a madrasa was reserved for its students and was not open to the public like a full mosque.

He represented the rural constituency of Cognac, and often supported the distillers in parliament. Although he supported democracy, he was in favour of plebiscites and opposed the republicans of the French Third Republic for most of his career. He took every opportunity to speak out against the government in the chamber of deputies. At one point an article he had written led to a duel with another deputy. Early years Gustave Cunéo d'Ornano was born on 15 November 1845 in Rome. His grandfather was a former comrade-in-arms of Napoleon who remained attached to the Bonaparte family. His parents were François Joseph Antoine Cunéo d'Ornano (1798–1863), former officer and prefecture councilor, and Adélaïde Françoise Dyonnet. He attended the Collège Stanislas de Paris, run by the Marianists, as did the Royalist pretender and his main spokesman in the Chamber of Deputies, Fernand de Ramel(fr). He studied law and received a license. During the Second French Empire he was employed by the Prefecture of the Seine. During the Siege of Paris (1870–71) he served in Paris as a lieutenant in a battalion of Garde Mobile. He then joined the army of the Versailles government, and helped suppress the Paris Commune. Journalist Cover of Le peuple et l'empereur Cunéo (1875) In 1872 Cuneo d'Ornano became one of the editors of the Courrier de France. From 1873 to 1874 he edited the Charentais in Angoulême. After contributing to la Presse for a short period, he returned to Charente and founded a Bonapartist newspaper, the Suffrage universel des Charentes, and became known for his extremely lively polemics. In 1876, in Bassac, Charente, he married Marie-Léontine-Claire-Sara Plantevigne-Dubosquet. They had one son, born in 1883, who was held on the baptismal font by Victor, Prince Napoléon. Politician Cunéo d'Ornano had a combative personality and great powers as a speaker and a journalist. He was not interested in the return of the Empire so much as in a plebiscitary republic modelled on the French Consulate of 1799–1804 with universal suffrage and an elected president. He was a determined opponent of the parliamentary system of the Third Republic. Despite being an outsider born far away, and despite being a conservative Bonapartist intellectual, he won great affection from the common people of the Charente countryside and was elected tens times in a row by the voters of the Cognac district. Cunéo d'Ornano was one of the most prominent leaders of the Bonapartist party in Charente during the 1876 legislative elections. He engaged in noisy demonstrations against the republican government, and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Cognac district of Charente in the second round of voting. There were many protests against the election, which was invalidated by the House on 5 April 1876 due to defamatory posters and attacks on the constitution. He was reelected with an improved majority on 21 May 1876. He sat with the Appel au peuple parliamentary group, consistently voted with the monarchical minority and often intervened in debates. In 1876, as a result of an article published in his le Suffrage universel, Cunéo d'Ornano fought a duel with André Duclaud(fr), a republican deputy in Charente. Cunéo d'Ornano supported the act of 16 May 1877 and supported the policy of the Broglie-Fourtou government. As official candidate in the 14 October 1877 elections he famously stated in his profession of faith that he would make \\"the republic and the republicans a meal that even dogs would not eat.\\" He was elected by 9,911 votes to 7,704 for the republican candidate. In the Chamber he continued his opposition and interruptions in debates, and was often called to order. He voted against the election of Jules Grévy as President of France, against the law on freedom of the press, and constantly fought for the appel au peuple (referendum). On 8 December 1878 he attacked the persecution of La Jeune Garde by the government, saying, \\"there is no liberty if it does not exist equally for everyone\\". He said the republican government allowed shameful caricatures against religion and past regimes, but banned drawings that targeted republican officials. Cunéo d'Ornano was reelected on 21 August 1881 by 8,621 votes against 8,132 votes for the republican candidate. He voted against the abrogation of the Concordat of 1801, against the cabinet of Jules Ferry and against the Tonkin credits. On 24 May 1881 he spoke out in the debate over the Treaty of Bardo that established a French protectorate over Tunisia. He stated that the government, in fighting a small war without being authorized by parliament, had violated Article 9 of the constitution which was designed to prevent such authoritarian action. The government had lied about its intent to annex the country even after the annexation has become a fact. In February 1883 Cunéo d'Ornano fought Charles Floquet's proposals to exile the members of former ruling families from French territory, and appealed against the arrest of Jérôme Napoléon. That year he tried without success to introduce an amendment to the constitution to allow plebiscites. He was reelected on 4 October 1885 for Charente on the conservative list. Once again he took every opportunity in the House to state his opposition to the government. Towards the end of the legislature he voted against reinstatement of the district poll, for indefinite postponement of revision to the constitution, against prosecution of three members of the Ligue des Patriotes, against the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and against the prosecution of General Boulanger. Cunéo d'Ornano from Nos Députés (1894) By the time of the elections of 22 September 1889 Cuneo d'Ornano had become less extreme and said he no longer wished to overthrow the republic as long as it became democratic and submitted to a national plebiscite. He ran as a \\"Bonapartist and Revisionist\\" for his former district of Cognac and was reelected by 8,811 votes to 7,705 for the republican candidate. He again sat with the partisans of the Appel au peuple. On the subject of alcohol he often defended the liberty of the distillers and fought against the surtax on alcohol and controls on its sale. He was reelected in the first round on 20 August 1893. In the new legislature he submitted many proposals in favour of the distilleries. After the publication on 13 January 1898 of Émile Zola's open letter J'accuse…! attacking antisemites during the Dreyfus affair, Cunéo d'Ornano was one of a long list of Nationalist leaders who signed an appeal posted on the walls of Paris that urged the people to take to the streets to show their support for the army and opposition to the Jewish syndicate that was trying to undermine it. He was reelected in the first round on 8 May 1898 and on 27 April 1902. He was elected for the last time on 6 May 1906. Gustave Cunéo d'Ornano died of a stroke in Paris on 17 May 1906 before taking his seat in the new legislature. Publications Cunéo d'Ornano made numerous speeches, proposals and reports as a deputy.

The madrasa is located inside Fes el Bali, the old medina quarter of the city. The madrasa dates back to the 14th century during the golden age of Fez under Marinid rule. The madrasa is located near Al Andalus Mosque and is also connected to another, smaller, madrasa built at the same time, the Sba'iyyin Madrasa. History View towards the prayer hall and the mihrab. = Historical background and function = The madrasa was commissioned in 1321 by Abu al-Hassan, who was at that time a prince and heir apparent to his father, Sultan Abu Sa'id Uthman II. Abu al-Hassan went on to become sultan in 1331 and became a prolific patron of mosques and madrasas in Fes.مدرسة الصهريج.. من أجمل المعالم التاريخية المرينية. Maghress. Retrieved January 23, 2018. He reportedly built this madrasa in honour of his father.Kubisch, Natascha (2011). \\"Maghreb - Architecture\\" in Hattstein, Markus and Delius, Peter (eds.) Islam: Art and Architecture. h.f.ullmann. p. 312. The building was completed by 1328. The madrasa was initially known as Madrasa al- Kubra (the \\"Greater Madrasa\\") because it was larger than the other madrasas of the same era. It also marked a significant evolution in the richness of its decoration, and features some of the earliest zellij (mosaic tilework) to be found in any Moroccan madrasa. It was reported that the madrasa's construction had cost 100,000 gold pieces. Later it came to be known as the Madrasa as- Sahrij for the iconic sahrij (water basin) in the center of its courtyard (sahn). Abu al-Hassan also built another smaller madrasa adjoining it, commissioned in 1323 and initially known as the Madrasa es-Sughra (the \\"Lesser/Smaller Madrasa\\"). That madrasa later came to be known as the Madrasa as-Sba'iyyin (roughly: \\"Madrasa of those who teach the Seven Recitations of the Qur'an\\"), the name it still has today, presumably due to the madrasa's specialization in this subject. Together, these two madrasas provided both lodging and teaching for students studying at the nearby Andalus Mosque, much as the Seffarine and al-Attarine Madrasas served students at the al-Qarawiyyin Mosque across the river. The madrasas were also accompanied by another funduq or hospice, but it has since disappeared. The madrasa was assigned a fqih (judge and expert in Islamic jurisprudence) and a number of other positions such as lecturers and Qur'an reciters, all of whom were provided with accommodations and salaries. The madrasa's upkeep and operations were funded in large part by charitable endowments designated under a habous or waqf (a trust under Islamic law). In addition to its function as an educational institution, Marinid madrasas like this one could also serve as centers of community life, functioning as a mosque, guesthouse, and venue for local ceremonies.Carved wood and left = Restorations = The madrasa was restored multiple times, including during the Saadian period (16th-early 17th century) and again between 1917 and 1924 by the Service des Beaux-Arts under the French Protectorate. The madrasa complex eventually fell into neglect. There were initial efforts to repair and protect it in the 2000s, including from the World Monuments Fund, but the madrasa suffered from further vandalism, including serious damage done to the adjoining Sba'iyyin Madrasa in 2009 due to looting. The two madrasas were more recently restored by the local heritage agency ADER-Fès and reopened in 2017, as part of a wider program of rehabilitation for Fes el-Bali which started in 2013.  Architecture  Detail of wood-carved inscriptions and other motifs. The madrasa covers 478 square meters. The structure follows the prevalent pattern of the Marinid-era madrasas, with a rectangular sahn (courtyard) surrounded by galleries which led to accommodations for the students on either side. Sleeping quarters for the students also existed on the second floor and numbered 26 in total. On the south side of the courtyard, across from the main entrance, was a prayer hall with a mihrab. The foundation plaque and inscription of the building is located in this room. The sahn is richly ornamented by zellij tiles, carved wood, and carved stucco, in a style shared with Nasrid architecture of the same era such as that of the Alhambra palaces. A passage between the sahn and the street entrance gives access to the stairs to the upper level and then to another, slightly smaller, courtyard to the west which contains the latrines.

Her parents quickly become despondent as money begins to run short, but Sarah resourcefully begins selling her award-winning bread to neighbors and eventually acquires a store front, all the while dealing with bullies and hobos as well as other setbacks such as a tornado. Reception The Bread Winner was selected as a \\"Notable 1990 Children's Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies\\" by the National Council for the Social Studies and Children's Book Council. Critical reception for the book was mostly positive. Zena Sutherland from The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books felt that the novel \\"gives a convincing picture of the way residents of a small town help each other.\\" She added that the \\"characterization is sturdy, the structure modest but satisfying, and the writing has a smooth narrative flow.\\" Susan F. Marcus, writing for the School Library Journal, thought that the \\"Depression and its people come alive in this touching and well-crafted novel.\\" Publishers Weekly stated that the protagonist is \\"a little too good to be true\\" and the \\"setbacks Whitmore throws in are almost formulaic\\". However, they thought that her \\"reactions to her parents' despair are both convincing and moving, and it's impossible not to admire her never-say-die attitude.\\" Kirkus Reviews felt that the novel was oversimplified, contained stilted dialogue, lack of development and unlikely events. They said that despite this, \\"Sarah is a strong female protagonist and the well-structured story fast paced, while Whitmore's evocation of the period allows readers to share the desperation of hard-working, decent people.\\" References 1990 American novels Great Depression novels American children's novels 1990 children's books ","title":"The Bread Winner"},{"id":"56385395","text":"Below are the squads for the 2017 Bandy World Championship final tournament in Sweden.

The complex is distinguishable from highly ornamented facades facing the street, and a minaret in turquoise color.Sidi Ahmed al-Tijani Zawiya. Archnet. Retrieved January 23, 2018. Description Interior of the zawiya and the mausoleum The construction was initiated by Al-Tijani. He and his companions looked for the suitable place for building their institution in Fez and visited several mosques for considerations. Eventually, they picked the spot in the Al-Blida neighborhood, back then known as Al-Dardas. There was already a zawiya built in the place by a man known as Sidi al-Lahbi. Al-Tijani purchased the land by his own money which was considered halal. He also received the financial support by the emir Moulay Slimane. After Al-Tijani's death he was buried in the site. The zawiya was not allowed for stranger to visit as they required trust of members of the community. It also explicitly prohibits the burial of any other persons. The companions had bought a marble and inscribed the quote by Al-Tijani on it, which reportedly said anybody who’s buried in the site will go to hell. The marble is located in the center arena in front of the old entrance. The building was renovated several times, with varying levels of additions to its feature. In 1881, a new mihrab was added. In 1895, a new saqayya (Arabic public fountain) and entrance gate were built. In 1901 some new decorations and inscriptions were added to the wall in front of the tomb. In 1903, a place for ziyarat was built. In order to visit the zawiya (usually for a ziyarat), it is required to contact the members of Tijaniyya tariqa which will eventually be notified to the supervisor of the institution. Once the contact is made, visitors will meet the members in front of the zawiya and required to recite some verses to honor the Sheikh before entrance.

During 1968 the attempts to identify nucleocidin were made and at that time it was assigned to a structure of a 9-adenyl-4' -sulfamoyloxypentofuranoside, which was mainly based on experiments from pmr and mass spectroscopy, as well as testing in chemical reactions. It was ultimately proven to have a structure of a 4' -fluoro-5' -O-sulphamoyladenosine. Nucleocidin is an antibiotic that can be produced from Streptomyces calvus that grows on Indian land.

Richards studied mathematics and physics for his bachelor's degree. For his master's degree, he worked under the supervision of Alan Turing (1912–1954) at Manchester as one of Turing's last students, helping to validate Turing’s theory of morphogenesis. Reflecting on Turing's death at the age of 80 during Turing's centenary year in 2012, Richards commented: \\"The day he died felt like driving through a tunnel and the lights being switched off\\". After Turing died, Richards changed his research area and worked for his doctorate, studying an aspect of optics, resulting in a Royal Society paper with his supervisor, Professor Emil Wolf. This provided a detailed description of the diffraction of light through a convex lens. After this, Richards moved into the area of medicine, producing an important paper on hormone peaks in the menstrual cycle. Later he worked on expert systems aimed at use in open heart surgery and also intensive care units. Richards became Professor of Medical Informatics at Manchester University and latterly Emeritus Professor within the School of Computer Science. Richards has been Chairman of the BCS Health Informatics Committee and in 1998 was made BCS Fellow of the Year for Services to Medical Informatics. He was the first President of the Institute for Health Record and Information Management (IHRIM), a member of the International Federation of Records Officers (IFRO).

Her correspondence with her husband's family survives and provided insights on the life for an officer's wife who was separated from her husband for a long time, while he was overseas on colonial business. Maria was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, c. 1760. She married David Collins, an English marine officer, in 1777 in Halifax. She gave birth to a daughter in 1778 who died in infancy. Although born to one of the most prominent Nova Scotia families, Maria was in great financial distress after her husband's death in 1810, and petitioned the UK government for a number of years before being awarded a pension. She died in Stonehouse, near Plymouth, Devon, Great Britain in about 1830.  Early life  Maria Stuart Proctor (sometimes spelt Procter) was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of Charles Proctor and his wife Margaret. Her father was a merchant, ship owner and prominent political figure in Nova Scotia. He had served as Justice of the Peace, Commissioner of the Highways, member of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia, warden of St Paul's Church, trustee of the Commons at Halifax, lieutenant colonel in the Halifax Militia and Provost Marshal. As such, Maria had been brought up to \\"the prospect of a very large fortune.\\" Maria was the youngest of seven children, a \\"lively girl, well educated and delicately brought up.\\" She grew up in the North Suburbs of Halifax. She met David Collins, an officer in the Royal Marines, when he was stationed in Halifax after the Battle of Bunker Hill. They married on 3 June 1777 by the Reverend John Breynton at the church of St. Paul, Halifax. Collins was the grandson of Arthur Collins, an English antiquarian who was best known for his work, Peerage of England.  Marriage to David Collins  Following their marriage, the couple moved to Chatham in the UK in 1777, where they lived for the first few years of their marriage in the Naval barracks at Chatham. On 8 April 1778, the couple baptised their daughter Henrietta Susanna at Rochester, Kent. Unfortunately their daughter did not survive infancy and was buried on 17 September 1780 in Chatham, Maria began to suffer from ill-health and did not have any more children. Promotions for David followed. He became captain-lieutenant in August 1779 and captain in July 1780. In 1781 he joined HMS Courageux in the Channel Squadron. But, with the end of the Revolutionary War, in 1783 David was placed on half-pay and the couple moved to Rochester. In order to maintain a lifestyle worthy of his rank and status, David borrowed money. With the prospect of a long peace, his father, Major-General Arthur Tooker Collins (1718-1793) encouraged David to accept an appointment as Deputy Judge Advocate of the new colony to be established in Botany Bay. Maria faced a long separation from her husband. She was not permitted to travel with him, as he was an officer, but it is unlikely she would have made the journey because there would have been no society of \\"civilised' women in the early days of the colony and because of her ill health. She had a general debility, was asthmatic and would suffer from epilepsy in later years. While David was away, she spent time in London and was a guest of relations and members of the gentry and military. David's younger brother George had married Mary Trelawny, an heiress, and lived at Ham House in Devon. Maria often visited them. She wrote letters to David which survive in the Mitchell Library. In these she updates him on family and political news but also voices her concerns that the expedition to Botany Bay has been forgotten and that \\"never was anything of the kind undertaken that seemed so little to interest the publick.\\" She supplied David with necessaries, sending out clothes, newspapers and Edmund Burke's pamphlet on HMS Gorgon, but urged him \\"to come home my dearest love and resume your place in the world and no longer be buried in oblivion.\\" In October 1793, Maria wrote to tell him that his father had died and the financial effects this had had on his family and his mother who was now forced to take lodgings in Plymouth. They were apart for ten years. In New South Wales, David had lived with Ann Yeats, a convict, and had fathered two children, Marianne and George. Maria knew about this relationship and the children and stated in a letter to David, that she had received a visitor who \\"is ignorant of your unholy connection, as I know enough of him and his lady to think he would introduce you to her, or she receive you, as they are people of strict principle.\\" David returned to England in 1797 and found Maria \\"ill and weakened beyond anything [he] could have imagined.\\" The couple moved to London, living at 19 Charing Cross and 6 Poland Street, which were respectable but not prime addresses. On his return to England, David struggled to advance or obtain any appointments. His financial affairs were not in good order and this led to disappointment and an anxious time for Maria. She described his situation as \\"her poor luckless David's affairs.\\" She noted that their temperaments were different. \\"He enjoys the little good which is left without anticipating future evil while I, whose temper was wont to be so cheerful, am equally out of humour with the past, present and future. In short he gathers roses from thorns and I, afraid of meeting a thorn therefore avoid the rose.\\" In 1803, David returned to Australia, accepting a position of Lieutenant-Governor and to set up a new settlement at Sullivans Cove as a harbour for Hobart Town. Maria did not travel with him, remaining in London with her now frail and old mother. Her sister, who had married the Irishman General Thomas de la Cour Desbrisay, died in 1798 in Charlottetown, Canada and Maria, worried about her health in 1804, asked her husband to support her mother. He agreed and instructed his bankers to support her mother in the amount of £150 per annum if anything happened to Maria. In 1807 Maria wrote to David and told him she was intended to join him in Hobart, but she did not do so. David died suddenly in 1810 while Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania. His death left Maria in a tenuous financial situation.  Literary career = Novels = Maria wrote novels to provide an income while David was away. These were written either under a pseudonym or anonymously at a time when women did not openly write novels. According to a Trelawny descendant, \\"Many of Maria's novels were still in the family library at Ham [House, Plymouth] in 1900, but their titles have not been recorded and the books apparently destroyed during World War II.\\"see note 5 to p136 on p334 of Currey = An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales = This account was published in London in two volumes, Volume 1 in 1798 and Volume 2 in 1802. These volumes were written by David Collins with Maria's help. It covers the colony from its first settlement in 1788 to August 1801. She was sceptical that the Account would be a commercial success, writing to him in 1797/98 that \\"Those who published before the [expedition to Botany Bay] was new did not succeed, it is very unlikely you should now it is forgot but you are surely right to do the best you can.\\" Collins Papers, The Mitchell Library Later she would write that her husband \\"was compelled to employ his hours in literary labour to procure a subsistence.\\" The book however, sold well and is of prime historical significance. In 1803, Maria took on the task of preparing the second edition. The form was to be such which \\"without lessening the interest of the word, might render it less expensive to the reader.\\".See Preface to second edition of An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales She therefore abridged the 2 volumes and condensing them into one, reducing some 950 printed quarto pages to 562. \\"She slashed her way through the thickets of her husband's prose to breathe life into it ... So skilful and effective were her cuts, that many considered her text a distinct improvement on the original.\\" Maria completed the task in 1804. She wrote the preface to the second edition, stating that her husband had started work on the Abridgement when \\"an appointment from his Sovereign called him to fulfil its duties in a distant country. Thus situated, he prevailed on me to undertake a task for which I felt myself but ill calculated, I have performed with reluctance, and which nothing but the desire of complying with his wish could have induced me to perform at all.\\" The exercise forced her to examine each page which meant that her \\"mind was by turns a prey to terror and disgust\\" and filled her with astonishment and compelled her to \\"condemn the temerity which could for a second time forgo every earthly enjoyment, a second time to encounter each species of hardship and all the cautious dangers so certainly attendant upon those who explore new and different climes a sacrifice for which no reward however liberal, no praise however loud, could offer any adequate recompense.\\"  Financial woes  Her husband had consistently borrowed throughout their marriage. On his death his assets in Hobart were not sufficient to meet his liabilities. Maria unsuccessfully petitioned the Admiralty for a pension. In 1811 she petitioned Robert Peel, then Undersecretary at the Transport OfficeThe National Archives, Kew, CO 201/65 p160 as quoted in Currey for a pension pointing out that she had \\"been born and bred a gentlewoman and with better prospects than my hard fate has realised,\\" her ill-health and that she had only thirty six pounds a year to live on, her 'husband's creditors having taken everything including a small property of my own amounting to one hundred a year.\\" She was now dependent on the support and accommodation of friends. She petitioned Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State for the Colonies, in September 1812 that she \\"must now find a residence for myself; but where to turn; to what corner of the world, situated as I am, to direct my bewildered course?\\" Her brother-in- law, George Collins petitioned Lord Liverpool on her behalf. It transpired that before he left for Tasmania, Lord Hobart, who would become the Earl of Buckingham promised David, that if Maria's situation \\"should appear to be such as to require the aid of government, I should consider it my duty to support any application from her.\\".National Archives, Kew, CO 201/65 f.280 - Letter from Lord Hobart to David Collins 4 February 1703 as quoted in Currey As Earl of Buckingham he wrote to Earl Bathurst in support of her application and she was awarded a pension of £120 per year. In 1815 she petitioned again for an increase, but this was refused.  Death and will  On 12 February 1828, Maria wrote her will.The National Archives, Kew, PROB 11/1775/386 - Will of Maria Stuart Collins of Stonehouse, Devon as quoted in Currey She was then residing at 23 Durnford Street, Stonehouse Devon. She left specific gifts of jewellery, including a gold watch set with pearls, gold enamelled watch keys, a rose diamond ring, a small garnet hoop rings, her books and a Jusia Japan box to her nieces and nephew and the widow of General Desborough. The residue of the estate was left to her nephew, Theophillis Desbrisay of the Royal Artillery. She died sometime in 1828-1830 before probate of the will was granted in September 1830.

For her actions in the war she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 19 March 1944.  Early life  Batrakova was born on 21 November 1922 in the city of Unimer in the Russian SFSR. Her family later moved to Leningrad where she graduated from secondary school in 1938. After the end of the war with Finland she returned to Leningrad Art College until she was called back to the military.  Military career  Batrakova voluntarily joined the Red Army in 1939 and participated in the Winter War as a medical officer, operating in Karelia and Ladoga. She was sent to the front lines again in June 1941 after the start of the Second World War to transmit information about movements of Axis forces to the Soviets, working under the code name \\"Elzi.\\" When her identity was revealed she was tortured by the Gestapo in February 1942 and set to be executed but was rescued by a team of partisans who took her and other captives to a hospital, where she remained until May 1942.Heroines. Issue. I. (Essays on Women - Heroes of the Soviet Union). M., Politizdat, 1969. From June 1942 to August 1943, she worked as a medical officer in the 117th Guards Artillery Regiment, transferring to the 463rd Rifle Regiment in August to work in the regiment of submachine gunners. She participated in the battle for Donbass, facing heavy artillery fire and shelling from enemy tanks; after the regiment's commander was killed in the battle the unit was forced to retreat to the trenches. Batrakova stood on top of a disabled tank and appealed to the unit to continue the fight. Her squad ended up taking control of numerous German trenches, forcing them to retreat. On 30 September 1943, when she was a junior lieutenant, the battalion was preparing to cross the Molochnaya River. Several soldiers hesitated to enter the filthy water and approach enemy fire. When the company commander was killed after falling into an anti-tank ditch, Batrakova continued fighting for five days until reinforcements arrived, despite being wounded twice. In that battle she repelled 53 infantry attacks and 18 air raids. For her excellence in the battle she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by a decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 19 March 1944 and was promoted to the rank of senior lieutenant on 12 September 1944. Throughout the war, she fought on the Northwest, Southern, Ukrainian fronts in the battles of Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka, Demyan, Lvov-Sandomierz, Melitopol, Nikopol-Krivoy Rog, Odessa, Rostov, and Stalingrad. In the battle of Lvov-Sandomierz, she sustained a severe concussion that left her speech impaired for a while; she was transferred away from the front lines after that. In November 1944 she married an artillery officer by the name of Alexander Demidov. From July to September 1944 she worked in the Komsomol political division of the Leningrad Air Defense unit, and then worked as the assistant chief of the 22nd Karelian district political department until February 1945.  Later life  After the war, Batrakova lived in Sestroretsk and worked as a factory shopkeeper until she gave birth to her son in January 1948. In 1957 she moved to the city of Leningrad and began training to become a locksmith in 1966, but became a factory's head shopkeeper. She died on 16 June 1997 at the age of 74 and was buried in the Volkov Lutheran Cemetery.

It is a general term for a vessel whose surface is adorned with an assortment of broken china, glass shards, and small objects, especially items associated with a dead person. They are also called forget-me-not jugs, mourning jugs, memory vessels, spirit jars, whatnot jars, ugly jugs, and whimsy jars. History and technique A memory jug may be any kind of vessel but is most usually a jug or vase. Items used to cover the surface range from shards of china, glass, and mirror to shells, beads, buttons, coins, medals, keys, jewelry, toys, watches, and other small objects. These are adhered to the surface using some kind of adhesive, typically putty or cement. The final piece may also be overpainted to create a more uniform surface. Memory jugs are closely related to the broken-china mosaic form known as trencadís that began to appear in the early 20th century. Most of the existing memory jugs date back no further than the early 20th century, and the makers of most are unknown. Scholars disagree about the origins of memory jugs, with some holding that they were intended as personal memorials, some that they were intended as grave markers, and some that they originated as a hobby unconnected with memorialization. Memory jugs have sometimes been found on African-American graves in the South, and some scholars think that their form was influenced by the Bakongo culture of Central Africa as it was brought to America by slaves. In Bakongo culture, there is a belief that people are connected to the spirit world by way of water, and consequently graves are often decorated with containers holding water, such as jugs, vases, or shells, as a way to help a dead person's spirit through to the afterlife. In addition, personal possessions are often broken to help release the individual's spirit. The memory jug might thus have originated by combining these traditions into a new kind of memorial.

His 1998 study on arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) among the population of Grand Falls, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada led to the infamous Texas Vampires incident and resulted in a 5-year suspension from clinical research by Baylor's Institutional Review Board. Robert Roberts, MD, cardiologist  Education  Dr. Roberts completed his undergraduate at Memorial University of Newfoundland. He attended Medical school at Dalhousie University and training in cardiology at University of Toronto in Canada.[1] With a scholarship from the Canadian Heart Foundation he relocated to the U.S. to complete a research fellowship at the University of California-San Diego under the mentorship of Eugene Braunwald and Burton Sobel where he contributed to the clinical trial development of TPA, a first line treatment for heart attacks. He then became Director of the Coronary Care Unit Barnes Hospital at Washington University in St. Louis (1972-1982) and was recruited by Dr. Michael DeBakey and Anthony Gotto to serve as Chief of Cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas (1982-2004), which he held for over two decades being one of the longest serving chiefs of cardiology in the US. In 2004, he returned to Canada to become C.E.O., President and Chief Scientific Officer of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada (2004-2014).[2]  Clinical practice  He was Director of the Coronary Care Unit at Barnes Hospital at Washington University in St. Louis from 1972-1982. He served as Chief of Cardiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas from 1982-2004, followed by President of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada from 2004-2014.  Research  His research is noted for developing the first quantitative assay for MBCK, which was the standard for diagnosing heart attacks in patients for more than three decades. Most of his research career was devoted to genetics and molecular biology of cardiovascular disorders which led him to several important discoveries, including the first gene for atrial fibrillation in 1997, the first gene for Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and many others. In 2007, he discovered the first gene for heart attacks (9p21) and since as part of an International Consortium has identified over 100 genetic factors that cause an elevated risk for heart disease in addition to the already commonly associated environmental factors such as cholesterol and smoking which paves the way for predictive genetic testing for heart disease in men and women at any age (not just when symptomatic) which he is currently developing. = Texas Vampires Controversy = In 1998, Robert Roberts led a group of researchers from Baylor College of Medicine to conduct a study on arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) among Grand Falls, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada populations. The group arrived at Grand Falls to collect blood samples from community members to test for biomarkers indicating genetic predispositions of this condition. The study was extremely problematic due to procedures used by Roberts to procure the samples causing significant concerns about the informed consent process of the study. Evidence from an investigation initiated by Baylor's Institutional Review Board found that the consent process was largely skipped or done through medical intimidation by Roberts and his team. Participants also were not given results of the study despite many feeling that they might have died had they not taken part. Due to the actions of Roberts' research team, and the public outcry which denounced the group as the Texas Vampires, the Newfoundland's Health Research Ethics Authority was established as a review board \\"to evaluate the ethics of all genetic studies proposed for the province\\". The board is the arbiter of which study groups are permitted to collect genetic materials from Newfoundlanders, among other considerations in medical ethics. Following an internal investigation of this incident by Baylor's Institutional Review Board, Robert Roberts was among three Baylor physicians suspended from clinical research for 5 years. The study also initiated a special subcommittee investigation of procedural and ethical aspects of the study led by Baylor's IRB and Ottawa Heart Institute which found protocol concerns \\"of a serious nature\\".  Awards and honours  He has authored over 900 publications in leading scientific journals and received several awards in recognition of his scientific contributions including the Distinguished Scientist Award from the American College of Cardiology (1998), McLaughlin Medal from the Royal Society of Canada (2008), Award of Meritorious Achievement from AHA (2001), Best of What’s New by Popular Science (1994), and was elected to Fellow of the Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada (2013). He served as Associate Editor of Hurst's The Heart for nearly 30 years while also being a member of numerous review boards for several journals and currently remains Editor-in-Chief of Current Opinion in Cardiology, Section Editor of Genomics for JACC and Associate Editor for JACC:BTS  References  Canadian cardiologists Dalhousie University alumni University of Toronto alumni Living people Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Robert Roberts (cardiologist)"},{"id":"56386152","text":"Mary C.

Soon after she graduated, Audsley began exhibiting with the London Group and at the Royal Academy. Audsley had been accepted for a teaching post at Westminster but the School of Art closed at the start of World War II before she could take up the post. During the War, Audsley enrolled in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force but was invalided out in 1943 and spent seven months in hospital. Further periods of ill-health, and family responsibilities, greatly limited her artistic career and it was only in the 1970s that she again became artistically active on a regular basis. Audsley worked in several media including carvings, ceramics, collage and printmaking. A solo exhibition of her work was held at Sally Hunter Fine Art in 1990.

A railroad track was laid in Atlanta by the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway, in which it started in Columbus, and ended at Luling, which became a new town in 1874. Atlanta became a part of Luling that same time, and it started to disappear afterwards.

Disappearance and murder  German tourists Andrea Scherpf (born December 31, 1959) and Bernd Göricke (born June 29, 1956) were hitchhiking in western Canada in the fall of 1983.

Forensic dentistry suggested possible European identity, and subsequent communication with Interpol allowed for the identification of the victims on 16 October. Over the next six years, 900 tips were collected, but the investigation remained unsuccessful.  Suspects = Andy Rose = In August 1989, Andy Rose was implicated in the murders in a statement by Madonna Mary Kelly. Rose and Kelly were both working in Chetwynd in 1983. In a conversation with an undercover police informant, Madonna Marie Kelly claimed that in October 1983, Rose had arrived on her doorstep, drunk and covered in blood, claiming to have murdered two people. Rose was charged and convicted of the murders in 1991, based almost entirely on Kelly's testimony.cbc.ca: Newfoundlander's ordeal with RCMP sting subject of CBC documentary Rose was convicted again in 1994, following an appeal. However, in March 1996, DNA analysis revealed that there were no DNA traces of Andy Rose on the bloody jeans from the scene. Subsequent to this and the claims from suspect Vance Hill's ex-wife (see below), Rose was released on bail in 1998, pending a third trial in 2001. Between Rose's release and the 2001 trial, the RCMP repeatedly attempted to get a confession from Rose using undercover officers in a \\"Mr. Big\\" sting operation. In 2001, at the third trial against Rose, the DNA traces on the jeans were linked to at least five people, including the victims. The DNA of a third person was salient, but did not match Rose. It also did not match the alternative suspect, Vance Hill. Prosecutor Gil McKinnon issued an acquittal for Rose, who had by this time spent almost 10 years in prison for the murders.listverse.com: 10 Unsolved Cases Involving Murdered Couples = Vance Hill = Vance Hill was an American construction worker from California who had been living in western Canada since 1967, with his wife and three children. Hill was a hunter and a chronic alcoholic.archive.is: Someone Got Away with Murder - Timeline In April 1983, Hill and his wife separated, and she moved back to California with the children. Hill remained behind in Prince George, British Columbia, three hours from Chetwynd. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Hill on 21 October 1983 on two unrelated charges of Obtaining Lodging By False Pretences. In November, Hill returned to his family in California, and apparently confessed the murders to his estranged wife Willadeen sometime in 1984. Hill threatened suicide at least once before later killing himself on 28 July 1985. In 1997, Willadeen Hill told the story to her nephew, who informed the police. According to Hill, her ex-husband told her: \\"The couple asked him if he could take them, and he agreed. He began to harass the woman. When her friend protested, he stopped the pick-up, they got out and began to argue. He reached into the pick-up, took the rifle, and shot him. The woman screamed and screamed and did not want to shut up. He said he also had to kill her.\\"cbc.ca: Someone Got Away With Murder, 21:38 ff  Current status  As DNA analysis eliminated both known suspects, the case remains unsolved. On 21 January 2009, Canadian journalist Linden MacIntyre reported extensively on the case and the attempts to convict Andy Rose in an episode of the Canadian investigative journalism program The Fifth Estate. In 2013, 30 years after the murders, police called for any member of the general public with information on the missing property of the two victims to come forward.

km east of the capital Sana'a), when government forces took control of \\"Mas camp\\" which borders the governorates of Al-Jawf, and Ma'rib. On 19-20 December, government forces coming from Ma'rib and al- Jawf (in the northeast of the capital Sana'a), took control of the 312th Armored Brigade camp, and 334th Armored Brigade camp. Government forces faced fierce resistance that lasted until February 2016, when they were able to take control of the 312th Armored Corps camp. 2015 On 16 December, government forces took control of Fardhat Nihm from Saleh/Houthi forces. Clashes continued for approximately ten days until government forces took full control of Fardhat Nihm. After officially announcing on 26 December full control of Fardhat Nihm, government forces officially declared that they had broken into one of the first districts of the Sana'a Governorate, which is approximately 60 kilometers from Amanat Al Asimah (the capital). 2016 On 10 February 2016, approximately a month and half after the capture of Fardhat Nihm, government forces were on the outskirts of the town of Nihm. Houthi forces and their allies called for the Bani Hashish tribe to stop any further advances and to recapture the lost town. After a few days of clashes, Houthi forces were able to regain the town of Nihm with help from the Bani Hashish tribe. After months of a stalemate, on August 2016, Government forces captured the strategic mountains of Al-Manara, and Salifih al-Faqih overlooking the villages of Bani Faraj in the Nihm District, which resulted in 17 deaths to Houthi Forces and Allies, and over 25 airstrikes in Houthi Strongholds according to Government forces. On 7 October 2016, Abdul-Rab al-Shadadi was killed in an artillery strike during an offensive east of the city of Sana'a by Houthi fighters.Top general in Yemen's Saudi-backed army killed. Reuters.

Furthermore, government forces reported significant advances in the village of Bani Faraj, on the outskirts of Nihm district. On 10 May 2017, clashes spilled over from Al-Jawf into the Arhab District in the Nahran area, which is located in-between the Arhab and Nihm district. According to government officials, on the week of 31 October, over two hundred Houthis were killed in Nihm. 2018 On 19 January 2018, Mount Al-Qarn and Mount Al-Dabbayeb were captured by government forces from Houthi rebels, and according to many military sources; government forces control most of Nihm's highlands that overlook Amanat Al Asimah. On 27 February, according to pro-Hadi force, at least 63 Houthis militants had been killed in heavy clashes with government forces in Nihm district. The Houthis mounted an offensive against government forces along the rugged mountains in Nihm, triggering fierce clashes amid heavy air strikes by Saudi-led coalition fighter jets. The pro-Hadi source said government troops pushed Houthis back as the coalition’s fighter jets destroyed their military reinforcements that came from the capital, and hit their gatherings in Nihm. 17 Houthis were killed in the fighting between 25 February and 1 March. 33 Houthis militants, including four military commanders were captured. Among Houthis deaths were three field commanders. On 3 March, Saudi-led coalition warplanes waged four raids on Bani Matar in Sana'a province, caused huge damage to citizens’ houses and properties. On 4 March, Houthis dispatched their \\"forces of death\\" to the Nihm battlefield to block government forces, and slow their advance towards Sana'a. Pro-Hadi source claimed that the government forces captured the Al Zelzal mountain, and escalated attacks on Houthis along other hillsides that overlook Arhab district. However, Houthis officials rejected loyalist claims of advancing in Sana'a’s Arhab District. It was reported that more than 55 people died and dozens more were wounded on both sides. On 6 March, Pro-Hadi media claimed that government forces have taken control of the last Houthi- held military sites in Nihm, and have claimed that fighting has now reached Dhabwa area, that it is in the middle of Nihm and Arhab District. 2020 On 31 January 2020, Houthi armed forces spokesman Gen. Yahya Sarea announced that Houthi forces managed to liberate roughly 2,500 km2 of territory including the city of Naham, and parts of the governorates of Al-Jawf and Marib, from Saudi- led forces. The coalition forces immediately denied this claim, claiming victory and progress in these areas. “In the Nahm district, east of the capital Sanaa, the National Army managed to regain control of a number of Houthi-controlled areas,” Majli said.

Built in 1863, it is one of the best- preserved 19th-century wood-iron Howe truss bridges to survive. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2012. (Archived version of draft) Description and history The Knight's Ferry Bridge stands at the eastern edge of the small community of Knights Ferry, spanning the Stanislaus River a short distance upriver from the modern Sonora Road bridge. The bridge is almost long, with a total of four spans set on stone abutments and piers. In addition to spanning the river, the bridge crosses a historic millrace north of the river. The bridge sections consist of Howe trusses formed out of wooden planks bolted together, with wrought iron tension rods, all joined by wrought iron bearing blocks. The exterior of the bridge is finished in vertical board siding, with a metal roof. 2004 HABS/HAER photo The bridge, the second to stand on the site, was built in 1862-63, after the first bridge (built 1856) was swept away during the Great Flood of 1862. Because of this flood, the new bridge was built on higher piers. The bridge was for a long time known as the longest covered bridge west of the Mississippi River, and since the 2011 destruction of Old Blenheim Bridge in New York State, which had approximately the same length, it is the second-longest covered bridge in the United States, behind the Smolen-Gulf covered bridge in Ohio. It was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey and by Historic American Engineering Record. In addition to its status as a National Historic Landmark, it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing structure in the Knight's Ferry historic district.

The site was concealed by being run as a hidden service on the Tor network. After running the site for the first six months, owner Benjamin Faulkner of Guelph, Ontario, Canada was captured by the United States Department of Homeland Security. For the remaining eleven months the website was owned and operated by the Australian Queensland Police Service's Task Force Argos, as part of Operation Artemis.  Reactions  The website was run by Australian police for 11 months, and involved impersonation of the forum owner WarHead (Faulkner's alias) which required police to regularly post child abuse images, in order to convince users that the site was not compromised. Ivar Stokkereit, a legal adviser to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Norway, stated this was \\"a clear violation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, even though the police’s intention is to prevent new offenses in the long run\\". Amnesty International also criticized the actions as \\"unacceptable under human rights law\\". ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) supported the proactive approach taken by Task Force Argos. James Sheptycki, professor in criminology at York University, criticized the transfer of the website from its original server in Europe to Australia as \\"jurisdiction shopping\\", being done due to the favourable legal framework in Australia that would allow the website to continue running in this way.  Convictions  The capture of the site, and its subsequent use to gather information, has led to arrests and convictions: * Benjamin Faulkner's associate, Patrick Falte, was captured together with Faulkner when they met in Virginia in October 2016 two days after they had raped a four-year-old girl. Falte had been an administrator on The GiftBox Exchange, another darknet child exploitation site that was shut down in November 2016. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape of the girl and subsequently sentenced to 35 years for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise. *Andrew R. Leslie, of Middleburg, Florida, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, where he was a VIP member of The Giftbox Exchange. Leslie also operated another darknet child exploitation network that featured videos of severe violent sexual abuse of children, and in March 2018 was sentenced to additional 60 years in prison for sexual abuse and production of child sexual abuse of i.a. toddlers. *Brett A. Bedusek, of Cudahy, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise and violation of previous supervised release for the same type of offense. All four above mentioned offenders were in addition sentenced to a lifetime of supervised release. * Site administrator Tyler David Walker, a 21-year-old Canadian, was initially arrested on the matter in March 2017, and sentenced to five years in prison. * Site user Robert Zitzelsperger, a former science teacher in Sydney.  Media portrayals  In November 2019 the Canadian network CBC in collaboration with Norwegian VG (Verdens Gang) published a six- part podcast called Hunting Warhead, chronicling the investigation by VG journalist Håkon Høydal and a Norwegian computer security expert of child sexual abuse networks on the dark web. In the course of the six episodes, CBC journalist Daemon Fairless examines the background of Benjamin Faulkner and the course of events that led to his capture.

Charter schools are public schools that operate independently of the local government school district. A CMO contracts with a charter school to provide a specific service or set of services. They may not hold the charter expect for in AZ. By convention, a CMO manages at least three schools and serves at least 300 students. Additionally, they must be a separate business entity from the school. History Economist Milton Friedman in 1955 proposed that education could be improved by a universal school voucher program. A free market in primary and secondary education would allow consumers (parents) to choose among alternatives, stimulating competition and improvement. In 1974, Ray Budde, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, floated the idea of a charter school. In 1991, Minnesota enacted legislation that enabled charter schools. Other states followed. Some commercial charter management organizations operate large networks of schools. EdisonLearning was founded in 1992. Variants=Non-profit CMOs= Many states have adopted laws that require that the holder of the school charter be a non-profit organization. In these instances, a charter school must form a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Typically this new business entity forms a school board to oversee the operations of the new public charter school. However, they may then choose to contract with a CMO to provide management related services. Examples include: *Knowledge Is Power Program *Imagine Schools =For-profit EMOs= Wisconsin, California, Florida, Michigan, and Arizona allow for-profit corporations to manage charter schools. Examples include: *K12 *Academica =Vendor operated school= In some cases a school's charter is held by a non-profit that chooses to contract all of the school's operations to a third party, often a for-profit CMO. This arrangement is defined as a vendor-operated school, (VOS). Distinction from education management organization CMOs in some usages are distinct from EMOs (education management organizations). One authority on schools, Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes makes no distinction between terms. In its recent reports it describes CMO -- non-profit and CMO -- for-profit. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools makes a clear distinction. CMOs are non-profit; EMOs are for-profit.

It was distributed by Kartemquin Films. When singer and entertainer Cher learned about the couple from a local news story, she offered to pay for repairs to the couple's home as well as Edith's medical bills. Cher is also the executive producer of the documentary film. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject at the 90th Academy Awards. Background According to Checkoway, the film was originally supposed to be a heartwarming love story about America's oldest interracial newlyweds, aged 96 and 95, who married after ten years together. However, the story took a turn when the happy couple was forcibly separated by a court order, mandating that Edith go live with her daughter in Florida. When Cher saw a news clip about the couple’s plight, she was very moved and wanted to know how she could help. “I called my lawyer and said, ‘Get into this and work on it,’ because I don’t want to see this couple separated. They’re too fabulous, and I just don’t want to see anything bad happen to them. I was going to have to retrofit their house so that they could stay there, which really was making some repairs and putting a full bathroom downstairs. Then things started to change. All of a sudden, they had to renovate the entire house. It was now up in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. And then, while we’re trying to figure this out, one night, [Hill’s guardian] comes with the police and drags her out of the house.\\" She connected with the family and hired a lawyer to represent Edith and Rebecca Wright, one of her three daughters, in order to honor Edith's wishes to stay in her home. “I took care of my grandmothers, I take care of my mother. It’s very expensive, and thank God I can afford to. But both my grandmothers said to me, “Don’t ever put me in a home.” Then my grandmother put my grandfather in a home; she made it seem like it was nirvana. I went to visit him, and I saw all these people just warehoused in this place. My grandfather didn’t speak the whole time I was there. I turned to him and said: 'I am getting you out of here. I don’t care what anyone says.' And the only thing he said to me the whole time I was there was, 'Don’t delay.' I got him out of there. I wouldn’t put anybody in that home. I know that people don’t have the funds, but warehousing our parents is just not right.” Says Checkoway: “[Cher] wasn't seeking publicity; this was just something out of the generosity of who she is. She got involved behind the scenes and then she and I bonded and kept that connection going. It was pretty soon when we found out that there was disagreement between Edith's daughters about what was best for their mom. We did not know what would unfold, literally, until it did. “The legal guardianship system was not on my radar before making this film, and so we learn that Edith's rights have been put in the hands of someone who is appointed by the court who doesn't know her. And the issues that arise when that happens are something that plays out before us again in the film. Then I began researching, and I couldn't understand how this could be. A lot of audience members leave the film asking, How on earth could this happen? They come to find out that this is happening to elders all across the country.” Reporter Judith Graham of The Washington Post presented more details from the perspective of the other participants in the story. Release and awards Edith+Eddie premiered at the True/False Film Festival in 2017, and subsequently screened at 34 more festivals throughout 2017 and 2018. The film won multiple awards including the Best Short at the International Documentary Association Awards, Jury Award for Best Documentary at the Palm Springs International Shortfest, Jury Award for Best Documentary Short at the Hamptons International Film Festival, Best Documentary Short at the Nevada City Film Festival, Outstanding Documentary Short Film at Tallgrass International Film Festival, Best Documentary - Flickers' Youth Film Jury Awards at the Rhode Island International Film Festival, Audience Award for Best Short at the Montclair Film Festival, Semi-Finalist: \\"Shorts List\\" at the Cinema Eye Honors, and Jury Honorable Mention - Short Doc Award at the Sheffield Doc/Fest.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject at the 90th Academy Awards. Plot The documentary centers on the opioid epidemic, specifically its effect on Huntington, West Virginia, where the overdose rate is 10 times the US average. It follows police, judges, and local nonprofits attempting to help people who struggle with opioid addiction and bring them to recovery as the city grips with a growing number of heroin and prescription painkiller overdoses, and eventually, the much more potent fentanyl. Among them are three women alluded to in the film's name: Huntington Fire Chief Jan Rader who, with other emergency responders, treats overdose victims; Cabell County Judge Patricia Keller, who heads the drug court; and Necia Freeman of Brown Bag Ministry, who delivers food to women who resort to prostitution to support their addictions. The documentary explains the use of naloxone to treat overdose victims, and explores the psychological toll on the county's first responders who see dozens of overdoses a month. It follows first responders to calls as people overdose, including one instance where a woman is revived at the counter of a convenience store while customers continue checking out nearby. There are several dozen interviews with people who have been addicted and are in recovery who discuss the effects of the drug on their lives and their efforts to recover from it. Production=Conception= Sheldon, who grew up in Logan and Elkview, West Virginia, said the opioid epidemic was personal and that she had friends and classmates impacted by addiction. The documentary was produced as a collaboration with the Center for Investigative Reporting, with a hopeful tone that focuses less on history, statistics and politics, and more on the daily routines of people impacted daily by opioids. Media covering the issue focused heavily on victims and she later said she wanted to create a documentary that focused more on the people helping them. In the process, she said she hoped the documentary would bring attention to addiction as something that impacts people of all demographics. In making the documentary, she said she sought to change the perception of opioid addiction from a \\"moral failure\\" to one of a \\"medical issue\\" where recovery is possible. Appalachia has seen problems with opioid addiction for some time before it gained a wider public understanding in the United States. She told Vanity Fair that she felt that while government, health care and pharmaceutical companies weren't paying attention to the plight in West Virginia, that the solutions to the opioid epidemic would ultimately come from there, because of how people like the subjects in her film have worked to help one another. Conversely, she said West Virginians have ignored the problem for too long and it needs to be addressed, regardless of the documentary's impact on how others view the state. =Filming= The documentary was shot between February 2016 and May 2017, off and on. Sheldon and her husband were the only two involved in filming on the ground, which they did off-and-on for a total of 38 days. The Center for Investigative Reporting funded the film through its Glassbreaker initiative. Sheldon reached out to the city mayor's office about the documentary, and was introduced to Rader, Keller and others. She and her husband subsequently rode along with the Fire Department for about 20 days over a period of six months. Rader later told Roll Call she was concerned with members of her department suffering from post traumatic stress disorder as its members see 40 or more dead bodies a year, including friends and classmates. She also said she wanted to highlight the estimated $100 million impact opioids had on Cabell County's economy, as her department responds to five to seven overdoses a day. Though Rader, Sheldon was introduced to a number of people who experience the opioid epidemic every day, and settled on the three women featured in the documentary because they often work with the same people at different parts of their lives. After filming, the couple approached Netflix which helped them craft the story in editing and post-production. The film's short length helps it as an educational tool, Sheldon said, because community screenings can dedicate an hour to the film — 39 minutes watching it and 20 minutes having a discussion about its contents. The creators built a field guide for screenings so it could be viewed in prisons, rehabilitation centers, and medical schools. The film debuted at the August 2017 Telluride Film Festival. Netflix released it for streaming the next month. Screenings of the film have followed around the country, particularly in communities impacted by opioid addition. Reception Heroin(e) has an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 10 reviews, and an average rating of 8.25/10. The film was praised for its tone. Forbes called it an \\"optimistic counter-narrative\\" that focuses on an alternative to harsh or judgmental approaches to understanding the impacts of opioids. Forbes said it makes \\"a powerful case for compassion and for second, third, fourth and 10th chances,\\" though not exploring their causes as deeply as other works such as J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy. The Clarion-Ledger wrote that its \\"gritty\\" approach allowed the viewer to understand the daily lives of people trying to help those affected by addiction. The New York Times considered it a front-runner for an Oscar because it \\"addresses an issue in the news — the opioid epidemic — with present-tense reportage and an eye toward putting human faces on the crisis.\\" Huntington residents interviewed about the film were generally supportive of its contents, noting that it highlights the compassion of people in the community helping others. Rader attended the 2018 State of the Union Address as a guest of Senator Joe Manchin and during the trip spoke to lawmakers about the opioid epidemic, which has had a substantial impact on Huntington's economy.

Incident  At 7:57 AM as students were gathering in an open area prior to the start of classes, 15-year-old student Gabriel Ross Parker, opened fire with a Ruger handgun, killing two 15 year olds at the scene. Parker reportedly went to the school's band room to check with his friends before the shooting, to make sure they were not in the area before returning to the commons area and beginning his attack. Witnesses stated that the gunman's eyes were \\"lifeless\\" and that he said nothing while he fired at students. After the shooting he discarded the weapon and ran to the weight room and hid with other students. Students, unaware he was the suspected shooter, motioned for him to join them in hiding. Another student who was hiding in the location, recognized Parker as the shooter and alerted a teacher in the room about the shooter's identity, the teacher then called law enforcement. A large number of students fled the schools campus to seek safety with local business owners attempting to aid the students. Students running from the incident heard screams of \\"Get down!\\" but many fled, or attempted to evacuate the wounded from the school and drive them to the hospital. This created chaos as many dropped what they were carrying such as phones and bags and jumped fences or ran into the woods. Many students also ran to the school's technical building on campus. Eighteen other people were injured, by bullets and the chaos afterwards with three people critically injured. Parker was taken into custody by the Marshall County Sheriff at 8:06 AM. The mother of the suspect reportedly received a phone call from her son that there had been a shooting and that he was scared. The revelation that her son was the suspected shooter caused her to be physically ill. Victims Bailey Nicole Holt and Preston Ryan Cope, both 15 years old, were killed. Holt died at the scene after reportedly calling her mother but \\"couldn't say anything\\". Cope died later at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center due to a non-survivable gunshot wound. Cope's parents reached the school before he passed and bypassed first responders to be by his side. Eighteen other students were injured, four by trying to escape, injuries sustained ranged from head wounds, to injuries to arms, the chest and abdomen from either the bullets or the chaos. Authorities reported that the wounded were five females and thirteen male students between the ages of 14 to 18 years old.

After his arrest a bag that Parker had on his person was searched by police, and held a copy of the Communist Manifesto and a large Winchester sheath knife. At his home he had a copy of Mein Kampf. Officers also seized the suspect's phone. = Investigation = Once arrested Parker was Mirandized and interviewed for almost two hours before Parker requested a lawyer. In the interview Parker reportedly told the investigating officers he planned the night before to take his step-father's pistol and the pros and cons of carrying out the act. School surveillance video documented the incident, and shows the progression of the incident. Police did not immediately offer a motive. According to the testimony of Marshall County Sheriff's Captain Matt Hilbrecht, during the interrogation, Parker expressed that \\"he was an atheist and that his life had no purpose and other people’s lives also had no purpose.\\" Officers also stated that Parker indicated the shooting was an \\"experiment\\" to see how students and society would respond. = Legal proceedings = Parker was arraigned in Marshall County Circuit Court on February 16, 2018. He has been charged with two counts of murder and fourteen counts of first-degree assault. The Kentucky Court of Appeals ordered the release of previously sealed records of Parker by the Marshall County Circuit Court after his 16th birthday as he is being tried as an adult. In March 2018, Parker and his attorney were in court to attempt to have the case moved back to Juvenile Court, which was denied and he is to be continued to be tried as an adult. During a pre-trial hearing in August 2018 it was reported that there was evidence from over 100 cell phones that would be potentially used in the trial against Parker. At this trial it was stated that if the prosecutors of the case received an expert opinion that Parker was suffering from a mental defect or disease, potential charges of wanton endangerment would be levied against Parker's stepfather. In May 2019, the judge ruled that his trial will be moved to Christian county citing heavy publicity and sensational allegations and the trial was scheduled for June 2020. Due to his age he is not eligible for either the death penalty or life without parole and according to Kentucky law must be eligible for parole after serving 25 years.https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/should-teen-school-shooters-spend- the-rest-of-their-lives-in- prison/2019/11/23/b96cc6f8-0baf-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html%3foutputType In April 2020, Parker pled guilty to murder and Parkers mother apologized to Holt's and Cope's families for her sons actions after. On June 12, he was sentenced to two life terms plus 70 years and will be eligible for parole after serving 20 years. During his sentencing, Holt's and Cope's families each delivered victim impact statements against Parker.  Response  A benefit concert at the Kentucky Opry in Benton was organized to raise donations for the families of shooting victims, with another concert organized three weeks after the first. The town also employed blue and orange ribbons, and the phrase \\"Marshall Strong\\". In June 2018, students who had been wounded were given checks from donation campaigns. Federal grants were announced in August 2018 by Governor Matt Bevin to support victims during the shooters trial, as well as for mental health professionals and a recovery plan coordinator at the high school. Some students have become involved with the March for Our Lives campaign and gun control rallies, which has caused them to be at odds with a majority of the area, which saw commentators in local news medias claiming the students were too young to know anything. Survivors of the Heath High School Shooting, the Columbine High School Shooting, and the University of California at Santa Barbara Shooting reached out to survivors to encourage healing and discussion about the incident. The entire student body was awarded the 911 Hero Award in September 2018, in order to recognize the students' actions during the shooting. = School response = Less than a week after the incident the school implemented new safety methods to protect the students. Students that arrived late would have to check in with the front office, and staff members began to screen students with metal detector wands before allowing them to enter. The school has also instated a second officer on full- time at the location, with grant proposals for more school resource officers. In June 2018 it was reported that the Marshall County School District had banned students carrying backpacks at the high school, and two middle schools to protect the students.

The Deil's Dyke, sometimes written as 'dike', is formed from an earthen berm of rounded form that varies from 2.0-4.0m wide and a maximum of 0.7m high sometimes having a stone core. Where a fosse accompanies the bank it is usually an inconsequential 0.5m or so in width on average and around 0.4m deep, more often located on the uphill or outfield side. As a defensive structure the dyke has no obvious military value and its erratic route militates against it being a practical political boundary. Location The earthwork is not continuous however it is generally regarded as running from east of Afton Water (NS 6169 1142) near New Cumnock to Burnmouth (NS 8400 0500) in the parish of Durisdeer, having passed through the parishes of New Cumnock, Kirkconnel and Sanquhar. A detached section ran from the site of the old Durisdeer Castle to the Kirk Burn above Durisdeer village, ending short of the Durisdeer Roman fortlet. The dyke follows contours that lie typically from 500 to 900 ft above sea level. History In 1824 the Deil’s Dyke is first recorded in print by Chalmers in his ‘Caledonia’ where he credits Joseph Train, amongst others, for the description of what survived at the time and for recognising its significance, ambiguous as that remains. In 1841 a second report was published as an appendix in MacKenzie’s ‘History of Galloway’. Originally it was said to run from Loch Ryan to the shores of the inner Solway and was a boundary between the Picts and the Britons of Strathclyde with a defensive palisade, watchtowers and forts however this has been shown to be incorrect as a number of the linear features included were shown to be head- dykes and other unrelated landscape features. A Dumfries and Galloway survey of 1956 proposed that the dyke runs along a 16 miles route from near Burnmouth Farm (NS 8400 0500), north of Enterkinfoot to Dalhanna Hill, New Cumnock, beside the Afton Water (NS 6169 1142), south-west of New Cumnock. This section is considered to have some credibility as a single structure constructed and planned through the control of a single controlling authority. elricks often started at such points so that the animals could be driven from that area along the route that would lead to their point of capture. In 1981 a section was excavated and was shown to consist of an earth bank only, likely to have been constructed on one single occasion. The turves used in its construction were taken from either side giving a width of 4.5 feet (1.4m) at the base with a maximum original height estimated at around 6.5 feet (2m). although both late Iron Age and medieval dating evidence was found it was not conclusive. No one single feudal land holder is known to have controlled such a large area so its construction as an estate boundary is implausible, but a mediaeval head- dyke function or a deer hay wind function or a hunting forest demarcation fits the evidence better. It has been noted that a considerable number of similar earthworks exist in the vicinity of the dyke making interpretation a challenge. The name 'Deil's Dyke' or 'Devil's Dyke' is commonly associated in myth and legend with structures of this scale however it has also been noted that a name similar or identical to 'Deil's Dyke' can mean a 'march dyke'. Some of the gaps in the course of the dyke may be due to the historical presence of dense woodland. Areas of once extensive woodland in Nithsdale are indicated on old maps such as in the 1660s when a Cashogill Wood (sic) is recorded near Enterkinfoot, extending at least as far as Kilbryd Kirk (sic). The RCAHMS have mapped sections of the Deil's Dyke near Morton Castle and near Gatelawbridge. In the parish of Eskdalemuir are sections of another similar linear earthwork there known as the 'Deil's Jingle'. Function Local tradition states that the dyke was used to hide cattle from raiders or to interfere with raiders returning with stolen sheep, cattle, horses and other goods, delaying them long enough for pursuers to catch up with them. elrick in Galloway is a natural feature once utilised for red deer management. In a number of places along its route it has been utilised and modified or possibly originally built as a head-dyke which physically separated the arable lower lying land from the upland pastures which were grazed by sheep and cattle which would have otherwise eaten any arable crops. The terms 'in-field' and 'out-field' are sometimes applied and both are clearly marked on the landscape as green lush vegetation on lower lying land against the more complex colours of bare rock, heather, bracken, etc. on the moors or out-fields. The development of field boundaries meant that head-dykes were no longer necessary and they fell out of use in the 18th and 19th centuries. The often erratic route may be explained by the need to enclose as much good quality arable land as possible. The dyke has also been proposed as a tribal territorial boundary or as a medieval land boundary however the irregular course of this linear feature makes this unlikely. The course of the Deil's Dyke is not noticeably associated with the many defensive features that exist in Nithsdale, such as Iron Age forts, medieval mottes, etc. although the linear earthwork near Durisdeer is linked with the site of the medieval castle. The Catrail in Roxburghshire, southern Scotland, has a number of similarities with the Deil's Dyke and consists of a bank and a ditch and runs for . It is considered to be a territorial land boundary dating from the Early Middle Ages and was once considered to link up with the Deil's Dyke. Some deer hay winds or elricks may have consisted of banks and ditches several kilometres long that were used to direct deer for the purpose of captureFletcher, p.58 and the Deil's Dyke fits this description.History of the Parish of New Cumnock \\"Deer hunting has left physical traces on the landscape in the form of banks and dykes used either as park boundaries or for trapping the deer\\".History of the Parish of New Cumnock The surveyed section of the New Cumnock to Durisdeer Parish route In 1956 much of the route was walked and the following observations recorded  a. NS 8000 0591 to NS 8260 0515: In 1985 this section had been removed by ploughing and was indistinguishable in other sections. Ardoch Farm and the A76 lie to the east. b. NS 8000 0591 to NS 8005 0595: In 1978 this length consisted of a stone and earth bank, 0.5m high and 4m wide. c. NS 8020 0601: In 1978 this section had a bank that on the north or downhill side enclosed an area of rig and furrow and lies close to the Hawkcleuch Burn. d. NS 8027 0602: In 1978 modern drains obscured the junction and the bank was 0.4m hugh and 2m wide. e. NS 8030 0603 to NS 8037 0602: In 1978 on the steep burn side slope the dyke was mostly obscured. f. NS 8037 0602 to NS 8050 0600: The route was not possible to follow. A 230 yard gap may have existed if the OS route is ignored. g. NS 8050 0600 to NS 8087 0596: In 1978 this section was hard to follow with minimal evidence. The Cowan Burn lies near by. h. NS 8089 0597: No evidence of the route remained. i. NS 8093 0596 to NS 8216 0579: The Dyke ran from the Cowan Burn to the northern side of Giengenny Hill. j. NS 8093 0596 to NS 8150 0591: In 1978 little of the route remained. k. NS 8150 0591 to NS 8213 0591: A contemporary wall runs along the route of the Dyke. The site is close to the Glengenny Burn. l. NS 8213 0591 to NS 8266 0541: Arable land is taken in here and the dyke course was rather random. m. NS 8216 0579 to NS 8272 0535: In 1956 this section had no fosse, but it did have a clearly visible bank, 6ft-9ft thick and up to 3ft high. n. NS 8258 0545: No sign of the dyke survived here. o. NS 8266 0541 to NS 8272 0535: In 1978 This section had a clear profile, 2m wide and 0.7m high. p. NS 8266 0541 to NS 8339 0500: Visible here in 1950. q. NS 8268 0526: In 1978 the course was not discernible from more recent dykes. r. NS 8272 0535: In 1956 the Dyke could be followed from the start of a sike tributary to Cubie's Cleuch. s. NS 8272 0535 to NS 8298 0518: In 1978 the 2m wide bank of the dyke ran to the burn. t. NS 8300 0518 to NS 8304 0511: Nothing remained of the dyke. u. NS 8304 0511 to NS 8339 0500: A farm track had obscured the dyke's course. v. NS 8404 0526: The dyke is thought to have started on the left bank of the Burnsands Burn in the area of its confluence with the River Nith. Cartographic evidence and place names In 1328 Durisdeer was recorded as Durrysder which in Gaelic may derive from dubhros 'a dark wood' and doire 'an oak copse', literally the \\"dark wood of the oak copse.\\" This description would be relevant in terms of the termination of a detached section of the Deil's Dyke in a wooded area. As a common place name the name 'Deil' can mean the 'Devil' who together with the semi- mythological Picts were credited with building many unusual or megalithic structures; as previously stated it can also be a variant of a word meaning a march or head-dyke that divides or separate into one or more parts. The term 'Pict's Dyke' is mainly applied in the parish of Sanquhar. Areas of once extensive woodland in Nithsdale indicated on old maps such as in the 1660s a Cashogill Wood (sic) is recorded near Enterkinfoot and extended as far as Kilbryd Kirk (sic). A 'Priest Wood' is recorded on a map of 1832 lying below the old church. The March Cleugh is a small burn with a name meaning 'boundary' that flows from near Kirkbride Hill. A March House stands near the dyke at Burnmouth and the name 'Eliock' is given to the nearby wood. The word 'Elerc' in Gaelic originally meant 'ambush' and later meant a 'deer trap' described as a funnel-like defile, artificial or natural into which deer were herded so that they could be contained and then killed. The personal or place name 'Elrick' is linked to such deer traps.Jackson, p.52.Taylor, p.51 A section of the dyke here is recorded by the RCAHMS in 1920 as having a foundation of large stones that indicate a width of seven feet.

Price (July 13, 1913, Passaic, New Jersey- February 11, 2001, Haverford, Pennsylvania) was an American chemist and president of the American Chemical Society (1965). He taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Pennsylvania. He was known as a pioneer of polymer science. He co-organized the first Reaction Mechanisms Conference in 1946. He was also a founding co-editor of the Journal of Polymer Science in 1946. He studied polymerization processes as part of the U.S. synthetic rubber program during World War II and invented and patented polyether polyurethane foam rubber. He also contributed to the detection of chemical weapons, the develop of chloroquine as a treatment for malaria, and treatments for cancer. In 1952 Price won the Democratic nomination to Congress for Indiana's 3rd congressional district. He was an active Quaker. As a long- term member of the United World Federalists, he campaigned for disarmament and co-operative world government through a strengthened United Nations. One of his interests was yacht racing, for which he won numerous awards. Education Charles Coale Price III was born on July 13, 1913, to Thornton Walton Price, a mechanical engineer, and Helen Marot Farley, in Passaic, New Jersey. His parents were Quakers who had married in the Swarthmore Friends Meeting. Charles was the first of five children. At age six, his right hand was blown off in an accident with a box of detonators for dynamite. Price attended Swarthmore College, earning a Bachelor's degree in chemistry with high honors, Phi Beta Kappa in 1934. He excelled in sports and was captain of the varsity lacrosse team. Price received his Masters (1935) and Ph.D. (1936) from Harvard University, where he worked with Louis Fieser. In June 1936, he married Mary Elma White. Career= University of Illinois at Chicago = Price did one year of post-doctoral work at the University of Illinois at Chicago, working with Roger Adams on the structure of gossypol. His interest in molecular bonding and the mechanisms of chemical reactions underlies much of his career. He was a member of the faculty from 1936 to 1946, becoming an assistant professor in 1936, an instructor in 1937, and an associate professor in 1942, in the department of chemistry. During World War II, Price did research in several important areas. He developed tests to detect known chemical warfare agents in water and constructed equipment to remove them. He worked on the synthesis of dichloroquinoline and tested chloroquine as a possible substitute for quinine, which was no longer available for the treatment of malaria. He studied polymers and polymerization processes involved in the production of synthetic rubber as part of the U.S. synthetic rubber program, which sought alternative sources to unavailable natural rubber. = University of Notre Dame = From 1946 to 1954, Price was Professor and Chairman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame. At Notre Dame, Price and Paul Doughty Bartlett organized the first Conference on Organic Reaction Mechanisms, held September 3, 1946. This conference marks the point at which American physical organic chemists in the United States began to identify themselves as members of a field. Price was a founding co-editor of the Journal of Polymer Science in 1946, with Paul M. Doty and Herman Francis Mark. He also served on the editorial board of Organic Syntheses from 1946 to 1954. He received the 1946 ACS Award in Pure Chemistry, given to the most promising young chemist, and presented \\"Some Polar Factors Affecting the Properties of Unsaturated Compounds\\" as his award address. Price was a pioneer in the field of polyethers. He invented polyether polyurethane rubber, a form of foam rubber which became widely used in sponges, mattresses, cars, insulation and building materials, flotation devices, and packaging. He obtained U.S. Patent 2,866,774 for elastomeric polyether urethanes (Filing Date: 09/23/1953; Publication Date: 12/30/1958). In 1950, Price campaigned at the Indiana Democratic Convention for the Democratic nomination to the U. S. Senate, in a three-way contest with Andrew Jacobs and winner Alexander M. Campbell. In 1952 Price won the Democratic nomination to Congress for Indiana's 3rd congressional district. He came second in the election to the Republican candidate Shepard J. Crumpacker Jr. Price resigned as head of the chemistry department at Notre Dame in 1952, to campaign, and was reappointed as department head in 1954. = University of Pennsylvania = In 1954, Price joined the University of Pennsylvania, where he became the Blanchard Professor of Chemistry and chairman of the chemistry department. In 1966 he stepped down as chairman and was named the University Professor of Chemistry. In 1968 he was named the Benjamin Franklin Professor of Chemistry. He continued to work in the area of polymers, and built upon his previous work with chemical warfare and disease treatment, investigating the area of cancer treatment. Price served on the Divisional Committee for Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences of the National Science Foundation in the 1950s. In 1962, he spent several months in Japan with his family, teaching at Osaka University and Kyoto University as a Fulbright Professor. Price served as President of the American Chemical Society in 1965. He chaired a new committee, on Chemistry and Public Affairs, and worked with Arnold Thackray, head of the University of Pennsylvania department of History and Sociology of Science, to establish a Center for the History of Chemistry (CHOC). Price retired from the University of Pennsylvania as professor emeritus in 1978. When CHOC was founded in 1982, Price became the founding chair of the CHOC Policy Council. Price was instrumental in helping CHOC to obtain funding from John C. Haas, Arnold Beckman, and others. In 1992, CHOC was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation and in 2018, the Science History Institute. The Charles C. Price Fellowship for postdoctoral students studying the history of science and technology was first awarded by the institution in 1999. Mary Elma (White) Price died of cancer in 1982, survived by her husband and their five children: Patricia (1938-), Susanne (1940-), Sarah (1944-), Judith (1946-) and Charles Coale IV (1948-). Charles Price remarried in 1983, to Anne Parker Gill. He died on February 11, 2001.  Activism  Price was active in the United World Federalists for many years. The organization advocated strengthening the United Nations to form a world government that could resolve issues and ensure peace. While in Indiana, Price served as Chairman of the St. Joseph County Chapter (1948-1950) and the Indiana State Branch (1950-1952). After moving to Philadelphia, he served as Vice-President of the Philadelphia Area Council and the Pennsylvania State Branch (1955). Price also served on the National Executive Council from 1950 to 1953 and 1956 to 1965. He served as Chairman of the Statutes Committee of the World Movement for World Federal Government from 1953 to 1957. He became First Vice-President of the United World Federalists from 1958 to 1959, and President from 1959 to 1961. He was President of the World Federalists Educational Fund from 1972 to 1974. Price was Chairman of the Federation of American Scientists from 1956 to 1957. He was on the executive committee of the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace in 1962. He served on the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO from 1964 to 1969, and served on its Executive Committee from 1966 to 1969. He became board chairman of the Council for a Livable World in 1973. He served on the board of the Committee on a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE), and spoke before U.S. Government committees on the Prohibition of Chemical and Biological Weapons. Price was active as a Quaker, serving as clerk of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting working group on world federal government and as clerk of the Old Haverford Meeting. He served on the College Board of Managers for Swarthmore College, the American Friends Service Committee, and as co-chairman of the Global Interdependence Center in Philadelphia in the 1980s. He encouraged scientists and government institutions to work together in support of disarmament and to seek peaceful solutions to economic, political, and social challenges throughout the world. Sailing Price was a long-term member of the Cruising Club of America, winning a number of trophies in his racing yachts Proton (a Gulfstar 41) and Proton II. When he moved from South Bend, Indiana to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1954, he sailed his yacht from Lake Michigan to the Chesapeake Bay, a three-month trip. First he participated in a 330-mile race from Chicago to Mackinac Island. Then he went through the Great Lakes to the canal at Buffalo, New York. After reaching the coast, he sailed along the coastline to Annapolis, Maryland. Between 1960 and 1970, Price competed six times in the Bermuda Race from Newport to Bermuda. In 1970, he sailed from Bermuda to the Isle of Wight, England in his 45-foot sailboat, to compete in the Cowes Week regatta. Other competitors in the races at Cowes Week included Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Prime Minister Edward Heath. Works * Mechanisms of reactions at carbon-carbon double bonds.

Scrap Arts Music creates original instruments and musical compositions; produces original sound and video recordings; and creates choreographed athletic performances for theatres, festivals, schools, orchestras, and special events. Scrap Arts Music (aka ScrapArtsMusic) is also the name of the company’s touring percussion quintet. Scrap Arts Music performs internationally, playing original compositions by Gregory Kozak on invented instruments made from industrial scraps.  History  In 1998, composer and percussionist Gregory Kozak and designer Justine Murdy co-founded Scrap Arts Music in Vancouver Canada. Kozak wanted to build his own “orchestra of invented instruments” and Murdy thought they could use salvaged and recycled materials from their home town. Many folk instruments are handmade from local materials; this is reported to have inspired them.Noah Buchan “Canadian Artists Play That “Junky” Music”, Taipei Times August 2008. During the late 90s, there was a condominium tower boom in Vancouver. Because of this, large amounts of construction byproduct and marine salvage were being discarded in landfills. Kozak collected scraps from fabrication shops and construction sites and created a collection of musical instruments from these scraps. Each instrument is original, mobile, and tuneable, and claimed to be distinct to the west coast of Canada. Scrap Arts Music makes their instruments by upcycling industrial scraps and welding them into sculptural instruments. Materials used include spun aluminum, steel railings, submarine parts, artillery shells, old accordions, and marine exhaust hose. More recently, old street lamp shades and pulp mill parts have been incorporated into new instruments. Kozak learned the skills of welding and metal fabrication in order to create instruments. He has now built over 200 instruments from West Coast scraps that are both sculptural and mobile. Kozak composes original music to be played on these instruments by a quintet of percussionist/multi- instrumentalists. Athletic choreography is an integral feature of live performances. Scrap Arts Music gives expression to the energy and excitement of percussion-based music. Scrap Arts Music was in residency at the Banff Centre for three months in 2001 and debuted in the United States later that year, at the Philadelphia Fringe Festival. In 2002, they released the album, Phon, with nine original tracks. Also in 2002, Scrap Arts Music was nominated for a West Coast Music Award in the category of Best Live Performance. They have played for international audiences for two decades. Scrap Arts Music performs a variety of events, including concerts, educational shows, corporate events, and holiday events.Holly Harris “Unusual Requiem wraps up Festival”, “Winnipeg Free Press,” February 2009. In 2016, Scrap Arts Music relocated their studio from Vancouver to Victoria, British Columbia. Scrap Arts Music's percussion-based performances have been compared to Blue Man Group, STOMP, Partch Ensemble, Kodo Drummers of Japan, and Cirque du Soleil. Scrap Arts Music is currently represented by IMG Artists out of New York City.

The Romanian attack During the night of 27 August 1916 three Romanian small torpedo boats (the old 10-ton Rândunica and the converted hydraulic service vessels Bujorescu and Catinca, each armed with two torpedoes in wooden carriages) attacked the Austro- Hungarian Navy's Danube Flotilla stationed in the Bulgarian port of Ruse, which consisted of five monitors and four armed river boats. The objective was to sink one of the monitors, but the attack failed in its immediate purpose, as only one barge loaded with fuel was sunk (by Rândunica, commanded by Captain Constantin Niculescu-Rizea) and a quay was damaged by another torpedo. Due to this attack, however, the Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla (Commander Karl Lucich) retreated west along the Danube, stopping at Belene and subsequently taking extensive defensive measures.

The bike was first assembled in 1947 as a Series B Rapide. It came to fill two roles; one of only two factory-backed racing bikes and a development platform for Vincent's high-performance V-twin models. Gunga Din underwent extensive modification throughout its working life until it was abandoned at the factory in the mid-1950s. Rediscovered in 1960, the bike was not restored until 2009.  History  Vincent special Gunga Din at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance The motorcycle that would come to be known as Gunga Din was manufactured on 3 April 1947. It was described as a \\"rattler\\". This may have been due to the engine having been run at some point with the sump filled with kerosene rather than oil. The bike was transferred to the Experimental Section headed by factory tester and racer George Brown, where it joined Brown's \\"Cadwell Special\\" single. The cast-off Rapide was extensively modified by Brown, working with his brother Cliff and with assistance from Vincent designer Phil Irving. The bike was given serial number F10AB/1A/71, the \\"1A\\" engine designation here meaning \\"modified Rapide\\", although this code would later be used to identify White Shadow engines. (This was the second 1A built, the first having been 10AB/1A/70 built for Jack Surtees, father of John.) Brown soon put the modified Rapide, labelled \\"HRD racing solo\\", to work on the track. The \\"Gunga Din\\" name came from the title character of the Rudyard Kipling poem, and was first applied to the motorcycle in an article written by motorcycle racer and journalist Charles Markham. Markham was given Gunga Din for a weekend trial, and opened his review of the bike for the 13 November 1947 issue of Motor Cycling magazine by quoting the last lines of the poem, and by doing so named the bike. Apart from its racing duties, Gunga Din also served as the development bike for both the Black Shadow road and Black Lightning racing models. After serving as a factory racer and development mule the bike was abandoned. In 1960 the new owners of the Vincent factory allowed members of the Vincent Owners Club (VOC) to search the old property. Peter Gerrish, public relations officer for the VOC, found Gunga Din under some sacks in an out-building on the grounds. There was extensive corrosion and the front wheel was missing, but a spare Black Shadow wheel was put in place to allow the bike to be sold. At first there were no takers at the asking price of about £250. The bike was bought by American Tom Pelkey, who had Gunga Din shipped to his home in Wisconsin U.S.A. Pelkey began to sell the bike off in pieces. Richard Garrett bought as much of Gunga Din as he could, and verified the parts based on serial numbers. Without the funds to restore the bike himself, Garrett sold what he had to American Vincent collector Keith Hazelton in 1975. Hazelton continued to track down missing items, looking specifically for parts with the \\"EX\\" serial number indicating an Experimental part. Hazelton kept the disassembled Gunga Din in boxes for 30 years. Paul Holdsworth documented and photographed everything that Hazelton had. Eventually Hazelton sold the bike to Paul Pflugfelder in April 2009. Pflugfelder delivered the collected parts to Precision Automotive Restoration Inc. in Massachusetts. His instruction to Precision AR was to have the bike ready to appear at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in four months time. Motorcycle broker and amateur Vincent historian Somer Hooker used Holdsworth's pictures to certify that the bike at Pebble Beach was Gunga Din. Hooker also documented much of Gunga Din's later history. At Pebble Beach that year Gunga Din was runner-up for Best of Show to a 1954 AJS E-95 \\"Porcupine\\". At the 2010 Concours d'Elegance of America in Meadow Brook Michigan Gunga Din took Best in Show. By that time the bike had been sold to Canadian Bar Hodgson. Ginga Din appeared at Cobble Beach on 13 September 2015 and won the Margaret Dunning \\"Spirit of Driving\\" Special Award. Features Gunga Din information plaque Gunga Din's Vincent V-twin engine displaced the same as the standard Rapide's, but during the course of its active life was upgraded and rebuilt numerous times, with the bike's specifications changing steadily. The earliest rounds of internal changes included enlarged ports, triple valve springs, polished connecting rods and engine case, a lightened flywheel, and a compression ratio that had been raised from 6.8:1 to 7.3:1. The original 1 1/16 inch Amal carburettors were replaced by larger 1⅛\\" units. These changes raised power output from to . Gunga Din was originally equipped with the Brampton girder fork front suspension used on the Series B Rapides. This unit was later replaced by a prototype of the Vincent Girdraulic front suspension. At one point during its racing career Brown switched the bike back to the Brampton fork. The rear suspension was a version of the Vincent cantilever system. Over time the bike received a new Rear Frame Member (RFM), new seat, and a different petrol tank and wheels. The bike had its mudguards cut down and stands removed. Motorsports Gunga Din's racing debut was at Abridge. Brown won his heat but during the race the gearbox seized because it had not been filled with oil. This was followed by a second place at the Dunholme aerodrome. In 1948 Gunga Din set a new Standing Start Mile World Sidecar Record in Belgium with a speed of . After this came several wins in the 1000 cc class at Ansty and Haddenham. A new Standing Start Mile record was set at Sandcar along with wins at the Invitation Race at Blandford, in the Unlimited class Sprint at Tartlepool and at the Shelsley Walsh hill climb. The season was crowned by a win in the class for machines of up to 1000 cc at the first ever post-war race at Silverstone. Brown entered Gunga Din in the 1947 Isle of Man Clubman's Tourist Trophy (TT), where bike and rider managed to set fastest lap with a speed of . Brown seemed headed for a win when the bike ran out of petrol. Brown pushed the bike the remaining six miles of the 37 mile track and managed to post a sixth-place finish. When American John Edgar approached Philip Conrad Vincent (PCV) in 1948 about obtaining a bike to challenge the American speed record, PCV knew that Gunga Din had already been tuned to produce more power than the contemporary Black Shadow. Edgar was told that for the cost of a Black Shadow and a £50 premium he would have a bike that could do the job. The Edgar bike was 1B/900, the Rollie Free \\"Bathing Suit bike\\", which the factory would later refer to as the first Black Lightning. Gunga Din made three appearances in record attempts in Belgium in 1948 and 1949. In late March 1948 Phil Irving delivered the bike to a track set up on a roadway between Antwerp and Brussels, although the bike (and rider) suffered damage on the way over to the continent.The Belgian distributor supplied parts from a factory Rapide to restore the bike to roadable condition. With registration number JRO 389 and in Black Shadow tune the bike challenged the Kilometre Lancée records for both solo and sidecar times. Ridden by Belgian racer René Milhoux, Gunga Din set new records for both classes. In September of the same year Gunga Din returned to Belgium, but now with MkII cams, a 13:1 compression ratio, and two 32 mm Amal carburettors jetted to run on methanol. On a stretch of autobahn near Jabbeke closed for the attempt and with official timekeepers in attendance Milhoux was able to set new world records for the kilometre and mile distances with sidecar, and a new record for solo attained by a Belgian national, one day after Rollie Free had taken the American record on 1B/900. In September 1949 both the bike and Milhoux returned to Jabbeke. On this attempt an error in marking the course distances prevented the team from officially taking anything but a new five-mile record. Gunga Din was taken to Montlhéry in 1952 as part of a contingent of seven Vincent bikes to set new speed records. Gunga Din was there as a test mule, and did not participate in the record attempt. For the Montlhéry runs PCV had the engine crankcase replaced with one of the newer ones with \\"Vincent\\" in raised letters. The restored bike has reverted to the older-style \\"HRD\\"-labelled crankcases. Gunga Din's final public appearance before being retired was in 1953 in Ireland, where it set a speed record of . The run is said to have taken place on public roads, on the Carrigrohane straight. Gunga Din indirectly made one other record attempt when its engine, in Black Lightning tune, was installed in the Vincent 3-wheeler prototype and driven by Ted Davis to match his earlier sidecar record during Practice Day at Snetterton Circuit. The engine blew up during the attempt and was rebuilt again, this time with a Picador-style bottom end.

Wish was founded in 2010 by Piotr Szulczewski (CEO) and Danny Zhang (former CTO). Wish is operated by ContextLogic Inc. in San Francisco, United States. The platform employs browsing technologies which personalise shopping visually for each customer, rather than relying on a search bar format. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers. Wish works with payment service providers to handle payments and does not stock the products themselves or manage returns. History Wish was started by Piotr Szulczewski, a former Google engineer, as a software company called ContextLogic. In September 2010, ContextLogic received $1.7 million in investments and involved Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. In May 2011, Szulczewski invited college friend Danny Zhang to relaunch the company as Wish. It was created as an application that allowed shoppers to create wish lists of their favorite products before matching them with merchants. They also earned revenue with a Pay-per-click model by advertising on Facebook. In 2013, Szulczewski met with Hans Tung, an investor with GGV Capital in Menlo Park, California and noted that a large number of sales were coming from Florida, Texas and the Mid-West rather than New York or California. Wish became an e-commerce site after asking merchants to host their products directly on the Wish application, with Wish taking a portion of each sale. In 2017, Wish signed a multi-year partnership with the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers. Wish conducted a World Cup campaign in 2018, that featured Neymar Junior, Paul Pogba, Tim Howard, Gareth Bale, Robin Van Persie, Claudio Bravo and Gianluigi Buffon. In 2018, Wish was the most-downloaded shopping application worldwide. The company doubled its revenue to $1.9 billion. As of 2019 it is the third-biggest e-commerce marketplace in the United States by sales. In August 2019, Wish received a Series H funding round, led by equity firm General Atlantic, taking the company's assets to $11.2 billion. JD.com is an investor in Wish. Services The Wish platform employs browsing technologies which personalise shopping visually for each customer rather than relying on a search bar format. More than 1 million merchants list their products on Wish’s platform to sell directly to consumers, eliminating distributor fees for the sellers while providing shoppers with low-priced merchandise. The bulk of merchandise available through the app comes from China and other overseas distributors. Products are usually smaller items which are cheaper to ship, aided by an agreement between China Post and the U.S. Postal Service which lowers costs of shipping for goods weighing less than 2kg. Wish offers Express Shipping in 5 days, or 6-8 days in some cases, as well as standard shipping that takes 2-3 weeks, for customers who prioritize savings over speed of delivery. Wish’s ‘wheel of fortune’-style game, Blitz Buy, integrates a layer of gamification to offer consumers additional discounts on top-selling items. The Wish application is available for download on iOS and Android and has been the most downloaded shopping app in the United States. Criticism Wish has been criticized for listing poor quality or counterfeit goods, a common concern among major e-commerce sites which feature independent sellers. Customers have complained about lack of communication from sellers and quality. As a result, Szulczewski has hired Connie Chang of Facebook to organize a community of about 10,000 Wish users to expose unsatisfactory dealers in exchange for free goods and discounts. It is possible to purchase items from Wish which are illegal in the purchaser's country. In January 2020, a man from Nelson, United Kingdom, was sentenced to 11 months in prison for purchasing a stun gun via Wish. Wish's advertisements on social media have been criticised for \\"unfathomable\\" recommendations, with one such 2020 advert claiming that the late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was available to buy on the site for $20.Saddam Hussein has been put up for sale on Wish.com.

It replaces the previous category A, category B, category C (instead split into the categories of \\"mainstream sports\\" and \\"national news\\"), and premium classifications.https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-86.htmhttps://crtc.gc.ca/eng/television/services/types.htmhttps://applications.crtc.gc.ca/radio- tv-cable/eng/broadcasting-services-list Discretionary services may air programming from any of the CRTC's defined categories, although no more than 10% of programming per month may be devoted to live professional sports. Discretionary services may offer multiplex channels with CRTC permission.  Background  As part of \\"Let's Talk TV\\", a CRTC initiative to reform Canada's broadcasting industry, the Commission announced in 2015 that it would phase out its previous \\"genre protection\\" rules, which forbade services with Category B licenses from directly competing with those with Category A licenses (which carried more stringent obligations on their owners, and must be offered by all television providers). The Commission felt that these restrictions were \\"no longer needed to ensure programming diversity between services\\", as \\"[they] limited programming services to offering certain types of programming and precluded other services from offering that programming.\\" As part of these changes, the CRTC began transitioning all pay and specialty services to standardized conditions of license. In November 2016, per a request by DHX Media, the previous premium television designation (which was designed for pay television services such as The Movie Network, and restricted the carriage of commercial advertising, but could consist of multiple feeds consistent with their scope of service) was also removed, merging them into the discretionary services category and allowing them to, if they choose, transition to advertising-supported formats.

Content This book deals with usury, which is a matter that was very discussed by the medieval Canon law. According to the index, it consisted in twenty-eight chapters, but only fourteen have been preserved. Moreover, there are five chapters of this work that are literally copied in the Terç del Crestià (Third Book of the Christian), in the part of this book that deals with the sin of avarice.Chapter 1 of the Tractat d'Usura corresponds almost exactly with chapter 760 of the Terç del Crestià, chapter 2 of the Tractat d'Usura with the 761 of the Terç del Crestià, chapter 3 of the Tractat d'Usura' corresponds almost exactly with chapter 762 of the Terç del Crestià, chapter 4 of the Tractat d'Usura corresponds almost exactly with chapter 763 of the Terç del Crestià, and chapter 8 of the Tractat d'Usura corresponds almost exactly with chapter 764 of the Terç del Crestià. For further information vide Brines, Lluís. Biografia documentada de Francesc Eiximenis. València. AVL. To be published. Pp. 159 ss. In the preserved part, Francesc Eiximenis has in general a restrictive point of view regarding usury. The starting point is Luke 6, 35, which says that if anything is lent, nothing else must be demanded in exchange. It has a relationship also with the general principle of Christian charity, which is so important in the Franciscan school, to which he belongs. Nevertheless, he accepts some cases, where usury could be allowed. He accepts also the lawfulness of the censals and violaris, that would be the right to get an income for a certain period, or even for a lifetime after paying a certain amount of money. They were very common in Catalonia and the Crown of Aragon during the Middle Ages, and this matter was very discussed in medieval Canon law. The source that Eiximenis uses in order to justify the lawfulness of censals and violaris is a short treatise about this matter that was written by the Dominican Bernat de Puigcercós.Brines, Lluís. La Filosofia Social i Política de Francesc Eiximenis. Sevilla. 2004. Pp. 378 ss. Influences This book is influenced by several Canon law sources. Therefore, together with classical works of medieval Canon law such as the Gratian's Decree or the Decretals of Gregori IX, several important canonists can be pointed out: Henry of Segusio, saint Raymond of Penyafort or Geoffrey of Trani. The influence of other scholastical authors such as the Franciscans Alexander of Alessandria and Duns Scotus and even the Dominicans (although Eiximenis himself was a Franciscan) saint Thomas Aquinas and Durandus of Saint-Pourçain is also remarkable.Hernando i Delgado, Josep. “El Tractat d’usura de Francesc Eiximenis”.

His media include painting, etching, silk screen, and collage.  Life and career  Joseph Holston was raised in the small black community of Hawkins Lane, a rural area of suburban Washington, D.C. His work reflects a strong sense of black identity nurtured by his upbringing in that close-knit community. In 1960 the family moved to Washington, DC, where Holston was accepted into the commercial art program at Chamberlain Vocational High School. Holston worked as a commercial artist/illustrator from 1964 to 1970. He also pursued independent study by enrolling in art classes throughout the Washington, DC area. These included classes with the noted portraitist Marcos Blahove (1928-2012).\\"Aaron Copland\\" (http://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2004.4)https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/marcos- blahove-obituary?pid=160583025 During the summer of 1971 Holston traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico to study with artist, Richard Vernon Goetz (1915-1991), a well-known portrait, landscape, and still-life painter.\\"Paint What You See (Part 2)-Richard V.

It premiered on 31 October 2017 as part of the 60th DOK Leipzig in Germany.  Film Content  The documentary explores the private and professional life of HIV-positive human rights activist Ortwin Passon. More than twenty years has passed since the AIDS related death of his boyfriend. Passon himself, however, is still alive - against his own expectations. The film investigates several philosophical and legal themes while following Passon in his normal life volunteering at Germany’s Federal Agency for Technical Relief as well as attending bareback sex parties. The connection between his private and his professional life becomes obvious, when Ortwin meets his doctoral adviser to work on a Doctoral Thesis about barebacking as a basic human right - the right of HIV positive men to have unprotected anal sex.  Production  The film is a production by the Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg and was made during André Krummel's third year at film school. Krummel met Passon by chance in a café in 2013. Shooting took place the following three years in a team of two together with Krummel’s assistant director and sound recordist Erik Lemke.  Reception  Christian Eichler from the German internet radio and podcast label Detektor.fm says André Krummel uses the film to draw a sensitive portrait with many unanswered questions. The film has been marked as controversial due to scenes of a sexual nature and explicit drug use. The documentary received further positive press from the online magazine Berliner Filmfestivals, stating that the film remained \\"very close\\" to the protagonist and makes an \\"important contribution to the discussion of sexual morality and perversion.\\"  Awards  After the Future premiered at DOK Leipzig in 2017 and received an Honorary Mention in the German Competition for Long Documentary and Animated Film Award. It was further nominated for several awards, including the ver.di Prize for Solidarity, Humanity and Fairness and the DEFA Sponsoring Award.

Publishers Ltd. at London in 1975. The book presents a vivid chronicle of the Chitral Campaign and the heroic efforts of the British Indian Army in 1895. It narrates how Queen Victoria rules over nearly a quarter of the earth's land surface, with the brightest jewel in her crown being India. Yet the might of the Raj is not to go unchallenged in the high mountains of the Hindu Kush. The State of Chitral which had till then existed as a buffer between British and Russian spheres of influence and tilted towards the Government of India in the second half of the 19th century, with the death of the Mehtar of Chitral in 1892 descends into civil war. A small British force led by Surgeon-Major George Scott Robertson is caught up in the Fort at Chitral which was to come under siege for seven weeks while a relief force was organised. The book narrates the follies of a vanished age.  Overview  Following the death of the Chief of Chitral Aman ul-Mulk in 1892, power in the state changes hands several times in the next few years. In early 1895, when it seems that the situation is finally coming back to normalcy the reigning Chief is murdered and conflict over the succession once again erupts. A small British force ends up being besieged in the Chitral Fort. The book presents a graphic account of the build up and the actual siege before elucidating how it is lifted. The intervention of Umra Khan a Pathan Chief, during this period of uncertainty, brings an unexpectedly large hostile forces on the scene. The British force at Chitral fights the invaders but are heavily outnumbered and forced to retreat into the Chitral Fort. The besieged forces then spend a month and a half defending an aging fort with rationed supplies and limited ammunition. Meanwhile two forces are dispatched to relieve the siege. An army of some 15,000 under the command of General Sir Robert Low set out from near Peshawar, fighting battle along the way, when met with resistance from the locals. Another smaller army under the command of Colonel James Graves Kelly marches from Gilgit over the Shandur Pass, bringing with it two mountain guns as it marches through the snow and a series of defiles. The author switches between the different fronts to maintain suspense and generally tells a good story. John Harris offers a glimpses of the Great Game, an old-fashioned defense of British imperialism, and repetition of contemporary clichés.

Leifer, a dual Israeli-Australian citizen, fled under suspicious circumstances shortly before a warrant could be issued, and she has remained in Israel and the West Bank since 2008, under varying levels of police and court supervision, pending the resolution of her extradition case. Allegations of further victims in the West Bank were made in June 2018. The degree of freedom she has enjoyed in Israel has prompted worldwide media coverage and criticism of Israel's justice system; activist Manny Waks described the case as \\"a farce\\" and \\"an embarrassment\\". Leifer lived an apparently normal life for some time in the Israeli settlement of Emmanuel, despite a court ruling that she was mentally unfit for proceedings. She was eventually re-arrested after media and police scrutiny of her behavior, but has continued to evade extradition, with more than 70 court hearings and appeals requested by her legal team, and with delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, after more than a decade as a fugitive, the Jerusalem District Court ordered Leifer extradited to Australia. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded over AU$1 million against the school, and also $150,000 exemplary damages personally against Leifer. Australian police confirm there is an ongoing investigation into the actions of some members of the Adass Israel community in helping her leave Australia. Israeli police have likewise opened an investigation into officials, including former Minister of Health Yaakov Litzman, who may have interfered with Leifer's case. Background The Adass Israel community is a Hasidic Jewish group in Melbourne that traces its origins to a split in the Elwood Shule in the early 1940s; some of its early members were boys and men who had been sent to Australia by the British on the infamous Dunera in 1941. The community's synagogue is in Ripponlea, and its school and chevra kadisha (Jewish funeral society) are located in nearby Elsternwick. The community is \\"ultra-Orthodox\\". Children are raised without television, internet, radio, but have access to Jewish newspapers or magazines that cover worldly matters. After the age of eight, boys and girls are kept entirely separate outside family homes, and the stories they are told never involve friendships between boys and girls. There is no sex education in schools but before marriage the bride and groom attend educational classes to discuss sex and other topics about marriage. The Rabbi of the community acts as the ultimate authority for members. Allegations of abuse In 2007, a woman in Israel, Dassi Erlich, sought counseling when she started to have recurrent nightmares and anxiety about events that had taken place at Adass Israel School when she was in high school. These incidents allegedly happened at the hands of Leifer, the principal of the school. After an arranged marriage in 2006, Erlich had moved to Israel with her husband. In February 2008, Erlich's therapist in Israel contacted a psychologist in Melbourne, who, in turn, contacted a senior teacher she knew at the school. The information passed on is that there were substantial allegations of \\"inappropriate conduct\\" by Leifer. The teacher phoned Erlich, and was convinced of the claims that there had been \\"clearly sexualised behaviour\\" by Leifer and that \\"important boundaries had been crossed\\". The teacher then confronted Leifer who denied that there was any problem and subsequently reported the matter to two senior rabbis and with other rabbis, a barrister and a psychologist. There was a meeting arranged with the president and some members of the school board. Leifer was telephoned at the meeting and denied the allegations, saying: \\"You have destroyed my reputation. I'm not going to stand for this.\\" Extradition case The evening that the allegations came to light, in March 2008, the wife of a school board member rang a travel agent to say a flight to Israel was needed urgently. The school arranged, paid and booked tickets for Leifer and four of her eight children on an aircraft that departed at 1:20 am the same night, without having informed the police. The police later investigated the school. Leifer's husband, Rabbi Yaakov Yosef (Jacob) Leifer, also fled to Israel with her, where he now heads the small Chust Hassidic community in Emmanuel where he and his wife have been living since 2016. In June 2018, Emmanuel was cited as a \\"haven for paedophiles\\" by The Sydney Morning Herald, which exposed further alleged child sexual abuse there by Leifer, committed \\"without consequence.\\" Following investigations by the police, a warrant was issued for 74 child sex offences concerning at least eight pupils, and an extradition request was placed with Israel. Leifer was then arrested in Israel in August 2014, and placed under house arrest in Bnei Brak where she was required to wear an electronic tag. At the extradition hearings, Leifer claimed that she suffered extreme anxiety and panic attacks in the lead up to the hearing, and she received a delay; she has since deferred the hearings numerous times claiming mental health issues, with one judge suggesting that the case could potentially be delayed up to a decade. In June 2016 an Israeli court suspended Leifer's extradition hearings and home detention altogether, requiring only six-monthly psychiatric reviews to determine whether she could attend court in Israel. In February 2018, Leifer was arrested by Israeli police after an investigation into whether she had systematically feigned mental illness to avoid extradition. The police investigation followed revelations by private investigators who captured over 200 hours of video of Leifer showing her leading a normal life, even though her defense team claimed that she was incapacitated due to her illness. Her legal team claimed that the arrest and the re-opening of the case was due to political pressure from Australia, and not a legal matter. A new assessment has shown her fit to stand trial in Australia, but the extradition has been held back temporarily to allow her legal team to review the new information. She is being kept in detention rather than house arrest. Rosenbaum Communications public relations firm owner Ronen Tzur led a strategic smear campaign to block Leifer's extradition. Subsequent to exposure of the project by the Yedioth Ahronoth, Leifer cut ties with Tzur, with her attorney, Yehuda Freid, calling the campaign “inappropriate”. On 7 March 2018, the judge ruled that Leifer was to be released, while further investigation was to take place. She was released into the custody of Rabbi Yitzchak Dovid Grossman, who had given testimony in her favor, claiming it was a \\"humiliation\\" for her to remain in custody. In 2016, Grossman had also twice appeared before a court in South Africa to negotiate the release from prison of former Shuvu Banim Torah Academy school dean Rabbi Eliezer Berland, who later confessed to rape and assault. Grossman soon withdrew his support, and Leifer was ordered held in Israel's only women's prison until extradition proceedings are complete. The Jerusalem District Court then remanded the alleged perpetrator and ordered a second round of psychiatric testing to see she is fit to stand trial for extradition.http://www.jwire.com.au/new-delay-in-leifer-extradition-process- survivors-frustrating-but-making-progress/ The court's medical committee returned its ruling in July 2019, finding that the accused had faked mental illness to elude extradition. On 15 March 2020 Justice Minister Amir Ohana announced that non-urgent court activity would be frozen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 26 May 2020, the Israeli Court held that Leifer was fit to stand trial for extradition to Australia. The Court rejected Leifer’s claim of mental illness that she has been asserting since extradition proceedings were initiated in 2014. On 21 September 2020, the Israeli Court ordered the extradition of Leifer to Australia.  Dassi Erlich and civil case  One of the alleged victims of the case, Dassi Erlich came out publicly in March 2017, and began campaigning for the extradition and changes in the Adass community. In 2015, prior to the public revelation of her name, Erlich sued the school in a civil case. In September 2015, after the school had refused to settle out of court, a civil case in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne awarded Erlich $1.27 million in damages against the Adass Israel School and the alleged perpetrator. As part of her evidence, Erlich described the extreme sexual naivety of the children in the community, and how that was used against her, even being unaware of the most basic elements of relationships and any sexual activity. This continued through high school, and after when Erlich was given a job at the school, where the abuse continued. The judge Jack Rush said \\"that the sexual abuse occurred under the guise of Jewish education by the headmistress of the school makes the breach of trust associated with the abuse monstrous. The evidence discloses the sole motivation of the suspect in her dealings with the plaintiff was her own sexual gratification.\\" He described the breach of trust as evil, and ordered the perpetrator to personally pay $150,000 exemplary damages to Erlich. Justice Rush said that, at the time Leifer had left, the president of the school board knew of eight additional allegations of sexual abuse on other girls. The school had had an obligation to report the matters to the police before arranging her departure. He rejected the school's argument that it had been a legal obligation to pay her air fares. The school argued that it was not liable because it was the congregation, not the school, that was the employer, but the judge also rejected this. Two of Erlich's sisters, Ellie Sapper and Nicole Meyer, who had also been abused, received out of court settlements from the school independent of this case. Erlich has since remained in the public eye, campaigning for the return of Leifer, and for abuse survivors, including meeting with many communal leaders and politicians. Her coming forward to the secular authorities have made her a traitor in the eyes of some in her community, which she has subsequently left.  Aftermath  Meir Shlomo Kluwgant was appointed principal of Adass Israel school in June 2017. There was significant anger in the community with the appointment, because of Kluwgant's role in the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. In February 2015, he stepped down from his numerous communal posts at the time because of his response to the evidence of the father of a sexual abuse victim at another ultra-Orthodox school in Melbourne. He had sent a text message to the editor of the Australian Jewish News, accusing the father of being a \\"a lunatic on the fringe, guilty of neglecting his own children\\". The father's evidence had been that his family had been targeted and ostracised by religious leaders when he had gone public with his allegations. The Victorian minister of education said he understood the concern and asked for an explanation from the school. The head of Adass Israel, Rabbi Zvi Beck asked for further consultation on the appointment. In August 2017, Kluwgant resigned from the school. In 2018 Kluwgant commenced an action for defamation against a spokesman for the victims at the school who, he claimed, had contacted the school when his pending appointment was announced, to say he was \\"the scum of the earth\\" and later to call for him to be dismissed.  Political interventions  In October 2017, Erlich and two of her sisters went to Israel to campaign for Leifer's extradition, meeting the Minister of Justice, the senior prosecutor in the department of international affairs and members of the Knesset. The following month the Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull met his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu and raised the matter of the delayed extradition with him. Two successive premiers of Victoria have been supporting the efforts to extradite Leifer. Ted Baillieu has supported the family, and helped set up the meeting between Malcolm Turnbull and Erlich, Sapper and Meyer. Baillieu also accompanied the sisters to Israel to meet with officials there. Daniel Andrews, also raised the case with Netanyahu who said he will have a fresh look at the situation. David Southwick, who represents the electorate of Caulfield, where the school is located, presented a petition of 17,000 signatures which he delivered in July 2017 to lawmakers in Israel. Federally, the extradition of Leifer remains a bi-partisan issue, with Mark Dreyfus confirming that Labor would continue to pressure for her to face justice in Australia. Members of the Jewish community have also called for the extradition. Israeli victim advocates and assault survivors rallied outside the Jerusalem District Court in March 2019, calling for Leifer to be deported. In February 2019, it was revealed that Israel's deputy health minister, Yaakov Litzman, was questioned by police on the suspicion that he had been using his position to prevent the extradition. It was alleged that Litzman pressured doctors to falsify psychiatric evaluations that deem Leifer unfit to stand trial, therefore preventing her extradition. Litzman claimed that everything he did was legal, and that he was acting \\"for the good of the public\\". Like Leifer, Litzman is a Gur Hassid; it was revealed that Leifer had previously held a position at a school run by the ultra- Orthodox group.

El Puente was founded in 1982 by the late Luis Garden Acosta, and co-founded with Eugenio Maldonado, and Dr. Frances Lucerna. Garden-Acosta's mission during this time was to stop the epidemic wave of violence due to youth gang/drug activity and street violence. El Puente's initiatives focus on fighting for a wide variety of social justice issues, including racial, environmental, immigration, educational, economic, housing justice, just to name a few. As a renowned Latinx art's and cultural institution, El Puente does most of its activism through various visual and performative art forms.  History  El Puente was first formed when leaders of the Williamsburg/Greenpoint community united to stop the youth from involving in gang violence in the area. Their motives were to fight and stop teen violence and health issues, like asthma which was a result of harmful pollutants being released into the community. The organization of El Puente created by Luis Garden Acosta and the community in 1982, was brought to life from the contributions by the students in Academy For Peace and Justice, that opened in the 1990s. Youth groups are the main focus of El Puente because of the value they placed on the environment and because they are the future of Brooklyn. El Puente means “the bridge” in Spanish, which symbolizes the progress they want to make from where the community is right now, to a place that they envision their community to be. They believe that a strong, united community is the key to success in moving forward. = Leader/Founder: Luis Garden Acosta = Luis Garden Acosta, a human rights activist, is the founder and president of a community and youth development organization in Brooklyn, New York. His drive to create peace and prevent injustices at the local and international scale was his reason to create the El Puente activist group in 1982. Luis Garden Acosta, son to a Puerto Rican mother and Dominican father, was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1945. His initial life plan was to become a Catholic priest, however, after years of pursuing his career, Acosta's life plan changed after hearing a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., which lead to his decision on becoming a political activist. Acosta has a diverse career background as he worked as community organizer, public health researcher, educator, and hospital director. He was also a member of the Young Lords Party, a Puerto Rican civil and human rights groups equivalent to the Black Panther Party. In January 2019, Acosta passed away from lung diease.  Education initiatives = El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice = El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice, founded by Frances Lucerna and El Puente facilitators in 1993, is located in south Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. Members of the latinx community started El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice to produce a sense community for youth. The school is a theme-oriented public high school, known as a “new vision high school,” which is part of a movement to improve schools in the education system as well.Dryfoos, Joy G. (1998). Safe passage: Making it through adolescence in a risky society. North Central Regional Educational Lab., Oak Brook, IL. Retrieved from: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED425225.pdf A theme-oriented school is one that is molded around a curriculum with certain theme, which in this case works towards helping their community provide a safe space for their students. The El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice programs provide meals as well as after school programs which are staffed by local members of the community in an effort to give students the means to make the school a safe space. The school aims to foster both individual and community growth within the schooling system by incorporating students’ identities and experiences into the curriculum. This brings cultural practices from within the household and integrates them into the students’ education.Moll, L. C. & Gonzalez, N. (2002). Cruzando el Puente: Building bridges to funds of knowledge. Educational Policy, 16(4), 623-641. The teachers help students understand the issues in their surrounding community so they can take action and make a change. Students learn ways to address possible social issues in their communities by discussing topics such as environmental racism and human rights in their classes and in doing so are given tools enabling them to attempt to create change in the overall atmosphere of the community to make it a more positive and progressive one. Performance and visual arts are an integral aspect of their teaching, which allow students to share their knowledge to the public via art galleries, performances, and other forms of visual and performing arts. As a result, the knowledge that they obtain in school can be spread into the community.  Environmental Justice Action Initiatives = Hurricane Maria Disaster Relief in Puerto Rico = El Puente has worked to aid latinx communities including people affected by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. In 2013, El Puente started a group with around 100 members, called Enlance Latino de Accion Climatica, or Latino Climate Action Network, that were tasked with helping the affected areas. Ten thousand Ekotek solar lanterns, which provided light, radio access, and a charging port for cell phones, were distributed to Puerto Rican residents who did not have access to electricity. The lanterns gave people connection to the rest of the world, as well as families. In addition, El Puente facilitated food distribution, and rose the awareness of climate change through informational booklets.(2016). \\"El Puente Climate Change in Our Community:What We Can Do to Protect Our Families and Our Communities.\\" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Technical Assistance Services for Communities Program. http://www.walkablewatershed.com/wp- content/uploads/2016/10/El_Puente_Booklet.pdf The first-ever Leadership Summit on Climate Change in Puerto Rico was possible because of El Puente's efforts. At the summit five Executive Orders were issued. The Executive Orders addressed climate change concerns that included the development of gas infrastructure and implementing initiatives for energy renewal. = Contesting the Building of an Incinerator = El Puente, in conjunction with the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg (UJO), prevented the construction of a massive incinerator in the Williamsburg area by protesting at the construction site. The plans if the incinerator indicate that it was supposed to be 55 stories tall. The incinerator was projected to burn up to 2,550 tons of trash a day. The two groups effectively deterred the process long enough for scientific research to be published, providing evidence regarding the harmful effects of burning garbage. This resulted in the Department of Sanitation being required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement. Funds were put into facilitating a study which proved that the levels of toxic pollution that would have been produced by the incinerator would exceed health regulations. The construction project was ultimately terminated. = Toxic Avengers = El Puente initially joined the environmental justice movement by starting a group called the Toxic Avengers. The Toxic Avengers are primarily latinx teenagers who protest environmental injustices. In 1988, students that were enrolled in science class taught by Jose MoralesProut, L. R. (1992). The Toxic Avengers. EPA Journal, 18(1), 48. initiated a teen group that focused on the importance of education, and knowledge to put a stop to a nearby radioactive waste storage and transfer facility Corburn, J. (2002). Combining community-based research and local knowledge to confront asthma and subsistence-fishing hazards in Greenpoint/Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Vol 110. 241-248. located one block from a local elementary school. The group relayed information about environmental hazards affecting local communities. The Toxic Avengers held Workshops, rallies, lectures, and marches to teach the community about the present pollution and to encourage the residents to become active. In 1992, the Toxic Avengers disbanded and are no longer a group. = Campaign Against Radiac Research Corporation = The Radiac Research Corporation has owned a radioactive waste plant in Williamsburg, New York since 1969. The plant has been highly debated and has been challenged by community protests for over 20 years. A bill was passed by the state legislature which requires the company to relocate the waste facility on the premise that it is only three blocks from a public school. El Puente has been involved in contesting the continuation of the plant. Specifically, the students of El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice helped to draft the bill which has been integral to making real strides towards relocation of the plant.  Health initiatives = Action against asthma in Brooklyn New York = According to the American Journal of Public Health, asthma has become a label increasingly associated with latinx groups.Acosta L. G., & Garden C. C. I., & Ledogar, R. J., & Penchaszadeh A. (2000). Asthma and latino cultures: Different prevalence reported among groups sharing the same environment. American Journal of Public Health. 90(6), 929-935. Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York is a predominantly latinx that live with hazardous air quality and conditions that cause these high rates of asthma. In this town in New York, one of the primary causes of the air pollution is from waste transfer stations. El Puente initiative is to take action against these harmful air pollutants by conducting citizen science within their community, otherwise known as community-based participatory research (CBPR). They have partnered with Centro Internacional de Epidemiología Tropical (CIET), an international organization whose purpose is to help community voices be heard. CIET helped El Puente create and administer surveys throughout the community to so they could properly collect data on the community and their health in relation with the pollution and air quality in the area. The American Journal of Public Health researched the asthma rates conducted by El Puente's surveys, It was found that the effects of asthma in the latinx community within Williamsburg and Greenpoint varied depending on the latinx group. The two latinx groups compared were Puerto Rican and Dominican people, who showed the highest percentage of asthma among different latinx and Hispanic groups in the area. The study found that Puerto Ricans were more at risk than Dominicans because most Dominicans use homeopathic remedies while many Puerto Ricans do not. Through this study and other studies El Puente has done in researching the correlation of asthma rates in their community has shown a link to their hazardous environments including pollution and air quality. El Puente have been able to take action with the knowledge they have gained from their research by educating their community. = Vaccination initiatives = To provide health care for all one of El Puente health initiatives is to work towards providing better health care to their latinx communities.

The Academy was awarded New York State Governor's \\"Decade of the Ch Id Award\\" for leading New York in “community-based vaccination campaigns”. El Puente has promoted the greatest immunization effort against childhood illnesses within New York, evidence to the strength of their movement. = HIV/AIDS Awareness Campaign = As part of El Puente's goal to improve their local community, they are working towards HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. The reason for their interest in the HIV/AIDS awareness campaign is because there is a connection between Puerto Ricans and HIV/AIDS. The efforts towards fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic could not be done without the co-foundation of Latino Commission on AIDS and initiation of the ongoing HIV/AIDS Adolescent Drama Company: Teatro El Puente in America. El Puente has been awarded grants that lend a hand to fighting HIV/AIDS. One grant of $214,000 was used for prevention programs for illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, focusing on education measures. These programs include after school wellness activities, service programs, and performances, and events to raise awareness.Miller, H. G., Turner, C. F., Moses, L. E., & National Research Council. (1990). AIDS and adolescents. = Williamsburg Neighborhood-Based Alliance = Leaders of El Puente and UJO as well as other community nonprofits created the Williamsburg Neighborhood Based Alliance (WNBA) to investigate public and individual housing, day care, and health care. This helped further health care initiatives, but it was a uniting point between the Hasidic Jews and the Hispanic communities. A power struggle between these two groups had resulted in violence and hate crimes. However, the communities decided to combine forces in order to combat environmental injustice and protect the health of the people living in Williamsburg, New York. This historic moment in creating the WNBA inspired the formation of the Community Alliance for the Environment (CAE)-- a group working for environmental justice initiatives that also reflects the ethnic composition of the Williamsburg area within the organization. The WNBA and the CAE have been involved in the lead poisoning awareness campaign, the incinerator prevention, and have worked to combat radioactive wastes.  Using arts to communicate with the local community  Luis Acosta and the other founders of El Puente highly values the importance of using arts as a bridge for communication and as a teaching tool for the local communities in the Williamsburg area. The Williamsburg, Brooklyn communities have suffered from gang violence, environmental deterioration, and poverty, which are often associated with the high percentage of people of color that made up the majority of the communities. El Puente prioritizes the importance of education outreach with the community and the youth, especially preventing the younger generations from affiliating themselves with gang- related activities. The implementation of arts and culture is one of the main curriculums in the academy in order to expand the students’ perspectives on many of the contemporary social, environmental, and political issues. They believe that “art is the process through which students develop—and through which they can explore the environment, public health, economic development, and other issues that affect their lives”. El Puente's project-based curriculum includes a year-long project for students to use arts to discover different social, environmental, and political issues, and connect them to their own living experiences. The use of research-based project allows the students to experience the process of researching factual and relevant information to their topics, and also provides them the opportunity to present their researches to their surrounding communities. An example from one of the past projects was on the topic of garment industry. A group of students presented a public show with displays of rap, dance, and fashion show to address the issues and injustices occurring in the sweatshops by broadcasting the reality behind the fashion industry. The displays of entertainment not only created relationship development within the community, it also contained educational value which people in the community can learn about a serious ongoing issue. Another example of using arts to create educational outreach and unify a community was the protest against the building of a garbage incinerator in the Williamsburg area. In the protest, a group of students from El Puente Academy of Peace and Justice created a 10-foot tall “incinerator monster” as a symbol of the threat and danger the facility will be to the community.

The series featured cartoons from Warner Bros.' library of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts. A weekly companion series, The Daffy Duck Show aired on Saturday mornings from 1996 to 1997. This series is not to be confused with Cartoon Network's former block of Warner shorts, The Bugs & Daffy Show. History and Format That's Warner Bros.! premiered on September 11, 1995 as part of Kids' WB's inaugural season, on their weekday lineup alongside classic episodes of Animaniacs. The show's title sequence reutilized the opening for the Fox Kids version of Merrie Melodies Starring Bugs Bunny & Friends, now scored with a jazzy rendition of \\"Merrily We Roll Along\\" and with a different ending showing the show's title. 65 episodes were created featuring three cartoons in each, with a \\"Hip Clip\\" (a holdover from Merrie Melodies) placed in between the second and third shorts to fill up any remaining time. Unlike Merrie Melodies before it, not every episode featured a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The following season, That's Warner Bros.! was renamed Bugs 'n' Daffy, which brought forth several changes to the format. Each show now began with a new title sequence set to an original theme song by Animaniacs composer Randy Rogel. In addition, the cartoons' staff credits were cut, leaving only a shot of their titles with a sting based on the theme song playing underneath them. Other than these changes, the contents of the original 65 episodes remained mostly the same. For the 1997–98 season, a new set of 65 episodes were created. Thanks to Time Warner's merger with Turner Broadcasting System on October 10, 1996, Warner Bros. had regained the broadcast rights to Turner's package of color Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies made before August 1948; at least one cartoon from the pre-1948 package was included in each episode (though some aired on The Daffy Duck Show first). Because of the lengths of those shorts, not every episode featured a \\"Hip Clip\\". Bugs 'n' Daffy was removed from the Kids' WB lineup at the start of the 1998–99 season, although some affiliates were allowed to air the series as a replacement for Tiny Toon Adventures. =The Daffy Duck Show= On November 23, 1996, a companion series titled The Daffy Duck Show began airing on Kids' WB's Saturday morning lineup as a replacement for the low-rated Freakazoid!.

This allows other individuals or organizations other than the land owners to purchase rights to resources below the surface. These parties also receive use of surface resources-such as wood or water- to facilitate gathering the resources below ground. Based on English legal theory but an American creation from the early 1900s, the broad form deed was used by land and coal companies in many states within the Appalachian Region.  Early history = Details = 1908 drift coal mine in West Virginia. Photograph by Lewis Hine. An American creation, the broad form deed did more than just transfer the title of all the mineral rights along with mining rights. The holder was also granted rights to do what they deemed necessary to locate minerals, create any infrastructure needed to amass and relocate the minerals, utilize any resources on the land for mining purpose (like trees or water), and allowed the holder to not be held liable over any damages or the condition of the land and water during or after mining. Views of land ownership at the time typically considered the owner to own from the center of the earth to the sky above. The broad form deed altered this view legally which bears the question of what legal precedent was in place that allowed for this severance to occur. = Royal mines = The broad form deed is based on the premise of severing the surface and mineral rights of property. The precedence of this idea comes from English legal theory. In this theory the King retained rights to various minerals on landowners estates for the purposes of maintaining the operations of the country and as such the King had authority to mine for those minerals. This precedence goes back to at least 1567 when the Earl of Northumberland disputed the Queen of England's right to minerals on his estate. Many charters for American colonies included clauses dedicating specified amounts of precious metals to the crown. After the American Revolution states sought control of mineral rights, however laws regarding control and ownership of mineral rights shifted and changed over time. Pressure for materials to fuel the industrial revolution resulted in development of new applications of estate severance based on the previous concepts; this included the broad form deed. = Early impact of purchased rights = The selling of mineral rights began before the creation of the broad form deed. During the late 1880s in East Tennessee the people that lived in the mountains were reported to be hospitable and open with the mineral buyers and travelers. This shifted to hostility by 1900 as they considered some methods by the companies to acquire land to be deceitful. An example of practices that distanced the locals was that of gaining the land by forcing the land to be sold at public auction. They did this by purchasing rights to land from one of several heirs and upon the other heirs refusing to sell using the court system to force the land to be sold. = John CC Mayo creates deed = John C.C. Mayo As schoolteacher from rural eastern Kentucky, John CC Mayo managed to accumulate quite a bit of wealth by purchasing mineral rights. He began by entering into a partnership with two other men in 1892 after combining funds. Using deed books and knowledge gained from the Kentucky Wesleyan College library, Mayo was able to determine those who had property over the most promising mineral deposits and started making deals. These options or \\"agreement to purchase\\" depended on him gaining the capital to complete purchases within the specified time-frame. Over the years he had successes acquiring land and worked with many coal and steel companies to get the railroads into the area so that mining could be profitable. After facing controversy in Virginia over how land was acquired, Mayo crafted the broad form deed so that the companies he worked for more securely held the rights to mine the minerals.  1950s-1990s = 1950s = As technology progressed during the 1950s, the broad form deed became a controversial issue especially in Kentucky and Tennessee ; machines became more advanced and could mine large portions of land. Over the next few decades complaints about the broad form deed inspired state legislators to make changes to protect Kentucky's surface land owners. In the 1956 case of Buchanan v. Watson, the Supreme Court of Kentucky established that damages made by modern mining techniques would not be assessed and granted the removal of all minerals on estates. = 1960s = The controversy of the broad form deed continued into the 1960s as environmentalists and land owners continued to protest the deed. In the 1968 case Martin v. Kentucky Oak Mining Co., the 1956 Buchanan decision was upheld as the court decided “the mineral owner bought and paid for the right to destroy the surface... to remove the minerals”. In Judge Edward Hill dissenting opinion, he stated that “I am shocked and appalled that the court of last resort in the beautiful state of Kentucky would … lend its approval and encouragement to the diabolical devastation and destruction of a large part of the surface … 'without compensation to the owners thereof”. = 1970s = Almost 18 years after the 1956 Buchanan decision the disagreement between the split estate owners continued. Environmentalists and activists continued to push for strong legislation and the abolishment of the broad form deed. State legislators had yet to change or abolish the deed until the 1974 Watson v. Kenlick Coal Co. case. This case ruled that if the mineral owners wanted to mine on the split estate they needed to request permission from the surface owners first. However, only months after the Kenlick decision, in the case Department for Natural Resources and Environment v. No. 8 Ltd it was decided that the Kenlick decision was unconstitutional. The legislators found that police powers to invade a citizen's private home did not extend unless the situation threatened the land owner's welfare and health. Jimmy Carter signing the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act into law. By 1976, the federal government was working on legislation that would place restrictions on strip mining. After decades of disagreement, the federal government signed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) in 1977, which placed restrictions on coal mining and strip mining in the United States. In response to SMCRA, Tennessee enacted the Tennessee Surface Owner Protection Act in 1977. This act stated that the method used for mineral extraction should be the same methods commonly used at the time of the broad form deed. = 1980s = In 1981, a disagreement between a mining company and local residents in White County, TN was taken to the Tennessee Supreme Court. This case, Doochin v. Rackley was the result of a mine company's effort to strip mine local lands that were home to local citizens. The court ruled in favor of the defendants because strip mining was not specifically allowed in deed. In contrast to the decision made in the No. 8 LTD (1975) case, the United States Supreme Court found that strip mining was unhealthy for the environment and therefore posed a threat to human life. Almost a decade after the Kenlick decision was reversed the Kentucky General Assembly responded by creating the Mineral Deed Act of 1984. This act stated that the mineral owner could only operate a mine within the methods that were established at the time the deed was originally signed by the mineral and estate owner; that period of time is referred to as mineral severance. However, later in 1987, the Mineral Deed Act was overturned by the case Akers v. Baldwin. In Akers v. Baldwin it was ruled that the Mineral Deed Act was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers and it “disturbed the Buchanan decision”. In the courts opinion, there may have been a “legitimate public purpose that motivated the passage of this legislation\\". A year after the Mineral Deed Act was overturned the citizens of Kentucky voted for a broad form deed amendment. The amendment passed with a margin of 4 to 1 and restricted coal companies from strip mining on the split without the permission from the surface owner. = 1990s = In 1993, President Clinton signed an amendment to the Stock Raising Homestead Act, discussing split estates which required companies to do four things: notify the land owners with a written letter of intent before beginning mining, create a plan that included minimal damages to the land, obtain a letter of consent from the surface owner, and give the land owners a letter promising complete reclamation and compensation. Many court cases between surface and mineral owners have resulted in changes to split estate regulations. For example, in the 1997 court case Gerrity Oil & Gas Corp. vs. Magness, it was ruled that the surface and mineral owners must be in compliance with each other's required use of land when using the estate in question, often requiring the mineral rights owner to change their plans of use of the surface to \\"accommodate the surface estate owner.\\"  Legacy: the split estate  The broad form deed is no longer used today, but many similar agreements were and still are created to separate mineral and surface rights. Today, a split estate occurs when one person or group owns the surface rights and another person or group owns the mineral rights. Often, in these situations, the right to access the minerals holds precedence over the surface owner's rights. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management has policies for split estates, applying only if the surface rights are privately owned and if the mineral rights are publicly owned and regulated by the Federal Government. If the mineral rights are not managed by the Federal Government, a lease agreement is arranged between the land and mineral owners and sometimes a surface use agreement is also created. Oil and gas drilling rig Resources including oil and shale gas are commonly extracted, but depending on the technology used, come with a high risk of contaminating the surface owner's land. Older oil and gas wells were less complicated than modern mining and fracking methods, used less water, and were not as harmful to the environment because of less waste production. However, shale gas fracking techniques produce wastewater which can be worse for the land above. The wastewater produced from fracking often contains salt, industrial chemicals, hydrocarbons, and radioactive material. The main concerns for the waste produced from shale gas fracking is for the water quality, human health, and the overall quality of life. The waste produced from fracking has affected land and water on the surface. In 2009, seventeen cattle were found dead near a fracking site in Louisiana, resulting in a fine to the company. The conclusion of this case stated that waste had leaked from the mining well and contaminated the pasture. There have been more cases of spilled fracking fluid in 2009 in Hopewell Township and Dunkard Creek Pennsylvania, both resulting in the death of many fish and amphibians, to name a few. As of 2011, some shale gas had been discovered in highly populated areas, therefore creating a higher chance of pollution to the water supply. Safely disposing of large amounts of wastewater from natural gas and oil production is often difficult because it often contains significant amounts of \\"salinity, toxic metals, and salinity.\\" In a study by the Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences published in 2013, the water quality of surface waters near a wastewater treatment plant in Pennsylvania was tested. The plant, along with others, sometimes would treat oil and gas wastewater at brine treatment facilities and releasing it into nearby streams. The water tested was shown to contain high levels of \\"chloride and bromide, strontium, radium, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic compositions.\\"  References  Property law Mining law and governance ","title":"Broad form deed"},{"id":"56388245","text":"Targówek Mieszkaniowy is a subway station in Warsaw's Targówek district.

The seven brothers were Pasquale, Pietro, Paride, Rinaldo, Agostino, Goffredo, and Martino, five of whom started the business in 1905, with the last two others joining in 1907. The firm dissolved in 1993. History Pasquale Santini, the eldest of the seven sons of a farmer living in the Tuscan Hills of Italy, decided to join the tide of immigration to America, the land of opportunity. In 1896 he went to America where he got a job with a cousin who was in the moving business. After saving enough money to send for his brother Pietro, and with the two of them working, they were able to send for three more of their brothers. In April 1905, the five brothers decided to start a moving business of their own in the Bronx, New York. By 1907 they amassed sufficient money to send for the two remaining younger brothers. Their inherent honesty, promptness, courtesy, and care in handling of all materials soon earned them a fine reputation which, originally by word of mouth, spread throughout the entire area. From 1913, the company was located in a building at 607-609 Jackson Avenue. In the mid-1920s Santini acquired the ten-story building at 1405-1417 Jerome Avenue on the corner of 170th Street. This became their main office, while their Jackson Avenue facility became a branch office. An ad for the Seven Santini Bros. from 1935 gives their address as 1405 Jerome Avenue. In 1935, Pasquale Santini died at the age of 61. His obituary notice in the New York Herald Tribune credited him with founding Santini Brothers. In 1954, Paride Santini, age 75, died. His obituary in The New York Times read: Goffredo (Godfrey E.) Santini remained as president and chairman of the board until he died in 1956. Leadership of the firm was then turned over to Martin, who retired in 1964, and then Goffredo's son Godfrey F. Santini. Rinaldo was the last to die in 1980. Goffredo attributed the success of the Santini organization to \\"a genuine desire to do a good job, and sincere interest in the customer's problem in a spirit of helpfulness... while we are in business for gain, we always consider profit as secondary importance to a job well done. A satisfied customer will pay dividends in the long run.\\" Ultimately the Seven Santini Brothers grew into one of the world's largest moving, packing and shipping organizations, with offices and warehousing facilities from coast to coast and in six foreign countries. Their notable clients included the Smithsonian, the Museum of Modern Art, Joseph Hirshhorn, the Estate of American painter Morris Louis, and the Chrysler Museum of Art, and one of their renowned employees was James Lebron, a master art handler and installer. In 1974, Santini opened industrial packing facilities in Houston and Galveston to service their oil and energy industry clients. In 1981, part of a Bronx park was renamed to Seven Brothers Square, honoring the company. As economic conditions changed, the Santini family eventually sold the company to another moving and storage company in 1988, whereupon the new owners decided to dismantle and sell the various operations of the company. By 1993, the company was completely dissolved.

It is found in the dry escarpment mountains of southwestern Arabia from Oman, South Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Habitat Dracaena serrulata is restricted largely to the highest, dry plateaus at the back of monsoon mountains- an area which monsoon rains do not reach. Dracaena serrulata grows commonly in association with species as Acacia etbaica and Grewia erythraea. Uses The stiff leaves of the Dracaena serrulata were an important source of fibre and rope. The large, stiff and spike-tipped leaves were cut or pulled from the trunk, and beaten with heavy clubs to loosen and crack open the rigid outer casing of the leaf. Then the leaves were taken to water and left to soak in it for some weeks. Once thoroughly softened, the leaves were removed from the water and piled up in heaps on a hard flat surface, and then beaten and thrashed with switches to loosen the fibre into separate strands. Once the separate fibres had been unravelled, they were twisted and rubbed on the thigh or between the fingers to produce threads, which could then be double or trebled, rolled and twisted again, or plaited according to the thickness of rope desired. These threads were traditionally said to make the strongest of all the cordage produced in Oman. The rope made form the Dracaena serrulata were popularly used as camel tackle, baggage ropes and rope-pulleys used to lower the heavy sacks of frankincense down precipices or across areas where baggage camels had difficulty penetrating. Ropes from this plant were also used to make harnesses in which men were lowered down sheer cliff sides to gather wild honey. The threads of the Dracaena serrulata also had a certain 'give', which made them popular for use of sling shots and bow-strings. The heart of a group of leaves of the Dracaena serrulata could also be eaten. The wood of the Dracaena serrulata was also occasionally used to make drums. Sections of the trunk would be sliced across horizontally and hollowed out to make the drum, the wooden sides being pierced with small holes and the top and bottom percussive parts being made from leather, usually from goats. Conservation Dracaena serrulata is classified as an endangered species. It was awarded the Future Conservation Award in 2017 with plans to identify the population size, health status and reproduction capacity of the species.

She is like a Giotto painting with her classical features and limp spun hair like a mediaeval page’s, and though she is diminutively proportioned, with small pointed breasts, her little figure is so elongated that, on her, materials fall in vertical folds like the flutings on a Grecian column.

I see new unsuspected qualities in Baba as she sits against the lamp or by the light of the fire.\\" In May 1930 Baba Beaton was presented at court, dressed in an Empire cut mousseline de soie gown adorned with bands of opalescent paillettes.

In this sacred scripture, Nabha Das wrote the life history of almost every saint ranging from the Satya Yuga to the Kali Yuga age. On his birthday 8 April, millions of followers remember him and his resolve to work for humanity. His birthday was declared as a local holiday by the Deputy Commissioner.  Early life  He was born on April 8, 1537 at village Bhadrachalam on the bank of the Godavari river in Khammam district in the Indian state of Telangana. His mother was Smt. Janaki Devi ji and his father was Shri Ramdass ji, now known as Ramdassu. They belonged to the Mahasha, Doom, Dumna community now known as Nabhadassia. Their professional work was to make baskets of cane and they were musicians. They were strong devotees of Lord Rama, because Rama's temple was situated at Bhadrachalam, now known as Rambhadrachalam. His parents initially had no children, leading the villagers to taunt them. They prayed for Lord Rama to bless them with a son, who would be learned, intellectual and a theologian. Then a son was born to them. He was first called Narayan Dass and was a devotee of Lord Rama. His parents died when he was five years old. He lived alone in the village and worshiped in the temple. He played on the bank of the river with his friends and also exchanged sand ladoo into the sweet ladoo with blessing from God.  Spiritual Journey  Saint Shri Agar Dass ji and Keel Dass were passing through near Ram Bhadrachalam hills and forests. They saw Narayan Dass under a tree. They asked him, \\"Who are you? Why are you sitting here?\\" Narayan told them, \\"I am made of five elements blessed from God\\". They were surprised to hear his spiritual reply. They asked him if he wanted to go to their temple. Keeldass scattered water on his eyes, then he opened his eyes and got a blessing. They brought him into the temple at Ghalta Dham at Jaipur. Guru Agar Dass ji offered a duty to him: to serve the pilgrims who come to hear Satsang and operate hand fan when I am preaching and teaching into the Satsang hall for devotees. One day, Guru Agardas was not concentrated to the Satsung because his one disciple (Hari Dass) who was a business person through the ship into sea way. His ship was sinking beneath a cyclone. He prayed before Guru Agardas to save his ship. Narayanadass was looking at his guru who he was not concentrating into the Satsung. He rapidly flapped the fan to save the ship. Narayanadass said to his Guru, \\"your focus on the Satsung freed the ship from cyclone\\". Guru opened his eyes and told him, \\"How did you understand my internal feeling, you are a great holy saint; now your name will be Nabha dass, now you will not operate fan. You will write life history of holy saints who come on the earth from Satya Yuga to Kali Yuga\\". Then he wrote the life history of many saints with a boon from his Guru. Guru Agardass told his elder holy saint Shri Keeldass, who had written life history of many saints by Nabha Dass. He was happy and told him, \\"you are great holy writer, and also deserve to get a degree of doctorate of Literature. We should arrange a religious function here and invite all holy saints to give blessing to your religious achievements. He said to him, \\"you should go to Varanasi for holy dip into Ganga.\\" He invited all holy saints. When he was going to Varanasi he passed through Ayudhia where the Lord Rama temple was situated. He stayed there for a few days. He went to the temple where a religious programme was underway. The saints were singing hymns. When the temple clergy told Nabha Dass to preach a hymn. Other sage persons objected that he did not belong to the sage community and asked how can you allow him. The priest told them that anyone can sing a hymn. Before starting Nabha Dass said, \\"jaat na puchhie saadh ki, poochh leejie gyan, mol karo kirpan ka, pari rahne do mian\\" (\\"do not ask caste, religion from holy saints, ask about enlightenment of the God\\"). (Bhagat Bhagti Bhagwan Guru Chatur Naam Baap Ek Inke Pad Bandan Kiye Nasin Vigan Anek). He sung devotee, devotion, Guru, God. They are the same and are respectable Idols. The sages were surprised to hear his preaching. They called to him with respect. The Priest asked him, \\"Where are you going?\\" He said, \\"I am going to Varanasi for holy dip into the Ganga. I invited all sage and holy saints to come at Ghalta Dham where to held religious ceremony for releasing the sacred scripture written by me with blessing from the Guru & God.\\" All saints accepted his message and celebrated him for his religious work. He went to the Ganga to bathe. He went to Mathura, Varidavan to worship at the Lord Krishna temple and also met sage Shri Tulsidass, who had written the Ramayana. He was surprised to learn about Nabha Dass and asked how Nabh Dass could write sacred scripture, because he did not belong to sage community nor was he a Learned Theologian. Nabha Dass came back to Ghalta Dham. Tulsidass and other holy saints were thinking about Nabha Dass' works. The sages were unhappy about his prominence and hatched a conspiracy against Nabha Dass. They stated that they would come there if your food is cooked with sandalwood. They knew that Nabha Dass had no sandalwood because these sandalwoods were in a forest with snakes in the trees will bite him and would kill him if he approached. He accepted their challenge and went into the forest with a bullock cart. Nabh Ddass prayed before the snakes that were there. Nabha Dass and his disciples cut sandalwood. A lion come and killed the bullock. Nabha Dass saw this happen and put the cart before the Lion and brought the wood to Ghalta Dham. The saints came to Ghalta Dham and greeted him with a garland of flowers. Tulsidass came there and sat in the last queue. When Nabha Dass saw him, he rushed to him and welcomed him saying,\\"I want a holy saint to make like the Sameroo\\". You will have like a sameroo in the Sacred scripture written by me with blessing from all saints here, the God. Then all holy saints with his Guru Shri Agardass, shri Keeldass released sacred scripture and called its name Bhagatmaal in 1585,at Ghalta Dham Jaipur and also to give doctorate of literature Degree to Nabha Dass. They renamed him Goswami Shri Nabha Dass Maharaj. They had written sacred scripture to bring us nearer to God. The life history of many holy saints come to Kali Yuga in Satya Yuga age. At the end of this ceremony, Nabha Dass left for a religious journey throughout India. He went first to Rambhadrachalam to take the blessing from his parent's temple and the temple of Lord Rama. He returned to Dhianpurdham, Pandoridham, Damtaldham. Then he went to Kulu Manali where his grand Guru Shri Krishna Pyahari Dass had a lodge. The lodge was situated in deep forest. King Shri Jagat Singh and his wife were there. She was suffering from skin disease. She had no relief from doctors. The queen believed in the saints, but the king did not. Grand guru Shri Krishana heard their problem. His guru told Nabha Dass to take her near the sacred spring and take three dips in the sacred spring. After this, her skin disease was cured. Both king and queen were happy and fell on the feet of the saints. They said to them,\\"you are great holy saints, we want to present a gift\\". Krishana Pyahari Dass said to them \\"You may have to celebrate ten days festival to the remark of the Lord Rama on Dusehra at Kulu. From that day Kulu Dushera began to venerate both saints. Nabha Dass came to Punjab through Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Jammu where his community lived. One day he received a message to come to my lodge to take blessing of my Guru, but they ignored them. No person came to listen to his hymns. He felt upset and returned to Ghalta Dham to serve in the Galtadham. He and his guru Agardass went to Revasha forest and stayed. One day King Raja Maan Singh went to the forest to hunt with 10,000 of his sainiks. They were exhausted. They saw a saint lodge and marched there. The King went in to take a blessing from the saints. Agardas told Nabha Dass to give him some parsad of banana. When Nabha Dass give him a banana, Raja Maan Singh said, \\"first parsad should be given to my sainiks and then after to me.\\" Nabha Dass called the sainiks and gave them all bananas. The king was surprised that he was able to give ten-ten bananas to the soldiers, while only 10 bananas were in the basket. The King was again surprised to see this miracle. He fell down on their feet for seeking a blessing. He gave 1600 acres of land in donation for Dham and made a gate named Agardass, Nabha Dass. The gate is still situated at Revasha Dham. Nabha Dass died in 1643. He is venerated because his sacrifice was for the whole people. His other notable works are Ramashtayam, Astayam and Ramcharitar ke paad in Braja.

Although the club has sympathizers from various circles, it is regarded as an association with left-wing leanings. In 1976, at the height of the Lebanese Civil War, the extreme right-wing Phalangist Party (Kataeb) militia confiscated the locale of the association for its political leanings. That put a halt to the club's activities. The president of the association Simon Kazandjian was martyred along with a relative, Kevork Kazandjian.

In 1996, the club restored its right to repossess its confiscated locale after negotiations with the Phalangist party leaders.

The movement lasted from 1959-1965, with goals of reinstating health benefits and improving working conditions. Miners protested at several mines in Eastern Kentucky, and laid and the foundation for future movements within the Appalachian coal community.  Background  An example of the type of hospital that was closed by the United Mine Workers of America. During World War II, The Unites States of America provided a large portion of the Allied Powers' resources, which caused a huge spike in production that needed to be powered by coal. However, after WWII, this production was no longer necessary, which also decreased the need for coal. Because of this, the coal industry fell into a slump, dropping from 16.0 quadrillion BTU (of total energy use) to 12.0 quadrillion BTU from 1945 to 1949. To counter this loss, the United Mine Workers Association, or the UMWA, and the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association, or the BCOA, negotiated an industry-wide deal that raised the wages of each miner from $1.90 per shift to $2.00 per shift in 1952. This wage could not be supported by smaller nor non-union coal mines, so many went bankrupt, which created a further increase in the power of the UMWA. Many workers lost their jobs, which overall increased the wealth of the UMWA. In addition, and increase in mechanization also lead to a decrease of miners. Miners were unhappy with this, because it would lead to higher job-lose, and in 1960, the UMWA Health and Retirement Funds chose to revoke medical coverage for miners who had been unemployed for over a year or who worked in a non-union mine. Two years later, in 1962, the UMWA Health and Retirement Funds closed all ten of its hospitals and took away the miners' medical cards. This kept the miners from being able to have access to proper medical care. This led to great unrest among coal miners and their families, leading to the Roving Pickets Movement.  Activities  Machinery such as this coal tipple were destroyed by the Roving Pickets during their protests. When the announcement came that miners and their families would no longer continue to receive their medical benefits from the UMWA Health and Retirement Funds, the miners took action and went on strike. Miners and their families who had lost health care benefits from the UWMA Health and Retirement Funds in the 1950s traveled from mine to mine in caravans protesting. The goal was to shut down non-union mines and those mines that were not paying the $0.40 per ton royalty fee, and to encourage non-union mines to organize themselves. These traveling protestors became known as the \\"Roving Picketers\\". The threat of violence from the Roving Picketers got the attention of authorities at the federal level. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy assembled a task force, as part of Appalachian Regional Commission with the goal of preserving the union hospitals. The task force successfully created a grant program that would allow non-profits to fund and operate the hospitals. This desire was part of a larger movement of the federal government intervening in Appalachia through antipoverty programs during the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. The Roving Picket movement was not necessarily a peaceful movement. There was some diplomacy through lobbying attempts with the federal government. However, the picketers blew up coal tipples, buildings, and trucks as part of their dissatisfaction. There were also instances of arson, shootings, beatings, and personal property such as cars and homes were also blown up. Berman Gibson was the leader of the Roving Picket Movement and believed in a method of lobbying to elected officials to achieve the goal of getting the medical cards reinstated. Gibson and his followers were making plans for a miners march on Washington D.C. during the Spring of 1963, which got the attention of President Kennedy. Kennedy was already concerned about growing civil rights unrest, and shortly after the miners made their intentions of a march known, the President created a task force within his cabinet to save the miners hospital.  Legacy  The Appalachian Regional Development Act. The page shown has a description of the Act and what it was made to try to accomplish. The Roving Picket Movement had a lasting impact not only in Eastern Kentucky but on the entire Appalachian region. This was a because the movement changed in 1963 from a miner's resistance to a movement for the poor known as the antipoverty movement. Kennedy started the efforts of the antipoverty movement but after his assassination Lyndon Johnson took office and continued the efforts of the anti poverty movement. The miners involved with the Roving Pickets traveled to Washington to make sure that the Appalachian region was not forgotten about and that legislation would be put in place. Johnson didn't forget about those miners and stated in his inaugural speech that there was going to be an “unconditional war on poverty” and even thanked the Appalachia region for their extra effort. Johnson instituted important legislation that worked to improve life for miners and the growth of the Appalachian region. One such piece of legislation was the Appalachian Regional Development Act which was instituted in March 1965 and renewed in 1967. The Act established the Appalachian Regional Commission which was tasked with a creating and overseeing programs that would create economic growth in the Appalachian Region.89th Congress. \\"The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965.\\" Robert C. Byrd Congressional Papers, Congress Series, 89th Congress, Box 1. Accessed 16 March 2018. http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/items/show/8. Miners continued to strike and fight for improvements in Appalachian after the Roving Picket movement ended but the Roving Pickets actions to help the poor and the demand for federal legislation to aid Appalachia set a strong legacy in the region. Across the Appalachian region new legislation was being put into place because of continued activism by miners such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.

By doing so, mobile-friendly social platforms began to integrate into the Olympics. Athletes and fans use these platforms to share live updates, special moments, and behind-the-scenes specials. The rise of social video and social broadcasting technology has provided a huge opportunity for Olympic athletes, teams, and sponsors to bring coverage to fans like never before. Olympic- related content has infiltrated all forms of social media, including Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. It is expected to expand in the coming years.  Background  The Olympics is able to advertise to its viewers and its host country with the use of data it collects through Social media marketing. Prominent social media platforms include: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, Google, MSN, Yahoo and many more. Campaign Initiatives and Artificial Intelligence technologies have been used to analyze the social media content of users. Information from consumers such as their preferences, demographics, age and locality are all analyzed to gain consumer insight. Campaign initiatives and AI technologies were used for such purposes in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics and are in use currently. Social media marketing of the Olympics is a new phenomena, beginning prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics  Variations  There are two classifications of social media marketing recognized by the IOC: * Officially sanctioned content from rights holders and sponsors that maximizes the use of Olympic content (imagery, hashtag) * Unofficial content that is generated by brands that leverage the excitement of the Olympics  2008 Beijing Summer Olympics  Social media marketing emerged as a phenomenon during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which progressed as a marketing and an advertising tactic ever since. The Beijing Olympics became the test subject for social media marketing initiatives started by advertising agencies. In 2008, social media marketing began the transition from one-sided communication to mass communication of the Olympic Games. Although social media marketing of the Olympic Games began in 2008, the audience to the Olympics was still primarily reached through television–reaching an audience of 4.3 billion viewers. At the time, the viewers of the Olympic Games through Internet website platforms made up an audience of approximately 390 million individuals. What was the beginning of Olympic social media marketing, was also the beginning of a more globalized experience of the Olympic Games via social media. Twitter, now a prominent social media platform, began in 2006 and grew to three million active users by the beginning of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Members of Facebook, another prominent social media platform, tracking the Olympic Games grew from approximately one million during the Olympic Games of Athens 2004 to 90 million during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Social media use, in general, increased by 24 percent between 2007 and 2008–from 63 percent of U.S. adults to 87 percent of U.S. adults.  2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) deemed The Vancouver Winter Olympics as \\"the first social media games” based on its fan base through social media platforms. The IOC launched their Facebook page a month before the games began, attracting 1.5 million fans. Shifting to online viewing attracted a younger audience than past Olympic games with over 60 percent of Facebook fans being under 24 years of age. Shaun White Athletes like Lindsey Vonn and Shaun White reached fans on social media as the platform posted behind-the-scenes coverage on their experiences. The IOC used social media to create competitions between athletes and fans streamed online. Its YouTube channel hosted a “Best of Us” challenge in which the public could compete in games with their favorite athletes, acquiring three million viewers. Photos spread across social media platforms, such as Flickr, which had 11,000 photos posted by 600 photographers, bringing a new perspective to the games. Twitter contributed constant live updates of the competitions. The IOC’s Twitter following doubled to 12,000 followers during the Vancouver Olympics, creating a larger viewer population for the games. The IOC created social media guidelines as more athletes and fans got online to interact with the Olympics. Social media was still relatively new as a marketing platform, so these guidelines confused many individuals.  2012 London Summer Olympics  The London 2012 Olympic Games succeeded in broadcasting, participation and marketing. For the first time, the IOC broadcast the Olympic Games live and on-demand through Youtube, allowing fans to access the Games anytime, anywhere through live streaming. The combination of conventional broadcasting and mobile platforms reached a global audience of 4.8 billion people. Social media soared with Facebook, Twitter and Google+, attracting 4.7 million followers. Athletes shared photographs, interacted online with fans and updated daily, either in person or via an agent. Instagram was established by 2012, making itself a premier photo-sharing platform perfect for athletes to capture their emotions. Lewis Wiltshire, head of sport for Twitter UK said, \\"Never before have fans had such direct access to their sporting heroes.\\" Usain BoltLondon2012 Social media created conversation on fan opinions regarding athletes, including 962,756 total mentions of Usain Bolt, “Fastest Man in History,” who defended the 100 meter and 200 meter gold medals. Michael Phelps followed with 828,081 total mentions. Olympic sponsors were active on social media; created several campaigns to promote their brands; and inspired viewers with mass participation and personalized events. The Adidas “Take the Stage” Campaign recognized talent around the world, installing a photo booth and inviting the 550 Olympics athletes to take the stage. (IOC Marketing Report 2012). David Beckham surprised fans at the photo booth in Westfield shopping centre, gaining popularity in UK media. Coca-Cola, Acer Inc., McDonald’s, Visa Inc. and several others used similar tactics of participation to attract viewers.  2014 Sochi Winter Olympics = Channels = The 2014 Winter Olympic Games were held in Sochi, a city in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, establishing the first “social media Olympics” for Russia. The most popular Russian social media and networking service, VK, created an Olympic page, similar to Facebook’s. The Olympic VK page has 2.8 million fans and—the most popular official community on the platform. Throughout the games, VK had 54 million Olympic mentions, an average of 1.5 million per day. Numbers grew on other social media pages: more than 2 million fans joined the Olympic Facebook page, 168,101 followed the Olympic Twitter, 150,000 followed the Olympic instagram and three million visited the Olympic website in February 2014. There were 90,000 total updates on social media by Sochi 2014 Olympians and teams. The United States was the most active country during the games logging 22,598 posts across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. = Engagement = With social media there is also hashtags. The most popular hashtag was #sochi2014 with almost 11,000 uses. The next top five hashtags were #wearewinter, #teamusa, #olympics, #goaus and #wirfuerD. Another popular hashtag was #Sochiproblems, depicting local struggles. Photos of the poor state of Sochi on all platforms made the games the number one trending topic one week before the opening ceremony. #SochiFail and #SochiProblems gave multiple reports of the poor living arrangements, incomplete construction, broken elevators, and polluted waters. This was one way that social media provided awareness to its users. = Media Perceptions = Media perceptions varied during the games; the Olympics was viewed as a confrontation between Eastern and Western Civilizations. The LGBT community took a stand against the games. Sponsors for the games including Coca-Cola, Mcdonald’s, and P&G; protested against Russian authorities. Many protests took a stand against Russian laws, which created a discussion between human rights advocates. Advocates believed organizations should not promote certain values in western markets while supporting an anti- human rights government in another market.  2016 Rio Summer Olympics  Thomas Bach Social media marketing was an influential tool in the promotion and analysis of the 2016 Rio Olympics. Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee said that the power of sport demonstrates that diversity and interconnectedness can enlighten us all. With over 25,000+ sources of accredited media covering the games, the 2016 games were the most consumed Olympic games to date. Marketing for the Rio Olympics began in 2013 and ultimately lasted 3 years. There were 26 million visits to Olympic.org, the official website of the Olympic games, and over 7 billion views of official Olympic content on social media. There were over 270 digital media platforms covering the games and active engagement throughout various social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. Twitter saw over 187 million tweets inspired by the Rio Olympics, a 24.6 percent increase from the 2012 Summer Olympics. The 187 million tweets generated nearly 75 billion Twitter impressions. It is important to note that throughout this same period, Twitter nearly doubled in size in terms of users, suggesting that there could have been an even larger growth in Twitter engagement. The hashtag, #Rio2016 was official content created by the IOC to generate buzz and encourage engagement. Facebook saw 277 million people interact 1.5 billion times regarding the 2016 games. Comparatively to the London games, which saw 116 million posts, there was a significant increase in interaction. Facebook also used the Rio Olympics to debut their Sponsored Photo Frame aspect as an alternative method of advertising revenue and marketing outreach. The idea behind this innovation was to present a new advertising opportunity for the platform and to encourage alternative interaction in a similar way to which Snapchat uses paid and sponsored geographic filters. The Rio Olympics was the first Olympics to utilize snapchat as a marketing tool. NBC directly partnered with Snapchat and Buzzfeed to promote the 2016 games.  2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics  The 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Olympic fans took to social media to discuss and manage their emotions regarding the postponement. Some platforms explained the sequence of events that led to the postponement, while other shared historical moments. On Twitter, users used the postponement as a way to explain how dangerous the pandemic really is, as well as to bolster political arguments. The hashtag #tokyo2021 offered optimism among the negativity and fear.

The dumplings are made of unleavened wheat dough squares filled with ground meat and condiments. In observance of the Islamic dietary rules, the meat filling is usually without pork.  Etymology  Josh means \\"to boil\\" while para is a term for \\"bit\\". This word was commonly used prior to the 10th century, when it was replaced by the modern Persian name gosh e-barreh, meaning \\"lamb's ear\\". There are several variations of the name in other languages including Azerbaijani (düşbərə, dushbara), Kazakh (тұшпара, tushpara), Kyrgyz (чүчпара, chuchpara), Tajik (тушбера, tushbera), Uzbek (chuchvara) and Uyghur (چۆچۈرە, chöchürä). The Arabic word shishbarak () or shushbarak () is thought to be derived from joshpara in pre-Islamic times. A theory about the words' etymology is that the word comes from the Turkic word düşbərə. The words tosh and dash mean \\"filled up\\" and \\"spill out\\", and berek means \\"food\\" (dishes made from dough). This alludes to the fact that düşbərə should be added in when the water is boiling and spilling out of the saucepan. A common Azerbaijani joke suggests that the word comes from “düş bəri”, which means \\"fall here\\": in other words, asking to fill the spoon with as many dumplings as possible.  Regional variations = Turkic and Persian cuisines = The dish is found in Azerbaijani, Iranian, Tajik, Uzbek, Uyghur, and other Central Asian cuisines. Uzbek chuchvara with tomato sauce and vegetables The dough for Central Asian chuchvara or tushbera is made with flour, eggs, water, and salt. It is rolled into a thin layer, and cut into squares. A dollop of meat filling, seasoned with chopped onions, black pepper, salt and thyme, is placed at the center of each square, and the corners of the dumpling are pinched and folded. The dumplings are boiled in meat broth until they rise to the surface. Chuchvara can be served in a clear soup or on their own, with either vinegar or sauce based on finely chopped greens, tomatoes and hot peppers. Another popular way of serving chuchvara is to top the dumplings with syuzma (strained qatiq) or with smetana (sour cream). The latter is known as Russian-style. Azerbaijani dushbara served in broth In Azerbaijan, the dumplings are smaller and the dough is thicker. ' are typically made from dough (wheat flour, egg, water), mutton (boneless), onions, vinegar, dried mint, pepper, and salt. The dish is prepared either with water or meat broth. Mutton can be substituted with beef, or even with chicken. The broth is made from mutton bones, and the ground meat is prepared with onions and spices. The dough is then rolled, cut into small squares, and stuffed with ground meat. The squares are wrapped like triangles and the edges are pasted together, making shell-shaped figures. The dumplings are added into the boiling salty water and cooked until the dumplings come to the surface. ' are served with sprinkled dried mint. Vinegar mixed with shredded garlic is added or served separately to taste. 5-8 düşbərəs typically fit on a spoon; however, in rural areas of Absheron, they are made small enough that a spoon can hold as many as 20. = Arab cuisines = Levantine shishbarak served in yogurt sauce Shishbarak is prepared in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Hejaz, and the northern area of Saudi Arabia. After being stuffed with ground beef and spices, thin dough parcels are cooked in yogurt and served hot in their sauce.

The Simpsons TCG was first released in fall of 2003. The core set titled Krusty Approved had 156 cards. Four pre-made Theme decks were released. Gameplay Players use 40 card decks, in a 2-5 player game. The goal is to get 7 points and the first player to do so, wins. Each player may play a Scene card (if that player doesn't have one in play), play Character cards at a Scene, declare an eligible scene completed or trashed, or play an Action card. At the end of a player's turn, they may discard as many cards as they like and draw up to 6 cards. Only Action cards can be played on another player's turn. When a scene is completed, the player completing the scene, and any other player with characters used to complete the scene, score 1 point. A bonus point is awarded to the player with the most characters involved in completing a scene, unless there is a tie, then no bonus is awarded, or if the scene was trashed. Reception The game was considered rules \\"light\\" and it didn't take itself too seriously as it lacked the competitive feel of games like Magic: the Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.

Approaching sculptural creations, her avant-garde pieces have been widely collected. Her works form part of the permanent collections of many of the world's leading art museums, including the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia; the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City; the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto, Japan; the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Pennsylvania; and the Victoria and Albert Museum of London. Growing up in the Heartland of the United States, Schick was raised by her single mother, who as an art instructor nurtured her creative talent. After attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison, she completed a master's degree in fine art at Indiana University Bloomington. She then moved to Kansas, shortly thereafter beginning a lifetime association with Pittsburg State University, where she taught as an art professor. In addition to her teaching, Schick developed a worldwide reputation as a jewelry artist, creating works which were more like body sculptures than traditional jewelry. Her conception of pieces allowed her work to be displayed on the body while simultaneously interacting with it, rather than simply being worn as an adornment. As one of the innovators who moved jewelry craftsmanship away from metals in the 1960s, she experimented with a wide variety of materials, including papier-mâché, wooden dowels, rubber, string, and canvas. Her large-scale works were typically brightly colored and represented a modernist abstract aesthetic. Early life Marjorie Ann Krask was born on August 29, 1941 in Taylorville, Illinois to Eleanor (née Curtin) and Edward P. Krask. Following her parents' divorce before her second birthday, she was raised by her mother, rarely seeing her father. Depending on where her mother was teaching or where she attended school, they moved frequently. At various times, they lived in Normal, Illinois; Blue Mound, Illinois; Charleston, Illinois, where Krask began first grade; Decatur, Illinois, where she finished elementary school; Longmont, Colorado where she attended junior high; and then Evanston, Illinois, where Krask graduated from Evanston Township High School in 1959. In Longmont, her mother, who was an art instructor, introduced her to metalworking and in high school, Krask studied fashion design with Frank Tresise. She spent her summers studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, initially wanting to design clothing, before deciding to become an art instructor herself. Enrolling in the art department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Krask practice taught in Watertown and studied jewelry design under Arthur Vierthaler, as part of her studies. Upon her graduation, in 1963, she married James Baldwin McDonald Schick. Together they moved to Bloomington, Indiana to finish their studies at Indiana University. She enrolled in a Master of Fine Arts program under the tutelage of Alma Eikerman, who would become her lifelong mentor and a strong influence on her work. She was trained as a traditional metalsmith and jeweller, graduating with distinction in 1966. Near the end of her schooling, an article she read about the work of abstract sculptor, David Smith, became influential for her work. She began to conceptualize jewelry as a type of sculpture which could be worn. Career When the couple graduated they began their teaching careers at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, with her husband teaching in the history department while she taught art. Schick first began working in papier-mâché during the time in Lawrence, using it as a lightweight alternative to metal, allowing her to create larger pieces. At the time, the medium was unconventional, and Schick's experimentation evolved from creating frames of chicken wire, coating them in the pulp mixture and shaping them to form. While her traditional jewelry pieces were readily accepted for juried exhibits, her papier-mâché adornments were regularly rejected as too radical. In 1967, both of the Schicks were hired by Pittsburg State University, at the time known as Kansas State College at Pittsburg. In 1969, she went back to the idea of putting her body through one of the sculptures of David Smith. Instead of the flat two-dimensional pieces she had made up to that time, she molded a brass headpiece with tubes on which she welded blue-lensed glasses at eye- level. Nicknaming the piece Blue Eyes, Head Sculpture changed the focus of her work from metalwork jewelry to wearable sculpture. =1970s= Schick became part of the Modernist era, creating works which explored abstraction through line, mass, space and volume. She took account of the difference between experiencing an object based on its presentation and the materials used, and its aesthetic significance. Her early jewelry designs were expressionistic, evoking emotions of conflict and contact. They made use of silver wire mixed with melted and pitted brass or bronze twisted into shapes. Many of them had the feel of objet trouvé artifacts. The pieces of her Cycladic Series featured polished shapes of brass and copper designed as oversized bracelets, brooches, and necklaces. For a time, she believed her metalwork was \\"serious art\\" and her experimentation with other media, far less important. Thanks to its lightweight, pliable qualities, she experimented with papier-mâché, as a means of extending forms away from the body. It also allowed volume and color to be used in ways that traditional metalwork could not. Schick produced pieces on wire frames encapsulated with molded pulp to surround the body. Rather than creating conventional wrist or neck adornments, her large creations were designed to be displayed on the whole body, from shoulder to foot. In 1976, Schick was contacted by Mary Ann Bransby, a jewelry instructor from Kansas City's University of Missouri, to create jewelry pieces for the school's modern dance troupe. The dancers used the pieces in innovative ways, putting rings on their toes or a bracelet on their foot, which caused Schick to recognize that pieces could be reinterpreted. The group gave performances and exhibitions of the artwork at venues including the Albrecht Gallery in St. Joseph, Missouri, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Kansas City Art Institute, and Lindenwood College in Saint Charles, Missouri. By the end of the 1970s, Schick grew tired of papier-mâché as a medium. She took courses in ceramics and plastics and experimented with making jewelry from clay, paper, plastic, thread, and combinations of thread and paper. =1980s= At the beginning of the 1980s, Schick began working with fiber, string and dowel rods, submitting six small pieces to an alternative media exhibit, \\"Jewelry Redefined: First International Exhibition of Multi-Media Non-Precious Jewellery\\" hosted by the British Crafts Centre in London in 1982. Receiving a letter from Paul Derrez, one of the jurors and owner of Ra Gallery in Amsterdam, she created a solo exhibit for his gallery. The show brought her international recognition and she was asked to participate in the Isetan Art Museum's International Jewellery Art Exhibition in Tokyo, where she won an award in fine arts. As her work began receiving international attention and became an influence on European jewelers, the American market began to accept her work. Her stick designs played with the illusions of negative space, with pieces of dowel riveted into pick-up sticks, spirals, and zig-zag shapes, creating a dialogue between the body and the adornment. Utilizing wood, rubber tubes and string, she created interlocking geometric shapes bordering on the outrageous and questioning the need to create mass-produced useful adornment. Taking a sabbatical from PSU, Schick studied metalworking at Sir John Cass College of Art beginning in 1983, leading to her first solo exhibition at Derrez's gallery that same year. In 1984, she worked as the artist-in-residence of John Cass. Schick was the only American to participate in the New Jewelry Movement which swept through England and the Netherlands. At the end of the 1980s, she began to make pieces of plywood and began to focus predominantly on neckwear. However, she did continue to make wooden bracelets during this time, using dowel sticks which were painted with variegated colors. Her three-dimensional pieces were more like sculpture than traditional flat jewelry and could as easily be displayed on a wall as worn. Schick also began exploring companion pieces, making her jewelry part of paintings, so that when they were not being worn, they could be displayed as artworks. She incorporated a whimsical series of teapots into her pieces, that took on the form of bracelets, brooches, or frames around the head and neck which could be shifted and disassembled. Creating hybrid pieces which blurred the boundaries between handicrafts, ornamentation, painting and sculpture, Schick worked in-the-round, giving all sides of a work equal focus, pressing the boundaries of traditional jewelry. Conscious of the sculptural notion that pieces would be viewed from any angle, she focused not only on the front and back of a piece, but how it would appear on or off a wall, on or off the body, or from any vantage point. By 1986, she had participated in fourteen international showings at nine art museums throughout the world. In 1987, Schick was one of the featured artists in a traveling exhibit that was shown throughout Virginia called Jewelry Now. The show also highlighted nationally known jewelers, including Jamie Bennett, Robert Ebendorf, Rebekah Laskin, Ivy Ross, Susan Sanders and Sandra Zilkner. Schick continued producing pieces for performance art, such as Collar in 1988, a neck piece six inches thick and 31 inches wide. While impractical for wearing as an every day adornment, the vibrant color scheme forced the wearer and observer to imagine and redefine how one moves through space. In 1989, the School of Fine Arts Gallery of her alma mater in Indiana hosted a solo show Marjorie Schick: A Retrospective, covering the first 25 years of her career. It featured over a hundred works, displayed without the use of models or mannequins, either protruding from walls or hanging from ceilings. The display showed that the works were non-functional as simple adornments and in a unique way were \\"unfinished\\" in the absence of the body of the wearer. =1990s= Schick returned to papier-mâché in the 1990s, using different painting techniques. Wishing to explore color, she began to work with fabric, just as painters use canvas. Disliking the flatness of the surface, she created pockets stuffed with Poly-Fil to add sculptural texture. The first piece in the series, Necklace \\"De la Luna/del Sol\\", was created in 1996 and inspired by the Peruvian archaeological sites of Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna. In 1998, Schick and her husband planned a sabbatical in Mexico, with tours to Europe. She began a series of pieces related to their travels, inspired by the varied color palettes of the differing landscapes. In particular, she was interested in exploring how different colors trigger memories of places and events. Glen Brown, an art historian from Kansas State University, likened these works to \\"souvenir scrapbooks\\" in a symbolist style, which captured the personal experiences of the traveler without need for a photorealistic representation. Her work could also be considered pop-surrealism as noted by Graham Shearing in his review of the 1998 exhibition \\"Revelations: New Jewelry\\" by members of the Society of North American Goldsmiths (SNAG). Her contribution was a piece called Katella. At times Schick used unprimed canvas to allow the light color washes to permeate the fabric, such as in the piece Brick Street, a homage to Pittsburg, Kansas. On others, she used heavy coats of gesso to build form and texture before painting the surfaces. In her work, Quetzalcoatl, completed after the Mexico trip, she used heavily gessoed fabric pouches and paint to represent the feathered snakes found in pre-Columbian sites they had visited at Chichén Itzá, Palenque and Teotihuacán. She used vivid colors and muted grays to represent the once vibrant murals completed in Maya blue and terracotta which have faded over time. In another piece, Chicago Windows, representing the Chicago skyline, Schick riveted black oak strips together to form panes around the brightly colored rectangles of plywood adorned with string to create the geometrical framework of the black background. Another piece representative of this period was Bound Colors, a necklace with ribbons of canvas laced through wood strips creating a design reminiscent of the Aztec calendar stone interwoven with a color wheel. It was mounted on a painted plywood base, from which it could be removed for wear, allowing the aesthetic of the piece to transcend the individual components of jewelry, painting and sculpture. The large scale of her works was intentional, so that the pieces were not tucked away in a drawer, but rather had multiple uses in different interconnected interpretations. Her work was designed to encompass the body, and rather than ornamental accessories, became \\"three- dimensional drawings-to-wear\\". =2000s= Yellow Ladderback Chair (2001) In the 2000s, Schick began experimenting with turning everyday items into wearable art. She designed Yellow Ladderback Chair in 2001 to evoke the \\"experience of being in a chair\\". The canvas necklace, creates a symbiosis of the ornamentation with the human wearer. That year, she participated in the group showing Open Links, hosted in Bowling Green, Ohio, by the university's fine arts department, with the aim of broadening attendees' perspectives to the redefinition of what jewelry could be. Two years later, she created Tool Belt and Scarf for Sonia Delaunay inspired by Delaunay's patterned designs. The belt, made of dowels, and the scarf, made of wood blocks, mirror the futuristic motifs of the painter and are surrounded by wooden implements such as paint brushes and pans, a needle, scissors and thread, which Delaunay might have used in her work. When the piece is worn, the tools of the artist's trade float around the wearer's knees. Schick began a series of necklaces with autobiographical themes. The numbered pieces, Necklace 1, Necklace 2, and so forth, depict representations of her life journey. She used color to represent variations in mood, such as shiny metallic paint for Necklace 21 representing the year of her marriage and the addition of blacks, grays and whites to Necklace 29, showing how much more complex her life became after the birth of her son. In 2000, Schick was made a fellow of the American Craft Council and in 2002 was honored by Governor of Kansas, Bill Graves as the state's artist of the year. In addition to her professorship, throughout her career, Schick taught at various seminars and workshops, including Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts, the Cleveland Institute of Art, the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, the Penland School of Crafts in the United States and programs abroad at Middlesex Polytechnic of London, the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo; the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design of Halifax; and at the Silpakorn University in Bangkok. In 2004, Tacey A. Rosolowski, a specialist in adornment art, prepared an oral history interview for the Smithsonian American Art Museum with Schick. A 40-year retrospective of the artist's work, Sculpture Transformed: The Work of Marjorie Schick, was curated by Rosolowski at Indiana University in 2007. Sixty-seven pieces of jewelry were exhibited covering the trajectory of Schick's development of themes and content, which focused on the transformative awareness of the body that one experienced while wearing her designs. Rosolowski was the principal collaborator on a book, Sculpture to Wear: The Jewelry of Marjorie Schick published as a retrospective of Schick's work by Arnoldsche Art Publishers in 2007. The book was written by ten contributors and covered the trajectory of Schick's career, assessing her innovation and impact on the development of the contemporary international jewelry aesthetic. After the book was released, a retrospective of Schick's work, by the same title began touring. The exhibit, accompanied by lectures, featured works loaned from the collections of museums, and toured throughout the United States and Europe between 2008 and 2009. Rosolowski also wrote the cover story, Sculpture for the Body for Craft Arts International′s 2008 edition featuring Schick's work. In 2011, Schick's works were exhibited in a show at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D. C. and in 2013, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art received 300 pieces of jewelry from the private collection of Lois Boardman which included some of Schick's designs. The works were featured in an exhibit Beyond Bling: Jewelry from the Lois Boardman Collection in 2017. In 2016, Schick stated in an interview with Art Jewelry Forum that her current work involved a series of wood shirts, whose design mimicked the styles of artists including Alexander Calder and Jim Dine. Schick retired from teaching in 2017, after having served 50 years at Pittsburg State University. Death and legacy Schick died from complications of a stroke on December 17, 2017 at the Kansas University Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas. Her pieces can be found in the permanent collections of many world-renowned museums, including the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia; the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City; the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra; the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design of Oslo; the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto, Japan; the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Seoul, South Korea; the National Museum of Scotland of Edinburgh; the Philadelphia Museum of Art in Pennsylvania; the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, Germany; and the Victoria and Albert Museum of London. Her teaching influenced generations of students including metalworkers Janet Lewis, whose works adorn the walls of the Pittsburg Public Library, and Sam Farmer, a 1987 recipient of the Elizabeth B. Koch Fellowship from the Kansas Cultural Trust, as well as painter Tera Reed and Native American weaver Margaret Roach Wheeler (Choctaw-Chickasaw).

Upon graduation from law school, she served as a law clerk in the Orleans Parish District Attorney's office and eventually rose to chief of the felony trials division. There, she prosecuted over 100 jury trials, primarily homicide cases. Former New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick Sr. called Vitter \\"honest, impartial and an outstanding legal scholar with plenty of courtroom experience.\\" Later she practiced at a boutique litigation firm specializing in maritime law and other matters.

The Union of Congregations and each of its local congregations avows themselves also to the doctrine of the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, because it is taken from Holy Bible which is the highest authority in all matters of Christian faith and doctrine.  Brief history  The origin of the Union of Congregations is the dispute in the Lutheran Evangelical revival movement (which movement was founded by Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg) on 1920s, is the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland enough committed to the Lutheran Confessions. It actualized when the new law on the freedom of religion in 1923 made it possible to resign the National Church and to form own religious community. Majority of the Lutheran Evangelical revival movement remained within the National Church. Beyond the foundation of the Union of Congregations was also necessity to go apart from unbiblical teaching. The inspiration for founding own free churches came from among other things Confessional Lutheran free churches of German and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. The first Evangelical Lutheran free congregation was founded in 1923 in Luopioinen. Later congregations in Lahti, Hämeenlinna, Tampere, Veteli and Marttila were founded. The leaders had dispute on the doctrine of the atonement in 1924 and it caused that these free Lutheran congregations were divided into two Lutheran church bodies. The Union of Congregations is the bigger one. The another one is Suomen tunnustuksellinen luterilainen kirkko (official English name is the Confessional Lutheran Church of Finland).  Activities and publications  The congregations are cooperating as a union of congregations in publishing ministry and camp activities. In addition to Divine services youths' gatherings, Children's clubs, gatherings at homes (Bible Study Groups and Singing) are own activities of local congregations. The Union of Congregations has camp and training center Kukkian Keidas in Luopioinen at Kuohijoki. The Union of Congregations has published books and own translation of New testament and Psalms which is adopted in 1935 (Psalms in 1949) and translation is linguistically revised in 1983.seurakuntaliiton-julkaisut The Union of Congregations publishes a periodical Seurakuntalainen and its circulation is 450.

The book traces the interactions between an activist state (the Workers' Party or Partido dos Trabalhadores) and a historically impoverished segment of the nation, offering an alternative to clientelism and universalism through the introduction of \\"intimate hierarchies,\\" which note the unofficial relationship and exchanges between politicians and their constituencies that maintain aspects of agricultural life in Northeast Brazil. The book won the 2015 Brazil Section Book Award from the Latin American Studies Association.  Synopsis  In this book, Ansell argues that Northeastern Brazil, under the PT, does not align with the traditional notions of clientelism or universalism, but instead has developed an unspoken system of “intimate hierarchies” that support a mutually beneficial socio-political system for politicians or elites and the impoverished citizens of Northeast Brazil. Ansell is responding to the predominant literature on post-authoritarian Brazil that uses the concept of clientelism as a means for elites to maintain their status, and for inequality to remain static. This concept, and the arguments of its practice, limits social and economic mobility in Northeast Brazil, holding marginalized and impoverished populations in their current place. Ansell's contribution to the literature is the introduction of a new way to think about the relationship between the party and citizens which complicates the traditional notions of clientelism. President Lula speaks during the ceremony of the Residential Lease Program - PAR, certificates of the Housing Allowance Program - PSH, and cards from the Bolsa Família Program Three terms that are vitally important to this book are patronage, clientelism, and universalism. Patronage is the granting jobs, favors, or services to individuals or groups who support a political party or campaign. Clientelism is a social order that depends upon and stems from patronage, particularly in politics where it emphasizes or exploits such relations of granting favors for political support. Universalism is a system where goods and services are distributed not as favors for political support, but as rights for all individuals regardless of politics. Piaui, Brazil This book is an ethnography, which examines the attempts of PT activists to use the program Zero Hunger (Fome Zero) to assist poor agricultural workers in northeast Brazil. Ansell's research began in 2001 at the Workers’ Party headquarters in Rio and continued through extensive field research conducted in the early 2000s. Ansell engaged with PT activists tasked with convincing the local, poor, largely subsistence farmers of the merits of the federal government's social program. The programs these young PT activists were pushing are Zero Hunger and, later, Bolsa Família (Family Stipend Program). Zero Hunger originally comprised many different programs. Some of these included projects with livestock rearing and cash cards. The cards became a large part of the later project, Bolsa Família. The programs are designed to attempt to construct a shared identity rooted in ideas of emancipation, with the eventual goal of mobilizing poor agricultural workers to pressure municipal, state and federal governments into providing goods and services which PT activists framed as their rights. According to Ansell, PT activists and government workers used three primary strategies in the attempt to convince northeastern Brazilians of the legitimacy and effectiveness of these programs. The first is what Ansell calls induced nostalgia, which is an attempt by PT activists to get local farmers to first conceptualize, then to reform and recreate the myth of the lost era of collective labour and consumption, which occurred before a reliance on clientelism. The second strategy used by PT activists was a strategy that Ansell refers to as Programmatic Pilgrimage. This strategy involved bussing large groups of subsistence farmers and agricultural workers to the state capital in Teresina. Here, they were encouraged to disregard their local and individual identities in exchange for a unification under the premise of a post-slavery ‘Quilombola’ past. The third strategy used by PT activists was one in which PT activists attempted to undermine the authority and command of local politicians, such as the mayor, by creating an independent and self-run committee that handled matters relating to the Zero Hunger program. The administration of the program was then, at least theoretically, free from regional politics and was controlled without the considerations and personal motivations of elites in localities. Despite their efforts, Ansell argues that none of these strategies really worked. This forced PT activists to reevaluate their understandings of the relationships between political elites and agrarian workers. Ansell calls these relationships, or networks of relationships, ‘intimate hierarchies.’ As the name suggests, these relationships are not as strictly delineated as either clientelism or universalism, but rather serves as a middle way between the two. Thus, these relationships are not vote buying, or official exchanges of favors, goods, or services for political support, as are associated with clientelism. Rather they are the long-term, unbalanced, yet mutually beneficial agreements between political elites and the masses according to which gifts, favors, goods, or services are to be exchanged without official records or an expectation for exact calculations. While these previous strategies were all fairly unsuccessful, Ansell notes that the PT activists did have some positive impacts on the region and the agrarian workers. First, livestock projects, which aided in the monetary and logistical complications of raising livestock, did assist the economic standing of farmers in the region. Second, activist involvement proved beneficial for women, as it shifted the patriarchal understanding of the household. Third, strategies like induced nostalgia and programmatic pilgrimage did assist in the formation of an understood community based in lower economic standing of the region, and its citizens, as a whole. And lastly, the emphasis of rights in the Zero Hunger Program shifted perceptions away from strict notions of clientelism to a heightened sense of mutual respect and long-term cooperation.  Critical Reception  Reviews of this book were completed by Stanley E. Blake in the Hispanic American Historical Review 95 (2015): 381-382. and Robert Gay in the Journal of Latin American Studies 47 (2015): 630-632. Stanley E. Blake (Ph.D., State University of New York, History, 2001) is a professor of history at The Ohio State University specializing in national identity in modern Brazilian and Latin American history. Robert Gay (Ph.D., Brown University, Sociology) is a professor of sociology at Connecticut College specializing in democracy, violence, and organized crime in Brazil. Blake praises Ansell for his analysis of patronage through the use of rational choice theory in the establishment of the concept of “intimate hierarchies.” This analysis is seen to force a conversation among historians on assumptions regarding the relationship between rural Brazil's residents and their politicians and bureaucrats. Gay echos these praises, adding commendations for Ansell's grounding of clientelism and universalism in lived social and political experiences, rather than discussing them in the abstract. Additionally, Gay notes the use of multiple voices and a lack of emphasis on the author as an asset to the book's design and execution. > Unlike a lot of ethnographies, this is not one that is dominated by the > author’s voice. On the contrary, throughout the book we get to hear from a > wide variety of actors, from poor agricultural workers, to local > politicians, to out of town administrators and activists. This is no small > achievement in a community where being seen talking to one person can close > off access to another. Ansell proves that he is a skilled ethnographer by > the very fact that he can bring so many different voices to the table. While Gay forgoes significant criticism, Blake is hesitant to fully embrace the analysis due to the use of anecdotal evidence and the lack of attention to long-term effects of the policies in question. Blake also notes that the anthropological account “would have benefited from a deeper engagement with the work of Brazilian labor historians who have demonstrated the ways in which workers further their own economic, social, and political interests by challenging and negotiating with employers, labor unions, and the state.”  Awards  Zero Hunger won the 2015 Brazil Section Book Award from the Latin American Studies Association.

The book is a case study of the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, as a way to understand the use of modernist principles as the basis for designing a city. The title is a reference to the principles of modernism underlying the development of the city. In the book, Holston traces the development and implementation of the plan for Brasilia, and the development of the city from its inception. The book is 369 pages long and contains 106 photographs, graphs, and diagrams.  Synopsis  Holston has a broad goal in the writing of the book, which he lays out near the beginning. He proposes \\"a critical ethnography of modernism\\" as a way for evaluating the flaws with each. He applies this concept in order to establish a \\"counter discourse\\" to show that the use of a master plan in effect caused the plan's own failure. These large- scale concepts frame his work. The book contains three parts which are each divided into multiple subsections. These parts are 1): The Myth of the Concrete, 2): The City Defamiliarized, and 3): The Recovery of History. In \\"The Myth of the Concrete,\\" Holston establishes the context of Brasília's development, saying \\"Brasília was built to be more that merely the symbol of this new age. Rather, its design and construction were intended as means to create it by transforming Brazilian society.\\" Building from this basis premise, he argues that the city was unable to live up to its lofty founding goals once it was inhabited because human interaction with its theoretical basis created a paradox that made it impossible to implement the initial plan. In this section, Holston draws upon the Plano Piloto, or the pilot plan for Brasília, statements by the President, Juscelino Kubitschek, as well as influential works of modernism to make his point. He then traces the development of Brasília to the tenants of Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), arguing that Brasília is a case study for the execution of those principles. Then, he traces how the creator of the plan, Lucio Costa, designed the plan as a way that it would be interpreted as a myth, arguing that this presentation led to its early appeal. In \\"The City Defamiliarized,\\" Holston argues that an area where the city broke with tradition the most clearly was in the death of the street. He shows how the plan was designed \\"to transform, both architecturally and socially, an urban way of life established in preindustrial cities.\\" He then analyzes street plans of more traditional European and Brazilian cities to show how the plan of Brasilia aimed to reorder the idea of the city. This concept is linked to zoning, which Holston uses to further show how Brasilia sought to reorder the traditional notion of the city by clearly breaking the city into specific zones that clearly separated different functions. In \\"The Recovery of History,\\" Holston directly address the paradox that arose when the presentation of Brasília as lacking a history clashed with the reality of constructing it. He argues that \\"to be different, an imagined utopia must negate the prevailing order that generates a desire for it and to be autonomous it must remain dehistoricized. Yet, in doing so, it becomes powerless to achieve autonomy since whatever substance it might have comes from that very order.\\" He traces how the establishment of Brasilia was meant to mirror the founding of Brazil and the realization of a new Brazil. However, he shows how neither the Portuguese or the Kubitschek administration took account of those there before, the indigenous peoples or the construction workers (pioneers). This failure to account for the construction worker was one key area where the Utopian vision of the city was undercut, as Holston shows through the multiple rebellions of the workers forcing their relocation to sanctioned satellite cities in the Federal District. He shows these workers' use of national symbols, arguing that this effort was key to securing satellite cities and access to Brasilia. Finally, he shows how traditional Brazilian city development and culture have crept into the city from day one, undercutting its purpose as a unique and ahistorical creation.  Critical Reception  The Modernist City: An Anthropological Critique of Brasilia has been largely positively received. Writing about the book, Michael Storper states \\"there is finally a book about modernism and the city that clarifies rather than obscures, that combines theoretical depth and methodological rigor with prose almost free of heavy academic jargon, and that is almost as fun to read as a novel.\\" The approachability of Holston's analysis is noted throughout critical responses to the book, and his strength of argument is noted as well. Reviewers point out his effective analysis of the concepts of utopianism and its relationship between modernism and reality. Another common theme in reviews of the book is praise of how Holston approaches modernism, with reviewers highlighting his simple explanations of modernism as a design principle and modernism as a way of life. Holston's interdisciplinary approach is also praised both for its breadth in coverage and in what it communicates to the reader, with reviewers saying \\"It is also liberally sprinkled with insights gleaned from the author's architectural, planning and anthropological reading.\\" However, this interdisciplinary approach can make it difficult for readers to clearly define the discipline and simultaneously understand his method as stated by Mia Fuller. The book has received some criticism, with Alan Gilbert arguing that \\"the sections on social and residential segregation are insufficiently based on hard data to satisfy most social scientists.\\" However, Gilbert does not see this issue as undermining his credibility. Another one of Gilbert critiques is that the multiple disciplines used in the work leads to some \\"reinventing [of] the wheel,\\" making the work repetitive in light of other more specific works in the appropriate subdisciplines.

His family was of English origin, having emigrated around 1660. Early life After service in the Hanseatic militia at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he studied law and political science at the universities of Göttingen, Berlin and Jena and received a doctorate in September 1819. He became an advocate in Hamburg and joined the Hamburg civil service as a legal official in Ritzebüttel, an exclave of the state of Hamburg at the mouth of the Elbe. In 1826 he became Senate Secretary. Syndicus In 1837, in recognition of his eminent talent and business experience, he was elected to the post of Syndicus. The four syndics sat in the Senate with the senators and took part in the debates, but had no vote. They had the title \\"Magnificence\\" and ranked between the mayors and the senators. The office, at that time, was somewhat analogous to that of a cabinet minister (which did not exist as such in Hamburg). To them were entrusted all important negotiations, and the preparation of every legislative enactment. In this office, he first dealt with trade policy, the postal service and railways. After the great fire of 1842, he brought about the construction of new buildings and the establishment of exemplary drainage and water supply facilities. Following the death of Karl Sieveking in 1847, Carl Merck was elected to Sieveking's Syndicus post, joining the other Syndics - Banks, Wilhelm Amsinck and Johann Kauffmann.Hamburgischer Staats Kalender 1846, publ. by Friedrich Hermann Nestler and Melle, Hamburg, 1846 Sieveking had been in charge of the Foreign Affairs of the State of Hamburg since 1820 when he became a Syndicus. After Sieveking's death, Banks was entrusted with the direction of foreign affairs. From 1848, Banks took up a number of diplomatic posts and was Hamburg's representative at the Diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt am Main. National Assembly in Frankfurt As a result of the German revolution starting in March 1848, Banks was sent by the Diet to London as a special envoy of the Federal Diet and soon afterwards became “Reichsgesandter” (German ambassador) in London for the fledgling central administration in Frankfurt. In the same capacity he went to Copenhagen in late autumn, after which he continued as the state of Hamburg’s representative at Frankfurt. Death As a result of the exhausting activity of these turbulent years, Banks had to seek a milder climate in the autumn of 1851 to restore his health, but died on 17 December at Veytaux near Vevey on the eastern shore of Lake Geneva.

Jackson's performance started the NFL's trend of signing top acts to appear during the Super Bowl to attract more viewers and interest. Background After Super Bowl XXVI, where a special episode of In Living Color, broadcast by future NFL broadcaster Fox during the game's halftime period successfully attracted viewers away from the Super Bowl telecast on CBS (with viewership falling by 22% over halftime), the NFL began the process of heightening the profile of the halftime show in an effort to attract mainstream viewers. Radio City Productions, who would produce the halftime show, attempted to court Michael Jackson to serve as the headline act by meeting with him and his manager Sandy Gallin. After three failed negotiations, including asking the NFL for a fee of $1 million, Jackson's management agreed to allow him to perform at Super Bowl XXVII. Although the league does not pay appearance fees for Super Bowl halftime performers, the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to donate $100,000 to the Heal the World Foundation—a charity that was founded by Jackson—as well as allocate commercial time to air an appeal for the foundation's Heal L.A. campaign, which aimed to provide health care, drug education, and mentorship for Los Angeles youth, particularly children affected by the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Nine days later, Jackson would conduct a television interview with Oprah Winfrey, which garnered the highest ratings for a television interview in history. Performance Jackson started his halftime performance by first appearing at the top of the stadium's two jumbotrons (using body doubles). Jackson then rocketed from center stage and stood completely still and silent for almost two minutes before beginning his performance. Jackson's performance included a medley consisting of \\"Jam\\" (with the beginning of \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\"), \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Black or White\\". The finale featured an audience card stunt, a video montage showing Jackson participating in various humanitarian efforts around the world, and a choir of 3,500 local Los Angeles area children singing \\"We Are the World\\", later joining Jackson as he sang his single \\"Heal the World\\" with an inflatable globe from the single's cover art. Commercial reception The halftime show was a major success, marking the first time in Super Bowl history that ratings increased between halves during the game.. This performance helped Jackson's latest album Dangerous rise 90 places in the album chart.Campbell, 1995, pp. 14–6. Set list The following songs were performed during the halftime show: * \\"Jam\\" (includes beginning of \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\") * \\"Billie Jean\\" * \\"Black or White\\" * \\"We Are the World\\" (children's choir) * \\"Heal the World\\" References 027 Events in Pasadena, California 1993 in California 20th century in Pasadena, California January 1993 events in the United States 1993 in American music Michael Jackson PepsiCo ","title":"Super Bowl XXVII halftime show"},{"id":"56390534","text":"Robert Szold (1889–1977) was a 20th-century American lawyer, best known as a champion for the reform of child labor law and as a Zionist movement leader as well as a founding partner of Szold, Brandwen, Meyers and Altern (1918). Background Robert Szold was born on September 29, 1889, in Streator, Illinois. His parents were merchants: Adolph Szold of Berehove, Zakarpatska, Ukraine, and Rachel Esther Gumbiner of Poland. He had three siblings. In 1909, he received a BA from Knox College. In 1912, he received a law degree with honors from Harvard University. Career In 1915, Szold was appointed Assistant Attorney General of Puerto Rico under United States Solicitor General John W. Davis until 1918. A brief that Szold wrote at that time led to the first-ever U.S. federal child labor law. In 1918, Szold returned to private practice and helped found the law firm of Szold, Brandwen, Meyers and Altman. (At some time during the early 1920s, the firm was known as Lowenthal, Szold and Brandwen of 43 Exchange Place, New York City. Lowenthal (1888–1971) became a director of the Amalgamated Bank and, later, a close advisor to U.S. President Harry S. Truman. Brandwen (1896–1986) became general counsel to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and a managing director of Amalgamated Bank. ) His clients included the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, led by Sidney Hillman. He also served as president of the United Housing Foundation. In 1919, Szold became friends with United States Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. That year, he also traveled to British Mandatory Palestine as a member of the Zionist Commission with his friend Harry Friedenwald. In 1920, he traveled to London with Július Šimon and Nehemia de Lieme as a member of the Reorganization Committee. Around that time, he found himself ousted as part of the Brandies-Mack faction by Chaim Weizmann faction. In 1930, the Brandeis-Mack faction returned to power, and Szold became chairman of the Zionist Organization of America through 1932. In this position, he drafted the certificate of incorporation of the Palestine Endowment Funds, Inc., for the Hebrew University. In 1937, Szold opposed the partition of Palestine. In 1942, Szold became treasurer and chairman of the budget committee of the American Emergency Committee for Zionist Affairs. In 1943, Szold became the first American Zionist leader to visit the British Mandate of Palestine since the United States of America entered World War II. Robert Szold on visit to Ramat Hashofet 1943 In 1945, Szold began serving as chairman of the board of the Palestine Economics Corporation through 1960. In 1946, at the 22nd World Zionist Congress, Szold supported Weizmann (against Abba Hillel Silver) to negotiate with the British. In addition to the above organizations, Szold served as a director for the Riverbay Corporation, East River Housing Corporation, and Edward A. Filene Good Will Fund. He was also an officer of the Hillman Housing Corporation and vice chairman of Council of Jewish Agency Personal life and death On September 4, 1917, Szold married Zip Falk. They had four daughters: Miriam, Ruth, Betty, and Joan. Szold was a third cousin of Henrietta Szold, whose father was Rabbi Benjamin Szold. Szold died age 88 on November 9, 1977 in New York City at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.

The Roman Theatre in Mainz, Rhineland Palatinate (ancient Mogontiacum) was excavated in the late 1990s. It is located immediately next to the Mainz Römisches Theater station and was once the largest Roman theatre north of the Alps, with a diameter of 116 metres, a stage-width of 42 metres, and a capacity of roughly ten thousand people.  History  Mogontiacum owed its significance to its location at the meeting point of the Main and the Rhine. The city provided a convenient base for the defense of the nearby border of the Roman empire, the limes, and for the organisation of military campaigns against the Germanii. As a result, a double legionary camp was built on the site in 13/12 BC, which remained in place until some time after AD 350. Over time a civilian settlement (Latin vicus) also developed on the site, which became the provincial capital of the newly created province of Germania Superior around AD 80. In this city, a Roman theatre was built, which was probably closely associated with the funerary games held in honour of Drusus. From 9 BC, military parades (decursio militum) were held in honour of Drusus at his cenotaph, the Drususstein, which was only 340 metres away from the theatre. Accordingly, the Roman theatre may have been used for the thanksgiving ceremony (supplicatio) by the representations of the sixty local Gallic communities (Galliarum civitates) in honour of Drusus. Suetonius mentions a theatre at Mogontiacum in his account of events in AD 39. Probably the currently visible stone structure was preceded by an earlier structure in wood. The theatre was the largest Roman theatre north of the Alps, seating some 10,000 visitors. The diameter of the seating area is 116 metres and the diameter of the orchestra in 42 metres. After the construction of the city wall in the middle of the fourth century AD, for which stone from the theatre was used, the theatre was left outside the walled area and fell into ruin. More and more of the stone from the theatre was taken away for reuse in new construction projects. The massive vaults of the theatre survived for a few centuries. From the 6th century they were used as catacombs for burials of the surrounding monasteries, especially St Nikomedes (which itself no longer exists). Graves associated with this period have been found in the recent excavations. The theatre is mentioned for a final time in the 11th century. Gozwin writes in his \\"Passio sancti Albani Martyris Moguntini\\" \\"The remaining ruins of the theatre there, which was built in the Roman manner for circus games and theatrical spectacles, provided this too.\\" During the construction of the Mainz Citadel in the middle of the 17th century, the area was completely levelled. The final visible remains of the masonry disappeared and the theatre was forgotten.  Rediscovery and excavation  State of excavation at the end of April 2007; new railway station building in the background. Foundations of the stage building were found in 1884 during the construction of the railway and were recorded before being demolished to make way for the tracks and platforms of the South Station (now the Mainz Römisches Theater station). The finds were not connected with the long lost theatre. In 1914, when further remains were discovered during the construction of a canal, the art historian Ernst Neeb identified the remains as part of a Roman theatre building. An exploratory excavation in 1916 supported his case, but because of the First World War, no further excavations could be undertaken. The remains were covered over once more and were completely forgotten. In 1998, after several years of planning, several pillars were uncovered as part of a first test trench. From 1999, general excavations of the structure were undertaken, funded by sponsorship and donations and the assistance of local volunteers. The theatre and its environs, including the neighbouring trains station and citadel, are to be further renovated in the near future. Musical and theatrical performances will be held in the theatre. There are also plans to extend the excavation area to the citadel and to reconstruct part of the theatre.  Amphitheatre  Mogontiacum very likely also had an amphitheatre. For a long time this could not be specifically located, but historical records and excavations suggest it was located in Zahlbach, near the Dahlheim cloister (itself no longer extant).Hans Jacobi: Mogontiacum. Das römische Mainz. Regio Verlag Mainz, Mainz 1996, , pp. 348–349, 1235–1237 In the notes of the Mainz monk Siegehard c. 1100 AD, there is mention of the ruins of a theatre in Zahlbach, which was said to have been used for gladiatorial fights and circus races.A. & R. Schmid, p. 221 In the Alten Geschichte von Mainz' by Father Joseph Fuchs, the amphitheatre is placed on another site, between modern Innenstadt and Hechtsheim. There would have been a large semicircle in which remains of solid pillars should have been found.A. & R. Schmid, p. 222 So far, however, archaeological evidence for either site is lacking. The existence of an amphitheatre is only asserted indirectly, through signs like the dedication of gladiators.  References  Bibliography * Günter Walz: Die Geschichte des Theaters in Mainz.

The group has written and produced several chart-topping hit singles on national radio, and was shortlisted to Top 50 for an international music production competition organized by Timbaland. They have shared the stage with international acts such as Status Quo, Demi Lovato, the Backstreet Boys, and 2NE1. They were also the opening acts for artists Fatman Scoop and Lil Jon on their tour in Malaysia. K-Town Clan is known for introducing the hip hop subgenre of crunk to Malaysia, along with their energetic and high octane performances. History=Formation (?–2008)= K-Town Clan was formed by schoolmates in their hometown of Kajang, Malaysia, sometime in the early 2000s. The group consists of three rappers, known by their stage names Big Bo, Roshan Jamrock and Dra-Vid. As a child, Jamrock's parents exposed him to music, including bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Beatles, and Gipsy Kings, among many others. His cousins who were studying in the United States introduced hip hop artists like Tupac, 2 Live Crew, and Snoop Dogg. Jamrock then met Dra-Vid at Kajang High School when he was 13 years old, and discovered they had the same interests and passion. They also met Big Bo, and would eventually form the trio K-Town Clan. In 2004, the group made their debut appearing on a national talent search competition called BlastOff, in which they were crowned the Grand Champions during the finale. Some time after, in the Orange Club at Kuala Lumpur, they had an audition and performed Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz's song Get Low. This earned them 10,000 ringgit and a trip to London. Following the events, K-Town Clan released their debut single Come Get Some in 2008, which made it onto the local radio station's top 10. =Hiatus, Playground, and Crunk Cowboys and the Moon $hine Music (2011–present)= After releasing their debut single, the group went on hiatus until 2011.

The team's first race at Nashville yielded a 26th place finish. Setzer would drive the truck in 9 races, with a best finish of 12th at Indianapolis Raceway Park and Bristol Motor Speedway. For the 2011 season, the team hired Clay Rogers as the driver. Rogers and RBR would finish 3rd in their debut together, and under NASCAR's new points system beginning that season, Rogers would be the points leader. The team then decide to expand their schedule from what they had previously planned. They would make it through the first 11 races of the season, before scaling back to a partial schedule. 2012 would prove to be a slow season as David Reutimann would miss the opening race at Daytona. After 3 races, Reutimann was replaced by Chad McCumbee, who would also be released after 3 starts. Scott Riggs was then hired to drive the 92 at the second Martinsville race. Riggs would return in 2013. For 2014, a rotation of drivers would run the truck, including Ross Chastain, Riggs, Corey Lajoie and Austin Hill as well as a switch from Chevy to Ford.

The mission of the ATFE is to preserve the Mohawk community's spiritual, cultural and biological integrity through activism, advocacy, and collaborative research. They achieve their efforts through projects related to political advocacy, environmental education and by conducting culturally-sensitive research to address the consequences of environmental injustices. The ATFE's influence has extended to surrounding public schools and has contributed to discussions on the introduction of Indigenous Knowledge into mainstream science curricula in the United States.  History = History of the ATFE and environmental injustice = In 1954, the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway began with the intent to facilitate economic and industrial growth in upper New York State. Project developers and government administrators directly violated treaties made with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy by developing on Akwesasne land, which is culturally and historically rooted on the St. Lawrence River. During the 1950s, fostering economic prosperity in less populated areas via industrial development was not unique to the upper New York region. The political climate under Eisenhower was characterized largely by the endorsement and prevalence of technological growth and advancement. Environmental justice scholarship asserts that indigenous populations, including the Akwesasne, are disproportionately exposed to the negative consequences of these economic advancements due to their lack of political agency and perceived inferiority. For example, in the wake of the St. Lawrence Seaway construction, Eisenhower's executive assistant, John Hamlin, referred to Native Americans as a “national problem,” a “less productive society” that was blocking the American vision of progress. These remarks are reflective of the Eisenhower administration's disregard for indigenous bodies and spaces, and the general attitudes of the time period that willed economic development over Native rights and voices. In late 1950s, developers built a hydroelectric dam on the St. Lawrence River, attracting industries to the Seaway located near Akwesasne territory. Three of the major industries to join the Seaway after its construction included General Motors, Reynolds Metals, and Aluminum Company of America. These companies were situated upstream of the Akwesasne, and have collectively formed one of the largest chemically contaminated sites in the U.S. The industries contribute pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, as well as metals and organic matter. General Motors, in particular, has caused significant damage to the Akwesasne community, due to their use of PCBs in the aluminum production process. In 1978, PCBs were deemed a hazardous substance by the Clean Water Act, and banned by the Toxic Substances Control Act for their detrimental effects on human and environmental health, which have been associated with reproductive failure, liver damage, and skin disease. The EPA fined General Motors for illegal usage of PCBs, prioritizing the site as a national Superfund site. However, they failed to follow through with many of the regulations and clean-up sanctions that were promised. For example, the Akwesasne community lobbied for the complete removal of General Motors toxic landfill, located within 500 yards of tribal land. These requests were denied by the EPA and the landfill was capped instead; a less-costly but significantly less effective solution to toxic contamination. This led to the ATFE being conceived in 1987, as a means to address environmental concerns, gain political agency, and remain actively involved in clean-up efforts and decision-making processes. According to the ATFE's research advisory committee, full cultural and environmental restoration will not occur until the EPA actively collaborates with Mohawk people in decision-making and superfund clean-up processes. = Mission statement = “The mission of the Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment is to, conserve, preserve, protect, and restore the environment, natural and cultural resources within the Mohawk territory of Akwesasne in order to promote the health and survival of the sacred web of life for future generations and to fulfill our responsibilities to the natural world as our Creator instructed.”  Goals and beliefs  The ATFE aims to contribute to natural and cultural resources, address the environmental problems such as those the Mohawk Nation faces, and mitigate the effects of current environmental issues through sustainable practices, research, and advocacy. These goals are accomplished under a culturally relevant framework that emphasizes the sacredness and interconnectedness of the land, and the subsequent need to restore and protect it. Specifically, the ATFE aims to: # Develop training, education and advocacy programs # Address community concerns about industrial pollution from nearby ALCOA, General Motors, and Reynolds Aluminum # Implement strategies to restore environmental and community health # Support culturally appropriate sustainable development projects # Conduct and support scientific research including sampling and testing for toxicants # Network with other Native communities, environmental and legal professionals  Cultural and spiritual foundation  The Akwesasne people are intimately interconnected with their environment, which for centuries has served as the basis of their spiritual and cultural heritage. The ATFE sites the St. Lawrence River as the “lifeblood” of their homeland, meaning it serves as a cultural and life-sustaining source of food, agricultural fertility, medicine, and spiritual tradition within their community. Akwesasne rejected the Saint Lawrence waterway construction because it broke relations between them and other peoples, especially the Dutch who had an agreement called kahswenhtha. The generations long relationship with nonhuman nature was also interrupted.The Akwesasne received little compensation and no political voice in the building of the waterway due to the fact that the ownership of the land they reside on is still being disputed at the state and federal level. The Mohawk emphasize the inter-relatedness of life and actions. The construction of the waterway not only impacted the environment, as sea life were increasingly contaminated with toxins, but the community began to lose associations with their language and culture, their connection to their Creator. The Akwesasne community maintains that when the environment is mistreated, the delicate balance between the land and the people is threatened, and both experience a devastating loss.  Structure of ATFE  In 1995, the Research Advisory Committee (RAC) was developed to address the sudden influx of research initiatives within the ATFE, and more specifically to establish a structured and formalized set of guidelines to review research proposals. This was officially known as the Protocol for Review of Environmental and Scientific Research Proposals. These protocols are guided by 3 fundamental ideals: peace, good mind, and strength. More specifically, the Mohawk people believe that these three principles are interconnected, such that striving for peace promotes peace of mind, which in turn requires strength to develop. Collectively, these 3 ideals serve to create a basis for reviewing and conducting research. The ATFE, in addition, stresses the importance of equity, empowerment, and mutual respect, all principles that are central to the organization and structural functioning of the task force, and crucial to the research and collaboration process. One of the primary goals of the ATFE is to create a culturally sensitive research environment that fosters inclusion and active participation of all community members. Thus the mutual and equitable collaboration of community members, scientists, and committee members alike is prioritized in the RAC, serving to give each participant a sense of empowerment and agency. Moreover, in considering research initiatives, the ATFE makes an active effort to facilitate equal distribution of power and resources, value all perspectives and contributions, and produce research that has direct benefits for community members.  Research initiatives  The ATFE participates and encourages research that is culturally sensitive and supports their environmental justice concerns, including the health effects of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the Mohawk Nation. To address concerns many Native Americans have over environmental hazards, the EPA has produced implements called risk assessment and risk management process. These implements were supposed to help manage the amount of toxins in the Natives' environment but they have failed the Native Americans. As such, the ATFE has committed to maintaining active involvement in decision making processes, and has started a movement called “The First Environmental Restoration” funded by the National Institute of Environmental and Health Services (NIEHS) in order to come up with a resolution to address toxicant issues facing the Mohawk territory of Akwesasne. More specifically, “The First Environmental Restoration” is a uniquely community-based initiative that emphasizes the protection of health and traditional culture. The fish that Akwesasne Mohawks traditionally eat are contaminated with PCBs due to General Motors, ALCOA, and Reynold's Metals spillage upstream in the Saint Lawrence River. One study evaluated 335 Akwesasne adults, roughly a quarter of the population, examining the total serum levels in the blood of Native adults and the self-reported rates of cardiovascular disease in the participants. It showed that this population had about 3 times higher background levels of PCBs when compared to the near nonexistent levels in the general US population. The study concluded that PCBs increase the cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis in P450 enzymes. Increased cholesterol and triglycerides have, in previous studies, been shown as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Along with this, the study found that Body Mass Index (BMI) and age were significantly correlated with the PCB levels in individuals. Toxicants have also threatened the reproduction of indigenous women, their families and communities as a whole. The ATFE maintains that exploring the intersectionality of environmental justice and reproductive justice will result in a deeper focus on and understanding of their environment. Moreover, research on the reproductive health of women correlate the same environmental issues addressed by the ATFE. Research on the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as PCBs, allow scientists to understand how the lifestyles of Mohawk cultures are impacting not only the health of those consuming contaminated species, but jeopardize the future of the nation as a whole. EDCs in young women in the Akwesasne community drastically decreased the women's ability to ovulate. Therefore, issues of reproductive justice are closely linked with the environmental contamination issues. Such scientific findings reveal an apparent correlation between numerous issues in Akwesasne communities and their contaminated environments. Further research into the impacts of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Akwesasne communities through a reproductive perspective revealed higher levels of pollutants in the blood of Akwesasne youth than non-Native groups in the same areas. Due to the lifestyle and culture of the Akwesasne, their likelihood to be exposed to the contaminated natural resources in their area are significantly higher than that of an average US citizen. Such contamination levels within the Akwesasne community differed based on the activities of the mother and the mother's history of breastfeeding her child or not. Reproductive justice must then be considered over many generations in order to adequately assess the impact of exposure in such communities, as POPs build up in bodily systems over time. Such is evidence to prove the continuation of contamination in the Mohawk nation, despite the EPA and federal governments efforts at improving the health of those communities. These findings offer a unique aim, focused on mothers, in Akwesasne research that more accurately depicts the assessment of risk in a region than the male body. Justice needs are beyond the equality of protection. “Using intersectionality as an analytic lens helps us to understand how individuals are differently affected by outside forces based on the varying combinations of their identities – race, class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship”.  Collaborations and partnership research  The ATFE partners with a number of higher education institutions to produce collaborate and culturally sensitive research that provides benefits for both scholars and tribe members. The research conducted by the ATFE provides knowledge on health perspectives, the environment, and justice among the people most impacted by toxic contaminants in the St. Lawrence River region. Researchers at the University at Albany, SUNY performed collaborative research with the nation to better understand the community, exposure levels and the cultural significance of the activities and lifestyle which contaminate Akwesasne people. Since a large portion of the US government’s responses to high correlations in industrial pollution and negative health of the Akwesasne people and environment are met with a request to change their lifestyle practices, this research offers a perspective on the lives of these people so that the US can better understand why this solution is insufficient. The development of the Seaway in the 1950s in the St. Lawrence River has contributed to decades of contamination accumulation in the bodies of those eating fish and other food near the river, and receiving breast milk from mothers with contaminants in their bodies. At this point, it is clear what has caused the negative health changes in the community, and this research helps to draw attention to the need for the US government to develop a new assessment of risk to understanding the build-up of these chemicals over time, and the impact they may already have for the next generation of Akwesasne. Collaboration with US institutions provides a connection and possibility for quicker results for changes in understanding, attitude and policies impacting the Akwesasne. In addition, the ATFE's research focuses on the harmful effects of PCBs, which have contaminated the St. Lawrence River as a result of the heavy concentration of industry residing upstream from the community. The Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment analyzed the relationship between PCB congeners and neurological function and ability in adolescents. This study compared 271 Mohawk mother and child (aged 10–16) pairs through a massive array of psychological and neurological tests, as well as a fasted blood sample. The psychological and neurological tests were chosen with cultural consideration. The blood samples were analyzed for cholesterol, triglyceride, and serum lipid concentrations of PCB congeners. 16 of the 209 congeners of PCB had high enough rates of detection to be analyzed and were grouped based on the congeners structural similarity to dioxins and the persistence. The two long- term memory exam scores correlated strongly with rates of all 4 categories of congeners which means there is a high probability that PCB effects long-term memory  Advocacy and activism = Education = The ATFE emphasizes formal education in school curricula and community based cultural education. The historical colonization of indigenous groups has excluded their history, culture and perspectives from the mainstream American formal education system. The incorporation of Traditional Knowledge (TK) into US formal schooling was mutually beneficial for both Native and non-Native groups in the US. An accurate understanding of the past allows students to better analyze contemporary issues. Through a formal partnership with SUNY Potsdam and the Salmon River Central School District, situated on Mohawk land, the Akwesasne community works to facilitate collaboration among community members and public school teachers to develop culturally relevant curriculum for Mohawk students. The benefits of a more holistic understanding of environmental processes exist within Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Western notions of science and ecosystems. U.S. politics, however, interact with the Akwesasne nations in a manner which ignores knowledge about the degree of interrelatedness of ecosystems and toxin build up in organisms over time. The ATFE argues that introducing TK to formal education in the United States could help blend scientific endeavors with power—socially, economically and politically. Scientific collaboration between US institutions and the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation have already revealed the importance of understanding not only contamination levels in Mohawk bodies, but the lifestyles and beliefs which contribute to their significance and continue to create meaning for the communities despite the negative health impacts. To begin, students with such perspectives would allow for quicker and more efficient results to come of interactions between the federal government and indigenous nations in the coming generations. Additionally, the inclusion of TK in formal schooling gives autonomy and a sense of belonging to Native American students, who have been largely overwritten, ignored and/or marginalized in other ways via the national school system and our incomplete telling of history leading to contemporary issues. The introduction of TK into scientific studies, in a formal education setting, would begin to facilitate the meshing of soft and hard sciences, of humanities and STEM research, so that the United States can maximize its potential for human expansion and justice. They also sponsor educational programs on traditional fishing and trapping called “Life skills on Land.” = ATFE and the political economy of the United States = Neoliberalism and environmental justice are two theoretical frames that play a role in the indigenous community. Shifting towards a neoliberalist market would compromise the mission of sovereignty expressed by so many First Nations. Since the beginning of the 21st century this new form of environmental governance has gained mainstream popularity. Therefore, Native Americans, including the Akwesasne, have questioned the decision to prioritize a different environmental activism framework which is more aligned with Mohawk values and lifestyles. Through education programs, the ATFE has sought a reformed political framework which legitimized Traditional Knowledge (TK) over the positivist scientific framework which dominates environmental work in the US. TK can be used to reimagine First Nation boundaries to include the ecosystems which run through such borders. In general, the holistic approach of TK works to protect the natural resources and health of entire ecosystems, including the human members living off of those resources. By promoting indigenous knowledge in Native and non-Native school systems, the Mohawk perspective begins to be included in issues of sovereignty and environmental justice issues. As more students are exposed to differing systems of knowledge in a legitimate setting, there is a higher chance that those principles can be adopted by the future generations into policy related to indigenous populations within the United States. Traditional Knowledge offers a Native perspective on issues such as sovereignty, self-determination, autonomy and agency among the community.  Ongoing projects  The ATFE research initiatives are the launch pad for actualizing a goal of the group—to develop a community-based research database. Because the Akwesasne control all aspects of conducting the research, the group is able to express cultural values of respect regarding the intent of their research, their subjects and how their findings can contribute toward actualizing goals of environmental justice. As sovereignty is essential in understanding to issues of First Nations within the US, these research projects exemplify the ability of First Nations to address their own concerns without the intervention of the mainstream American society. Resolving issues with respect, equity, and empowerment is something that the Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment lives by. Through these three standards, the task force is able to address their own ideas of risk assessment, data and potential solutions through a culturally appropriate methodology. The ATFE on the Environment has lessened the effects of pollution on the community while simultaneously preserving Mohawk culture through efforts in maintaining multiple aquaculture facilities. These facilities produce pollutant free fish species for the local community to eat, allowing for the continuation of their cultural practices. The major projects and current focus areas of the ATFE include: ** Advocacy *** Research initiatives by the ATFE have built the foundation for the group to connect with the wider community to inform the public about the Akwesasne issues from their own perspectives. ATFE has advocated for the introduction of Traditional Knowledge in formal schooling in order to expand the perspectives of the future leaders of this country. These efforts have impacted both Native and non-Native students, and offer an alternative perspective on the environment which could promote more thoughtful and holistic approaches to handling natural resources in the future. ** Aquaculture Project *** The Task force has worked to produce aquaculture labs in order to provide the community with non-contaminated fish species for consumption. This initiative works to temporarily address the issue of consuming contaminated, yet cultural significant species while the Task Force works toward reversing the contamination to the St. Lawrence River ecosystem. Because the research initiative was born within the Akwesasne community, its efforts approach food insecurity from both a short and long- term perspective to ensure the health of the existing community. ** Black Ash Project *** The Asian emerald ash borer was introduced to the United States in the 1990s. Since then, these ash borers have threatened the Ash Tree populations. Ash trees, specifically, the black ash, is used in Native American basket weaving which has economic and cultural importance to the tribes. This study collected and analyzed the responses of Native American Tribes to this invasion and how they sought to mitigate the effects the ash borer could have. The Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment, in particular, started the “Black Ash Project.” This project educated the community on black ash seed collection and even organized 21 seed collections in 2009. ** Cultural Resource Program ** Environmental Education ** Environmental Laboratory ** Fruit Tree Project *** They run seed giveaways of native trees. ** Maple Sugar Project ** Medicine Plant Restoration Project ** Research and Partnerships ** Sustainable Agriculture Program ** Sweet Grass Project ** Traditional Medicines ** Wild Rice Project  References  Native American organizations ","title":"Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment"},{"id":"56390959","text":"General Kircho Kirov was the head of the National Intelligence Service of Bulgaria from February 2003 to January 2012.

Built in 1888, it is believed to be the only such structure in the United States in which the enclosed gas containment unit is essentially intact. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. As of 2018 it is owned by Liberty Utilities, a regional natural gas company, and its future is uncertain. Description and history The Concord Gas Light Company Gasholder House is located south of downtown Concord, on the east side of South Main Street just south of its junction with Water Street and north of its junction with Gas Street. It is a circular brick building in diameter, which is capped by a funnel-shaped roof that has a cupola at the center. The total building height is . Architecturally, the wall is divided into sixteen sections, articulated by simple brick piers, with a tall and narrow round-headed window in most of these sections. A south-facing bay has a projecting hip-roofed valve house, which historically served as the source feed for the storage facility, while a west-facing bay has a projecting gable-roofed valve house which housed the interconnection to the city mains. Inside the brick structure is a concrete storage tank with a capacity of . It has a floor thick, with walls that taper from at the base to at the top. It is reinforced by wrought iron bands. The gasholder (which functions as a sort of lid on the tank) is in diameter, and is constructed out of metal plates riveted together. It was guided in its movements by rails mounted on the inside of the concrete tank. The Concord Gas Light Company was founded in 1852, establishing a plant for manufacturing lighting gas from coal on South Main Street. As the company expanded service, it built smaller gasholders, both near its manufacturing sites, and at remote service areas. By the 1880s, it had four such gasholders with a total capacity of , which was deemed inadequate for its needs. The present building was constructed in 1888 as a long-term solution to its capacity problem. In 1921 the company built a second gasholder, a more modern steel structure with more capacity, which was demolished in 1989. The company discontinued use of gasholders in 1952, when Concord was connected to natural gas pipeline networks. According to research performed as part of a Historic American Engineering Record survey of the building, it is believed to be the only gasholder building of its type with an intact interior tank.

The policy, as per directions issued in February 1946, aimed to consolidate individual landholdings and labour into collective farms (Peasants' Work Cooperatives). The Yugoslav government followed the pattern of the Soviet Union, with two types of farms, the state farms and collective farms. The peasants' holdings were operated under government supervision, the state farms owned by the governments were operated by hired labour. Of the European communist states, Yugoslavia ranked second, behind Bulgaria, in proportion of peasant households in collectives. In 1950, 21.9% of arable land and 18.1% of households were under collectivization. The Cazin rebellion of May 1950 was a peasant revolt against the state's collectivization efforts and was a factor in the abandonment of collectivization that occurred throughout the 1950s in Yugoslavia.

Dill, a computer scientist from Stanford University, designed to preserve the democratic process with modern day voting advancements. Dill’s educational nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization has grown quickly since its founding and seeks to represent concerned citizens who are hesitant about electronic paperless voting. The Verified Voting Foundation volunteers act as lobbyists, educators, and leaders who promote a secure voting environment by the means of paper voting with a tangible receipt for each vote. They do this by influencing election officials and civilians at every level of government to closely monitor elections in the United States. As well, the Verified Voting Foundation is in charge of a database that contains \\"voting system information\\" and \\"best practices\\"; this information about the electoral process and voting equipment is available to the public online. The role of the Verified Voting Foundation has expanded as various ballot mechanisms have emerged in the United States. The 2000 and 2016 Presidential elections have contributed to this foundation's role because citizens and officials were questioning voter security and ballot counts after both elections.  History = Foundation = David L. Dill's research involves \\"circuit verification and synthesis and in verification methods for hard real-time systems\\". Part of this work has required him to testify on \\"electronic voting before the U.S. Senate and the Commission on Federal Election Reform\\". These interests ultimately led him to establishing the Verified Voting Foundation in 2003.  Activities = Partnerships and lobbying efforts = The Verified Voting Foundation has established a partnership with the Election Protection Coalition; they act as a resource to help voters with registering to vote, finding their polling place, absentee voting, and informing voters about election tools used at their polling site. This is done through hotline services, digital aids, and on the field volunteer work. The Verified Voting Foundation also provides the public with information and resources about the electoral process and practices across the country. Because there is no cohesive regulation over the electoral process in the United States, voting protocols for state and federal elections are controlled by individual states. Through lobbying and other efforts, the Verified Voting Foundation advocates for the government to take a larger role in electoral regulation to mandate standardized voting tactics–like paper ballots–for every state. Volunteers are currently in the process of launching the organization's nationwide campaign to push for the use of paper ballots and regular voting audits on voting system hardware and software throughout the country. Historically, addressing issues with voting systems has not been at the forefront of political agendas. Election officials want citizens showing up to the polls confident about where their vote is going and how it is being interpreted. The Verified Voting Foundation essentially acts a non- governmental advocacy group that attempts address what they see as a voter security issue by pressuring government officials to prioritize election reform in favor of their belief of \\"best practices\\". The 2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida was a trivial event that forced officials to improve vote accuracy and \\"raised concerns about how Americans vote\\". The punch card voting method used in Florida did not provide the accurate vote count for the state; which ultimately played a crucial role in who as elected as president. This event sparked George W Bush to sign the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) a year later. HAVA helped fund states to improve their voting systems and practices by requiring states to meet new standards, accessibility requirements, and protocols (outlined in the legislation) in their electoral process. States like Florida, Georgia, and Maryland have used HAVA to be proactive in reforming their ballot tactics in that suited their state's practices. For instance, activist groups in Maryland, associated with the Verified Voting Foundation, continue to advocate for a \\"voter-verifiable receipt or switch to paper ballot\\" with its current online voting tactics. Other states like Idaho, California, Arizona, Illinois and Pennsylvania have been slower to react and change their voting habits. The implementation of HAVA created new debates for the democratic process like: “voter identification, provisional balloting, absentee voting, and paper ballots”. The Verified Foundation's volunteer and research work attempts build off the work from HAVA to encourage their perspective on what constitutes necessary voting changes for states to ensure vote accuracy. In December of 2019 allegations of impropriety by Verified Voting resulted in the resignation of board members. These board members Phillip Stark and Richard Demillo resigned after alleging Verified Voting was pushing the sale of election systems they knew to be faulty and that Verified Voting was acting out of duty and relationship with proprietary software interests. https://www.fastcompany.com/90441559/two-experts-quit-election-accountability- group-over-claims-it-has-been-endorsing-untrustworthy-machines = The Verifier Tool = In 2012, along with the Rutgers Law School Constitutional Litigation Clinic and Common Cause, the Verified Voting Foundation conducted an extensive survey of \\"states' voting equipment and ranked the states according to their preparedness\\". This research specifically looked at each state's voting technology and how this correlated to the foundation's standards for overall ability to preserve the democratic process. Their combined research efforts resulted in an online \\"interactive\\" visual tool, The Verifier, where this information is accessible to voters. The Verifier is the Verified Voting Foundation's information database that provides details on \\"polling place equipment, accessible equipment, early voting equipment, and absentee ballot tabulation\\" nationwide and for each state.  Stances = Stance on paper ballots = The Verified Voting Foundation advocates for the use of paper ballots in order to have a traceable receipt of each voter's ballot. Paper ballots were first used in the United States to elect a pastor for the Salem Church in 1629; this voting method remained popular until the late nineteenth century. During this time period, paper ballots' two main concerns regarded voter privacy and ballot stuffing. After the 1880s, new voting methods began to emerge across the nation including manual counting systems and electronic voting services. This led to polling sites across the country to move away from the more traditional use of paper ballots and partake in an array of different voting methods. The mechanical lever was one of the first ones introduced and helped combat the concern of “ballot interpretation” but did not provide a traceable voting record for each citizen. As of 2010, states no longer practice the mechanical lever voting method. The punched card voting method was introduced in the 1960s and has voters punch holes for the candidates they support. The cards are then either placed in a ballot box or put through a vote counting machine. The main dilemma that arose for this method is that additional paper markings on the sheets during this process made it difficult to obtain an accurate vote count; this method is no longer used in the electoral process. Other notable voting methods used by states include optical scan ballot systems, DRE voting machines, hand counted paper ballots,electronic voting. Ultimately, because there is not a uniform mechanism to count and provide a receipt for each vote across the United States, the Verified Voting Foundation attempts to start dialogue and provide tools to inform the public about the voting process; their efforts are in hopes of eliminating voting ambiguity from different methods and make the electoral process as cohesive and secure to their standards as possible by preventing vote miscounts and \\"vote tampering\\". Previously, manipulating a state or federal election meant ballot stuffing or intentionally miscounting votes. For instance, Huey Long was caught meddling with paper votes in 1932; as well, votes in the 1948 Senate election appeared to be miscounted as Johnson suspiciously “overcame a 20,000 vote deficit”. Today, election officials are preparing for digital hacking as well with electronic voting. After the 2016 presidential election, voters and officials became more aware of this possibility as of accusations towards Russia for election hacking started to arise. Part of the Verified Voting Foundation's work is motivated to remove this voting option in order to prevent this potential vulnerability for electronic voting and require a paper receipt for each voter as a physical source of accountability to prevent skewed election results. = Stance on online voting = A common consideration under electoral reform is online (or internet) voting, where voters cast their ballots from their personal internet devices. While this is an enabling technology for voters with disabilities, the Verified Voting Foundation considers the security risks to outweigh any benefits. Like electronic voting, online voting leaves no audit trail. A breach of a voting server could result in a fraudulent election result; one that leaves no evidence or trace of the attack. Unlike other online services, such as banking, election manipulation is difficult to catch because ballot secrecy prevents voters from seeing their ballots after they have submitted them, which also prevents voters from determining if their votes have been digitally altered or not.https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/vote-online/ = Stance on cryptographic protections = A wide variety of systems propose using cryptography to provide a digital audit trail to either augment or replace a paper audit trail. Most prominently, these are end-to-end (E2E) auditable voting systems. The idea for such a design goes back to the early 1980s. A number of directors and advisors to the Verified Voting Foundation have worked on designing such systems, however the Foundation has no public unified stance on these systems. Instead, it often notes these systems are primarily research-focused and not commercially deployed at the present time. Since the release of Bitcoin in late 2008, a second set of cryptographic systems propose using Bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology to provide election integrity. These systems may or may not be end-to-end verifiable. The use of a blockchain is considered by the Foundation to be insufficient for protecting elections. Voter verifiability is a major security requirement of voting, which is not solved by blockchainhttps://www.verifiedvoting.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/10/The-Myth-of-_Secure_-Blockchain-Voting-1002.pdf Europe is developping an eIDAS compatible framework named the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), which potentially addresses this verifiability issue.

The museum is an old farm that was purchased for museum purposes in 1958. The farm is located about from the center of Ørsta. History The Brudavoll Farm has probably been inhabited since the 16th century. In the 17th century, the farm was struck by a landslide and the buildings were moved to a new location on the property. As far as is known, the farm was an isolated one. At that time, it was the farm with the largest open territory in Ørsta. In its configuration today, it is representative of an ordinary home in a rural fishing community in the 19th century. After the Ørsta Open Air Museum Society (Ørsta bygdemuseumslag) was established in 1951, it purchased part of the Brudavoll Farm in 1958: the buildings on the old farm and a small part of the land. The rest of the property was taken over by a new owner. The Ørsta Open Air Museum Society was the owner and operator of the Brudavoll Farm until 2004, when ownership was assumed by the Brudavoll Farm Foundation (Stiftinga Brudavolltunet).

Such languages can be evolved starting from a natural (human) language, or can be created ab initio. In addition, a new \\"interlingua\\" language may evolve within an AI tasked with translating between known languages.  Evolution from English  In 2017 Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) trained chatbots on a corpus of English text conversations between humans playing a simple trading game involving balls, hats, and books. When programmed to experiment with English and tasked with optimizing trades, the chatbots seemed to evolve a reworked version of English to better solve their task. In some cases the exchanges seemed nonsensical: > Bob: \\"I can can I I everything else\\" > Alice: \\"Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to\\" Facebook's Dhruv Batra said: \\"There was no reward to sticking to English language. Agents will drift off understandable language and invent codewords for themselves. Like if I say ‘the’ five times, you interpret that to mean I want five copies of this item.\\" It's often unclear exactly why a neural network decided to produce the output that it did. Because the agents' evolved language was opaque to humans, Facebook modified the algorithm to explicitly provide an incentive to mimic humans. This modified algorithm is preferable in many contexts, even though it scores lower in effectiveness than the opaque algorithm, because clarity to humans is important in many use cases. In The Atlantic, Adreinne LaFrance analogized the wondrous and \\"terrifying\\" evolved chatbot language to cryptophasia, the phenomenon of some twins developing a language that only the two children can understand.  Evolution ab initio  In 2017 researchers at OpenAI demonstrated a multi-agent environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic language ab initio without starting from a pre-existing language. The language consists of a stream of \\"ungrounded\\" (initially meaningless) abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, which comes to evolve a defined vocabulary and syntactical constraints. One of the tokens might evolve to mean \\"blue-agent\\", another \\"red-landmark\\", and a third \\"goto\\", in which case an agent will say \\"goto red-landmark blue-agent\\" to ask the blue agent to go to the red landmark. In addition, when visible to one another, the agents could spontaneously learn nonverbal communication such as pointing, guiding, and pushing. The researchers speculated that the emergence of AI language might be analogous to the evolution of human communication.Mordatch, I., & Abbeel, P. (2017). Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04908. Similarly, a 2017 study from Abhishek Das and colleagues demonstrated the emergence of language and communication in a visual question-answer context, showing that a pair of chatbots can invent a communication protocol that associates ungrounded tokens with colors and shapes.Das, A., Kottur, S., Moura, J. M., Lee, S., & Batra, D. (2017). Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.06585.  Interlingua  In 2016, Google deployed to Google Translate an AI designed to directly translate between any of 103 different natural languages, including pairs of languages that it had never before seen translated between. Researchers examined whether the machine learning algorithms were choosing to translating human-language sentences into a kind of \\"interlingua\\", and found that the AI was indeed encoding semantics within its structures. The researchers cited this as evidence that a new interlingua, evolved from the natural languages, exists within the network.Johnson, M., Schuster, M., Le, Q.

Indeed, it was found that the combination of two catalysts, silver nanoparticles and an ionic liquid solution containing equal volumes of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF4) and water, reduced the overpotential for CO2 conversion to carbon monoxide (CO) from about 1 volt to only 0.17 volts.Brian A.

Dioxide Materials' proposed reaction pathway for CO2 electrolysis on silver in the presence (green) and absence (black) of EMIMAt this point there is still some question about how the imidazolium is able to lower the overpotential for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The first step in the electrolysis of CO2 is the addition of an electron into the CO2 or a molecular complex containing CO2. The resultant species is labeled \\"CO2¯\\" in the figure on the left. It requires at least an electron-volt of energy per molecule to form the species in the absence of the ionic liquid.Chemistry Views (Elsevier) Converting CO2 with Less Energy That electron-volt of energy is largely wasted during the reaction. Rosen at al postulated that a new complex forms in presence of the ionic liquid so that 1 eV of energy is not wasted. The complex allows the reaction to follow the green pathway on the figure on the right. Recent work suggests that the new complex is a zwitterionMark Pellerite, Marina Kaplun, Claire Hartmann-Thompson, Krzysztof A.

He farmed at The Reedbeds,The Reedbeds was an area at the lower (western) reaches of the River Torrens now covered by the suburbs of Fulham, Lockleys and Underdale. and after making a small fortune as one of the fortunate \\"Snobs\\" group of investors in the Burra copper mines, purchased a fine property in Burnside and land at 103–105 Rundle Street (Section 84? 85?), where he opened a furniture factory, which soon won valuable contracts, including seating for the new Legislative Council chambers in 1855. During this period his workshop was destroyed by fire, presumably from a candle left burning after the men, who had been working overtime, left the premises. His insurance was nowhere near sufficient to cover his losses, but despite the loss of materials, tools and facilities he was able to fill the contract satisfactorily. The work produced in his factory has been judged the colony's finest, with nearby Mayfield's a close second. Another prestigious contract was for furnishing a private suite in Government House for the Duke of Edinburgh during his 1867 Royal Visit. Tragedy struck Debney: his wife Susanna (née Woodward) and daughter Matilda drowned in 1860 when their sailing boat capsized off Glenelg. He was part owner, with James Woodforde, of Mundowdna Station and a licensed valuator. He served as Chairman of the Burnside Council for six years, and as undertaker for the most prestigious funerals. He was the first Adelaide employer to reduce his men's working day from ten to nine hours. In 1875 he sold his cabinetmaking business to Patrick Gay and in 1877 sold his Burnside property to Simpson NewlandThis became \\"Undelcarra\\", later the home of the (unrelated) Simpson family. Some references have the mansion built for Debney, others say Newland. His Rundle Street property was sold in 1886 for £22,000.

The bikes are a bright red orange and weigh . Riders unlock bikes using the Uber app and are charged to their Uber account. Each Jump bike has a 250-watt electric motor which powers the front wheel. Jump employees swap out the battery packs every three days. At the end of a ride, the bikes have to be locked to a sidewalk bicycle rack. Uber acquired the company in April 2018, and expansion into European markets began in June that year. In May 2020, Lime took over the Jump business as part of an investment deal with Uber. History Jump was founded as Social Bicycles, Inc. in 2010, and launched its bikes in 2013. By 2018 it had deployed 15,000 bikes in six countries, with users making over 5 million rides. The company rebranded as Jump in January 2018. In February 2018, Uber reached a deal to allow riders in San Francisco to access Jump's fleet of e-bikes in the Uber app. Two months later, Uber acquired Jump Bikes for a reported US$200 million. After the acquisition, Jump's CEO announced the company was planning an expansion into Europe, which began in June 2018. In October 2018, Jump began rolling out its scooter-sharing system in Santa Monica, California in addition to e-bikes. By then, Jump operated 4,000 bicycles across 13 cities. In December 2018, Jump announced plans to update their bikes with new features including a front computer, improved electric- assist, and a swappable battery starting in January of the following year. Uber transferred the Jump e-bike and scooter business to Lime in May 2020 as part of an Uber-led round of investment into Lime. In a statement, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said, \\"Lime has the operational expertise and undivided focus needed to build a scaled, sustainable micromobility business,\\" and cited the move as preparing Uber for recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic had hurt Uber's rides business. After the deal, Uber destroyed thousands of old-model electric bikes and scooters due to maintenance, liability, and safety concerns. In June 2020, Lime re-launched JUMP bikes in many major US and European cities. This relaunch changed prices to match those of Lime's. In August, Lime officially integrated JUMP bikes into their app. This new integration now allowed for users to book a ride up to 30 minutes in advance, 15 minuets more than what was offered in the Uber app. As of August 2020, JUMP bikes are now only available in the Lime app, with integration back into the Uber app slated for later this year.  Areas served = United States = A Jump Bike docked at a public bicycle dock along the National Mall A Jump Bike in Rome, Italy Providence, Rhode Island The service launched in Washington, D.C. in September 2017. This was followed by a launch in San Francisco during January 2018, becoming the first dockless bike sharing system to launch in the city. In May 2018, Jump launched in Santa Cruz, California with a fleet of 250 electric bicycles. They also launched in Sacramento, California during that month, later adding charging stations for the e-bikes throughout the city. In June 2018, Jump began a six-month pilot program with the City of Chicago, placing its dockless electric bikes in the South Side region for rental. When the six-month period concluded, Jump pulled their bikes from Chicago streets pending legislation from the city. On 2 July 2018, Jump made its Texas debut in Austin. In New York City, Jump e-bikes are available in Central Bronx and the North Shore of Staten Island as part of a dockless bike pilot program by the city which began in July 2018. In August 2018, Jump began operations in Denver. As of September 2018, Jump has expanded the program to Providence, Rhode Island. However, the service has been suspended indefinitely following issues of theft and vandalism. The company also received permission from the Santa Monica government to roll out 500 e-bikes and 250 e-scooters in the city. In December 2018, Jump started operations in Atlanta and San Diego. = Europe = In June 2018, Jump launched its electric bike-sharing system in Berlin, Germany, marking the start of Jump's planned European expansion, under the ownership of Uber. In April 2019 it was launched in Paris, France. In May 2019, the system was launched in London. In November 2019, it was launched in Lisbon, Portugal and Rome, Italy. = Canada = In September 2018, Uber announced interest in expanding Jump into the Montreal market, which would make it the first dockless bikeshare in the city. In June 2019, Jump purchased the operational team contracts of Hamilton BikeShare, marking its first official entrance into the Canadian market. While Hamilton Bike Share's monthly and Pay as you Go members have access to 24/7 Jump team support, the Everyone Rides Initiative (ERI) subsidized low income pass program is still directly run by Hamilton Bike Share staff in the SoBi Hamilton office. = New Zealand = In June 2019 Jump launched their e-scooter product into the Wellington market, competing with local scooter company Flamingo and dockless bike company Onzo. In January 2020, Jump scooters and e-bikes launched in Auckland. In mid 2020, the Auckland Council reissued operating permits, and Jump scooters and e-bikes were re-launched by Lime in September.

History Patrick Gay, sen. (c. 1815 – 7 October 1866), his wife Agnes Waddell Gay (c. 1816 – 16 November 1903) and their small family left Fifeshire, Scotland, and emigrated to South Australia aboard James Fernie in 1854. In 1864 he established a cabinetmaking and undertaking business P. Gay & Son at 107 Rundle Street, on the Twin Street corner adjacent George Debney's furniture warehouse and in premises rented from Debney. Patrick Gay (c. 1841 – 30 October 1911), who had been working for Debney, took over the business in 1867. Around 1875 he took over Debney's premises on a 28-year lease. includes considerable detail of store layout and stock.

The shop had been closed around 2:30 pm, and first signs of smoke noticed around 9 pm, and a fire hose deployed around 10. Without any evidence, the newspapers assumed arson (\\"incendiarists\\"), perhaps thinking of a disgruntled ex-employee, as Gay had sacked some of his work- force in response to the economic downturn of a year before, and those remaining were on short hours. At the inquest it transpired that there was a hole, accessible from the Sturt Stables, in the wall of the flockroom, adjacent to Gay's engine (gas driven) room. Flock and kapoc, natural fibres used for stuffing mattresses and upholstery, are both somewhat flammable, and could conceivably be ignited by someone of malicious intent. All witnesses insisted Gay maintained good relations with all employees, past and present, and there was no enmity between his English and German workmen, who were on equal pay rates. The inquest failed to decide on a probable cause, and Gay was able to claim from the insurance companies. =The arcades= Gay's Arcade frontage Twin Street, Adelaide The design for Adelaide Arcade had been completed and work commenced on its construction when a separate design by a different architect, James Cumming (c. 1825–1901), was commissioned for a three-storey building on Twin Street and an arcade to join Adelaide Arcade at right angles near the middle. The contract for building Gay's Arcade, as it would be named, was let to Nicholas Wallis Trudgen (c. 1829–1892), who was likewise not involved in the Adelaide Arcade project. :The syndicate of investors in the Adelaide Arcade consisted of Emanuel Cohen, J. M. Wendt, Patrick Gay, Saul Solomon, and L. H. Berens. It is not known whether the same or another group or even Gay himself financed Gay's Arcade. Both arcades were completed by the beginning of December 1885; Gay's workshops, and warehouses occupied the upper two floors of the block building and one side of Gay's Arcade was devoted to his showrooms.

The buildings were designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and Frederick George Kirkegard with the first buildings being constructed from 1928 to 1929. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 2015.  History  Moorooka State School opened in January 1929 to accommodate the growing population of a previously rural district on the southern outskirts of Brisbane. The first Sectional School building was extended in 1933 and 1946 with further Sectional School buildings to its northeast and northwest corners. In 1956 a three- storey brick and concrete classroom block in a modernist style was added, as post-war housing construction in Moorooka continued to increase the local population. The standard and purpose-built school buildings are set amongst terraced, landscaped grounds with mature trees. Apart from a brief hiatus during World War II (WWII), the school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity. Originally part of an area called \\"Boggo\\", which ran from Dutton Park to Rocky Water Holes (later Rocklea, ), and which was part of the traditional lands of the Turrbal people, Moorooka's development was spurred on by transport improvements. Predominantly an agricultural area until the early 20th century,Clarke, R and Thomason, P, 1979 (plus 1989 update volume by Thomason, P), Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989: a history of the school and district.

By 1900 Moorooka was still primarily rural, with most residents living between Ipswich Road and Beaudesert Road.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, pp.20-1. Moorooka was part of the Shire of Yeerongpilly, prior to its amalgamation into the City of Brisbane in 1925. The house \\"Greenloaning\\", built for Robert Bell in 1904, was on land which later became the Moorooka State School's Infant School, and his family lived there until WWII.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.24. Residential development occurred to the west and north of the school site in the early 20th century, assisted by the extension of the tramline to Yeronga Park in 1915.'Do you know your Brisbane? Ipswich Road - a cluster of progressive suburbs.' Sunday Mail, 14 April 1929, p.23. In the 1920s the area east of Ipswich Road, to the south of Yeronga Park, was used for war service housing.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.30.

The article claimed that Moorooka would become \\"another Annerley\\", regarding residential development, thanks to the tram line extension. The tramline was extended to Salisbury in 1940. (Mackenzie, A, 1992. Memories along the Boggo Track, Boolarong, Brisbane, p.108. However, the area around Moorooka State School (east of Beaudesert Road, between Mayfield and Evans Roads) remained largely undeveloped before WWII, apart from some housing between Bracken Street and Sherley Street.Aerial photograph, 17 May 1944, RAAF3-4. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of growing communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers. In 1911, the population of Moorooka was 350, rising to 791 by 1921.'Moorooka', www.queenslandplaces.com.au/moorooka (accessed 6 May 2015). Pressure for a state school at Moorooka occurred from around 1912, when the Moorooka Progress Association presented a petition to the Education Department.'Progress Associations: Moorooka', The Telegraph, 13 December 1912, p.4. Moorooka children either attended Rocklea State School, or Yeronga State School (established 1867 as Boggo State School).Queensland State Archives Agency ID5869, \\"Yeronga State School\\". A site for a new school at Moorooka, consisting of , was purchased from Charles Robert Parish by the Department of Public Instruction in December 1927.Certificate of Title 11230205, DNRM. The land was originally part of Portion 198, purchased by John Robertson in 1864.The site was transferred to the Crown in February 1943, with a Deed of Grant to the Secretary for Public Instruction in Queensland, the next month. The school was originally intended to be sited west of Beaudesert Road (then called the Southport Road), which would have put it in the Oxley electorate, rather than the Logan electorate in which it ended updespite 95% of the pupils coming from the Oxley electorate. ( 'New State School opening at Moorooka, Department's record', The Telegraph, 18 March 1929, p.7) The first building constructed for the school, during 1928, was a standard Public Works design. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components. Attention to improving light and ventilation to achieve an optimum classroom environment culminated in 1920 with the Sectional School (Type DT/1), a high-set timber structure.School types are detailed in the following study: Burmester, P., Pullar, M., and Kennedy, M., Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study: Conservation Management, Report for the Department of Education, November 1996, p.30. This fundamentally new design combined all the best features of previous types and implemented theories of an ideal education environment. It proved very successful and was used unaltered until 1950. This type was practical, economical, satisfied educational requirements and climatic needs and allowed for the orderly expansion of schools over time. Before the Sectional School, all school buildings were generally aligned with street and property boundaries, regardless of aspect. By late 1914, after acceptance of the principles and virtues of providing natural light into classrooms advocated by Eleanor Bourne, (appointed as the first Medical Inspector of Schools in 1911), buildings were being preferably orientated to receive maximum indirect southern light. The Sectional School type was designed to have an unobstructed wall of windows on its southern elevation and verandahs, typically to the north but sometimes to the end elevations, allowing for linkages to other and future buildings. Its blank end walls were also detailed to be removable, so that as the school grew, the building could be easily extended in sections, hence the name. This led to the construction of long narrow buildings of many classrooms - a distinctive feature of Queensland schools.Burmester, P., Pullar, M., and Kennedy, M., Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, November 1996, pp.41-44. The Sectional School building at Moorooka was aligned approximately east-west, being lowset at the east end, and highset at the west end (due to sloping ground), and consisted of five classrooms , with an northern verandah which wrapped around the east and west sides. A teachers room projected off the northern verandah, and the northeast and northwest verandah corners were enclosed.'Moorooka State School' photo in DPW Annual Report, 1929Plan 143-15-9_16113845, \\"Moorooka State School Additions\\", Department of Public Works, 1932. The 1928 plan indicated possible future expansion through the addition of buildings off each corner of the first building, linked by their verandahs;Plan 143-15-9-2_16113856, \\"Moorooka State School\\", Department of Public Works, 1928. an expansion approach that accommodated the sloping site. The building (known as Block B in 2015) had a Dutch-gabled roof and was set on concrete piers. About two thirds of the understorey play area, on the west side, was floored with concrete. Three of the classrooms were linked by folding partitions, which could be opened to create an assembly hall. The remaining partitions were fixed, with centred doorways. It was reported that there was room for 200 pupils, with ample light and ventilation provided by large windows on the southern side. The completed cost was £2,607.Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 June 1929, p.5. Moorooka State School opened in January 1929 with 139 children and 6 teachers. By the end of the year, enrolments had increased to 230.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.39. At the school's official opening on 16 March 1929, Thomas Wilson, the Minister for Public Instruction, noted that the school, built on the elevated part of the site, had a beautiful view to the west, and was positioned to allow for future expansion.'Moorooka, new state school, splendid structure', Sunday Mail, 17 March 1929, p.12'Moorooka: opening of the new school', The Brisbane Courier, 18 March 1929, p.20. Efforts were made to improve the school grounds and its facilities. The Ladies Committee worked to provide a piano, a sewing machine and a library, and to install electric lights at the school. In late 1929 a concert was held in the Ideal Picture Theatre in Yeronga to raise funds.'School concert', Brisbane Courier, 2 December 1929, p.23. The uneven parade ground between the school and Sherley Street was levelled by government relief workers, and boys at the school helped remove tree stumps from the grounds. In 1931 two tennis courts were opened, southwest of the school building, with money raised by the School Committee, the Ladies Committee, and teachers.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.43'Tennis Courts opened', Brisbane Courier, 7 October 1931, p.18. These tennis courts were located south of Block D. See site plan 1637-416-1_11048279, \\"Moorooka State School Block Plan\\", Department of Public Works, 1950. The continued increase in daily attendance (averaging 260 by 1933) also led to a new two-classroom wing for 100 children (known as Block A in 2015) officially opened on 27 May 1933 by Frank Cooper, the Minister for Public Instruction.'School wing opened', Sunday Mail, 28 May 1933, p.20. Connected to the northeast corner of the 1929 block, the addition was another Sectional School building, with the same proportions and features as the first.Plan 143-15-9_16113845, \\"Moorooka State School additions\\", Department of Public Works, 1932. The south wall had casement windows with fanlights, while the northern windows were double-hung sashes.Project Services, \\"Moorooka State School\\", p.7. There was a teachers room off the north verandah, and semi-enclosed hat rooms at the northwest and southeast verandah corners. Inside, the building had coved ceilings, with exposed metal tie rods. WWII affected the functioning of Moorooka State School. In 1942, a Staging Camp (Camp Moorooka) was constructed for the US Army between Mayfield Road and Bracken Street, extending south to the east of Medina Street, and west to the southeast corner of Moorooka State School.National Archives of Australia, control symbol FOLDER M TO N FOLIO 69, \\"Moorooka Camp Site\\", 1944. Due to the fear of a Japanese invasion of Australia, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools in late January 1942,'All coastal schools shut until change seen in war', Courier Mail, 28 January 1942, p.3. but while most state schools resumed on 2 March 1942, some, such as Moorooka, remained closed for \\"special reasons\\".'Teaching pupils of shut schools', Sunday Mail, 1 March 1942, p.3. The US Army took over Moorooka State School from 24 February 1942,'Moorooka State School commandeered by the military during WW2', http://www.ozatwar.com/locations/moorookastateschool.htm (accessed 6 May 2015) and as a result, most of Moorooka's pupils went to Junction Park State School. However, Moorooka's students were allowed back to their own school on 13 July 1942.'Concern on school facilities', The Telegraph, Monday 20 July 1942, p.2. Moorooka State School Band welcoming home soldiers from World War II, circa 1945 Substantial housing development also occurred south of the school towards the end of WWII. In 1944-45 the Moorooka War Workers Housing Estate was built between Scherger Street and Evans Road, for married workers at the Rocklea Munitions Works. This complemented the hostels built for single workers, located to the west of Beaudesert Road, south of Hamilton Road,'Moorooka War Workers Housing Estate' http://www.ww2places.qld.gov.au/places/?id=959 (accessed 28 May 2015). and the hostels' area was later used for housing ex- servicemen.Project Services, \\"Moorooka State School\\", p.4. After the war, the business centre of Moorooka shifted to Moorvale, at the junction of Beaudesert and Mayfield Roads.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.36. Moorooka State School continued to expand after WWII, as a result of housing development and an increased local population. In 1947 the combined population of Moorooka, Rocklea and Salisbury was 8,364, and this rose to 12,163 in 1954, and 17,246 by 1971. In late 1946 a new wing for infants (known as Block C in 2015) was added to the northwest corner of the original building.The new block is not extant on a 12 June 1946 aerial photograph of the school. (QAP82-35283, DNRM). Another Sectional School design, this was highset (although lower than the 1929 building) with the understorey floor concreted. Plans also show a concrete retaining wall between the 1946 building and Sherley Street.Plan 1637-282_16113900, Department of Public Works,1946. The roof was Dutch-gabled, and the northern verandah wrapped around the east and west sides. The southern side was lit by casement windows and the northern by double-hung sash windows. The two classrooms were larger than in the previous blocks, being and divided by a folding partition. Ceilings were coved, with exposed metal tie-rods and latticed vents. Hat rooms were located at the south end of the west verandah, and the northeast corner of the verandah of the new building; while the connection to the 1929 building, by steps rising up between the verandahs, required the relocation of an existing hatroom to the south end of the latter's western verandah. It is claimed that the windows on the verandah side of Block C improved ventilation, and that these rooms were popular.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.47. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nation-wide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp.28-31. At Moorooka State School, a former Camp Moorooka store building to the south of the school was converted into four classrooms in 1946.'Rest of news in brief: Moorooka School', The Courier Mail, 31 May 1946, p.5Plan 1637-289_16113889, \\"Moorooka State School, conversion of army hut to temporary classrooms\\", Department of Public Works, 1946Site plan 1637-416-1_11048279, \\"Moorooka State School Block Plan\\", Department of Public Works, 1950and NAA control symbol FOLDER M TO N FOLIO 69, \\"Moorooka Camp Site\\", 1944. Between 1946 and 1950 a new teachers room was attached to the east verandah of the 1929 block, as well as a single-storey extension to the west of the existing northern teachers room. Concrete stairs to the northwest of Block A, similar to those adjacent to Block C, were also added around that time. Two temporary classrooms blocks (totalling five classrooms), were built between 1948 and 1951, on of land added to the south side of Moorooka State School in 1943.Plan 1637-238_16113867, \\"Moorooka SS new temporary classroom\\", Department of Public Works, 1948aerial photograph BCC5-39426, 1951. Survey Plan SL1673 indicates that a \\"State School Extension Reserve\\" was gazetted in 1943. Such temporary buildings were constructed in Queensland schools between 1943 and 1951, and were introduced as an expedient, temporary solution to the baby boom and post- war shortages of labour and materials. The remainder of the school grounds, to the south, were added by 1950.The current grounds were listed as school reserves by 1950 (site plan 1637-416-1_11048279, \\"Moorooka State School Block Plan\\", Department of Public Works, 1950). Lot 594 was surveyed in November 1948, and from 1981 this allotment included the 1943 school extension. (Survey plans SL1952, (1948)SL9570, (1981). While the majority of school buildings were built to standard plans, as in other periods, some buildings were also constructed to a purposed design. These were typically constructed in areas of stable, suburban and urban populations and can be seen as an evolution of the urban brick school buildings of the early 1900s and depression-era brick school buildings. They were generally substantial structures of brick and concrete that introduced many innovative ideas that later found their way into standard plans. For example, brick was progressively used more frequently in high schools as standard.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study, p.77.Block D under construction, March 1955In 1953, new brick primary school buildings were planned for Moorooka, Townsville and Walkervale (Bundaberg), as part of a school-building program at that time that was reportedly a record for the state.'Record School Building', Queensland Times, 28 December 1953, p.2. Moorooka State School's new brick and concrete three-storey classroom block (known as Block D in 2015) was approved in 1953, at a cost of £43,635,'New school', Courier Mail, 20 February 1953, p.5. and the building was opened in 1956.Building was still underway in 1955 (Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 June 1955'). The building was designed by Frederick George Kirkegard,F.G. Kirkegard was later a founding partner of Kirkegard & Ellwood, a Brisbane based architecture firm. a student architect with the Department of Public Works, in a modernist, austere style popular at the time. Modernist architecture developed in pre-World War I Europe and gained popularity in Australia after WWII. It is notable for a rationalisation of planning, emphasising clarity and simplicity of form and detailing.Richard Apperley, Robert Irving and Peter Reynolds, A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.281. Distinguished by their extensive use of steel, reinforced concrete and glass, Australian buildings in the modern or International style were heavily influenced by American and European examples. Characteristics included rectangular massing, plain smooth walls with areas of contrasting textures, and selective expression of structural systems, such as concrete framework. In Queensland, architects sought to create climatically responsive modernist buildings by combining careful building orientation, sun-shading devices and natural ventilation methods. This design approach was consistent with the requirements espoused by United Kingdom and New South Wales educationalists at the time, who advocated for schools that were climatically responsive with diffused natural light, and constructed of modern materials that were durable, washable and attractive.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study. p.72. Education in the 1950s was embracing the modern, and media reports at the time espoused the virtues of bright and attractive school buildings for encouraging student attendance, stating that \\"Brisbane's modern new State schools should make for happier, healthier learning\\".'Bright Schools May Be Magnet to Many Pupils', The Courier Mail, 31 December 1952, p.3. Block D: north elevation with verandahs and concrete fins, 2015 The new building at Moorooka was anticipated to \\"provide classrooms and other facilities of the most modern character\\".Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 June 1955, p.10. Kirkegard's design comprised an elongated form of rectangular massing, with contrasting areas of facebrick (enclosing the east and west ends) and painted concrete (verandah and shade elements). There were open verandahs on the northern side, with large concrete fins that contributed to sun control, and a concrete balustrade. The building had timber-framed hopper windows on the southern elevation with a long flat concrete hood, and double-hung sash windows with fanlights on the northern elevation. Constructed to the southwest of Block C, the new building contained an open play area for most of the ground floor, with a health services room, glazed entry lobby and stairwell at the east end, and a stairwell and boys lavatory at the west end. The first floor included four classrooms, a store and cloakroom at the west end, and a head teachers room, with associated lobby and bathroom, at the east end; while the second floor had four classrooms, with a store and cloak room at the west end and a utility room at the east end.Plan 1637A-8-4_16113988 \\"Moorooka new brick school, foundation plan, ground floor\\", Department of Public Works, 1953Plan 1637A-8-5_16113977, \\"Moorooka, new brick school, first floor plan, second floor plan\\", Department of Public Works 1953. A curved Brisbane tuff (commonly but incorrectly known as porphyry) retaining wall with incorporated planter boxes, was also built to the north and east of Block D at this timePlan 1637A-8-2_16113614 \\"Plan showing setting out of building ground improvements and drainage\\", Department of Public Works, 1953. (with concrete block extension in the late 1960s). The school continued to expand from the 1950s onwards, with new buildings and some changes to existing buildings. New tennis courts were built by 1955, further south on the east side of the school, after Block D was built north of the original tennis courts. In 1958 Blocks J and K were built for an Infant's School (opened 1959). In 1959 Block C's western verandah was enclosed as a store and hat room, new stairs were built at each end of Block B (on the verandahs, leading down to the understorey), and a boys' toilet was added inside the Head Teacher's room in Block D.Project Services, \\"Moorooka State School\\", p.9. The 1960s was a period of growth at the school. Enrolments rose from 700 to 1000 between 1967 and 1970, although later fell back to 700 by 1976.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, pp. 50-1. Further buildings were added to the school during the 1960s and 1970s, along with a swimming pool in 1963. An east-west retaining wall was built south of Block A in the late 1960s, and the retaining wall to the northwest of Block A was extended to Sherley Street at the same time.Plan W1569-66_11676291, \\"Moorooka State School: groundworks and erosion control\\", Department of Public Works, 1968. Staff toilets were added to the west end of the ground floor of Block D , and a library (Block L) was built south of the east end of Block D in 1977. Meanwhile, the converted army hut was removed from the grounds , and the temporary classrooms blocks between 1972 and 1974.Building dates derived from: Project Services, 'Moorooka State School'aerial photographs (various dates) and various plans of site, Department of Public Works. The population of Moorooka in 1976 was 9,639, but the late 1970s saw a decline in student numbers, due to an aging population. In 1983, the Junior and Primary Schools were combined.Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.80. In December 2006, Blocks J and K were destroyed by an arson attack,'School fires spark hunt', Sunday Mail, 9 December 2006. http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/school-fires- spark-hunt/story-e6freoof-1111112662038 (accessed 6 May 2015.) but were replaced with a multi-purpose hall that opened in 2009.'Project: Moorooka State School'.http://www.cordellconnect.com.au/public/project/ProjectDetails.aspx?uid=829966 (accessed 6 May 2015)'Moorooka State School: History', https://moorookass.eq.edu.au/Ourschool/History/Pages/History.aspx, (Accessed 25 May 2015). Moorooka's population was 8,609 in 2001, rising to 9,984 in 2011. The arrival in the suburb of immigrant families from culturally diverse backgrounds is reflected in the current student body at Moorooka State School. The school grounds now cover , and include mature plantings, some of which were planted by students on Arbor Days. The provision of outdoor play space was a result of the early and continuing commitment by the Department of Public Instruction to play-based education, particularly in primary school. Trees and gardens were planted as part of beautification of schools. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Alexander Boyd was critical of tropical schools and among his recommendations stressed the importance of adding shade trees to playgrounds.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study, p.4. In addition, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Landscape elements were often constructed to standard designs and were intrinsic to Queensland Government education philosophies. Educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline and developed aesthetic tastes. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 49. Mature trees currently along the northwest boundary were evident in aerial photographs from 1946.Aerial photograph 1946, QAP82-35282, sourced from DNRM. Memorials commemorating Anzac Day (2008) and the opening of the Outdoor Learning Centre (2004) have been placed adjacent to one of two pencil pines (Cupressus sempervirens) to the northeast of Block C. In 2015, the school continues to operate from its original site. It retains standard timber and purpose-built brick buildings dating from 1929 to the 1950s, set in landscaped grounds. The school is important as a focus for the surrounding community and generations of students from the area have been taught there. Since establishment the school has been a key social focus for the local community. The grounds and buildings have been the location of many social and community events over time, including as a meeting place of the Moorooka Branch of the Australian Red Cross during WWII,'Women's War Work', Courier Mail, 21 June 1940, p.12'Moorooka Red Cross', Courier Mail, 18 June 1941, p.9. and for fetes to raise funds for the school.Fetes were replaced with direct giving for fund- raising by 1976 (Clarke and Thomason, Moorooka State School Jubilee 1929-1989, p.52.  Description  Site plan of the school, 2015 Moorooka State School occupies a site (Lots 595 SP118822 and 594 SP118821) bounded by Sherley Street to the north, Beaudesert Road to the west, Alexander Park to the south, and residential properties that front Blomfield Street to the east. However, the registered boundary encompasses the northern of the school (Lot 595 SP118822 only), consistent with the 1927 school reserve. The main entrance to the school is along Sherley Street, where the timber school buildings (Blocks A, B and C) and mature trees along the boundary contribute to the suburban streetscape. The site slopes downwards from northeast to southwest. The school complex comprises a variety of educational buildings and landscape features of varying eras of design and construction. Of these, significant components are concentrated to the north and include: * Block B - Sectional School Building (1929) * Block A - Sectional School Building (1933); * Block C - Sectional School Building (1946) * Block D - Brick and Concrete Building (1956) * Landscape features - Mature trees and retaining walls Elements within the registered boundary that are not considered to be of cultural significance include: Blocks E, F, and I; the Library; various modern ancillary structures; modern landscape features such as pathways and paved areas; and the swimming pool. Where the register boundary extends into road reserve, the road and footpath fabric is not considered to be of cultural significance. = Sectional School buildings - Blocks A, B and C = The three Sectional School buildings are timber-framed and weatherboard-clad structures on concrete piers, with corrugated metal-clad Dutch-gable roofs and verandahs along the north, east and west sides. The buildings are symmetrically arranged in a U-shaped plan, with Block A and Block C connected to either end of the northern verandah of Block B. The buildings range from lowset to highset, reflecting the slope of the site. From east to west: Block A is lowset; Block B is highset; and Block C is highset, though set lower than Block B and connected via verandah stairs. The buildings retain extensive early timber joinery. Southern windows comprise large banks of casements with horizontal centre-pivot fanlights. Windows to the northern verandah walls vary, with banks of high-level horizontal centre-pivot windows to Block B, and double- hung sash windows with horizontal centre-pivot fanlights to Blocks A and C. Windows and doors retain early fittings and hardware. The interior walls and ceilings are lined with timber v-jointed (VJ) tongue-and-groove (T&G;) boards. The ceilings are coved, with exposed metal tie rods and square lattice ceiling vents. Skirtings and architraves are timber of a simple profile. Verandah walls are single-skin, lined with VJ, T&G; boards with exposed external framing. Verandah floors are timber, and ceilings are raked and lined with VJ, T&G; boards. Joinery to the verandahs includes square timber posts and two- rail timber balustrades with battened balusters. Classrooms are accessed from the northern verandahs via flush-panelled doors with fanlights. Hat / bag hooks are attached to the verandah walls of Blocks B and C. Teachers rooms are attached to the north and east sides of Block B, and to the north of Block A; they are gable-roofed and weatherboard-clad, and feature skillion window hoods with timber brackets. The north-facing teachers rooms have battened gable infills. The interior walls and flat ceilings are lined with VJ, T&G; boards. Elements of the Sectional School buildings not considered to be of cultural significance include additions and alterations such as: modern extensions; carpet and linoleum floor linings; sheeted and glazed partitions; ceiling fans and air conditioning units; understorey enclosures; modern joinery, fixtures and fittings; and aluminium framed windows.Block B with projecting teachers' room, 2015 = Block B (1929) - Centre = Classroom interior of Block B, 2015 Block B contains an open plan classroom space (formerly five classrooms). The lintels and bulkheads of the four original classroom partitions remain, with a modern concertina door inserted into one opening. An early hat room enclosure (1946) is retained on the southwestern corner of the verandah, along with a connecting stair to the northwest. The northern verandah is accessed via two sets of external stairs. Additional stairs () have been inserted into the east and west verandahs, providing covered access to the understorey. The east verandah stairs are enclosed with a combination of modern fixed glazing and louvres. The eastern teachers room ( - 1950) is lowset on timber stumps; and connected to the 1929 building via a small verandah extension. The door is panelled and the windows to the north, east and south are narrow, double-row casements. The northern teachers room is highset on concrete piers. floor. The window on the eastern wall is an original casement, while the fixed northern window and verandah door are modern. There is a lowset weatherboard-clad extension to the west (added -50). The understorey of Block B combines open areas for play, and enclosed areas for storage and a workshop (former modern tuckshop). The southern side has been partly enclosed with facebrick, which also formed the tuckshop counter area. Other areas are enclosed by either concrete, corrugated metal or timber battens. The understorey of the northern teachers room is enclosed with weatherboard cladding.Block A, 2015 = Block A (1933) - East = Block A contains two classrooms, separated by an original partition with part-glazed double-doors. Part-height modern partitions form a small office space within the western classroom. The east and west facing Dutch-gable ends feature battened infills. The lowset understorey is also enclosed by timber battens. The verandahs are partially enclosed with modern sheeted and glazed partitions on the northern side between the teachers room and classrooms, and in the southeast corner for a store room (former hat room). The original semi-enclosed hat room is retained in the northwest corner. Two sets of timber stairs access the northern verandah either side of the lowset teachers room. The teachers room retains a casement window to the north, while the eastern window has been replaced. Block C, 2015 = Block C (1946) - West = Block C is primarily highset, with a lowset eastern verandah that is supported by a concrete retaining wall (1946). The building contains an open plan classroom space (formerly two classrooms - larger than those in Block A). The former layout is discernable from partition bulkheads that remain. The original semi-enclosed hat rooms are retained in the northwest and northeast corners of the verandah. The western verandah (now enclosed) is clad externally with weatherboard and lined internally with flat sheeting, and has with timber-framed hopper windows. Timber stairs provide external access to the north and east verandahs. The understorey is enclosed with corrugated metal, timber battens and concrete panels, and used as a storage area. Block D as seen from Sherley Street entrance, 2015 = Brick and Concrete Building - Block D (1956) = Block D; east stairwell from first floor landing, with glazed verandah bays, 2015 Block D is a three-storey, brick and reinforced- concrete building with a low-profile hipped roof. The building has rectangular massing and the elongated form comprises three distinct sections: full height facebrick enclosing concrete stairwells and amenities at the east and west ends; and first and second floor classrooms with north-facing verandahs to the centre. The north elevation features vertical and horizontal concrete fins forming ten bays to each of the upper floors. The verandahs are painted concrete and the end bays are enclosed with fixed, metal-framed glazing. The south elevation features a continuous, flat reinforced-concrete hood over the lower windows. The building retains much of its original timber-framed joinery. Windows to the east-end section are hoppers with rendered projecting jambs, and the west-end section has mostly casement windows. Classrooms have banks of south-facing hopper windows with fixed timber shelves to sill height. Windows to the verandah walls are double-hung sashes with horizontal centre- pivot fanlights. Some verandah windows on the second floor have been replaced with aluminium-framed sliders. Classroom doors are low-waisted timber with glazed inserts. Classrooms at the western end have sliding doors. There are three (formerly four) classrooms on both the first and second floors. The fixed classroom partitions have timber doors at the southern end. Original folding partitions have been removed; however, the fixed partition bulkheads and doorways remain. Walls and ceilings are lined with flat sheeting. The west end section has lavatories to ground floor, and open meeting spaces (former cloak rooms) and toilets to the first and second floors. The east end section has a glazed entrance lobby to ground floor, and a combination of offices, storage and toilets to the first and second floors. The stairs in both end sections have metal balustrades with timber handrails. A ramp at the eastern end of the first floor connects with the understorey of Block B to the east. Much of the ground floor (formerly open play space supported by concrete piers) has been enclosed with fibrous-cement sheeting to form modern office spaces. Open areas have been retained adjacent to the east and west stairwells. These thoroughfares have fixed timber bench seats. = Landscape Elements / Grounds = The established school grounds comprise mature trees and garden beds, as well as various built landscape features. The sloping site is terraced with embankments and retaining structures. The school is set slightly below Sherley Street, with earth embankments along part of the northern boundary. There is a flat parade ground to the north of Block B, surrounded by garden beds. A concrete retaining wall (1946) with stairs aligns to the north of Block C, and a similar set of concrete stairs (pre-1950) are located north of Block A. A curved retaining wall (), finished with Brisbane Tuff, extends from northwest of Block C around to southeast of Block D. The wall is stepped and incorporates planter boxes. Mature trees including figs (Ficus spp.) and camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) are concentrated along the northwest boundary of the school and contribute to the streetscape. Further mature plantings of various Eucalypt species (Eucalyptus spp.) are concentrated near the eastern boundary of the school. Two mature pencil pines (Cupressus Sempervirens) are located adjacent to the entrance on Sherley Street. Memorial plaques have been placed adjacent to one of the pencil pines. One memorial is an ANZAC Day commemoration from 2008, the other is in commemoration of the opening of the Outdoor Learning Centre in 2004.  Heritage listing  Moorooka State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 August 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Moorooka State School (established in 1929) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of a standard government design that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies, and a non-standard design that reflects the specific needs of the school. Three connected Sectional School buildings (1929, 1933 and 1946) demonstrate the culmination of many years of experimental timber school design by the Department of Public Works (DPW), providing equally for educational and climatic needs. A three-storey brick and concrete building (1956) demonstrates the post-war construction of larger and more permanent school buildings in areas of established populations. The building reflects mid-20th century architectural and educationalist movements through its modernist, climatically responsive design and materials. The grounds retain mature trees and landscaping features, representative of suburban school sites, and demonstrate the importance of play and aesthetics in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Moorooka State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school with later modifications. The school is a good, intact example of a suburban school complex, comprising: timber-framed teaching buildings constructed to standard designs by the Queensland Government; a non- standard brick and concrete building; and a landscaped site with mature shade trees, retaining walls and assembly / play areas. The three connected Sectional School buildings (1929, 1933 and 1946) are fine, intact examples of their type, comprising: timber framed structure; Dutch-gabled roofs; highset form with play space beneath (1929 and 1946 buildings); blank end walls; northern verandahs, with linkages between buildings; large banks of south- facing windows; projecting teachers rooms (1929 and 1933 buildings); hat room enclosures; single-skin verandah walls; coved ceilings with metal tie- rods and latticed vents; and early joinery and internal linings. The brick and concrete building (1956) is an excellent, intact example of an individually- designed state school building, typically constructed in areas with large urban populations to meet the specific needs of the school. Designed in a mid-20th century modernist style, the building combines rectangular massing, walls with areas of contrasting textures and climatically responsive design elements such as concrete fin sun-shades. The efficiently planned and well composed building comprises an elongated form, with facebrick and metal-framed glazing enclosing stairwells at the east and west ends, north-facing concrete verandahs along the first and second floors, and a glazed entrance and lobby to the east. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Moorooka State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It was established in 1929 through the efforts of the local community and generations of children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of its suburban district and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Planning The all woman nature of the expedition was designed by Arlene and Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz during a 1972 expedition on Noshaq. Arlene, who having previously been rejected from high altitude expeditions as a woman stated “Few American women ever get a chance to climb that high, to lead, or even to participate in a major expedition. No American woman [had] ever climbed to 8000 meters, and only seven women from any country [had] ever climbed that high. We [hoped] this climb [would] give a number of women sufficient experience so that they can be invited on mixed expeditions, or organize their own.\\" Led by Blum, they underwent psychological tests and individual training programs. The counter culture of the 70s led teams to rebel against the military inspired siege style mountaineering. As the first female team, many of the women were especially determined to forge their own leadership methods and styles independent of the male lead expeditions before them. =Funding= The team spent a year raising the money needed for the climb, mostly by selling T-shirts with the slogan, A Woman’s Place is on Top. They also received sponsorship from the American Alpine Club and support from the National Geographic Society, Johnson & Johnson and OB Tampons. Expedition At the time, Annapurna had been climbed by eight people, via three different routes. Annapurna has since emerged as one of the most dangerous mountains in the Himalayas with a 32% fatality to summit ratio. It is extremely avalanche prone, which was not fully appreciated at the time. They approached the mountain siege style, leaving Pokhara with more than of supplies, a team of porters, 13 women and 6 Sherpas. Blum had wanted to employ female low-altitude porters and train them to be climbers, but ran into difficulties with the Sherpas' union and the women hired were not strong load carriers. They arrived at base camp on August 26, and pushed up a rib towards the north to camp 2. From there the route choice was between most recent ascent of the mountain The Dutch Rib which was direct and technical and a new variation of the Spanish Route which appeared easier. They settled on the Dutch Rib after watching several avalanches on the Spanish Route. They waited until the mountain was opened at a prayer-flag raising ceremony, and began upwards towards camp 3 on September 12. On September 19 Komarkova and Chewang were forced to retreat to base camp due to multiple avalanches. On the 27th Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz, Liz Klobusicky-Mailänder, Chewang, and Lakpa established camp 3, and another near avalanche miss cleared the rib making it more passable. The same day an avalanche made it 3 km down to camp one, with the wind from it flattening tents. They had reached camp four by October 8, and planned to set up a final camp before the summit. =Summit attempts= Initially Blum wanted the first summit team to consist of three women, no Sherpas, with Sherpas ascending on the second team. However, Komarkova pushed to have Sherpas Mingma and Chewang join them. Ultimately the first summit team consisted of Komarkova, Irene Beardsley, Mingma Tsering Sherpa and Chewang Ringjin Sherpa after Piro Kramer, an eye surgeon, retreated after getting a frostbitten right index finger. The team reached the top on October 15. Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz and Vera Watson were keen to make a second summit attempt with a large team; however, many expedition members were sick, had frostbite, or were exhausted from recent summit attempts. They could not convince Whitehouse to join them, as she thought that their decision-making skills were compromised. They decided to continue anyway, with Wangyel accompanying them to camp 5, and climb the then unclimbed 8,051-meter central peak. However, Wangyel descended after falling sick, leaving them without a siege-style support structure. They failed to make a scheduled radio call, and their bodies were found by Lhakpa Norbu and Mingma below camp four, three days later. Historical significance Initial reports from the New York Times called the climb an inspiration to women, noting that women's mountaineering in America had 'come of age', and it was symbolic and relevant to second wave feminism. Blum's book on the expedition, Annapurna: A Woman's Place, was cited by Kitty Calhoun as an inspiration to later mountaineers. At the time, the expedition received some criticism by men, including David Roberts, for having Sherpas forge a path to the summit on an all women's expedition and for perceived poor decision making leading to the deaths of Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz and Watson. This was denounced by Blum as hypocritical, since there were no objections to Sherpa forged paths on recent all-male expeditions and that (at the time) there had been one death for every summit on Annapurna. Historian Julie Rak noted that had Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz succeeded at the first ascent of the central peak the narrative might have been different.

The band is composed of Sydney Koke (bass, vocals), Courtney Loove (guitar, vocals), and Jen Twynn Payne (drums, lead vocals). History Sydney Koke and Jen Twynn Payne met in their hometown of Calgary, Alberta in 2007. After becoming housemates, Twynn Payne began learning to play drums with then-boyfriend Patrick Flegel. Koke was impressed with her abilities and suggested they start a band, which became Puberty, a post-punk group with guitarist Nicole Brunel. Puberty disbanded when Koke enrolled in a neuroscience PhD program at Duke University. Twynn Payne moved to Vancouver shortly after to play drums in Makeout Videotape. Twynn Payne and Loove met and formed a synth-pop duo called Girls in Love, which quickly disbanded. Koke dropped out of Duke and moved to Vancouver to start a new band with Twynn Payne, who suggested they enlist Loove as the guitarist. The three jammed together for a summer before Loove moved to Montreal for a new job. After she returned eight months later, they became more serious, playing their first official show in 2011 as The Courtneys at Pat’s Pub for a friend's birthday party. The band's name is both an homage to Loove (\\"the most modest member of the band\\") as well as a clique of \\"cool girls\\" at Koke's elementary school. Their eponymous first album, The Courtneys, was intended to be a four-song EP. They ran ahead of schedule and recorded more material, and completed recording, mixing, and mastering within three days. It was released by Hockey Dad Records, and was quickly sold out of its initial pressing. Their second album, The Courtneys II, developed over the next three years as the band refined their songcraft, revising and refining songs as they explored \\"what makes an ideal structure of a song.\\" Their experimentation also affected the sound of the record; they auditioned six different mix engineers for the record, and instructed their mastering engineer to make it sound \\"like Teenage Fanclub on Bandwagonesque.\\" The album garnered acclaim for its sound; Rolling Stone editor Rob Sheffield named it one of his top albums of 2017. Style=Musical style= The Courtneys describe their style as \\"slacker pop\\" and \\"artisanal grunge;\\" critics have categorized them as jangle-pop, garage pop, and surf rock. They are most commonly associated with the Dunedin sound, particularly Flying Nun artists such as The Clean; they became the first non- New Zealand band to sign with the label after thirty-five years. They cite Eddy Current Suppression Ring, Pavement, Dinosaur Jr., and Fugazi as inspirations, with Teenage Fanclub, Big Star, and Phoenix cited as particular influences on II. Shoegaze has also been cited as an influence, largely due to Courtney Loove's unique open tuning. Lyrically, the band has been noted for their pop culture references. These include actors (\\"K.C. Reeves\\", about Keanu Reeves), movies and television shows (including \\"Lost Boys\\" and \\"90210\\"), and other musicians (the \\"mandatory suicide\\" refrain from \\"Manion\\" is a reference to the Slayer song of the same name; \\"Nu Sundae\\" is an oblique reference to Calgary band Nü Sensae). The Courtneys II marked a change from the referential to the more personal; it's claimed to be \\"75% about crushes.\\" =Visual style= Much like their songs, their videos are often referential. Their video for \\"90210\\" is an homage to Eddy Current Suppression Ring's \\"Which Way to Go,\\" while \\"Silver Velvet\\" is a remake of Bailter Space's \\"Splat.\\" The band also takes a distinctive approach to marketing and merchandise. Their logo was developed for their rec baseball team (also called \\"The Courtneys\\"), whose baseball cap is visible on the cover of their first album. They have released other unique merchandise, including an air freshener.

It is located next to the city gate of the same name, and also features an adjoining madrasa.  History  The entrance (left) and gallery fountains (right) of the Bab Guissa Mosque, circa 1920. Based on an inscription on one of its marble columns, the mosque is thought to originate from the 14th century, during the reign of the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hasan (1331-1351), though there is not much available information. In the late 18th century, the Alaouite sultan Mohammed ibn Abdallah (1757-1790 CE) built an adjoining madrasa while also restoring and expanding the mosque itself. The mosque was reportedly heavily restored and modified at the end of the 19th century as well. The mosque is named after the nearby Bab Guissa, a city gate which was in turn named after the 11th-century Zenata prince al-Guissa ibn Dounas who built the original gate by this name.  Description = Mosque = The mosque occupies a space of about 1440 square metersOfficial signage posted outside the mosque. and is located just inside the northern city gate called Bab Guissa. This is a relatively elevated position compared to the rest of Fes el-Bali, and as a result the mosque's minaret is prominent on the northern skyline of the medina (historic city). The minaret is plain and mostly undecorated. On the mosque's eastern side, next to the base of the minaret, is the mosque's main entrance. The gateway is decorated with typical Moroccan motifs including interlacing semi-circles around the doorway's arch and a larger square frame with a band of darj-w-ktaf or sebka (a pattern with shapes similar to palmettes or fleur-de-lys). Above the door is a carved and painted wooden canopy, also characteristic of traditional Moroccan architecture. Next to this entrance, and adjoining the city wall, is a small outdoor gallery with wall fountains for ablutions (ritual washing before prayer), decorated with mosaic tiles (zellij) in geometric patterns as well as tiles painted with arabesques and Arabic calligraphy. The interior of the mosque is dominated by a relatively large courtyard or sahn, surrounded by galleries on three sides and by the main prayer hall on its southeastern side, all marked by large, slightly pointed horseshoe arches which are typical of medieval Moroccan mosques. The courtyard has a typical central fountain, but is also shaded by several fig trees, a much less typical feature. The main prayer hall is short and only two rows deep. The wall around the mihrab (i.e. a niche on the qibla wall indicating the direction of prayer) is richly decorated with carved stucco and, in its top portion, a row of stained glass windows with grilles of geometric patterns. = Funerary mosque annex = Behind the prayer hall (to the south or southeast) and attached but secluded from the rest of the mosque is an interior prayer space (of similar size to the main prayer hall) used only for funerary rites and for prayers over the bodies of the deceased before burial. This type of annex to a mosque, called a Jama al-Gna'iz (\\"Funeral Mosque\\" or Mosque of the Dead) is not common to all mosques in the Islamic world, but similar annexes are attached to the Qarawiyyin Mosque and the Chrabliyine Mosque in Fes. It is designed to be separate from the main mosque so as to maintain the purity of the latter as a regular prayer space (which by religious principle must not be soiled by unclean things, which would include dead bodies). This part of the mosque is accessed by another monumental portal on the south side of the complex, decorated with a radiating or semi-circular geometric pattern reminiscent of Almohad and Marinid gates. Since the Bab Guissa cemetery is located just outside the nearby city gate, it is likely that the mosque was well-situated to offer this type of service. = Madrasa = Adjacent to the mosque is the 18th-century madrasa (for religious studies) built by sultan Mohammed ibn Abdallah (ruled 1757-1790). It is accessed through a door in the mosque's northern wall, but the building is located on the mosque's western or southwestern side. It is roughly the same length of the mosque but only half as wide. It consists of a two-story gallery around a long courtyard of 22 meters by 4.8 meters with a central fountain. Aside from the floor of the courtyard, which is paved with simple zellij mosaic tiles, this madrasa is essentially undecorated (in contrast with more famous madrasas in the city like the much older (14th century) Bou Inania Madrasa or the slightly more contemporary (17th century) Cherratine Madrasa). Today, the courtyard is also covered with modern light roof to keep out the rain. The galleries give access to the sleeping cells of the students. Seminars were conducted in the madrasa, and the mosque itself also hosted two teaching chairs (i.e. professors). At the beginning of the 20th century the madrasa housed 40-60 students, mostly from the nearby mountain regions of Morocco. It is still in use today.

Plot U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border patrol agents apprehend two \\"other than Mexican\\" migrants affiliated with Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Daesh; the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suspects that the terrorists are negotiating a deal with the Sonora Cartel – headed by José Rivera (Mircea Drambareanu) – to smuggle terrorists from Mexico into the United States. Former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and CIA Agent John Harmon (Steven Seagal), who had raided a Sonora compound and killed its previous leader, El Mini Oso, is enlisted by CIA intermediary Matt Beck (Andrei Stanciu) to end the extremists' plot. Harmon recruits old flame and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Zara Hayek (Jemma Dallender) and United States Army Special Forces/CIA-trained spy- drone pilot Matthew Sharp (Russell Wong) after learning that the meeting between the terrorist coalition and the Sonora Cartel will be in Istanbul, Turkey. In Istanbul, Harmon's team spy on Hezbollah leader Ayan Al-Mujahid (Sergiu Costache) and Rivera but the meeting is cut short and adjourned after al-Mujahid notices Sharp's drone. Following a brief car chase and shootout between Harmon and al-Mujahid's men, Harmon learns from Beck that the real target is Abdul Rauf (Ghassan Bouz), the bomb-maker responsible for the downing of a Crimea Airlines plane in Syria. Rivera's men raid Harmon's safehouse and abduct Hayek; Harmon and Sharp locate and kill Al-Mujahid and his men at the Palace Hotel. Rivera and Rauf escape to the former's compound in Rumelifeneri but are tracked down by Harmon, who shoots them in the neck and head respectively, before embracing Hayek.

She made the first ascent of Gasherbrum III, the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz died along with her climbing partner, Vera Watson, during an attempt on Annapurna I Central. Early life Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz was born in Birmingham and grew up in Cornwall. She studied at Slade School of Fine Arts in London where she learned to climb. Climbing career Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz's early climbs were in Wales, England and the Alps, making ascents of the North Pillar of Palü, the Triolet and Les Courtes. After moving to Poland with her husband and climbing partner Janusz Onyszkiewicz, she climbed extensively in the Tatras, including the eastern wall of Mnich, the northern wall of , and a winter ascent northern wall of Niżni Rysy and Mieguszowiecki Middle (first winter ascent). She was known for her cool head and early commitment to alpine style mountaineering, which involves moving quickly and independently towards summits, at a time when large siege style expeditions were more common. In 1972, during the Polish expedition in Hindu Kush, she ascended both Aspe Safed and Noshaq. Based on these climbs, she was selected for the 1975 Polish Gasherbrum Expedition. It was initially designed as a women's only expedition to Gasherbrum III led by Wanda Rutkiewicz, however a simultaneous men's expedition to Gasherbrum II was refused a permit and the two merged. She made the first ascent of Gasherbrum III (7952m), the world's highest unclimbed peak, with a mixed team consisting of her, Rutkiewicz, Onyszkiewicz, and . During this expedition she gained the British height record for women. Following the height record, she was elected to membership of the Alpine Club, one of the first women to be so. Despite these successes, the achievements of women's climbing continued to be downplayed, with critics noting the presence and contributions of men on female driven expeditions. =Annapurna= In 1978, she took part in the American Women's Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna, the tenth highest mountain in the world. It consisted of all female foreign climbers, designed to give women the opportunity to climb a major peak at a time when they were often excluded from expeditions. Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz was one of the few non Americans, and was considered one of their best climbers. Annapurna had very few ascents at the time, and they found it to be more treacherous than anticipated, with multiple avalanches causing severe delays in their progress. It is now considered the world's most deadly mountain, with the highest death rate of any 8000er. During the expedition Chadwick- Onyszkiewicz noted \\"It's the most dangerous mountain I've been on\\" in a letter to her husband. The expedition was successful, with Vera Komarkova, Irene Beardsley (formerly Miller), Mingma Tsering Sherpa and Chewang Ringjin Sherpa reaching the summit. However, Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz was keen for a female only team to succeed, so she and climbing partner Vera Watson made a second summit push to the unclimbed second peak. Since many of the climbers had already descended due to frostbite and sickness or were too exhausted, they departed camp III for the summit alone and with very little support in the upper camps. They missed a scheduled radio call that night, but others in the expedition were tired and unable to mount a rescue. Three days later Mingma and Lhakpa Norbu Sherpa found their bodies next to a crevasse below camp IV. It was speculated that they fell on an ice slope near camp V, perhaps due to avalanche or rockfall. A memorial fund, administered by the Mount Everest Foundation, was created in her memory. Its aim is \\"to provide grants to further British and Polish women's mountaineering in the world's greater ranges, ie: further afield than the Alps\\". Personal life In 1971 Chadwick- Onyszkiewicz married Polish mathematician and mountaineer Janusz Onyszkiewicz, her frequent climbing partner.

It was built from 1909 to 1910 by the Queensland Department of Public Works and MR Hornibrook. It is also known as the former Thompson Estate State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 May 2016.  History  Junction Park State School opened on its present site in 1891 as the Thompson Estate State School, to accommodate the growing suburban population of a previously rural district on the southern outskirts of Brisbane. Junction Park State School retains two early swimming pools (1910, 1929) and a Depression-era brick school building (1936) with associated concrete retaining walls (c.1935) and brick toilet blocks (1934). Set in landscaped grounds with mature shade trees, the school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity. The Junction Park State School is today located in the suburb of Annerley, part of the traditional lands of the Turrbal and Jagera people. Annerley was originally part of an area called \\"Boggo\\", which ran from Dutton Park to Rocky Water Holes (later Rocklea). The Junction Hotel, established at the junction of Boggo Road (now Annerley Road) and Ipswich Road in 1866, was the beginning of a township at that location, known as Boggo until being renamed Annerley in 1892. Local farms, surveyed in the late 1850s, were replaced by suburbs from the late-19th century, due to the area's proximity to South Brisbane. Development was facilitated by construction of the Corinda–Yeerongpilly railway line in 1884 and the extension of an electric tram service from Woolloongabba to Dudley Street (south of the Junction Hotel) in 1899. The tramline was later extended south to Cracknell Road (north of Yeronga Park) in 1914.'Tramway extension work', Brisbane Courier, 9 March 1899, p.4 The sale of suburban allotments in the Thompson Estate, east of Ipswich Road and west of Norman Creek, between O'Keefe Street in the north and Victoria Terrace in the south, from 1881, led to calls for a local school.Brisbane Courier, 9 November 1881, p.4'McKellar's Official Map of Brisbane and Suburbs (6 Chains to an inch)' 1895, sheets 11, 12 (In 1977 the Thompson Estate was bisected by the new South East Freeway.) By the mid-1880s the nearest schools were at Yeronga (opened as Boggo Primary School in 1871), Coorparoo (1876), and Dutton Park (1884).Buch, p.40 The provision of state- administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p. 2 The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. This further standardised the provision of education, and despite difficulties, achieved the remarkable feat of bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p. 2 The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers. The inclusion of war memorials and community halls reinforced these connections and provided a venue for a wide range of community events in schools across Queensland.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8 James Joseph Dempsey, headmaster 1889 to 1923 From 30 April 1888 the Thompson Estate Provisional School No. 514 was conducted in a rented four-room cottage in Oxford Street (now between the Pacific Motorway and Norman Creek). A provisional school could be opened with as few as 15 (later 12) pupils. The Board of General Education gave financial assistance to local committees to set up and maintain these schools. The local committee provided a building and found a teacher, and the Board paid the teacher's salary relative to the number of pupils. If the district or town developed, provisional schools were raised to state school status, with purpose-designed school buildings and teacher residences attracting better qualified and more experienced teachers. The school, under Kathleen Barry, initially had 52 pupils, rising to 173 by December 1888. In January 1889 James Joseph Dempsey (head teacher of the school until 1923) replaced Barry, and upon reaching 200 pupils the school was moved to a hall in Regent Street (west of Oxford Street) in August 1889.Dempsey, pp.2, 4Buch, pp.44-6 The school became Thompson Estate State School in January 1891. The delay in the school being upgraded from provisional to state school, despite its rapidly increasing enrolment, was due to the school committee initially being unable to raise the required financial contribution. While pupil attendance was rising, a permanent site for the school was being sought, alongside community fundraising to obtain one-fifth of the cost of a school as required by the government. In mid-1888, William Stephens, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, and chairman of the Thompson Estate school committee, asked the Stephens Divisional Board if it would object to the Queensland Government resuming some land for a school. As a result, of land east of Ipswich Road (not including land adjacent to Ipswich Road, which remained a recreation reserve) was donated by the Stephens Divisional Board, although there was some disagreement from a rival school committee over the location.Buch, pp.47-53 William Stephens was also the Mayor of South Brisbane in 1888, 1899, and 1901'Mr William Stephens, death at Southport', The Brisbane Courier, 1 May 1925, p.10 The land was reserved for state school purposes on 19 July 1890.Queensland Government Gazette, 1890, Vol 2, p.891Survey Plan N25362, 1890 The land was previously part of Portion 105, purchased in 1859 by Stephen's father Thomas Blacket Stephens, Brisbane's second mayor (1862) and a newspaper proprietor.Elgin Read, \\"Stephens, Thomas Blacket (1819-1877)\\", http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/stephens-thomas- blacket-4644 (accessed 18 March 20116)Buch, pp.9-11 The northern part of Portion 105, plus part of Portion 103 to the east (also previously owned by Thomas Stephens) had been gazetted as a reserve for a manure depot in 1881.Survey Plan S151856 (1859)Queensland Government Gazette, 1881, Vol 2, p.11 This was transferred to the Woolloongabba Divisional Board in 1883, and then to the Stephens Divisional Board (formed in 1886, and named after Thomas Stephens) in 1888Queensland Government Gazette, 1888, Vol 1, p.476Survey Plan N25348, 1889 Between October 1890 and March 1891 a teacher's residence was built at the west end of the school reserve, and a timber school building was constructed further east, on the site of the current brick school building. Between the residence and the school were two small lagoons, on the site of today's oval.Buch, p.56 At this point Waldheim Street was only a track, which was included in the school grounds until the grounds were properly fenced in 1923.Dempsey, p.13 Waldheim Street also acted as the entrance to Waldheim (built c.1901, still extant), the family home of William Stephen, opposite the school The new school and residence cost £1818. The high-set timber school building was occupied on 31 March 1891.'New School, Thompson Estate', The Telegraph, Friday 3 April 1891, p.2 The school had been designed to accommodate 280 pupils, but 425 turned up on the first day.Dempsey, p.5 Several extensions to the building followed between 1893 and 1900.Buch, p.114 The name of the school also changed to Junction Park State School in 1892.'Junction Tonic Sol-fa class', The Telegraph, 10 September 1892, p.2 The grounds at Junction Park State School were initially rough and unfenced. The first Arbor Day was celebrated at the school in May 1891, and 12 of the trees planted were supplied by the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9 Along with built additions and tree planting, the area of the school also increased. The school grounds were expanded northwards from the 1890 school reserve, largely thanks to the efforts of Dempsey. Residential allotments along Gowrie Street (formerly Ferndale Street), between Harewood Street (formerly Alfred Street) and the eastern end of the school reserve, were gradually acquired.Dempsey, p.9 A residence on Lot 117 became the school caretaker's residence (removed by 1941). A tennis court was opened in 1908 near Gowrie Street, on some of the recently acquired land, and a second court was added in 1913.Buch, pp.100, 109DPW Plan 609-11-7/1, \\"Junction Park S. School sewerage installation\\" (1941) By 1934 all but three residential allotments - the two closest to Harewood Street (lots 106, 107) and one between B Block and the 1910 pool (lot 115), had been purchased.DPW Plan 12-20-11-4, \\"Junction Park Brisbane, new building\\", 1934 Lots 107 and 115 were later incorporated into the school grounds, which reached its maximum size of by 1982. This included the addition of of land to the east end of the original reserve in 1958.Survey Plans SL3205, (1958)SL9736 (1982) By 1982 the school owned lots 107 to 126, along the south side of Gowrie Road. As well as tennis courts, other sports facilities were constructed at the school. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. A cricket pitch was created on the school grounds by 1894, after previously being played on a paddock south of the school reserve. In 1908, the school's military cadets benefited from the establishment of a miniature rifle range at the east end of school grounds. The targets were on the other side of the creek, with the shots passing over the heads of Chinese market gardeners on the creek flats.Buch, pp 78,167 The Australian Government's Ekibin Rifle Range, associated with the nearby drill hall [QHR 602216] was also located south of the school. Another sports facility constructed was a swimming pool, the first of its kind in a Queensland state school. Junction Park State School was already involved in swimming as a sport, using a local waterhole and a dammed section of Ekibin Creek, until a case of typhoid led to a change of venue from the creek to the Peel Street Baths in South Brisbane. Once a water main was extended to Gowrie Street, it was possible to have a swimming pool in the school grounds. Work commenced on a concrete pool in October 1909. By this time the school had an average attendance of 615, out of an enrolment of 700 pupils. Smaller 1910 swimming pool, 2015 Measuring , and to deep, the pool was built by Messrs Wells and Bennett of Woolloongabba, and was opened by Walter Barnes, the Minister for Public Instruction, on 5 February 1910. One end of the galvanised iron enclosure around the pool was roofed and partly enclosed as dressing rooms. Most of the £175 cost was raised by the school committee, with £80 provided by the government for a \\"recreation shed\\" (since it was not policy to fund swimming pools). JJ Dempsey, writing 10 years after he had finished as head teacher at the school, considered the pool to be a memorial to four young students of the school (boys aged 6 and 7) who had drowned at Baynes' Paddock (Stones Corner) in a flooded waterhole in February 1890.'Board of Waterworks', The Telegraph, 12 October 1909, p.2'First school swimming pool', The Brisbane Courier, 5 February 1910, p.7'Baths at State Schools', The Telegraph, Monday 7 February 1910, p.5Dempsey, pp. 9, 11Buch, pp.25-26 At the opening, John Douglas Story, the Under Secretary for Public Instruction, noted that baths at state schools would play an important part of training boys for the Australian navy. As enrolments continued to climb, a new building for infants was opened on 22 June 1911, northeast of the main school building. A King Poinciana was planted as a \\"coronation tree\\" the same day, to commemorate the coronation of King George V.'Junction Park, opening of new school', The Telegraph, 23 June 1911, p.4 In October 1913, when the school had an average daily attendance of 800, a two-storey infants school building was added to the southeast of the 1911 building. This was named the \\"Denham Infant School\\", after the Premier, Digby Denham (who was also chairman of the school committee).'A school story told by the Governor', The Brisbane Courier, 20 October 1913, p.8 That year the school was also connected to the main sewerage system, with toilets to the north of the main school building.Buch, p.110 The March of the Dunagrees passing along Ipswich Road, Moorooka, before arriving at Junction Park State School, 30 November 1915 Lady Goold-Adams, wife of the Queensland Governor Hamilton Goold-Adams, at the opening of the Red Cross Fete at Junction Park State School, 1916 During World War I, the school contributed in many patriotic activities to support the war effort. Many former student enlisted in the armed forces. An honour board, dated 1915 and located in the former assembly room on the first floor of the Depression-era brick school building in 2016, has 86 names of former pupils who were \\"serving at the front\\". By December 1917 the school's honour board (possibly multiple boards) listed 300 former pupils who had enlisted, with 30 having died.Buch, pp.189-90 The teachers, current pupils and their families also rallied behind the war effort. There were fundraising events to provide comforts for the troops as well as enthusiastic support for recruiting initiatives. In November 1915, the March of the Dungarees (a snowball march to attract army recruits) which started in Stanthorpe on 6 November. Along the route, local communities supported them with meals and accommodation. On 30 November, as the recruits marched along Ipswich Road on their final day, they stopped for breakfast provided by the families of Junction Park State School. On Saturday 30 September 1916 Junction Park State School held a fete and concert to raise funds for the Australian Red Cross. Changes continued at the school, to accommodate the educational needs of the growing suburb. Annerley became a thriving business precinct in the early 20th century, and between 1911 and 1921 its population grew from 1203 to 2642. By 1923 a housing estate stood immediately to the south of the school. A new timber block of three classrooms (Block B) was built north of the main school building, near Gowrie Street, .Project Services, \\"Junction Park State School\\", in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008 There are references to a \\"new wing\\" being opened at the school in 1925 (when there were nearly 1000 pupils in daily attendance), and this may refer to Block B.'State education, Minister's remarks, Junction Park School', Daily Mail, 15 June 1925, p.8 In 1925 Dempsey noted that the new addition had been built on land he had obtained.Buch, p.212 Block B was later reconfigured as two classrooms in 1937DPW Plan 206-22-4, \\"Department of Public Works, Junction Park State School alterations to partitions\\", 1937 Other changes in the 1920s included a new, larger swimming pool.

The school had received a new flagpole in 1912, related to the coronation of King George V the previous year.'Hoisting a school flag, Junction Park State School', The Telegraph, 21 October 1912, p.2 The 1930s brought major changes to the built fabric of the school. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building program to provide impetus to the economy. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work program by the Department of Public Works. This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p. 5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p. 5 By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.'Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930', p. 15 Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.58 In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public works building program designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. This building program included: government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p. 8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p. 7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp, 6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p. 2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p. 2'State will spend over £460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p. 9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p. 2 Many of the programs have had lasting beneficial effects for the citizens of Queensland, including the construction of masonry brick school buildings across the state. Most were designed in a Classical idiom to project the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. The construction of substantial brick school buildings in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation.Type E/B1, Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.59 The Queensland Public Works Department and Department of Public Instruction were extremely enthusiastic about the brick school buildings designed in the 1930s. They were considered monuments to progress embodying the most modern principles of the ideal education environment.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.60 Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and often exhibited a prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings, being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Ideally, the classrooms would face south with the verandah on the north but little concession was made for this and almost all Depression-era brick school buildings faced the primary boundary road, regardless of orientation (however, Junction Park State School's brick school building did have the classrooms facing south but this may be because it was simply facing the primary boundary road). Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.59-60 Despite their similarities, each Depression-era Brick School building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles, which were derived from contemporary tastes and fashions, included: Arts and Crafts, typified by half-timbered gable-ends; Spanish Mission, with round-arched openings and decorative parapets; and Neo-classical, with pilasters, columns and large triangular pediments. Over time, variations occurred in building size, decorative treatment, and climatic-responsive features.EHP analysis of Depression-era Brick Schools, based on contemporary photographs, QHR listed schools, Project Services Heritage Reports (2006) and original DPW building plans The Chief Architect during this period was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966), who was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department from 1910 to 1951, and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951. A brick school building (Block A in 2016) for Junction Park State School was requested by the school committee in June 1934, approved in December 1934, and completed by June 1936. The central wing of the old timber school building was removed, while two other wings remained in place to the north and south of the new building, to allow teaching to continue during construction. 'New school buildings, Milton and Junction Park', The Telegraph, 20 December 1934, p.2Buch, pp.267-8 Three new brick toilet blocks - one for boys, one for girls, and one for infants - plus a septic system, were constructed in 1934, for £3400, to complement the new brick school building.Buch, p.263Project Services, \\"Junction Park State School\\" In June 1935 the building \\"in progress\\" had an estimated cost of £20,560. It would contain twenty-one classrooms to accommodate 860 pupils, with the possibility for future extensions to provide for 1,020 pupils. The building was to be constructed of brick with an asbestos cement slate roof. The basement comprised a concreted play area and secondary entrances. The ground floor contained a main entrance portico to the south, entrance porches to the northern façade, ten classrooms, cloakrooms, a head teacher's office and a male teachers' room; and the first floor contained eleven classrooms, cloakrooms and a female teachers' room. Three classrooms on each floor were provided with folding partitions, to enable them to be converted to large assembly rooms.'Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30th June 1935', p.7 The building was reported as being \\"in progress\\" in the 1935 annual report of the Department of Public Works, although local media reported it as \\"completed\\".'State's building progress, Works Department busy', Courier Mail, 3 July 1935, p.17 It was again mentioned, with a photograph of the building and the retaining wall to the west, in the 1936 DPW annual report. The building plans were drawn by Frederick Thomas Jellett, who had been articled with the Victorian Public Works Department and engaged by Queensland Public Works as a draftsman in 1920. Jellett's name also appears on drawings in the 1930s for extensions at New Farm State School and Ascot State School, and for Ayr and Ipswich North State Schools.Project Services, 'Junction Park State School'DPW Plan 12-20-11-2, \\"Junction Park Brisbane, new state school\\", 1934 The symmetrical building, with classical detailing, addressed Waldheim Street, with a range running east–west, terminated by stairwells (and cloak rooms on the first and second floors), with more classrooms in the lateral wings at either end of the building. The classrooms were accessed by a rear (northern) verandah and all but four had windows to the south. The remaining four classrooms projected to the rear in the lateral wings, and had north windows. Classroom ceilings were battened with lattice vents on the second floor. Three classrooms to the east of the entrance bay on both the first and second floor were divided by folding doors. The remainder were divided by solid masonry walls with connecting double doors. Verandah floors were concrete. Entry was via a two-storey bay (with undercroft) that projected south from the centre of the range and framed the main entrance to the building. The bay was accessed by two sets of L-shaped stairs leading from Waldheim Street to an entrance loggia, which had three brick archways and a concrete balustrade of large square piers and decorative balusters. To the rear, two stairs with porch landings projected diagonally from the junction of the range and lateral wing on the first floor. The roof was tiled and was provided with a fleche. It appears that terracotta tiles rather than asbestos cement tiles were used.DPW Plan 9-24-2, \\"Junction Park Brisbane, new school\\", 1934 A low concrete retaining wall with two sets of steps was built as part of the levelling of the grounds, to the west of the brick school building, and was constructed by 1935.'Brisbane City Council Water Supply and Sewerage Department Detail Plan No.439', (7 October 1935) The school residence had also been removed by 1935, and the land at the west end of the school was terraced by this time, as was the east end of the school. The concrete block retaining walls at the west end of the school may have been built between 1935 and World War II.Buch, p.262 Earth terraces are shown at the west end of the grounds, rather than a wall, in the BCC 1935 sewerage plan. The terracing appears to be more linear/regular by 1946, compared to a 1936 aerial, suggesting that the walls could have been added in the late 1930s. However, further research is required.Aerial photographs DNRM, ADA9-6202, 20 April 1936 and 1946 Block A was opened by the Minister for Public Instruction, Frank Cooper, on 17 October 1936, with the cost reported as £28,000, and the remaining wings of the old school were sold for removal around this time.'Minister opens new school at Junction Park', The Telegraph, 17 October 1936, p.4'For removal by public auction', Courier Mail, 11 September 1936, p.26 The old timber wings are still present on an aerial photograph taken 20 April 1936.DNRM, ADA9-6202 Some of the timber from the demolished wing was used to build dressing sheds and showers over the 1910 swimming pool, which remained covered until the sheds were demolished in 1955.Buch, p.267Project Services, 'Junction Park State School'(pool uncovered) Like World War I, World War II also affected life at the school. Due to fear of Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools in January 1942, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. The closed schools were sometimes occupied for defence purposes, and some schools remained closed \\"for special reasons\\" after the rest had reopened.Ronald Wood, 1993, Civil Defence In Queensland During World War II, p.79'Schools reopen; some await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p.3 Slit trenches, for protecting the students in the event of Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools, often by parents and staff. Zig-zag trenches were dug at Junction Park State School, skirting the oval.Buch, p.331 A call went out for volunteer helpers to dig the trenches at the school.'School trenches should be finished at once', The Telegraph, 29 January 1942 Traces of some of these trenches are visible in a 1946 aerial photograph of the school, along the south side of the oval. Junction Park also hosted students from Moorooka State School, which was occupied by the United States Army between February and July 1942. After World War II, enrolments at the school continued to climb. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, pp.28-31 In 1947 enrolments at Junction Park State School reached 1477, and for a few years Junction Park State School was Brisbane's largest attended state school. In May 1948, the administration of the infants school separated from that of the primary school.Buch, p.337 In order to accommodate increasing student numbers at the primary school, Block B was extended at either end in 1953, and in 1955 Block C was added just west of Block B, on the site of the 1908-1913 tennis courts.DPW Plan 514/742/1, \\"Junction Park Primary School additional accom\\" 1953DPW Plan 514-786-1, \\"Junction Park Primary State School additional accom\\", 1955 Two new tennis courts had been formed at the west end of the school by 1951, on the terrace that was previously the site of the school residence.Aerial photograph DNRM, BCC5-39399, (1 August 1951) A new infants school complex opened at the east end of the school reserve in April 1958.Buch, pp.358-59 Concrete retaining walls were added between the 1930s brick school building and the infants school at this time (prior to the 1950s, plans and aerial photographs only show several earth banks at the east end of the school). The 1913 infants building was also removed, and the 1911 infants building was extended and remodelled as a domestic science and manual training block, and was shifted slightly northwest, to its current site near the northeast corner of the 1929 pool.DPW Plan 514/853, \\"Junction Park St. School, D/science & man/training block, remodelling, additions etc\\", 1957 Later, as infant enrolments fell (from 774 in 1952 to 320 in 1966) it was decided in 1974 to re-amalgamate the primary and infants schools. Meanwhile, the primary school had 1523 enrolled in 1958, dropping to 785 by 1965, as the baby boom ended and Grade 8 was transferred to secondary school in 1964.Buch, pp.396-7, 401 Other changes have been made to the school over time, including partition and entrance alterations to the brick toilet blocks. The brick school building has had some internal changes, with some new partitions added to the first and second floors, and some classroom walls removed. In the summer of 2015-2016 the ceilings on the second floor were replaced. The southern side of the undercroft was enclosed between the piers with doors, fixed glass panels and louvres ; a tuck shop was added as an enclosure in the east side; and the lateral wings of the undercroft have been enclosed for classrooms and store rooms.DPW Plan 514-725, \\"Junction Park State School enclosing between piers to main (front) elevation\\", 1953DPW Plan 514-1653/1(A), \\"Junction Park State School new tuckshop (under Block A)\\", 1978 In 1964 a new entrance from Waldheim Street was created east of the brick school building, leading to a paved area.Annotation on DPW Plan 514/742/2, \\"Junction Pk Primary School, additional accommodation\\", 1953 Some bitumen was removed from the playground behind the brick school building in 1995, to create a grassed area, and a forest of native trees (sclerophyll forest) was opened in the southeast corner of the grounds in 1997.Buch pp.423-4 Historic aerial photographs show that there has been a clump of trees in this corner of the school since at least 1936. An early tree appears to survive between the sclerophyll forest and the 1929 pool. The site of the 1950s infants school complex was excised from the east end of the school grounds in 1998, leaving the school grounds at their current size of , and the infants school buildings were demolished between 1997 and 2000 (the land being later used for residential apartments).Survey Plan SP107273, 1998 The infants school buildings were still present on a 1997 aerial photograph,DNRM QAP5484-142, 21 March 1997 but were demolished by 2000 and were later replaced by housing.DNRM, QAP5736-174, 19 January 2000 Some new buildings were added to the school in 2003 and 2009.Buch, pp.447, 452DPW Plan, 1615-05-H01, \\"Junction Park State School, Building the Education Revolution, hydraulic services title sheet and site locality plan\\", 2009 The school celebrated the centenary of the opening of the Thomas Estate Provisional School in April 1988, with a banquet for 600 people at the Hilton International Ballroom,Buch, p.437 and a history of the school was also published that year. Another history was published in 2015. In 2016 the school continues to operate from its original site, and retains its early swimming pools, Depression-era brick school building, toilet blocks, and retaining walls, set in landscaped grounds with mature shade trees. The school remains important to the Annerley community. Since establishment, generations of students have been taught at Junction Park State School and it has been a key social focus for its community with the grounds and buildings having been the location of many social events.  Description  Site plan, 2016 Junction Park State School occupies a levelled site within the residential suburb of Annerley, approximately south of the Brisbane CBD. The site faces, and is primarily accessed from, Waldheim Street to the south; and is bounded by Gowrie and Harewood streets (north), residential properties (north, east and west) and the Annerley Library (fronting Ipswich Road, west). The school comprises a range of buildings and structures; with the most prominent being a Depression-era brick school building (Block A; 1936), located at the southeast end of the site. A complex containing two early swimming pools (1910 and 1929) and timber stands (pre-1944) is located to the northeast of Block A, as are three brick toilet blocks (1934). Other important elements of the school include various Depression-era retaining walls at the west end of the grounds (), an oval west of Block A, and mature trees. = Depression-era brick school building (Block A; 1936) = Brick school building from Waldheim Street, 2015 Block A is a symmetrical, masonry structure of two storeys, with an undercroft. A tall fleche projects above the tiled, hipped roof. The building comprises a range, running west–east, with two short lateral wings at the eastern and western ends, running south–north. A two-storey bay (with undercroft) projects south from the centre of the range and frames the main entrance to the building. It is accessed by two sets of L-shaped stairs leading from the Waldheim Street to an entrance loggia, which has three brick archways and a concrete balustrade of large square piers and decorative balusters. Additional entrances of concrete stairs diagonally project from the northern elevation at the junction of the range and lateral wings. These stairs have metal balustrades and enclosed, one-storey, face brick landings. Rear of brick school building as seen from the school grounds, 2015 The building is elegantly composed with classical detailing. Constructed from load-bearing face brick walls, it has rendered decorative elements to the first and second floors, and a rendered base that forms the undercroft level. The red-brown brick walls of the first and second floors are laid in a stretcher bond, and are relieved with pilasters - rendered on the front elevation and English-bonded, brown face brick on the northern elevation. The pilasters have simple, rendered capitals. Along the front elevation, tiled window hoods with decorative timber brackets shelter the first storey windows; and two face brick projections protrude from the eastern and western ends of the range. The projections and entry bay are topped with rendered parapets, and rendered string courses run the length of the elevation. A foundation stone is set within the wall east of the entry bay, at the understorey level. Rendered detailing on the entrance bay includes ornamental scrolls, and the words \\"JUNCTION PARK STATE SCHOOL\\" in raised lettering. A gabled pediment on the northern side of the range has a face brick tympanum, which is rendered at its apex and has a centred, rendered accent circle. The interior layout of the building is symmetrical. The ends of the range are terminated by stairwells and store rooms (former cloak rooms), and are flanked by toilets and store rooms (also former cloak rooms) and classrooms in the lateral wings. Aligned with the entry bay and in the centre of the range is a first floor foyer, centrally located between eastern and western office spaces, and a second floor classroom and office. Leadlight fanlights are located in the foyer; featuring the words \\"JUNCTION PARK\\" below the school's crest, with the school's house symbols to either side. A timber board listing the names of the school's principals since 1888 is also located in the foyer. The remainder of the range, on both the first and second floors, comprises classrooms. Most classrooms throughout the building retain original partition bulkheads, which indicate the original layout, and latticed ceiling vents are retained on the second floor. Most classrooms and offices have plaster walls, timber-framed floors covered in recent carpet or linoleum, and flat-sheeted ceilings with timber battens. Skirtings are generally wide and plastered, and most classrooms retain picture rails. A raised timber stage has been constructed in a classroom at the eastern end of the first floor. A timber honour board (1915) is located in the same classroom. It is stained dark brown and has a decorative frame that is stained in a lighter brown and has turned vertical supports. Featured at the head of the board is a photograph of a soldier, surrounded by the words, \\"1915; HONOUR BOARD; OUR BOYS SERVING AT THE FRONT; JUNCTION PARK STATE SCHOOL,\\" and leaf patterns painted in gold. Below this are the names of 86 former students who served in World War I, also painted in gold. Stairs are of polished and painted concrete, and their balustrades have timber handrails and metal balusters with timber posts. At the landing level between the undercroft and first floor, there are decorative metal screens in the openings to the stairwell. Verandahs along the northern side of the range provide access to the first and second floor classrooms and offices. They have painted concrete floors and their ceilings are flat, with those on the second floor featuring timber battens. The brick balustrades have rendered copings, with concrete drains channelled along their base; the central sections are plastered and enclosed with early windows. Recent lightweight partitions enclose most ends of the verandahs to enlarge the lateral wings' classrooms, and are not of cultural heritage significance. A large, metal school bell is attached to the western balustrade of the first floor verandah. Its bracket is marked with \\"JPSS, 1888\\" in raised letters. The undercroft level comprises open play-space, a modern tuckshop and storage space, with enclosed classrooms and storage spaces in the lateral wings. It has a concrete slab floor, with floors in some enclosed spaces covered in recent linoleum and carpet. Most ceilings are of flat sheeting, and timber framing is exposed within the range and the western wing. The piers are stop-chamfered, and timber seats supported by metal brackets are attached to some piers. Early timber joinery is retained throughout the building, including: tall casement windows (to the exterior); double-hung sash windows (to the verandahs); arched casement windows (to the eastern and western range projections); panelled doors on the first floor; low-waisted French doors with arched fanlights (to the entrance bay); a high-waisted timber panelled door (to the tuckshop, 1953); and an interior French glazed door (between classrooms on the second floor). Most windows and doors have early awning fanlights; and most windows retain their early hardware with winding mechanisms. All rendered elements have been painted. = Swimming Pools (1910, 1929) and Timber Stands (pre-1944) = The larger 1929 swimming pool with stands, 2015 The swimming pool complex includes two rectangular, in-ground, concrete swimming pools and timber stands. The 1929 pool has slightly rounded corners. The complex is enclosed by early face brick and perforated concrete block walls to the south and east, a corrugated metal-clad timber-framed fence to the north, and a recent, face brick, changing room structure (2003, not significant) to the west. The oldest and smallest pool is the 1910 swimming pool, which runs on a north–south axis, measures , and is located west of the perpendicular, 1929 swimming pool, which measures . Both pools have tiled edges and concrete pavers around them. The stands comprise tiered, timber-framed seating that allow for the viewing of the 1929 swimming pool. The stands are sheltered by a metal-framed roof (1989) that is not of cultural heritage significance. = Toilet Blocks; Boys, Girls and Infants (former, 1934) = The boys, girls and infants toilet blocks are all one storey, rectangular, face brick structures that have corrugated metal- clad Dutch-gable roofs, V-jointed (VJ) timber soffits, and long axes running east–west. Triangular, timber ventilation panels are located within the gable apexes. Entrances to the blocks are from the northern and southern sides, and are screened by facebrick walls that have rounded corners at the entry points. Variance in brickwork colour indicates where some of these screens have been extended; in some cases, both in length and height. The brickwork of the exterior walls is exposed internally (some have been painted). The floors are concrete (with modern linings) and the ceilings are lined in VJ timber. Window openings are timber-framed and have tall sill heights. Most internal partitions have been altered and toilets have been replaced by modern units - these are not of cultural heritage significance. = Landscape elements = The school grounds are well established, and the formerly sloping site has been terraced to the west of Block A by several Depression-era concrete retaining walls that form levelled platforms. These retaining walls are located: west of Block A (running north–south), along the west, northwest and southwest boundaries of the oval, and along the western boundary of the site. Many mature trees which appear to predate 1936, including some large figs (Ficus spp.), are located within the school grounds along the southern boundary of the site and the northern edge of the oval, plus individual mature trees are located south of the 1929 swimming pool, and north of Block B and the former infants toilet block. = Other Structures and Elements = An early concrete plinth is set on a square concrete base south of the swimming pool complex. Modern partitions, joinery, buildings and sheds within the cultural heritage boundary are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Junction Park State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 May 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Junction Park State School (established in 1891) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains an excellent example of a government-designed Depression-era brick school building (1936), which was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies and is set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities and mature trees. The Depression- era brick school building, toilet blocks and landscaping of the school grounds demonstrate the Queensland Government's building and relief work programs that, during the 1930s, stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The two swimming pools (1910, 1929), the earliest of which was the first built in a Queensland state school, reflect the growing concern in the early 20th century to teach children to swim for health and safety reasons. The World War I Honour Board (1915) located in the Depression-era brick school building is important in demonstrating the school community's involvement in a major world event. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Junction Park State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school built during the Depression era. The school comprises a Depression-era brick school building, and brick toilet blocks (1934), constructed to a government design. These are set within a generous, landscaped site that retains mature shade trees, Depression-era retaining walls (), and sporting facilities, including the early swimming pools and an oval. The substantial Depression-era brick school building is an intact, excellent example of its type and retains a high degree of integrity. The building demonstrates the principal characteristics of its type, including its two-storey form, with an undercroft; symmetrical, high quality design that features classical detailing; loadbearing, face brick construction; hipped roof; and prominent central roof fleche. The building has a linear layout, with rooms accessed by verandahs, and an undercroft used as open play space. Typical of this building type, the Depression-era brick school building was located in a growing suburban area at the time of its construction. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its elegant composition of formal and decorative elements, substantial size, face brick exterior and high quality materials, the Depression-era brick school building at Junction Park State School has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, by which the Department of Public Works sought to convey the concepts of progress and permanence. The building's elegant composition, assertive massing and classically-influenced design contribute to its dignified streetscape presence, and contrast with the surrounding small-scale residences. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Junction Park State School has a strong and ongoing association with the Annerley community. It was established in 1891 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Annerley children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Annerley and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

However, those in the know (a large catchment that is ever-growing, actually), know that - as well as being one of our most charismatic live performers, Ian McNabb is up there as one of the finest singer-songwriters and guitarists that these isles have ever produced. This album will delight that large, growing fan-base and should, with the aid of word-of-mouth, draw even more people in.' Similarly, Nigel Cartner of Sonic Bandwagon noted that 'This is a highly recommended album – one of the best of the year from a man who’s no stranger to producing excellence throughout his illustrious career.'

A member of the Higher Council of Education, he ceased his tenure in 1903 and continued to give private lessons, singing and scenery lessons.  Theories of voice and singing  For Crosti, there is not only the chest voice and head voice; there is a kind of intermediate emission that he calls palatal voice, and that is a slight modification of the breast voice. The palatal voice is produced at the glottis level following the same mechanism as the chest voice itself (vibrating strings in all their length), but it differs from the latter in that the resonance, instead of being made above all in the thorax, is supported under the palatal vault by an appropriate arrangement of the pharynx, the soft palate. The vocal breath, sent to the frontal sinuses and striking directly at the upper walls of the palate, contracts the roundness, majesty and softness to which the nasal cavities it passes, without vibrating them, however, add sound still. It is also in this register that the richest sounds of an organ occur. It is therefore necessary to take care of the production, because it is also the medium, part of the voice in which the songs to be sung are usually written. (Eugène Crosti.

Its original foundation dates back to the foundation of Fes el-Jdid (\\"New Fez\\"), the royal citadel of the Marinid dynasty, in 1276 CE. Most of the palace today dates from the Alaouite era (17th-20th centuries). The vast grounds are home to multiple private structures, patios, and gardens, but historically also included administrative offices and government tribunals. Today, the most publicly visible parts of the palace are its main entrances at the Old Mechouar (to the northeast) and the highly ornate 20th-century gates at Place des Alaouites, near the Mellah (to the southwest).  History = Marinid foundation and embellishment (late 13th century and after) = The minaret of the alt= The palace was founded and initially built, along with the rest of Fes el-Jdid, by the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in 1276. It served as the new royal residence and center of government for Morocco under Marinid rule. Before this, the main center of power and government in Fes had been the Kasbah Bou Jeloud on the western edge of the old city (at the location of the still extant Bou Jeloud Mosque). The decision to create a new and highly fortified citadel separate from the old city (Fes el-Bali) may have reflected a continuous wariness of Moroccan rulers towards the highly independent and sometimes restive population of Fes. The Grand Mosque of Fes el-Jdid, adjacent to the palace grounds, was also founded at the same time as the new city in 1276 and was connected by a private passage directly to the palace, allowing the sultan to come and go for prayers. culverts where the Fez River passes under the mechouar Although the original layout of the palace cannot be fully reconstructed due to centuries of subsequent expansion and modification, it was most likely concentrated further southwest within the current palace grounds. What is now the Old Mechouar (a large walled courtyard preceding the main public entrance to the palace) was at that time a fortified bridge over the Oued Fes (Fes River) at the northern entrance to the city, and was most likely not directly connected to the palace itself. In addition to the main palace structures at the center of the city, the palace was also flanked by a large park or garden area to the west which was characterized by elevated terraces and pavilions, most likely corresponding to the site of the present- day Lalla Mina Gardens in the current palace. These first gardens were known as the \\"Agdal\\" (not to be confused with the current Agdal Gardens further west) and followed a tradition already established in Almoravid and Almohad times, as exemplified by the older Agdal Gardens of Marrakesh. The western edge of these gardens was in turn bounded by the western walls of the city. A gate known as Bab Agdal still stands here today and preserves its old Marinid- era layout. Abu Yusuf Ya'qub had also wished to create a vast pleasure garden outside the palace, perhaps in emulation of those he might have admired in Granada (such as the Generalife); however, he died in 1286 before this could be accomplished. His son and successor, Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, carried out the work instead in 1287, creating the vast Mosara Garden to the north of Fes el-Jdid. This garden was supplied with water from the Oued Fes via an aqueduct fed by an enormous noria (waterwheel) near Bab Dekkakin. Both the gardens and the noria fell into disuse after the Marinid period and eventually disappeared, leaving only traces. = Alaouite revival and expansion (17th century and after) = The skyline of the palace today, within Fes el-Jdid, seen from the east; the tall structures on the left are part of the Dar Ayad al-Kebira, with the minaret of the Lalla Mina Mosque partly visible behind it Following years of neglect, the original Marinid constructions mostly fell into disrepair and were only restored, rebuilt, or replaced when the Alaouite sultans re-invested in Fes and made it the capital of Morocco again (with the exception of certain periods). As a result, the current structures in the palace mainly date from the Alaouite period, from the 17th century and after. In 1671, Sultan Moulay Rashid ordered the creation of a vast rectangular courtyard in the eastern part of the palace. The courtyard, still extant today, was adorned with green zellij tiles and centered around a large rectangular water basin. This addition extended the Dar al-Makhzen grounds up to the edge of the Lalla ez- Zhar Mosque, which had previously stood in the middle of a residential neighbourhood, and cutting off one of the local streets. This was one of several occasions where the expansion of the palace cut into the general residential areas of Fes el-Jdid. Moulay Rashid also built the vast Kasbah Cherarda north of Fes el-Jdid in order to house his tribal troops. The housing of troops here also liberated new space in Fes el-Jdid itself, including the northwestern area which became the new Moulay Abdallah neighbourhood from the early 18th century onwards. This is where Sultan Moulay Abdallah (ruled between 1729 and 1757) erected a large mosque and royal necropolis for the Alaouite dynasty. Abdallah's successor, Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (ruled 1748 and 1757–1790), was responsible, according to some sources, for establishing the New Mechouar and the Old Mechouar. However, other studies and later authors attribute this arrangement to Moulay Hassan's reign a century later (see below). Mohammed ben Abdallah also built the Dar Ayad al-Kebira, one of the more imposing structures inside the palace grounds. Major expansions and modifications continued throughout the 19th century. Under sultan Moulay Abd al-Rahman (ruled 1822–1859) the Bab Bou Jat Mechouar or Grand Mechouar was created to the west of the Moulay Abdallah quarter, providing the palace grounds with another ceremonial entrance to the northwest. Moulay Abd al-Rahman also revived the gardens of the palace to the west, up to the old western Marinid walls of the city, by creating the Lalla Mina or Lalla Amina Gardens (on the site of earlier Marinid-era gardens) and building the adjoining Lalla Mina Mosque. West of these, beyond the old walls, an even larger walled garden known today as the Agdal was established by Sultan Moulay Hassan I (ruled 1873–1894). (According to one author, the Lalla Mina Mosque is also attributed to Moulay Hassan.) alt=It also seems to have been under Moulay Hassan that the Dar al-Makhzen grounds were extended northwards up to the south gate of the Old Mechouar, thus turning the latter into the main entrance of the palace instead of the main entrance of the city. This forced the diversion of the northern end of Fes el-Jdid's main street so that it now enters the Old Mechouar from the side. The new expansion included a vast rectangular courtyard to serve as an \\"inner mechouar\\", followed by several other courtyards extending up to the Old Mechouar's gate. This inner mechouar was lined by arcades and housed a number of public and administrative functions like the mahkama (courthouse). This mechouar also lay between the Grand Mosque of Fes el-Jdid and its former madrasa (the Madrasa Fes el-Jdid), cutting them off from each other and resulting in the madrasa being integrated into the palace. According to scholars it was Moulay Hassan who then built what is now known as the New Mechouar on the north side Bab Dekkakin and of the Old Mechouar. Next to this he also built the Dar al-Makina factory on the west side of the new square in 1886. Lastly, Moulay Hassan also connected Fes el-Jdid and Fes el-Bali (the old city) for the first time with a large corridor of walls. Inside this space he commissioned a number of royal gardens (such as Jnan Sbil) and summer palaces (such as Dar Batha), which were separate but associated or connected with the palace. Historically, members of the public and government officials only had access to the first few courtyards of the Dar al-Makhzen, from the Old Mechouar to the \\"Inner Mechouar\\", due to public government institutions and tribunals being housed here. The Old Mechouar and the adjoining courtyards were thus a reception and waiting area for those who had business inside the palace. The rest of the palace further west, on the other hand, made up the sultan's private residence and was not accessible to anyone but the sultan, his family, and his inner circle. = Recent history (20th century) and present day = After Moulay Hassan, his son and successor Moulay Abd al-Aziz (ruled 1894–1908) constructed a palace pavilion, known as Dar al-Fassiya, on the western edge of the central palace structures, on the north side of the Lalla Mina Gardens. It was adjoined by a marble-paved courtyard and some of its rooms had ceilings gilded with gold leaf, but it was later abandoned and even partly looted. His successor, Moulay Abd al-Hafid (ruled 1908–1912), began in turn the construction of a large multi-story pavilion which was the include the first elevators in the palace, but its construction was not completed and it stood unfinished for many years. Following the advent of French colonial rule in 1912, the capital of Morocco was moved to Rabat and never returned to Fes. Some of the outlying branches of the palace, such as the Dar al-Beida and Dar Batha near Fes el-Bali, were occupied by the offices of the French authorities and of the French resident-general. Despite this, the main palace complex in Fes is still regularly used by the King of Morocco today. The palace is thus not open to the public.Royal Palace. Lonely Planet. Retrieved January 24, 2018.  The new Gates of the Royal Palace  In the 1960s King Hassan II reoriented the entrance of the palace complex from the Old Mechouar in the north to a new southern approach facing the modern Ville Nouvelle of Fes. A new grand square, Place des Alaouites, was laid out and new ornate gates to the palace were built between 1969 and 1971. The gates are considered an excellent piece of modern Moroccan craftsmanship and are lavishly decorated with elaborate mosaic tilework, carved cedar wood, and doors of gilt bronze covered in geometric patterns. These gates, along with the gate at the Old Mechouar, are the closest that most members of the public can get to the palace grounds.

Today it covers 80 hectares, taking up much of the city's area. Inside, the vast palace grounds are taken up by numerous courtyards, residential pavilions, gardens, and fountains. Its complicated and irregular layout is the result of repeated modifications, reconstructions, and expansions over the centuries, much of it now dating to the Alaouite period (17th-20th centuries). = The mechouars = The entrance to the Dar al-Makhzen at the Old Mechouar In the context of palace architecture, the term \\"mechouar\\" (from the French transliteration, méchouar, of Arabic المشور; sometimes spelled mishwar or meshwar in English) generally refers to an official square or courtyard at the entrance of the royal palace. Such squares were used for various open-air ceremonies, the reception of ambassadors, and as waiting areas for those entering the palace. They were often also part of the setting for the dispensation of justice or the receiving of petitions to the ruler. For example, the main qadi (judge) of Fes Jdid held his tribunal near the entrance of the palace, located just inside the entrance from the Old Mechouar. There are at least three historical mechouars attached the royal palace of Fes.  Old Mechouar (Vieux Méchouar)  alt= The smallest of the mechouars of Fes, this courtyard immediately precedes the official entrance to the Dar al- Makhzen. The mechouar is enclosed by ramparts on all sides and dates to the Marinid period. It appears that it was originally a fortified bridge over the Oued Fes (Fez River), with fortified gates at either end. The river still passes underneath the square, reemerging via four semi-circular openings at the eastern base of its walls on the edge of the Jnan Sbil Gardens. On the southern side of the square today is the gate to the Dar al-Makhzen; until the creation of the new palace gates in the southwest, this was the main entrance to the palace. However, this was originally occupied by a gate called Bab al- Qantara (\\"Gate of the Bridge\\") or Bab el-Oued (\\"Gate of the River\\") which had been the northern entrance to the whole city before the palace grounds were expanded and it became the gate to the Dar al-Makhzen itself. On the square's northern side is Bab Dekkakin (originally called Bab es-Sebaa), the monumental gate leading to and from the New Mechouar (see below). To the west, an opening in the walls leads to the Moulay Abdallah residential district of Fes el-Jdid. On the square's east side are two other openings in the wall. The southern one leads to the Grande Rue (main street) of Fes el-Jdid (which leads to Bab Semmarine and the Jewish Mellah beyond), while the northern opening gives access to the road leading towards Place Bou Jeloud and the entrance to Fes el Bali. Because of this crossroads, the mechouar is one of the busiest squares in Fes el-Jdid today.  New Mechouar (Nouveau Méchouar)  The New Mechouar, looking south towards Bab Dekkakin To the north of the Old Mechouar, through the monumental Bab Dekkakin (\\"Gate of the Benches\\"; also known as Bab es-Sebaa, \\"Gate of the Lion\\"), lies the larger New Mechouar. According to scholars, it was created by Sultan Moulay Hassan (Hassan I) in the late 19th century. On the western side of the square is a gateway in the Italianate architectural style which belongs to the Makina (Dar al-Makina), a former arms factory (also called Dar al-Silah) established by Moulay Hassan in 1886 with the help of Italian officers. Originally, though, this western wall was actually a large Marinid aqueduct built in 1286 to carry water to the Mosara Garden in the north; the faint outline of its arches can still be seen today within the structure of the wall. The northern gate of the New Mechouar, known as Bab Kbibat es-Smen (\\"Gate of the Butter Niche\\"), also dates from the 1886 construction, though another gate called Bab Segma (formerly part of the Marinid gardens) also lends its name to the area.  Bab Bou Jat Mechouar  Also known as the \\"Grand Mechouar\\", this vast irregular quadrilateral space of 4 hectares occupied the northwestern corner of Fes el Jdid in an angle between the walls of the palace grounds to the south and the Moulay Abdallah district to the east. The military square was laid out in the mid-19th century by Abd al-Rahman de Saulty, a Muslim convert and officer in the military engineers corps under Sultan Moulay Abd al-Rahman (ruled 1822-1859). The creation of the mechouar required a minor diversion of the Oued Fes river at the time. Bab Bou Jat, the main western gate of the Moulday Abdallah quarter, once opened through here but was closed off in the 20th century. On the south side of the square is a menzeh, an elevated pavilion from which the sultan could observe ceremonies taking place in the square, which was built by Sultan Abdelaziz (ruled 1894-1908). = The grounds of the Royal Palace = alt=While today the main front entrance of the palace are its famous gates to the southwest, historically the palace's main public entrance was from the Old Mechouar to the northeast. Upon entering the palace from here, one passed through several courtyards until reaching the \\"Inner\\" Mechouar created under Sultan Moulay Hassan. This large rectangular courtyard is lined with arcades and historically housed a number of public and administrative functions like the mahkama (courthouse). On the southeast side of the courtyard is a mosque which is in fact the former Marinid Madrasa of Fes el-Jdid, modified and provided with a minaret when Moulay Hassan created this mechouar. The Grand Mosque of Fes el-Jdid, to which it was originally associated, is located just outside the royal palace grounds to the north of here. To the west and south of these mechouars was the area which was historically the private residence of the sultan. It consists of a number of patio courtyards, inner gardens, residential pavilions, and other structures. One of the largest elements is the Patio of Moulay Rashid, created in the 17th century. It covers a large rectangular area on the east side of the palace and is centered around a rectangular water basin. Further southwest from these central structures is a large park or garden known as the Lalla Mina Gardens. The gardens, along with a mosque near its northeastern corner (not far from the present-day palace gates and marked with a minaret), were created by Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman in the 19th century on the site of the former \\"Agdal\\" gardens of the Marinid period. They are adjoined to the north by another palace pavilion and courtyard created by Moulay Abdelaziz (1894–1908). At their eastern corner, on the south side of the Lalla Mina Mosque, is a large square courtyard which was once the menagerie of the palace, holding lions and other wild animals, but is now adjoined by the new main gates of the palace. Along the western edge of the gardens runs a set of double fortified walls which were the original Marinid western walls of Fes el-Jdid, as well as the original western gate known as Bab Agdal. Beyond these, further west and covering an even larger area, are the current Agdal Gardens which were originally established by Sultan Moulay Hassan.

In the mid-1930s he played in NBC radio ensembles and worked with Wingy Manone, and in 1939 joined Muggsy Spanier's Ragtimers band. The group soon split, after which he played with Charlie Spivak, Brad Gowans, Eddie Condon, Miff Mole, and Joe Marsala. He played extensively on radio with several of these ensembles. He was also a prolific session bassist, recording with Wild Bill Davison, Bobby Hackett, Cliff Jackson, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Edwards, Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, Georg Brunis, George Wettling, Ralph Sutton, Joe Sullivan, and Boyce Brown in the 1940s and 1950s.

Early life and family Born in Lower Hutt on 8 April 1943, Tate was the son of Dudley Tate and Hazel Winifred Tate (née Jackson-Hughes). He was educated at Hutt Valley High School from 1956. Scientific career Tate studied chemistry at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating BSc in 1964, and MSc the following year. His master's thesis was titled A study of the dealdolisation of diacetone alcohol. Tate then completed a PhD on decarboxylation kinetics and mechanisms under Robert Walker Hay at Victoria, before moving to Soil Bureau, a branch of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in the Hutt Valley. In 1992, DSIR was dissolved and Soil Bureau became Landcare Research, a Crown Research Institute, and he moved with it to Palmerston North, on the campus of Massey University. Much of Tate's early research involved the storage and cycling of phosphorus and carbon in soils, particularly in economically important New Zealand grasslands and native forests. Later work focused on carbon cycling an sequestration, particularly as climate change became an issue and the question of how soils and soil biota could impact atmospheric carbon dioxide levels became relevant. Tate also contributed his soil chemistry knowledge to other research topics at Soil Bureau / Landcare, including sand dune rehabilitation, restoration of pasture after topsoil removal and understanding tussock grasslands. Many papers were coauthored with people including Des J. Ross, C.W. Feltham, Benny K.G. Theng, R.H. Newman, Neal A. Scott, Surinder Saggar, Paul C.D. Newton, Troy Baisden, Aroon Parshotam, David A. Wardle and Gregor W. Yeates. Retirement in 2005 did not stop Tate working on his science. One of his last works was editing Microbial Biomass, a 2017 volume on soil and ecosystem microbial processes. Tate died in Palmerston North on 22 January 2018. Honours and awards In 1995, Tate was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the peak science organisation in New Zealand. He was also elected to fellowships of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry and the New Zealand Society of Soil Science.

The ceremony marked the first time that memorial events to commemorate the genocide had taken place in Piraeus. The monument was funded by businessman Evangelos Marinakis. The Pontic Genocide was an atrocity carried out by the Turkish government, it was committed alongside the Armenian and Assyrian genocides. An estimated 353,000 Greek lives were lost as a result of the Pontic genocide. Evangelos Marinakis has said that one of the reasons the monument was such an important project for him to contribute to, is because his mother, Irene Karakatsani, is a descendant of the Ypsilantis family, whose ancestors played a central role in the Greek War of Independence. The three-dimensional sculpture is 15.50 metres long and 7.10 metres high. It is made of stainless steel and has brass details.

Overview Verge3D enables users to convert content from 3D modeling tools (Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender are currently supported) for viewing in a web browser. Verge3D was created by the same core group of software engineers that previously created the Blend4Web framework. Features Verge3D uses WebGL for rendering. It incorporates components of the Three.js library and exposes its API to application developers. ; Puzzles : Application functionality can be added via JavaScript, either by writing code directly or by using Puzzles, Verge3D’s visual programming environment based on Google Blockly. Puzzles is aimed primarily at non-programmers allowing quick creation of interactive scenarios in a drag-and-drop fashion. ; App Manager and web publishing : App Manager is a lightweight web-based tool for creating, managing and publishing Verge3D projects, running on top of the local development server. Verge3D Network service integrated in the App Manager allows for publishing Verge3D applications via Amazon S3 and EC2 cloud services. ; PBR : For purposes of authoring materials, a glTF 2.0-compliant physically based rendering pipeline is offered alongside with the standard shader-based approach. PBR textures can be authored using external texturing software such as Substance Painter for which Verge3D offers the corresponding export preset. Besides the glTF 2.0 model, Verge3D supports physical materials of 3ds Max (with Autodesk Raytracer as reference), and Blender 2.80's real- time Eevee materials. ; glTF and DCC software integration : Verge3D integrates directly with Blender and Autodesk 3ds Max, enabling users to create 3D geometry, materials and animations inside the software, then export them in the JSON-based glTF format. The Sneak Preview feature allows for exporting and viewing scenes from the DCC tool environment. ; Facebook 3D posts : For Facebook publishing, Verge3D offers a specific GLB export option. The exported GLB files are displayed and can be opened in the App Manager. ; Asset compression : Exported files can optionally use LZMA compression, resulting in a reduction in file size of up to 6x. ; UI and website layouts : Interface layouts, created using external WYSIWYG editors, can be linked with Puzzles to trigger changes to a 3D scene being rendered in the browser and vice versa. ; Animation : Verge3D supports skeletal animation, including animation of bipeds and character rigs, and allows for animation of material parameters. Model parts can also be set up to be dragged by the user. ; Physics : The physics module can be linked separately to enable collision detection, dynamically moving objects, support for characters and vehicles, springs, ropes and cloth simulation. As of version 2.11, simple physics simulations can be created and controlled without coding via Puzzles, the visual programming system used by Verge3D. ; AR/VR : The 2.10 update added support for WebXR, an in-development open technology designed to enable virtual reality and augmented reality experiences to be displayed in web browsers. It works with both headsets with controllers, like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, and those without, like Google Cardboard. AR/VR experiences can enabled via Puzzles or JavaScript. Workflow Verge3D's workflow differs substantially from other mainstream WebGL frameworks. Development of a new Verge3D application is usually started from modeling, texturing and animating 3D objects. The models are assembled in a 3D scene within a single *.max or *.blend file. This file is then used as a basis for a Verge3D project initialized from the App Manager. An interactive scenario is optionally added using the Puzzles editor overlay. A Verge3D application can be previewed in the web browser at any development stage using the App Manager. The finished web application can be deployed on the Verge3D Network, on Facebook or on the user's website. Experience Curiosity  Notable uses  NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory used Verge3D to create an interactive 3D visualization of the Mars InSight lander. The web application allows for exploring and interacting with the real-time model of the spacecraft, with the possibility to move different parts and unfurl the solar panels. NASA's older interactive web application Experience Curiosity was ported to Verge3D from Blend4Web. The application makes it possible to operate the rover, control its cameras and the robotic arm and reproduces some of the prominent events of the Mars Science Laboratory mission.

He is known for the publication Musicalisches Gesang-Buch, a collection of sacred songs to which Johann Sebastian Bach contributed. Born in Herzberg, Schemelli was from 1695 to 1700 a student at the Thomasschule in Leipzig. From 1707, he held the position of church musician in Treuenbrietzen. From 1727 he was Hofkantor at the court of Zeitz, retiring in 1758. He died in Zeitz. Musicalisches Gesang-Buch In 1736, Schemelli published in Leipzig his Musicalisches Gesang-Buch (Musical song book), also known as Schemellis Gesangbuch, a collection of 954 sacred songs with texts in the tradition of pietism, and probably intended for private contemplation. Only 69 of the songs come with music, a melody and a bass line. The melodies are often like simple arias, rather than like chorales. Bach contributed to the collection, but musicologists debate to what extent. Schemelli's son Christian Friedrich was a student of the Thomasschule from 1733 to 1735, and later studied at the Leipzig University, which explains the contact. In the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV), numbers 439 to 507 list songs from the Gesangbuch, but his authorship is certain only for three of them, \\"Dir, dir Jehovah, will ich singen\\", BWV 452, \\"Komm, süßer Tod\\", BWV 478, and \\"Vergiss mein nicht, vergiss mein nicht\\", BWV 505.

Set entirely on computer screens and smartphones, the film follows a father (John Cho) trying to find his missing 16-year-old daughter (Michelle La) with the help of a police detective (Debra Messing). It is the first mainstream Hollywood thriller headlined by an Asian-American actor. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 31, 2018, by Screen Gems. The film was a financial and critical success, grossing over $75 million worldwide against a $880,000 budget and receiving praise for its direction, acting, unique visual presentation and unpredictable storyline. At the Independent Spirit Awards, Cho was nominated for Best Male Lead. Plot In San Jose, California, David Kim is shown looking through photographs and videos of his daughter Margot and his wife Pamela at various times in Margot's childhood as a happy, close family. Pamela was diagnosed with lymphoma and died right before Margot enters high school. One night, Margot goes to a friend's house for a study group. While David sleeps, Margot attempts to call him three times. The next morning, David is unable to find Margot but assumes she has risen early to go to school. Later, he calls Margot's piano instructor but is informed that Margot cancelled her lessons six months prior. David discovers that Margot was pocketing the money for the lessons and transferred it to a now-deleted Venmo account. Realizing that Margot is missing, David calls the police. The case is assigned to Detective Rosemary Vick, who asks for information about Margot's personality and friendships. David manages to access Margot's accounts, including Facebook, and speaks to her contacts, but he learns that Margot had become a loner since Pamela's death. Vick calls to report that Margot made a fake ID for herself and shows traffic-camera footage of Margot's car at a highway junction outside of the city, suggesting that Margot may have run away. David, unconvinced, discovers that Margot was using a live streaming site called YouCast and that she frequently spoke to a young woman called \\"fish_n_chips\\". Vick investigates this and reports back that fish_n_chips is innocent, having been sighted in Pittsburgh at the time of the disappearance. From Margot's Tumblr account, David finds that Margot frequently visited Barbosa Lake, which is near the highway juncture where she was last seen. He drives to the lake and finds Margot's Pokémon keychain on the ground. The police arrive and locate Margot's car underwater. Margot's body is not inside, but there is an envelope in the glove box containing the piano lesson money. A sweep of the surrounding area is conducted by the police and volunteers, but a thunderstorm slows progress. Margot's body is not found. When a boy who knew Margot claims online that she is with him, David tracks him down and attacks him, whereupon Vick forbids him to further investigate her disappearance. However, David visits a site which displays the crime-scene photographs and notices his brother Peter's jacket inside. He then discovers text messages between Margot and Peter, hinting that they might have had an incestuous relationship. When David confronts Peter at his house, the latter explains that they were only smoking marijuana and confiding in each other, and he chastises David for failing to notice that his daughter was depressed. During this confrontation, Vick calls David. She tells him that an ex-convict named Randy Cartoff confessed in an online video to raping and killing Margot, then committed suicide. An empty-casket funeral is arranged for Margot. As David is uploading photographs to a funeral streaming service, he notices that the website's stock photograph features the same woman as fish_n_chips’s profile- picture. David contacts the woman and discovers that she is a stock model who does not know Margot and that the police never called her. Attempting to report this to Vick, David instead reaches a dispatcher who reveals that Vick volunteered to take the case and was not assigned to it as she claimed. David googles Vick and finds that she knew Cartoff through a volunteer program for ex-convicts. He reports this to the sheriff, and at the funeral, Vick is arrested. A few days later, Vick has agreed to confess to murder and other crimes in exchange for leniency for her son Robert, who was using the online identity fish_n_chips to get close to Margot because he had a crush on her. Margot sent Robert the money thinking that Robert was a working-class girl whose mother was in the hospital. Robert felt guilty and wanted to give the money back; he decided to do so at the lake. When Robert surprised Margot by getting into her car while she was smoking marijuana, she ran, and in the ensuing scuffle Robert accidentally pushed Margot off a cliff into a 50-foot- deep ravine. Vick decided to cover up the incident, pushing the car into the lake, creating the false fake ID and the fish_n_chips alibi as a waitress in Pittsburgh. When David found the car, proving that Margot could not have run away, Vick turned Cartoff into a fall guy and killed him. The film then goes back to Vick right after being arrested. As she is being transported into custody, David asks her where Margot's body is, and Vick tells him that Margot's body is in the ravine but that even if she had survived the fall, she could not have lived five days without water. David tells the police to turn the car around, pointing out that the storm occurred on the third day of the search, which would have provided Margot with water. At the ravine, the rescue crew discovers Margot severely injured but alive. Two years later, Margot is shown to have applied for college to major in piano, with her acceptance status as pending. Through texts, David tells Margot that Pamela would have been proud of her, something he neglected to do at the start of the film.

When Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian pitched the concept to The Bazelevs Company, they declined their offer to make it a short and instead gave them the offer to make it into a feature film. While Ohanian was open to the offer and saw its potential, Chaganty was hesitant since he believed a feature film would be stretching the concept and feel too gimmicky. But after coming up with the intro, they felt like the concept for the film would work. The character, Rosemary Vick, was named after Rosemary's Baby and The Shields character Vic Mackey. Actor John Cho turned down the role of David Kim at first because he felt that the film would not be doable. The film was shot over various devices. These include GoPro, Drone (unmanned aerial vehicle), news helicopters, mini dv cameras, webcam, and even director Aneesh Chaganty's iPhone, which became the main camera. The scenes between Cho's David Kim and Debra Messing's Rosemary Vick were all shot in one house, with Cho on one side of the house and Messing at the other. Actress Michelle La described the filming process as a \\"logistical nightmare\\". Release The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2018. Shortly after, Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquired distribution rights to the film for $5 million. It was initially scheduled to be released on August 3, 2018, but was pushed back to a limited release on August 24, 2018, before opening wide on August 31, 2018. Reception=Box office= Searching grossed $26 million in the United States and Canada, and $49.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $75.5 million. Searching debuted to $388,769 from nine theaters in its limited opening weekend, for a per-venue average of $43,197. It expanded to 1,207 theaters on August 31, and was projected to gross $3 million over the weekend. It ended up making $6.1 million (including $7.6 million over the four-day Labor Day frame), finishing fourth at the box office. In its second weekend of wide release, the film was added to an additional 802 theaters, and grossed $4.5 million, finishing fifth. It then made another $3.2 million in its third week of wide release. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 247 reviews, with an average rating of 7.49/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Searchings timely premise and original execution are further bolstered by well-rounded characters brought to life by a talented cast.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 78% overall positive score. Varietys Peter Debruge called the film \\"so unique in its approach that Sundance can only program something of its kind once before the gimmick gets old.\\" Kate Erbland of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \\"B+\\" and called it \\"a true storytelling feat, married with sharp editing that makes the entire effort not only seamless, but also wholly intuitive,\\" also saying, \\"Aneesh Chaganty's drama transcends its gimmick, offering up a smart and refreshing spin on movies that literally play out on small screens.\\" Screen Rants Chris Agar gave the film four out of five stars, and summed it up as \\"a suspenseful drama, buoyed by its innovative film making style and collection of strong performances by its leads.\\" He added, \\"Even if Searching didn't make effective use of its technology angle, the core story would still work due to Chaganty's script, which packs an emotional punch from its first moments and never holds back.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film four out of five stars and wrote \\"director Aneesh Chaganty, in an exceptional feature debut, does the impossible, building a high-voltage, white-knuckle thriller told almost exclusively through smartphones, laptop screens, browser windows and surveillance footage. Searching is a technical marvel with a beating heart at its core, which makes all the difference\\". Aisha Harris of The New York Times wrote, \\"While a somewhat silly reveal in the final act feels ripped from a Law & Order episode, the combination of clever concept reflecting the prevalence of screens in everyday life, and the pleasure of watching a typically underused Mr. Cho take on a meaty lead role make Searching a satisfying psychological thriller.\\" News18 Indias Rajeev Masand gave the film 4/5 stars and stated, \\"it's difficult to talk about the plot in any detail for fear of ruining the tension and its multiple twists,\\" though \\"Chaganty has elevated a standard missing-person drama into something quite extraordinary on the strength of his inventive storytelling...\\" Mihir Fadnavis of Firstpost wrote, \\"this is a very exciting film that needs to be seen on the big screen and one that seems like an avenue into what the future of cinema could be...Searching has created some sort of a blueprint to make more films like this more easily at a much faster pace.\\" Potential sequel On August 14, 2019, a sequel was announced to be in development.

It first flew in 1933 and was later re-engined, serving an aeroclub until the invasion of Poland. Design and development The WK.3 was the second of Władysław Kozłowski's designs to be built. It was intended as an aeroclub basic trainer, strong, safe and easy to fly, comfortable and easy to maintain. He built it along with his friend Ludwik Antonowicz, who provided both constructional and financial assistance. They began in June 1932 and had completed the airframe by the following spring. No suitable modern engine was available but Warsaw Aeroclub provided them with an old, Anzani seven-cylinder radial engine. The first flight was on 26 June 1933, piloted by Ignacy Giedgowd. He and two other pilots carried out the initial tests, flying the WK.3 for 163 minutes. They reported good handling with short take-off and landing runs. The WK.3 was a biplane with wooden structure throughout. The constant chord wings were each built around twin spars, covered with plywood around the leading edge and with fabric elsewhere. The upper wing had a centre-section mounted high above the fuselage on N-form cabane struts and outer panels which were swept at 8° to improve cockpit access and fields of view. The lower wing was unswept. Upper and lower wings were braced together with a pair of parallel interplane struts on each side and both had 4° of dihedral. The ailerons were on the lower wing. Behind the Anzani engine the fuselage had ply covering over a rectangular- section frame. The tandem cockpits shared a single opening and had dual controls. The fabric-covered horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage and the vertical surfaces were ply-covered. The fin, with a straight swept leading edge and blunt top, mounted a blunted rectangular rudder. The WK.3 had a simple, fixed and conventional undercarriage. V-struts on either side from the lower longerons supported the mainwheels on a rubber cord damped single axle. Operational history It was later re-engined with a more modern, Polish built upright, four-cylinder, air-cooled inline PZInż FS-II, which produced and lengthened the nose by .

He is noted for being first professional organ builder in the United States and for building the first church organ in North America. He taught the renowned organ builder David Tannenberg the trade. Clemm concentrated on building and repairing church organs for the nascent Moravian Church in North America.  Early life and education  Johann Gottlob Klemm was born in a village near Dresden, Germany, in 1690. He was the son of an organist, organ builder, and schoolmaster. He took up theology studies at the Universities of Freiberg when he was fifteen years old for two years. In 1709 he went to the University at Leipzig. Early career He decided against ministry and returned to Dresden in 1710 to take up a career in instrument building. Clemm learned the trade as a keyboard instrument builder and organ builder in Dresden from Andreas Silbermann and his brother Gottfried Silbermann. He developed a friendship with Moravian leader Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf and built a harpsichord for him. In 1726 he joined the Moravian Church and moved to Herrnhut on the estate of Zinzendorf. Clemm was in attendance at the communion service on August 13, 1727. He was a group leader who taught boys and led services. Clemm followed the Moravian ways for some years, but ultimately became disillusioned with Zinzendorf's leadership around 1730. The squabble was over doctrine and distrust of pious people. Clemm and his family remained in the community of Herrnhut for a few more years until they emigrated to America in 1733 with the Schwenkfelder family. North America Clemm settled in Philadelphia in 1736 and lived as a Separatist. He constructed organs and keyboard instruments for churches of the Moravians in America. He dropped his German name he was born with, Johann Gottlob Klemm, and anglicized his name as John Clemm. Clemm moved to New York City in 1737. He proposed a Schema for a large organ for Trinity Church in 1738. It was approved and he started construction of the organ in 1739. He finished it in 1741 and was paid the final payment then. It was the first church organ built in America. Clemm returned to Pennsylvania in 1747. There he repaired and built organs in the Bethlehem area for the Moravians and assisted Gustavus Hesselius. In the spring of 1748 Clemm moved with the Tannenberg family to Nazareth, Pennsylvania. He started at that time teaching David Tannenberg organ building techniques. Together they built five organs for the Moravians. Clemm was America's first professional organ builder. Late in his life Clemm dictated an autobiographical memoir, which was edited anonymously. He became gravely ill at Bethlehem on May 2, 1762, and died on May 5 at the age of 72.

It first originated in Bishnupur, the town of Bankura District. In the 16th century, Bir Hambir, the king of Bishnupur, invented this card. There are ten avatars of Bishnu in the cards. It is a unique example of Bengal’s folk art.  Origin  In 1592, Bir Hambir became king of Bishnupur. He had a great relationship with Akbar, so, a lot of times he went to Akbar's court. Seeing the playing of cards he was surprised. Coming to his kingdom, he thought of creating a new card in God- goddess of uniqueness. According to his directive, artist from Bishnupur, Kartik Faujdar, made the Dashabatar Cards. kings of Mallabhum play this card at leisure for entertaining. However, Indian scholar Haraprasad Shastri said that this game first originated in the 8th century. In 1895 he said in the Asiatic society's journal: > ...I fully believe that the game was invented about eleven or twelve hundred > years before the present date. Because the placement of Jagannath (Buddha) is in the 5th position in Dashabatar card, but in common belief, Jagannath is in the 9th position. Prabhat Kumar Saha, an expert on Dashavatar cards, said: \\"Malla dynasty ruled from about 12th century AD to 1622\\". He confirmed that the Foujdars were the only makers of these cards in Bengal.  Method  The artists from the Faujdar family of Bishnupur specialise in making these cards. At first, a piece of cloth is folded a number of times. Then glue is pasted, made from tamarind seeds. After drying this, a layer of chalk dust is applied on the cards. Both sides are evened out with a smooth stone. The cards are then cut into round shapes of a 4.5-inch radius. Various deities and their symbols are painted on these using various colours. On the reverse part, a layer of lac and vermillion is applied.  Cards  Dashavatar cards are the 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu - Matsya, Kurma, Baraha, Nrisingha, Buddha (Jagannath), Baaman, Ram, Balaram, Parshuram and Kalki are drawn on these cards. The Dashavatar card game is a complicated one. It is played using 120 cards with numerous rules and regulations. Sital Fouzdar claims to be the 87th generation of artisans.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History Townsend North House c. 1883 Townsend North was born in 1814 in Ulster County, New York. In 1835, his family moved to Washtenaw County, Michigan, where North and his father established a construction contracting company which, among other things, built the first dormitory on the University of Michigan's campus. North's father retired in 1839, but Townsend North continued in the contracting business until 1845, when he moved to Flint. There, he became part of a venture to construct a bridge across the Cass River at Bridgeport; his payment for his contribution was 3000 acres of land, to be located in any portion of Michigan. North chose this location in Tuscola County, and established the town of Vassar. North lived in Vassar and contributed to the economy of the town. He established the first sawmill in 1849, selling it in 1865. He founded a woolen mill in 1867, and by 1875 opened the first bank in Vassar and the first successful general store. He also held public office, ranging from serving as the Tuscola County Register of Deeds in 1850 to serving as State Senator from 1874 to 1875. In 1865, North constructed a house at this location, on a high bluff overlooking Vassar. In 1880, he refurbished and expanded the house into this stylish mansion. The house had the first central heating system in the town, as well as its own hot and cold water system. Townsend North died in 1889. The house is currently owned and occupied by Roger and Pat Goggans. Description The Townsend North House is a 2-1/2-story L-shaped Eastlake structure with asymmetrical massing, clad in clapboard. The facade dominated by an narrow, ornate center tower, located in the center of the L, with a steeply sloped hip roof. To the left of the tower is a two-story, two-bay section capped by a gable roof with the eavesline to the front. To the right of the tower is another two-story, two-bay section capped by a gable roof, but with the gable end to the front. Gables are clad with vertical boards. Shutters cover the four bay windows. Two front porches haves paired support columns and heavy cornices. On the interior, the house has hardwood woodwook of cherry, walnut, and oak. Etched glass is used throughout for decoration, with a particularly fine example on the front door. Doorframes are elaborately carved, with fine Eastlake detail. In the master bedroom, the fireplace surround displays the ornate carving, and an ornately crafted mirror surround is located above the fireplace.

Biology  Schizopilia fissicollis is a neotropical cockroach species that lives on and under loose bark of trunks of dead trees. Its flattened body structure allow it to live in crevices and narrow places under (partially) loose bark. It also protects them from predators like ants. By adhering firmly to the underground, the extensions at the tergum are pushed on the substrate, allowing no room for ants and minimizing the attack surface. Adults have large rounded wings that extend over the abdomen. The eyes are rather small, directed frontal and lateral with a more or less translucent area in the pronotum above the eyes. The upper side of the body (pronotum, mesothorax and metathorax and abdomen) of the nymphs is covered with tubercles, giving it a rough appearance. In adults, the pronotum is smooth and shining and the lateral posterior edges of the pronotum are bifurcated, resulting in two lobes. Nymph hiding on a leave The flattened body shape. Top view of a nymph. Notice that nymphs do not have the extensions at the pronotum like the adults do.  Reproduction  Like other members of the family Zetoborinae, Schizopilia fissicollis is an ovoviviparous cockroach. Eggs are kept inside the abdomen of the mother until they hatch. It's not known if Schizopilia fissicollis exhibits social interactions between mother and offspring or between siblings, as described in some related Zetoborinae cockroaches.

The geology of Ethiopia includes rocks of the Neoproterozoic East African Orogeny, Jurassic marine sediments and Quaternary rift-related volcanism. Events that greatly shaped Ethiopian geology is the assembly and break-up of Gondwana and the present-day rifting of Africa. Rocks formed by the East African Orogeny 880 to 550 million years ago make up the oldest geological units in Ethiopia. The orogeny caused the closure of the ancient Mozambique Ocean. Rocks of Ethiopia formed concurrently with the Mozambique Belt and the Arabian-Nubian Shield forming a large north-south (predent-day coordinates) mountain chain called the Transgondwanan Supermountain. Erosion of this mountain may have played a role in triggering the Cambrian explosion. Erosion of the orogen and mountain was such that by the early Paleozoic a planation surface extended across Ethiopia. Sedimentary rocks of Ordovician age cover this surface making it largely an unconformity. At parts the unconformity of the Precambrian basement has glacial striations, rôche moutonnées and chatter marks formed likely during the Karoo Ice Age. The Paleozoic sedimentary cover above the unconformity is of fluvial and glacial origin (Enticho Sandstone, Edaga Arbi Glacials). Early Jurassic marine sediments cover much of the older sediments including a planation surface of Triassic age. These sediments deposited as result of a regional marine transgression swept over the Horn of Africa during the initial break-up of Gondwana. Resultant rocks include sandstone, limestone, shale, marls and evaporites (Adigrat Sandstone, Antalo Limestone, Amba Aradam Formation). A third major plantion surface and unformity formed in the following a tectonic event in the Early Cretaceous that tilted carbonates in the Tigray and Dire Dawa-Harar areas. On top of this surface lies a series a fluvial sediments. Depositions of marine sediments continued in eastern Ethiopia's Ogaden basin until the Eocene. The Ethiopia-Yemen Continental Flood Basalts or Ethiopian traps that cover much of Ethiopia flowed over both irregular surfaces and peneplains preserving laterite soil beneath. The flood basalts covered initially a much larger area (>750,000 km2) just after eruption about 30 million years ago in the Oligocene with volumes reaching 350,000 km3 (Ashangi Basalts, Alaji Basalts). Since then erosion has reduced areal extent and volumes. The modern pattern of volcanism concentrated to the Afar Depression and the Main Ethiopian Rift begun in Late Miocene time. The area of modern volcanism contains the bulk of Ethiopias geothermal energy resources.

She ran a salon in Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in Paris, until 1934 when she retired. Biography Three dresses sketched by Augusta Bernard Born in Provence in 1886, Bernard began her career as a dress-maker by copying the designs of other couturiers. After first opening a studio in Biarritz, she moved to Paris in 1922, establishing a studio there the following year. She specialized in creating long, pale- coloured evening dresses, often cut on the bias. In order to achieve asymmetry, the simple, unadorned designs were often put together piecemeal. Bernard became increasingly prominent over the years, especially in the 1930s after the fashionable Marquise de Paris had won the St Moritz fashion competition in the silver lamé evening gown she had designed. Her salon on the luxurious Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré became popular not only with French women interested in haute couture but also with Americans. In 1932, Vogue featured a photograph of one of her neoclassical evening dresses, which had been selected as the most beautiful dress of the year. One of her most prestigious dresses and one of her very last is an ivory tulle gown she created in the autumn of 1934, considered by Patricia Mears, deputy director of The Museum at FIT, to be her magnum opus. With the onset of the Great Depression, her clients found it increasingly difficult to pay their bills. As a result, she closed her salon in 1934 and retired. She died in 1946.

Orbit and classification  is a member of the dynamical Amor group of near-Earth asteroids, and therefore does not currently cross Earth's orbit. The asteroid's closest approach to the Sun is just outside Earth's farthest distance from the Sun. When the asteroid has a perihelion point less than 1.017 AU (Earth's aphelion), it is classified an Apollo asteroid. This asteroid's category flips back and forth as time passes, due to minor perturbations of its orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–3.7 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,344 days; semi-major axis of 2.38 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.57 and an inclination of ° with respect to the ecliptic. With its sufficiently large aphelion, this asteroid is also classified as a Mars-crosser, crossing the orbit of Mars at 1.66 AU. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery published by the Digitized Sky Survey taken at the Siding Spring Observatory in June 1986, more than 12 years prior to its official discovery observation at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii. = Close approaches = With an absolute magnitude of approximately 15.8, is one of the brightest and presumably largest-known potentially hazardous asteroids (see PHA-list).

She later became involved with mainstream politics (Centre Party), sitting as a member of the Prussian parliament (\\"Landtag\\") between 1924 and its abolition in 1933.Ernst Kienast (Ed.): Handbuch für den Preußischen Landtag. Ausgabe für die 3. Wahlperiode. R. v. Decker's Verlag (G. Schenck), Berlin 1928. p. 500.  Life = Provenance and early years = Albertine Badenberg was born in Steele, at that time a manufacturing town outside Essen (into which it has subsequently been subsumed), at the heart of the rapidly industrialising Ruhr region. Albert Badenberg (1831-1888), her father, was an architect and land surveyor. Her mother, Auguste (1838-1922), came from a family of Viennese minor aristocrats. Albertine left her girls' school when she was fifteen and spent the next two years in Belgium and England in order to learn French and English. She then attended a (single sex) teacher training college in Koblenz, passing her final exams in 1885, which qualified her to teach at middle and senior schools (for girls). In 1886 she accepted a teaching position locally in Steele and in 1887 she accepted the headship of the German School in Genoa. The sudden death of her father in March 1888 put an end to her career and travel plans, however, and she returned to Germany, finding herself at the age of 22 responsible not just for supporting herself, but also for her widowed (and thereby impoverished) mother and six younger siblings. = Feminism in a Catholic context = Badenberg had already joined the recently formed Association of Catholic Women Teachers (\\"Verein katholischer deutscher Lehrerinnen\\" / VkdL), and on returning from Italy she engaged actively with it. In 1894 she set up a job placement service and in 1896 a legal advice service for members. She campaigned for legal and financial equality with male teachers. She joined the VkdL executive committee in 1898. Her proposal as to how the association could acquire a more prominent public profile resulted in the launch in 1900 of \\"Christliche Frau\\" (\\"Christian Women\\"), a news-magazine and a mouth-piece of the Catholic women's movement. In the teeth of opposition from other parts of the catholic mainstream, in 1906 Badenberg played an important part in the founding of the German Catholic Women's Association. She became a member of its national executive and in 1909 founded a branch association in her home town, Steele. In 1910 she took over national responsibility for the KDFB's treasury function. In 1917 she absented herself from her teaching work in order to work full time for the KDFB as its General Secretary till 1921. That year she returned to teaching, becoming a deputy school head in 1922. = After the war = Naturally as a leading figure within the KDFB, Albertine Badenberg backed votes for women, but during the war years the topic was off the political agenda. Another organisation with close connections to the Catholic Church in Germany was the Centre Party, within which there were strong opinions on both side of the enfranchisement argument: formally the party tended to remain silent on the topic. However, in the aftermath of national military defeat and the emperor's abdication new constitutional arrangements became unavoidable in 1918, and the provisional government published a declaration that all future elections to public bodies would take place using a system of secret ballots and proportional representation, open to all persons aged at least 20, whether male or female. The \\"votes for women\\" debate thereby ended suddenly, and before there had been time for it to resurface. The Centre Party immediately approached the KDFB, calling for co-operation. One upshot was that the KDFB took on responsibility for the \\"political education of women\\" on behalf of the party. More generally, in the feverish political year that followed, the two were closely co-ordinated in their campaigning. = Prussian politics = At some stage Albertine Badenberg joined the Centre Party, becoming a member of the regional party executive, the district party executive and the local party executive. In December 1924 she was elected a member of the Prussian parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), representing the Düsseldorf-East electoral district, and taking a special interest in wages issues. The Landtag had been dissolved, along with other democratic institutions, by the time Albertine Badenberg celebrated her 68th birthday in December 1933. = Later years = There are suggestions that during the Hitler years Badenberg was in touch with opposition circles as the outreach of the Catholic associations became ever more constrained by the authorities. The Association of Catholic Women Teachers (VkdL) closed down in 1937 after the Gestapo confiscated its head office premises in Berlin-Steglitz. After 1945 she involved herself in helping to refound the VkdL, and remained engaged when in 1949 it was able to establish itself in a new head office in Essen. 1949 was also the year in which she undertook a pilgrimage to Assisi.
