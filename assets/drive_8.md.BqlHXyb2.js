It is sometimes referred to as the Habsburg–Ottoman War or the Austro-Ottoman War. War aims The war began as a Russian-Turkish conflict. The Russian Empire, headed by Catherine the Great, had been involved in previous wars of conquest against the Ottomans, and the two nations were openly hostile. In August 1787, after \\"numerous Russian provocations\\" (Hochedlinger), the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Russians.Hochedlinger (2003:382) The Austrian Emperor Joseph II had concluded an alliance with the Russians in 1781, which (Hochedlinger) \\"obliged [him] to assist the Russians with his full might ... Vienna felt that it had to act promptly so as not to annoy the [Empress]. What Joseph had to make sure this time was that Austria did not come away empty- handed again, as over the Crimea in 1783–84.\\" In fact, Joseph was facing a serious threat to his rule in a distant portion of his empire, in what is now Belgium; as well as long-term tensions with a powerful northerly neighbor, Prussia. Hochedlinger opines that \\"war could not have come at a more inopportune moment.\\" Hochedlinger also judges the Turks also made a mistake in starting the war themselves. From the Russian point of view, \\"the conflict could now be presented to the European public as a defensive war against an aggressor. Turkish aggression also made it much more difficult for France to continue its traditional role as the Sultan's protector against Russian rapacity\\". Fighting Clash between Russo-Austrian and Turkish troops in the Battle of Rymnik The Austrians entered the war in February 1788, though they had by now lost their best chance for an easy victory. The slow preparations of Russia resulted in the Ottoman concentration on Belgrade. The Austrians relied on Russian support in Moldavia, which only began in late 1788, and Joseph II seemed to have been reluctant to fight the Ottomans. In July, the Ottomans crossed the Danube and broke into the Austrian Banat. Shortage of supplies struck both sides, while disease struck the Austrian soldiers. As many as 50,000 Serb refugees flooded across the Danube, causing logistical problems for the Austrians. In mid-August, Joseph II dispatched 20,400 soldiers into the Banat. A Serbian Free Corps of 5,000 soldiers had been established in the Banat, composed of refugees that had fled earlier conflicts in the Ottoman Empire. The Corps would fight for liberation of Serbia and unification under Habsburg rule. Later on, the balance shifted toward Austria: the Turks were expelled from parts of Croatia, the Banat, parts of Bosnia, and Belgrade was taken in a three-week campaign by the aging Field Marshal Laudon.Britannica, 11th edition Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788–92) was established. The Austrian army also decisively participated in the victories of Focşani and Rymnik under the overall command of Suvorov, and Josias of Saxe-Coburg conquered Bucharest. Disease At the front, outbreaks of malaria and other diseases played a major role. According to Braunbehrens, in the Austrian army during 1788 there were \\"epidemics: the lazarettos were filled to capacity, half the army was sick, and thousands of soldiers died\\". Joseph II spent most of the war at the front, and was one of those who fell ill there; he ultimately died of his illness after his return home (20 February 1790).Braunbehrens 1990, 311 Outcomes Siege of Belgrade in 1789. Austria restored Belgrade and other captured territories to the Ottomans. Joseph's successor Leopold II was compelled to end the war due to the threat of Prussian intervention in support of the Ottomans.Virginia Aksan, Ottoman Wars: An Empire Besieged, (Taylor & Francis, 2007), 138. In the final negotiated outcome, established in the Treaty of Sistova of 4 August 1791,Jeremy Black, British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783–1793, (Cambridge University Press, 1994), 263. Austria's gains were \\"meagre\\":Encyclopædia Britannica, 1988 Austria returned all the territory from its conquests save the small town of Orsova and a strip of Croatian land near the Bosnian-Croatian borderCharles W. Ingrao, The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618–1815, (Cambridge University Press, 2000), 210. (e.g. Drežnik Grad, Cetin Castle, Donji Lapac, Srb). The Russians won new territory along the Black Sea and forced the Turks to acknowledge previous conquests in the Treaty of Jassy of 9 January 1792. For the Ottomans, the war was a salient event in a long period of national decline (see Stagnation and reform of the Ottoman Empire). Serbia had been under Ottoman rule before the war and was closely fought over, remaining an Ottoman possession after the final treaty settlement. The war was to have important consequences for the future history of Serbia. Rajić writes, > The wars of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries instilled in the Serbian > consciousness the deep-seated expectation that only Austria could lend a > helping hand [i.e., in liberating Serbia from the Ottomans]. This faith was > largely shaken after Kocina Krajina and the last Austro-Turkish War > (1788–1791), when it became clear that despite the Serbs' merits and heavy > casualties in the fight against the Turks, the emperor abandoned them and > made peace with the sultan.

Home front in Austria The war had serious negative effects on the economy of Austria, and derailed progress in creating a modern civil society. Calinger writes: > To have the time and financial resources to establish his domestic reforms, > Joseph II needed stability in foreign affairs. It is a well-tested maxim > that war stops reform. Joseph's predatory foreign policy, however, joined > with that of Catherine II, led to a war against the Ottoman Turks from 1787 > to 1790. This war devastated his domestic economy. The next year the > national debt soared to 22 million gulden, and in 1790 it reached 400 > million. As food prices and taxes rose and a new conscription was > implemented, the mood in Vienna turned ugly. Bread riots erupted after the > bad harvest of 1788/89 and the emperor's popularity plummeted.Calinger > (2003:71) Solomon writes that even \\"the morale of the cultural elite was severely eroded; fears of conscription led many aristocratic families to leave Vienna, and there were widespread feelings of disillusionment with Emperor Joseph, a sense that he had betrayed the promise of an enlightened reform movement.\\"Solomon 1995, 433.

It is commonly applied after pruning, or at locations where the tree bark has been damaged.Juzwik, Jennifer, French, D.W., Jeresek, Jon, Overland Spread of the Oak Wilt Fungus in Minnesota, Journal of Arboriculture 11(11): November 1985 323 Description White tree paint on trees along a road in Hefei, China Tree guard paints are sold as organic and non-organic products. Some gardeners use a light-colored interior latex-based paint diluted with 50% water. Both sunburn and sun scald can cause the tree's bark to crack or die, resulting in additional stress which is compounded by insects and parasites that enter the barkless wood, an invasion that will ultimately shorten the tree's life. Tree paint or whitewash protects against this. Some tree paints, depending on ingredients, also protect against insects and rodents. For example, neem oil has been used by Indian farmers for thousands of years, for many uses, including as a natural insect repellent and insecticide. Plants sprayed with diluted neem oil repel insects, and smothers those who come into contact with it, ultimately killing most insects that ingest the product within 1–3 days. Castor oil, derived from the castor tree seed, gives a coated surface an unpleasant taste to rodents, such as rats, moles, voles, gophers and rabbits that may otherwise gnaw on the tree's bark.http://www.thegardenacademy.com/Organic_Tree_Paint.html Tree paint may help to prevent disease-carrying insects from entering a wounded tree.A Guide to Successful Pruning, Pruning Deciduous Trees Studies have shown that wound dressing must be applied immediately after damage or pruning. Even a delay of three days can be too long. White tree paint is commonly applied to citrus trees to keep the affected tissues from overheating, as dark-colored paint can raise the surface temperature of the treated tissues. The classic tree paint is black, because it is based on an asphalt emulsion. Consumer versions of tree paint may come in spray cans, commercial application may involve paint guns. Tree paint can also applied by brush. An organic tree paint can be made; it is similar to a brushable mud.

It is a solid matter with a melting point of 135 °C. Hexanitroethane is used in some pyrotechnic compositions as a nitrogen-rich oxidizer, e.g. in some decoy flare compositions and some propellants. Like hexanitrobenzene, HNE is investigated as a gas source for explosively pumped gas dynamic laser. A composition of HNE as oxidizer with boron as fuel is being investigated as a new explosive.Compatibility Testing of Hexanitroethane with Boron  Preparation  The first synthesis was described by Wilhelm Will in 1914, using the reaction between the potassium salt of tetranitroethane with nitric acid. :C2(NO2)4K2 + 4 HNO3 → C2(NO2)6 + 2 KNO3 + 2 H2O A practicable method for industrial use starts with furfural, which first undergoes oxidative ring-opening by bromine to mucobromic acid. In the following step, mucobromic acid is reacted with potassium nitrite at just below room temperature to form the dipotassium salt of 2,3,3-trinitropropanal. The final product is obtained by nitration with nitric acid and sulfuric acid at −60 °C. :500px  Properties  The thermal decomposition of hexanitroethane has been detected at 60 °C upwards in both the solid and solution phases. Above 140 °C, this can occur explosively. The decomposition is first order and is significantly faster in solution than in the solid. For the solid, the following reaction can be formulated: :C2(NO2)6 → 3 NO2 + NO + N2O + 2 CO2 For the decomposition is solution, tetranitroethylene is first formed and can be trapped and detected as a Diels–Alder adduct, for example with anthracene or cyclopentadiene. :500px References External links *WebBook page for C2N6O12 Nitroalkanes Explosive chemicals Pyrotechnic oxidizers ","title":"Hexanitroethane"},{"id":"12831566","title":"HLA-DQ7"},{"id":"12831573","text":"Platforms is a railway station in the city of Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, operated by Meitetsu.

A longstanding theory is that a bird carried a notably smaller ancestor across the ocean and dropped it on the islands, as bird mediated dispersal has been documented in other snail species. Alternative theories include that it floating across the ocean on a mat of debris, or that it island hopped across the Pacific in a combination of the theories. Subfamilies in the family Achatinellidae include: * Achatinellinae Gulick, 1873 - synonym: Helicterinae Pease, 1870 (inv.) * Auriculellinae Odhner, 1921 * Elasmatininae Iredale, 1937  tribe Elasmatinini Iredale, 1937 - synonyms: Strobilidae Zilch, 1959 (n.a.); Pitysinae Cooke & Kondo, 1961  tribe Antonellini Cooke & Kondo, 1961  tribe Tubuaiini Cooke & Kondo, 1961 * Pacificellinae Steenberg, 1925  tribe Pacificellini Steenberg, 1925 - synonym: Tornatellinoptini Cooke & Kondo, 1961  tribe Lamellideini Cooke & Kondo, 1961 * Tekoulininae Solem, 1972 * Tornatellidinae Cooke & Kondo, 1961  tribe Tornatellidini Cooke & Kondo, 1961  tribe Tornatellariini Cooke & Kondo, 1961 * Tornatellininae Sykes, 1900  tribe Tornatellinini Sykes, 1900  tribe Elasmiatini Kuroda & Habe, 1949  Anatomy  In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 16 and 25 (according to the values in the table).Barker G.

Sculptors remaining voyages followed the pattern of the first two. She sailed from San Francisco on 3 June, with a section of in tow, and made local cargo voyages in the Southwest Pacific between 15 July and 29 September, before returning to San Francisco on 24 October.

This large dry dock was delivered by the combined efforts of Sculptor, and a sister ship, at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, Philippine Islands, on 13 February 1945. Sculptor then carried cargo between advanced bases until 28 April, and returned to San Francisco on 21 May. On 15 June 1945, the cargo ship left San Diego with two 83' US Coast Guard cutters on deck and a barge in tow. The tow was dropped at Pearl Harbor, and the remainder of the cargo was offloaded at Saipan after arrival on 13 July. The ship returned to San Francisco on 1 September, and began her sixth and last Navy voyage on 29 September. She delivered cargo to Saipan and Guam, and sailed from Guam on 23 December, for the East Coast of the United States. Post-war decommissioning Sculptor arrived at Baltimore, Maryland, on 21 February 1946, and was decommissioned there on 26 February. The ship was redelivered to MARCOM on 8 March, and struck from the Navy List on 12 March 1946. On 15 January 1947, she was sold to the Greek shipping firm P. & V. Pantaleon for $544,506. She was removed from the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia, on 27 January 1947.

The Recent native distribution of Streptaxidae includes South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, Seychelles, Mayotte, Comores, Mauritius, Réunion, Rodrigues, India, Sri Lanka, Andamans, South-East Asia and the Philippines. The genus Gibbulinella is found in the Canary Islands. The species diversity of Streptaxidae reaches its maximum in sub-Saharan Africa. With 13 genera and about 130 nominal species, the second most diverse streptaxid fauna can be found in Southeast Asia. Streptaxidae are the most diverse among tropical Asian carnivorous snails. In Indochina, streptaxid diversity was thought to comprise only 10 genera and about 40 species in 1967. However, in 2006-2016, 21 new species (more than half the previous total) and one new genus had been described from Indochina. Thirty-seven species are recorded from Thailand, 10 from Myanmar, 45 from Vietnam, and 12 from Laos. Description Streptaxids can generally be recognized by their eccentric or cylindrical shells, while the animals have a bright yellow to red or orange body with external hook-like structures on the everted penis. Early classifications of the family such as Wilhelm Kobelt (1905–6), used mainly shell shape and the arrangement of apertural dentition. However, many shell characters are highly conserved or occur recurrently, making some species and genera difficult to separate. The reproductive organs of streptaxids can also be taxonomically significant.  Taxonomy  Prior to Schileyko’s revision in 2000 only two subfamilies, the Streptaxinae and the Enneinae had been recognized, which were primarily based on their shell morphology. = 2005 taxonomy = Only the one family, Streptaxidae, was recognized within the Streptaxoidea in the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005).

It is an independent, quasi-judicial body, established under the Commerce Act 1986. The purpose of the Act is to promote competition in New Zealand's economy. It prohibits conducts that restricts competition (restrictive trade practices) and the purchase of a business's shares or assets if that purchase leads to a substantial lessening of competition in the market. Introduction The Commission is accountable to the Minister of Commerce and Associate Minister of Commerce for its performance. It is intended to be an independent and impartial promoter and enforcer of the law, with a purpose of achieving the best possible outcomes in competitive and regulated markets for the long-term benefit of New Zealanders. The Commission undertakes investigations and where appropriate, takes court action. It considers applications for authorisation in relation to anti-competitive behaviour and mergers. The Commission also enforces pieces of legislation specific to the telecommunications, dairy and electricity industries. Specific roles of the Commerce Commission The Commerce Commission has specific roles under various Acts, as follows: =Fair Trading Act 1986= The Fair Trading Act 1986 was developed with the Commerce Act to encourage competition and to protect consumers from misleading and deceptive conduct and unfair trading practices. The Act applies to all aspects of the promotion and sale of goods and services – from advertising and pricing to sales techniques and finance agreements. The Act also applies to pyramid schemes, and provides for consumer information standards covering country of origin (clothing and footwear labelling, fibre content labelling, care labelling and supplier information notices relating to motor vehicles. The Commission also enforces six product safety standards relating to baby walkers, pedal bicycles, flammability of children’s night clothes, cigarette lighters, household cots and toys for children aged up to three years. =Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001= The Commission has both enforcement and adjudication roles under the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001. The Act provides for the Commission to undertake enforcement action and requires the Commission to issue determinations to resolve disputes between Fonterra and other parties. =Telecommunications Act 2001= The Commission has two primary functions under the Telecommunications Act 2001 that help to ensure broadband and mobile markets are competitive. The first is to regulate certain fixed-line and mobile services by setting the price and/or access terms for that service. The second is to monitor and report on competition, performance and developments in telecommunications markets. The Commission is also responsible for allocating the exact amount telecommunications providers must pay in Government levies each year. =Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003= The Commission assumed responsibility for enforcing the major provisions of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 on 1 April 2005. This Act repealed the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and the Hire Purchase Act 1971, placing obligations on creditors with respect to disclosure requirements; calculation of fees, charges and interest; and oppressive conduct. It also enables consumers to seek reasonable changes to credit contracts on the grounds of unforeseen hardship. The part of the Act which relates to oppressive contracts known as buy-back transactions was enacted on 14 October 2003 and was already enforced by the Commission prior to April 2005. In 2011, former National Finance director and convicted fraudster Trevor Allan Ludlow was the first person to be indefinitely banned by the Commission from working in the consumer finance industry. Cartel leniency policy The Commission has a cartel leniency policy to assist in the investigation of anti-competitive arrangements between competitors that are often secret and difficult to detect. The Commission wishes to encourage those involved in cartel conduct to report the cartel to the Commission. The Commission will grant immunity from Commission-initiated proceedings to the first person involved in a cartel to come forward with information and formally apply for leniency, provided they co-operate fully with the Commission in its investigation and prosecution of the cartel. The leniency policy applies to arrangements between competitors which substantially lessen competition. It does not include conduct which amounts to a company taking advantage of a substantial degree of market power. Regulated industries The Commerce Commission has a role in the regulation of some markets where there is little or no competition. The markets where the Commission is currently involved include: electricity transmission and distribution, gas transmission and distribution, telecommunications, airports and the dairy industry. The Commerce Act Part 4 contains specific provisions for regulation in these markets with a purpose of promoting outcomes that are consistent with outcomes produced in competitive markets such that suppliers of regulated goods or services: * have incentives to innovate and to invest, including in replacement, upgraded, and new assets; and * have incentives to improve efficiency and provide services at a quality that reflects consumer demands; and * share with consumers the benefits of efficiency gains in the supply of the regulated goods or services, including through lower prices; and * are limited in their ability to extract excessive profits =Input methodologies= The Commission defines input methodologies as part of applying regulation on monopoly businesses under Part 4 of the Commerce Act. These input methodologies provide the basis for setting price-quality paths for electricity lines and gas pipelines services, and also how information disclosure requirements will be set for electricity lines, gas pipelines and certain airport services. Commission members The members of the Commerce Commission are appointed by the Governor General, on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. A Telecommunications Commissioner is appointed on the recommendation of the Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media. The Chair of the Commerce Commission is Anna Rawlings, appointed for a three year term in 2019.

This is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. These snails occur in a wide variety of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia.Cuezzo M. G. (2003). \\"Phylogenetic analysis of the Camaenidae (Mollusca: Stylommatophora) with special emphasis on the American taxa\\". Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 138(4): 449-476. . A large American group, which is mainly represented by species from the Caribbean, has, until recently, also been subsumed under the Camaenidae. However, latest molecular phylogenetic studies showed that these species represent a different family, the Pleurodontidae.Wade, C.M., Hudelot, C., Davison, A., Naggs, F., Mordan, P.B. Molecular phylogeny of the helicoid land snails (Pulmonata: Stylommatophora: Helicoidea), with special emphasis on the Camaenidae. Journal of Molluscan Studies 73: 411-415.Bouchet, P., Rocroi, J.P. Classification and Nomenclator of gastropod families. Malacologia 47: 1-397. This molecular study also implies that the Bradybaenidae, currently being treated as a distinct family within the Helicoidea, is a junior synonym of the Camaenidae.  Anatomy  Camaenid shells are often quite large (25–50 mm), but a number of species also have small shells (<5 mm). Shells reveal a remarkable diversity in shape and colour, which is partly linked with their lifestyle. For instance, arboreal species tend to have large and conical shells, whereas terrestrial species often have rather flat shells. The shells of some taxa can be vividly coloured, showing banding or other conspicuous patterns, but others are plain and uniform. This family is defined by a missing diverticulum and a missing stimulatory organ. It is suggested that the family Camaenidae as currently delimited is a polyphyletic taxon. There are no synapomorphies uniting this diverse family. The American group is closely related to the families Helicidae and Helminthoglyptidae, while the Australasian group is a closely related to the Bradybaenidae.Scott B. 1996. Phylogenetic relationships of the Camaenidae (Pulmonata: Stylommatophora: Helicoidea). Journal of Molluscan Studies, 62: 65-73. Abstract In order to retain the Camaenidae as a monophyletic clade, the Neotropical Pleurodontidae will need to be removed as an independent family, and the Bradybaenidae will need to be included. This taxonomic decision is currently pending a formal suggestion and wider acceptance among systematists, however. In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 26 and 30 (according to the values in this table).Barker G. M.: Gastropods on Land: Phylogeny, Diversity and Adaptive Morphology. in Barker G. M. (ed.): The biology of terrestrial molluscs. CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, 2001, . 1-146, cited pages: 139 and 142.  Subfamilies  Division into subfamilies has been suggested, however, given the unresolved relationships on the family level, the subfamilial treatments must be considered hypothetical. They do not reflect the results of comprehensive phylogenetic analyses, and are not corroborated by current molecular data. The following three subfamilies have been recognized in the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) (as based on a suggestion of Alan Solem) *subfamily Camaeninae Pilbry, 1895 - synonyms: Amphidrominae Kobelt, 1902;Kobelt W.

Glenn High School (often shortened to simply John Glenn High School) is a four-year secondary school of about 800 students and 70 faculty members, located in the hamlet of Elwood, Town of Huntington, Long Island, New York. The school serves residents of the Elwood School District.  History  The school was constructed from a combined authorization for building, equipment, grounds and landscaping of $3,640,000, and came in under budget. The architect was Frederick E. Allardt, A.I.A. The school was dedicated on November 17, 1962 after opening to students in September 1962, with Williard J. Adams, President of the Board of Education and James H. Boyd, District Principal laying the cornerstone and Dr. Walter Crewson, Associate Commissioner of Education for the State of New York giving the address: \\"Education for Freedom.\\". The first principal was Dr. Jack Horner. The school is named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, whose historic flight around the earth took place on February 20, 1962 during the construction of the school. The School Board and High School P.T.A. led by Mary Birkel decided on the name. Its first senior class of 72 students graduated in June 1963. The school quickly became known for both its high percentage of students entering college as well as for having a superior sports program, participating as the Elwood Knights in the Suffolk County League B IV.  Athletics  The school has had numerous athletes named as All county and All State in baseball, basketball, football, gymnastics, soccer, volleyball and wrestling. The 1964 baseball team as a B-1 school defeated North Babylon (AA-1)in the playoffs and then Half Hallows Hills in the championship game to win the Suffolk County title and its varsity football team was undefeated (8-0) that same year, only the second year the school fielded a varsity team. Coach Jim Dunn was named 1965 Suffolk Coach of the Year. In 1989, both the baseball and softball teams won the Suffolk County Class B Championship. In basketball, Glenn's boys team won the Long Island and Suffolk County Class A championships in 2014, the Class B Championship in 1987 and 1988 as well as the Long Island Class B Championship in 1988. The girls team won the Suffolk County Class B Championship in 2005, the Suffolk County Class A Championship in 2006 and 2011, the Long Island Class B Championship in 2005, the Long Island Class A Championship in 2006 and the New York State Class B Championship in 2005. Football has remained a successful program at the high school. James Dunn was the coach during the program's first period, guiding the undefeated 1964 team and was named Suffolk County Coach of the Year by Newsday. Dr. Bob Cox took the helm in 1971 coaching the Blue Knights to their first ever conference title in 1972. Tony Cerullo followed continuing the trend, winning conference titles in 1975–77, 1979 and 1984, with a Rutgers Trophy in 1979 to his credit, when he was named Suffolk County Coach of the Year, as well for the best football team in the county. In 2010, the football team won the Suffolk County Championship and its first Long Island Championship. The team was also awarded the Rutgers Trophy for the second time. The 2010 Knights Football team was the only undefeated public high school football team in the 2010 season as they beat Seaford High School in the championship game. In 2011, the football team won its second straight Long Island Class IV Championship by defeating Roosevelt High School. The boys soccer team was dominant in the 1980s and 1990s, winning the Suffolk County Class B Championship in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991 and 1992, the Long Island Class B Championship in 1986, 1987 and 1990, and the New York State Class B Championship in 1986, 1987 and 1990. The girls soccer team won the Suffolk County Class B Championship in 1995 and the Long Island Class B Championship in 1984. The John Glenn girls' volleyball team has achieved outstanding success over the past 2 decades. The Spiders (as they call themselves) have been League Champions for 20 years straight, Suffolk County Class B Champions for 13 years straight also capturing two other county titles for a total of 15. They also have been crowned Long Island Class B Champions for the past 12 years straight sending them onto the State Championships where they took State Class B titles 6 out of the last 10 years. (2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2011, and 2012) The controversy over whether the Glenn Girls' volleyball program should be entitled to call themselves the \\"Spiders\\" rather than the \\"Lady Knights\\" is part of what makes the athletic program at John Glenn unique. Glenn's wrestling team was the Suffolk County Division II champion in 2007 and Suffolk County Division I champion in 2009 and 2010.  Achievements  Each year, members of the senior class achieve SAT scores that rank above the national and state averages. Its students have performed as All-County, All-State and All-Eastern musicians. Many of the school's art students participate in and receive recognition at regional competitions and one student was recognized for his work, at the state level. The number of seniors cited by the National Merit Scholarship Program exceeds the national average. Graduating classes have included a number of National Merit Scholarship finalists, semifinalists, and commended scholars. In addition, 87 percent of the class of 2003 graduated with a New York State Regents diploma, one of the highest percentages on Long Island. Ninety percent of the graduating class continued their education, attending colleges, universities, and technical schools. Courses are reviewed annually and new courses are added to meet changing needs.

Of his twenty-five surviving songs, twenty-one (or twenty-three) are cansos, with one alba, one partimen, one pastorela, and one religious piece represented. Two of his melodies survive. Life During Cadenet's childhood Raymond V of Toulouse and Bertrand I of Forcalquier went to war over the Vaucluse. Cadenet's father was killed in battle fighting for the count of Forcalquier and the castle of Cadenet was destroyed. Cadenet was taken captive or as a hostage to the court of Toulouse, where he became known after his birthplace, a term which also mean \\"juniper grove\\" (cade is Occitan for \\"juniper\\"). He rose to prominence in the court under the patronage of several prominent families with close connections to the Cathar movement. According to his late thirteenth-century vida, . . . et el venc bos e bels et courtes e saup ben cantar e parlar, et apres a trobar coblas e sirventes.\\". . . and he became good, beautiful, and courteous and knew well hoe to sing and talk, and learned how to compose couplets and sirventes.\\" He became a devoted attendant of the count and countess of Toulouse. His cansos celebrate love but also criticise the feudal lords for their less admirable behaviour. He was only full of praise for lauzengiers, the spies and eavesdroppers who forced lovers into ever more secrecy. He wrote one sirventes criticising Raymond Roger Trencavel for his poor manners on a visit to the court of the count of Toulouse in 1204.Graham-Leigh, 27. This sirventes is a useful source for the relationship between Toulouse and the Trencavel on the eve of the Albigensian Crusade, as it was written for a contemporary audience and dealt with personal issues. Cadenet also wrote a famous early alba, S'anc fu belha ni prezada, whose music (air) and lyrics are still preserved.Falvy, 164. The music is of the style of an oda continua hymn.Falvy, 161. In some of his writings, modern researches have thought to detect the influence of Cathar doctrine. His famous Lo ben e lo mal (The Good and the Bad) divulges a deep sense of guilt towards God and a desire to swap evil and good: > Ben volgra s'esser pogues > tot lo mal qu'ai fait desfar > eˑl be que non ai fait far > Ai! com m'en fora ben pres > siˑl bes fos mals e mals fos bes. . . > Tant mi sent vas Dieu mespres > qu'eu me cugei deseperar. > > I would like, if it could be, > To destroy all the evil which I have made > And do all the good which I have not done > Ah! because it would be pleasing to me > If the good were evil and the evil good. . . > So guilty I feel towards God > That I believe I might despair. > Another chansonnier portraying Cadenet as an old man and a Hospitaller Elsewhere the learned Cadenet borrowed a Classical metaphor, that of the \\"boat of love, ploughing through the rough weather\\" from Ovid, and wrote Plus que la naus q'es en la mar prionda / Non had poder de far son dreg viatge.Allen, 311. Cadenet elsewhere employs simile and metaphor to compare a beautiful but difficult woman to a pretty flower without seed: > Car es delida > leu flors, on mieills es florida; > q'ela se fraing per nïen > qand so qe mostra desmend.Lewent, 193. After the Crusade and the Inquisition, Cadenet took refuge in Spain (either Castile or Aragon, c. 1230),Falvy, 160. where he had an influence on the court of Alfonso X of Castile. Alfonso's cantiga Virgen, madre gloriosa adapts metric elements from Cadenet's alba.Falvy, 163. Late in life, after an unhappy falling in love with a novice nun, sources differ as to whether he entered either the Order of the Temple or the Order of the Hospital. He appears to have been serving with the Order in Palestine when he died around 1230, though other sources place him in the Hospitaller establishment at Orange in 1239.

He sailed up to Tarsus, where he found Baldwin of Boulogne besieging the place, then held by Tancred of Hauteville, a fellow Christian but rival of Baldwin's for dominance in Cilicia. Excited to find a native of his own home town, he readily gave assistance to Baldwin, and after the town was taken he was given command of the garrison. In 1098, after Baldwin had moved on to rejoin the main Crusading army, Tancred requested the assistance of Guynemer in taking Alexandretta, which was held by the Turks. With Baldwin out of the region, Guynemer consented and together they captured the city. At the Siege of Antioch, Guynemer briefly held Latakia. Sources *Setton, Kenneth, editor.

The genus is known from two specimens discovered on the Xiagou Formation and Zhonggou Formation—which are situated in the Xinminbao Group. These findings were made during field-works in 1999 and 2004. Though Suzhousaurus is known from these two specimens, an earlier named and described therizinosauroid from the adjacent basin, \\"Nanshiungosaurus\\" bohlini, may be synonymous with the former. However, Suzhousaurus can not be compared to this species due to non-overlapping material and the loss of the same. Moreover, this synonymy will result in Suzhousaurus bohlini with \\"N\\". bohlini having priority. Suzhousaurus was an unusually large Early Cretaceous therizinosauroid reaching lengths of and nearly in weight. The upper arm (humerus) was very distinct from therizinosaurids, making Suzhousaurus to be considered as a therizinosauroid. Unlike derived (advanced) therizinosaurids, the vertebral column was not highly pneumatized, however, the pelvis shows a marked therizinosaurid-like opisthopubic build. Like other therizinosauroids, Suzhousaurus had elongated claws and neck for browsing, robust hindlimbs and a large trunk that ended on a reduced tail. With the description of the more complete second specimen, the autapomorphies and validity of Suzhousaurs became more clear and with this, numerous anatomical traits indicate that Suzhousaurus is a non-therizinosaurid therizinosauroid, therefore, excluded from the derived Therizinosauridae. The genus is often recovered as the sister taxon of this family though. History of discovery Diagram showing known remains from FRDC-GSJB-99 and FRDC- GSJB-2004-001 The holotype specimen, FRDC-GSJB-99, was discovered in the Xinminbao Group at the Yujingzi Basin. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking cranial material but contains a right humerus, right scapulocoracoid, 10 dorsal vertebrae, partial ribs, nearly complete left and fragmentary right pubes, the lower end of the left ilium and several unidentified elements. The specimen was described in 2007 by Li Daqing, Peng Cuo, You Hailu, Matthew Lamanna, Jerrald Harris, Kenneth Lacovara and Zhang Jianping, also naming the type species Suzhousaurus megatherioides. In terms of etymology, the generic name, Suzhousaurus, is derived from Suzhou which is the old name for the Jiuquan area. The specific name, megatherioides, indicates a resemblance to the giant ground sloths Megatherium. Li and colleagues pointed out that Suzhousaurus might be identical to \\"Nanshiungosaurus\\" bohlini, an earlier named therizinosauroid found in the same geological group and also known from limited remains. If so, the resulting species name would be Suzhousaurus bohlini under the terms of priority. However, a direct comparison is difficult because there is no overlapping material and the holotype of \\"N\\". bohlini is apparently lost. In 2008, a new and fairly more complete skeleton was described. The specimen FRDC-GSJB-2004-001 which contains the last three dorsal vertebrae, the sacrum composed of five sacral vertebrae, the first six caudal vertebrae, a very complete pelvic girdle composed of the left ilium, pubis and ischium, and both femora (right femur is fragmeted), was discovered in 2004 by a field team of the Fossil Research and Development Center of Geology and Mineral Resources Exploration of Gansu Province also at the Xinminbao Group. Since the left pubis of both specimens share similar traits, these fossil remains represent another specimen for the taxon. Although both specimens lack cranial material, Button and colleagues reported an isolated dentary tooth referred to Suzhousaurus that was collected in the Yujingzi Basin near the area of the two specimens, which was described in detail by the same team and You Hailu in 2017. In 2018, You with colleagues proposed the Mazongshan Fauna, which is composed by dinosaur taxa found on the Xiagou and Zhonggou formations, and provided more historical data from the Suzhousaurus specimens: FRDC-GSJB-99 was discovered around 1999 being found in mid gray- variegated beds of the Xiagou Formation dating to the early–mid-Aptian stage, and FRDC-GSJB-2004-001 was found in 2004 at the upper red beds in the Zhonggou Formation dating to the Early Albian. Description Life restoration Suzhousaurus was one of the largest known Early Cretaceous therizinosauroids, with a length of and a ponderous weight of approximately . Suzhousaurus can be differentiated from all other therizinosaur taxa in having a round top border of preacetabular projection of ilium, a foramen on the obturator area with a total width greater than its height from the top to the bottom, a relatively short pubis with a deep and wide obturator notch, and the ischiadic shaft is deflected towards the rear. Like other therizinosauroids, Suzhousaurus developed a prominent keratinous beak, had stocky/robust hindlimbs, a large belly and a reduced tail. Feather impressions from the therizinosauroids Beipiaosaurus suggest at least a partial feathering in Suzhousaurus. The dorsal vertebrae centra in Suzhousaurus were mainly amphiplatian (flat on both ends) and amphicoelous (strongly concave on both ends). In more anterior vertebrae, large pleurocoels (small, air-filled holes) can be located on the lateral surfaces of the centra, but these proggressively decrease in size. Pneumatic openings are absent. Along with the centra, the neural spines become more elongated on posterior series. The neural spines are subvertically- oriented in the anterior dorsals but become more inclined towards the rear. The neural canals—where the spinal cord passes through—are very reduced. The sacrum is composed of five well-fused vertebrae that show no indications of pneumatization. Their neural spines are from a large plate. Overall, the caudal vertebrae are smaller than preceding vertebrae with more rounded facets. The wideness of the neural spine proggressively decreases. Schematic comparison of the ilium of Suzhousaurus (D) and other therizinosaurs As a whole, the scapulocoracoid is a robust element that follows the shape of Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus, but in a top view the scapular blade is very recurved, indicating a rather round thorax. The right scapula is attached to the coracoid and both elements appear to be coossified as in most other therizinosauroids. The right humerus is a large element, measuring long, however, it lacks several therizinosaurid traits; the deltopectoral crest is more reduced than in most therizinosaurids such as Erliansaurus, Erlikosaurus, Neimongosaurus, Segnosaurus and Therizinosaurus, and the posterior trochanter is not present on the posterior surface of the humeral shaft center, which is present in therizinosaurids. Also, the lower end of the humerus is more flattened than in therizinosaurids. In these aspects, Suzhousaurus is more similar to therizinosauroids like Alxasaurus or Beipiaosaurus. The pelvis has a strong opisthopubic condition. The ilium has an expanded and slightly curved anterior end and a long rugose structure can be located on the posterior end. Being strongly recurved and connected to the ischium, the pubis has a large pubic boot (large expansion on the lower end). The ischium has an extensively expanded lower end similar to that of therizinosaurids. On its mid-height, a large ridge-like structure articulates with the pubis. The femur is highly thickened and robust with a well-developed great trochanter and articular surfaces. It has a total length of . Classification Li and coauthors, in their description, assigned Suzhousaurus to the Therizinosauroidea, in a basal position. They performed a cladistic analysis that found the genus to be more derived than Beipiaosaurus and Falcarius, less derived than Alxasaurus and true therizinosaurids, and the sister taxon of Nothronychus, forming a clade with it. The more complete remains of have also confirm that Suzhousaurus is more derived than Falcarius and Beipiaosaurus, and less derived than therizinosaurids. On the large revision of the Therizinosauria performed by Lindsay Zanno in 2010, she found Suzhousaurus in a more derived position as the sister taxon of the Therizinosauridae representing the latest diverging therizinosauroid. which has also been corroborated by Button and colleagues. In 2019, Hartman and team performed a phylogenetic analysis for the Therizinosauria using data provided by Zanno 2010 and found this time Suzhousaurus as a therizinosaurid taxon, however, with poor support. Relationships of Suzhousaurus and Falcarius. The former represents the latest diverging therizinosauroid Results obtained by Zanno in 2010 for the Therizinosauroidea are shown in the cladogram below: Paleoecology The overall environment deposition of the Xinminbao Group suggests a clastic- dominated subsidence basin of low-relief in which weak, short-lived lakes repeatedly gave arise to open-land biomes. Suzhousaurus was a relatively large herbivorous component of its ecosystems. The known specimens were recovered from the complex of the Mazongshan Dinosaur Fauna, which is composed by the contemporaneous genera of both Xiagou and Zhonggou formations. During the late Aptian–early Albian eras, a large lake surrounded by narrow hills was likely present in the Mazongshan and Jiuquan areas, allowing dinosaur faunas to travel across areas without geographical barriers. =Xiagou Formation= The vast majority of ornithothoracines are known from the near Changma Basin The gray-variegated beds in the Xiagou Formation of the Yujingzi Basin were deposited in lowland-like environments with coastal conditions. A high diversity of ornithothoracines is known from this formation such as Avimaia, Changmaornis, Dunhuangia, Feitianius, Gansus, Jiuquanornis, Qiliania and Yumenornis. Other theropod dinosaurs known from the gray-variegated beds of Suzhousaurus include the large ornithomimosaur Beishanlong and the predatory tyrannosauroid Xiongguanlong. Additional herbivores are represented by Archaeoceratops, Jintasaurus, Qiaowanlong and Xuwulong. =Zhonggou Formation= The Albian Zhonggou Formation slightly overlains the sediments of the Xiagou Formation, and consists of abundant red fluvial sedimentation. Aside from the referred specimen of Suzhousaurus, sparse remains of Auroraceratops and Beishanlong are known from the red beds. The remains of ceratopsians and therizinosaurs in these beds could reflect a preference of niches close to rivers and lakes, whereas hadrosauroids and sauropods probably inhabited more interior environments of the region. However, ceratopsians and therizinosaurs remains are also found in the gray-variegated beds of the Yujingzi Basin. In the Gongpoquan Basin, lacustrine-dominated conditions are represented by gray beds, which is consistent with a return to lacustrine deposits in the upper part of the Zhonggou Formation.

In some cases these are encouraged or required by the state and used by state agencies. In others they are voluntarily implemented by private operators (e.g., internet service providers). The country was listed among the \\"Enemies of the Internet\\" in 2014 by Reporters Without Borders, a category of countries with the highest level of internet censorship and surveillance that \\"mark themselves out not just for their capacity to censor news and information online but also for their almost systematic repression of Internet users\\". Other major economies listed in this category include China, Iran, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia. In 2017 the Communications Select Committee set up an inquiry as to whether and how to further regulate the Internet in the UK. =Default network-level blocking by Internet service providers=  Current situation  Mobile Internet censorship UK mobile phone operators began filtering Internet content in 2004\\"What mobile internet filtering tells us about porn blocks\\", Open rights Group, 31 May 2013. when Ofcom published a \\"UK code of practice for the self-regulation of new forms of content on mobiles\\".\\"UK code of practice for the self-regulation of new forms of content on mobiles\\", Office of Communications (Ofcom). Retrieved 2 December 2013. This provided a means of classifying mobile Internet content to enable consistency in filtering. All major UK operators now voluntarily filter content by default and when users try to access blocked content they are redirected to a warning page. This tells them that they are not able to access an 'over 18 status' Internet site and a filtering mechanism has restricted their access. Categories that are listed as blocked include: adult / sexually explicit, chat, criminal skills, drugs, alcohol and tobacco, gambling, hacking, hate, personal and dating, violence, and weapons.Content Blocked, BT.com Support & Advice, January 2004. Users who are adults may have the block lifted on request. Guidelines published by the Independent Mobile Classification Body were used by mobile operators to classify sites until the British Board of Film Classification took over responsibility in 2013. Classification determines whether content is suitable for customers under 18 years old. The default assumption is that a user is under 18. The following content types are blocked from under 18's: * Suicide, self-harm, pro-anorexia and eating disorders * Discriminatory language * Encouragement of drug use * Repeated / aggressive use of the word ‘cunt’ * Pornography restrictions * Violence and gore restrictions Significant overblocking of Internet sites by mobile operators is reported, including the blocking of political satire, feminism and gay content. Research by the Open Rights Group highlighted the widespread nature of unjustified site blocking. In 2011 the group set up Blocked.org.uk, a website allowing the reporting of sites and services that are 'blocked' on their mobile network. The website received hundreds of reportsBlockedReports.xls of the blocking of sites covering blogs, business, internet privacy and internet forums across multiple networks. The Open Rights Group also demonstrated that correcting the erroneous blocking of innocent sites can be difficult. No UK mobile operator provides an on-line tool for identifying blocked websites. The O2 Website status checker was available until the end of 2013 but was suspended in December after it had been widely used to determine the extent of overblocking by O2. Not only were civil liberties and computing sites being blocked, but also Childline, the NSPCC, the Police. An additional opt-in whitelist service aimed at users under 12 years is provided by O2. The service only allows access to websites on a list of categories deemed suitable for that age group.  Public Wi-Fi  Libraries and educational institutions =Politics and extremism= The main focus of political censorship in UK law is concerned with the prevention of political violence. Hence incitement to ethnic or racial hatred is a criminal offence in the UK and those who create racist websites are liable to prosecution. Incitement to hatred against religions is an offence in England and Wales under the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. Holocaust denial is not an offence per se unless it contravenes other laws. Other legal exceptions to the principle of freedom of speech include the following: * Treason including advocating for the abolition of the monarchy (which has not been successfully prosecuted since 1946), compassing or imagining the death of the monarch.Treason Felony Act 1848 * Sedition. * Incitement to terrorism including encouragement of terrorism, dissemination of terrorist publications and glorifying terrorism. * Collection or possession of a document or record containing information likely to be of use to a terrorist. Possession of Inspire magazine has been successfully prosecuted under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000. In September 2014 Home Secretary Theresa May proposed the introduction of Extremism Disruption Orders. These would allow judges to ban people who are deemed extremists (but who \\"do not break laws”) from broadcasting, protesting in designated places or posting messages on Social Media. =Pornography= There are a number of legal exceptions to freedom of speech in the United Kingdom that concern pornography. These include obscenity and indecency, including corruption of public morals and outraging public decency. The UK has a markedly different tradition of pornography regulation from that found in other Western countries. It was almost the only liberal democracy not to have legalised hardcore pornography during the 1960s and 1970s. Pre-existing laws, such as the Obscene Publications Act 1959, continued to make its sale illegal through the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally new laws were introduced to extend existing prohibitions. The Video Recordings Act 1984 required the BBFC to censor all video works before release. As a result, the UK became one of the few representative government countries where the sale of explicit pornography on video (and later DVD) was illegal (thus opening the market to unlicensed pornography shops which technically operated in defiance of the haphazardly enforced laws). The appearance of the Internet during the 1990s introduced unregulated access to hardcore pornography in the UK for the first time. The existing legal and regulatory framework came to be seen as insufficient and in the 21st century a number of measures have been introduced, including web blocking and additional criminal legislation. Nevertheless, the Obscene Publications Act is still in force, and it makes it illegal for websites that can be accessed from the UK without age restriction to contain certain types of adult content. Child pornography The first attempts to regulate pornography on the Internet concerned child pornography. Legislation in the form of the Protection of Children Act 1978 already existed making it illegal to take, make, distribute, show or possess an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of someone under the age of 18. The R v Bowden case in 2000 established that downloading indecent images of children from the Internet constituted the offence of making, since doing so causes a copy of the image to exist which previously did not exist. =Internet newsgroups= Initial steps to restrict pornography on the Internet were taken by the UK police. In the 1990s they began to take a pro-active regulatory role with respect to the Internet, using existing legislation and working on a self-tasking basis. In August 1996, the Metropolitan Police Clubs & Vice Unit sent an open letter to the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) supplying them with a list of 132 Usenet discussion groups that they believed to contain pornographic images or explicit text and requesting that they ban access to them. The list mainly included newsgroups which carried child pornography. Ian Taylor, the Conservative Science and Industry Minister, warned ISPs that the police would act against any company which provided their users with \\"pornographic or violent material\\". Taylor went on to make it clear that there would be calls for legislation to regulate all aspects of the Internet unless service providers were seen to wholeheartedly \\"responsible self-regulation\\". Following this, a tabloid-style exposé of ISP Demon Internet appeared in the Observer newspaper, which alleged that Clive Feather (a director of Demon) \\"provides paedophiles with access to thousands of photographs of children being sexually abused\\". During the summer and autumn of 1996 the UK police made it known that they were planning to raid an ISP with the aim of launching a test case regarding the publication of obscene material over the Internet. The action of the UK police has been described as amounting to censorship without public or Parliamentary debate. It has been pointed out that the list supplied to ISPs by the police in August included a number of legitimate discussion groups concerned with legal sexual subjects. These contained textual material without pictures that would not be expected to infringe UK obscenity laws. =Internet Watch Foundation= The direct result of the 1996 campaign of threats and pressure was the setting up of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), an independent body to which the public could report potentially criminal Internet content, both child pornography and other forms of criminally obscene material. These reports would be passed on to ISPs and the Police as a ‘notice and takedown’ service for the removal of potentially illegal content hosted in the UK. It was intended that this arrangement would protect the internet industry from any criminal liability. The IWF was also intended to support the development of a website rating system. Demon Internet was a driving force behind the IWF's creation, and one of its directors, Clive Feather, became the IWF's first chairman. After 3 years of operation, the IWF was reviewed for the DTI and the Home Office by consultants KPMG and Denton Hall. Their report was delivered in October 1999 and resulted in a number of changes being made to the role and structure of the organisation, and it was relaunched in early 2000, endorsed by the government and the DTI, which played a \\"facilitating role in its creation\\", according to a DTI spokesman. At the time, Patricia Hewitt, then Minister for E-Commerce, said: \\"The Internet Watch Foundation plays a vital role in combating criminal material on the Net.\\" To counter accusations that the IWF was biased in favour of the ISPs, a new independent chairman was appointed, Roger Darlington, former head of research at the Communication Workers Union. =Introduction of Cleanfeed= =IWF/Wikipedia controversy= =Search engines= The Google search engine Google Search includes a SafeSearch filter which restricts the content returned by a search. In December 2012 the option to turn the filter off entirely was removed. In July 2013 Prime Minister David Cameron called on Internet search engines to \\"blacklist\\" certain search terms, so that they would bring up no results. Microsoft quickly responded by introducing a blacklist provided by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). A 'pop-up' warning appears on the UK version of its search engine Bing when searches contravene the blacklist. In November 2013 Google announced that 100,000 \\"blacklisted\\" search terms would no longer give any results, while 13,000 would produce a warning message. Child protection experts, including a former head of the CEOP, have warned that these measures will not help to protect children because most child pornography on the Internet is on hidden networks inaccessible through these search engines. =Cartoons= In 2009 the UK Ministry of Justice claimed that legislation was needed to reduce the availability of hardcore paedophilic cartoon pornography on the internet, particularly from Japan. The decision was made to make possession of cartoon pornography depicting minors illegal in the UK. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (sections 62–68), which came into force on 6 April 2010, created an offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of possession of a prohibited image of a child.Coroners and Justice Act 2009 - 2009 c. 25 - Part 2 - Chapter 2 - Prohibited images The maximum penalty is three years imprisonment and listing on the sex offender registry. A prohibited cartoon image is defined as one which involves a minor in situations which are pornographic and \\"grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character\\". The Act makes it illegal to own any picture depicting under-18s participating in sexual activities, or depictions of sexual activity in the presence of someone under 18 years old. The definition of a \\"child\\" in the Act includes depictions of 16- and 17-year-olds who are over the age of consent in the UK, as well as any adults where the \\"predominant impression conveyed\\" is of a person under the age of 18. \\"The law has been condemned by a coalition of graphic artists, publishers, and MPs, fearing it will criminalise graphic novels such as Lost Girls and Watchmen.\\" Extreme pornography Calls for violent adult pornography sites to be shut down began in 2003, after the murder of Jane Longhurst by Graham Coutts, a man who said he had an obsession with Internet pornography. Jane Longhurst's mother and sister also campaigned to tighten laws regarding pornography on the Internet. In response the government announced plans to crack down on sites depicting rape, strangulation, torture and necrophilia. However, in August 2005 the Government announced that instead of targeting production or publication, it planned to criminalise private possession of what the Government now termed \\"extreme pornography\\". This was defined as real or simulated examples of certain types of sexual violence as well as necrophilia and bestiality. The passing of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 resulted in the possession of \\"extreme pornographic images\\" becoming illegal in England and Wales as of January 2009. The law has been criticised for criminalising images where no crime took place in their creation. Additionally, the law's placing of liability on consumers rather than producers has been criticised for creating a power imbalance between the individual and the state. There has never been a legal challenge to the law in the UK as the cost of doing so would be beyond most individuals. In 2011, there were over 1300 prosecutions under the law, compared to the Government estimate of 30 cases a year.\\"Fantasy 1-2-1 talk could land you in jail\\", Jane Fae Ozimek, The Register, 3 August 2012. Retrieved 22 October 2013. In 2004 in Scotland, a committee of Members of the Scottish Parliament backed a call to ban adult pornography as the Equal Opportunities Committee supported a petition claiming links between porn and sexual crimes and violence against women and children. A spokeswoman said \\"While we have no plans to legislate we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation.\\" In 2007, MSPs looked again at criminalising adult pornography, in response to a call from Scottish Women Against Pornography for pornography to be classified as a hate crime against women. This was opposed by Feminists Against Censorship. In September 2008, Scotland announced its own plans to criminalise possession of what it termed \\"extreme\\" adult pornography, but extending the law further, including depictions of rape imagery. These plans became law with the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010. In July 2013, David Cameron proposed that pornography which depicts rape (including simulations involving consenting adults) should become illegal in England and Wales bringing the law in line with that of Scotland. These plans became law with the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. CPS advice regarding depictions of consensual legal acts  In January 2019, the Crown Prosecution Service amended their advice regarding prosecutions under obscenity laws of depictions of acts that are themselves legal to perform, stating that they \\"do not propose to bring charges based on material that depicts consensual and legal activity between adults, where no serious harm is caused and the likely audience is over the age of 18\\". Video on demand The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 require that the online streaming of videos (known as Video On Demand or VOD) in the UK conforms to the BBFC R18 certificate regulations which had previously only restricted those sold in licensed sex shops. The regulations were first announced in July 2013 by David Cameron. The UK regulator of VOD is Ofcom, which replaced ATVOD as the regulator from the beginning of 2016. During its tenure as regulator ATVOD regularly instructed UK websites to comply with its rules and failure to do so resulted in Ofcom issuing a fine or shutting down a website. It is a criminal offence not to restrict access to adult VOD content to those aged over 18, by means such as requiring the user to provide credit card details. In March 2014 ATVOD proposed new legislation that would introduce a licensing system for all UK adult content providers. The verification of customers' ages would be a condition of granting a license. Furthermore, there would be a legal requirement on financial institutions to block the customer payments of unlicensed adult websites. Revenge porn An amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 creates a specific offence in England and Wales of distributing a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress (commonly called \\"revenge porn\\"). The maximum custodial sentence is two years. The law received Royal Assent and came into effect in February 2015. Pressure for a change in the law came from reports in April 2014 by UK charities including The National Stalking Helpline, Women's Aid, and the UK Safer Internet Centre that the use of revenge porn websites had increased. Women's Aid Charity Chief Executive Polly Neate stated, \\"To be meaningful, any attempt to tackle revenge porn must also take account of all other kinds of psychological abuse and controlling behaviour, and revenge porn is just another form of coercive control. That control is central to domestic violence, which is why we're campaigning for all psychological abuse and coercive control to be criminalised\\". In July, Minister of Justice Chris Grayling announced plans to \\"take appropriate action\\" to address revenge porn in Britain. A House of Lords Committee, in a report on social media crime, subsequently called for clarification from the DPP as to when revenge porn becomes a crime. Written pornography R v Walker, sometimes called the \\"Girls (Scream) Aloud Obscenity Trial\\", was the first prosecution for written material under Section 2(1) of the Obscene Publications Act in nearly two decades. It involved the prosecution of Darryn Walker for posting a story entitled \\"Girls (Scream) Aloud\\" on an internet erotic story site in 2008. The story was a fictional written account describing the kidnap, rape and murder of pop group Girls Aloud. It was reported to the IWF who passed the information on to Scotland Yard’s Obscene Publications Unit. During the trial the prosecution claimed that the story could be \\"easily accessed\\" by young fans of Girls Aloud. However, the defence demonstrated that it could only be located by those specifically searching for such material. As a result, the case was abandoned and the defendant cleared of all charges. In October 2013 a press exposé resulted in a number of on-line e-book retailers removing adult fiction titles including descriptions of rape, incest or bestiality from their download catalogues. Age verification With the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2017, the United Kingdom became the first country to pass a law containing a legal mandate on the provision of an Internet age verification system. Under the act, websites that publish pornography on a commercial basis would have been required to implement a \\"robust\\" age verification system. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) was charged with enforcing this legislation. After a series of setbacks, the planned scheme was eventually abandoned in 2019. =Social media= Social media in the United Kingdom are subject to a number of laws which restrict the range of comments that users can make.  Malicious communications  Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988 criminalises sending another any article which is indecent or grossly offensive with an intent to cause distress or anxiety (which has been used to prohibit speech of a racist or anti-religious nature). Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 makes it an offence to send a message that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character over a public electronic communications network. The section replaced section 43 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 and is drafted as widely as its predecessor. The section has controversially been widely used to prosecute users of social media. On 19 December 2012, to strike a balance between freedom of speech and criminality, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued interim guidelines, clarifying when social messaging is eligible for criminal prosecution under UK law. Revisions to the interim guidelines were issued on 20 June 2013 following a public consultation and have been updated since then. Libel The fact that existing libel laws apply to Internet publishing was established by the Keith-Smith v Williams case of 2006, but the time limit of one year after publication for libel suits does not apply to Internet publishing because each incidence of material being accessed on the Internet is defined as a new publication. As a result, many newspapers and journals do not publish controversial material in their on-line archives due to a fear of potential libel suits. In addition, individuals without the financial means to defend themselves against libel suits can also be reluctant to publish controversial material on-line. With older forms of publishing the media companies themselves had legal responsibility for posts but with social media such as Twitter it is the users and not their online hosts who have legal responsibility. Individuals who are defamed online may also not have the financial means to seek legal redress. The UK Ministry of Justice drew up plans in 2008 to give such individuals access to cheap low-cost legal recourse but these proposals were never implemented. Instead the Defamation Act 2013 (which came into force on 1 January 2014) reformed libel law to allow new defences and introduce a requirement for claimants to show that they have suffered serious harm. The intention behind the reform was to make it harder to bring libel suits in Britain. Contempt of court Exceptions to freedom of speech include prior restraint, restrictions on court reporting including names of victims and evidence and prejudicing or interfering with court proceedings, prohibition of post-trial interviews with jurors, and scandalising the court by criticising or murmuring judges. The use of social media to comment on a legal case can constitute contempt of court, resulting in the fining or imprisonment of the social media user. This can happen if a trial is seriously prejudiced as a result of a comment, such as a breach of jury confidentiality, resulting in the need for a retrial. It can also happen if the identity of an individual is publicly revealed when their identity is protected by a court. For instance, victims of rape and serious sexual offences are entitled as a matter of law to lifelong anonymity in the media under the Sexual Offences Act 1992, even if their name has been given in court.\\"Anonymity, Helping victims and witnesses to give evidence\\", CPS Policy for Prosecuting Cases of Rape, The Crown Prosecution Service, September 2012. Retrieved 4 November 2013. There have been a number of instances of users of social media being prosecuted for contempt of court. In 2012 the R v Evans and McDonald rape trial generated more than 6,000 tweets, with some people naming his victim on Twitter and other social media websites. Nine people were prosecuted. In February 2013, the Attorney General's Office instituted contempt of court proceedings against three men who used Twitter and Facebook to publish photographs which allegedly showed the two murderers of the toddler James Bulger as adults. This use of social media breached a worldwide injunction that prevented publication of anything that could identify the pair. In December 2013 the Attorney General's Office set up a Twitter account to provide advice to individuals using social media. The advice is intended to help individuals avoid committing contempt of court when commenting on legal cases. The professional news media routinely receive such advice. Proposals to limit social media, following August 2011 riots On 11 August 2011, following the widespread riots in England, British Prime Minister David Cameron said that Theresa May, the Home secretary, would meet with executives of the Web companies Facebook and Twitter, as well as Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, to discuss possible measures to prevent troublemakers from using social media and other digital communications tools.\\"Cameron Exploring Crackdown on Social Media After Riots\\", Eric Pfanner, New York Times, 11 August 2011 During a special debate on the riots, Mr. Cameron told Parliament: > Everyone watching these horrific actions will be struck by how they were > organized via social media. Free flow of information can be used for good. > But it can also be used for ill. And when people are using social media for > violence we need to stop them. So we are working with the police, the > intelligence services and industry to look at whether it would be right to > stop people communicating via these Web sites and services when we know they > are plotting violence, disorder and criminality”. Critics say that the British government is considering policies similar to those it has criticized in totalitarian and one-party states.\\"Reaction to Cameron’s plans for social media crackdown\\" , Marta Cooper, Free Speech Blog, Index on Censorship, 11 August 2011 And in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 England riots, Iran, often criticized by the West for restricting the Internet and curbing free speech, offered to \\"send a human rights delegation to Britain to study human rights violations in the country\\".\\"Iran Asks to Send Human Rights Rapporteurs to Britain\\" , Fars News Agency (FNA), 9 August 2011 On 25 August 2011 British officials and representatives of Twitter, Facebook and BlackBerry met privately to discuss voluntary ways to limit or restrict the use of social media to combat crime and periods of civil unrest.\\"In Britain, a Meeting on Limiting Social Media\\", Ravi Somaiya, New York Times, 25 August 2011 The government is seeking ways to crack down on networks being used for criminal behavior, but is not seeking any additional powers and has no intention of restricting Internet services.\\"Government backs down on plan to shut Twitter and Facebook in crises\\", Josh Halliday, Guardian, 25 August 2011 It was not clear what new measures, if any, would be taken as a result of the meeting. =Copyright= The practice of file sharing constitutes a breach of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 if it is performed without the permission of a copyright holder. Courts in the UK routinely issue injunctions restricting access to file sharing information published on the Internet. The British Phonographic Industry represents the interests of British record companies and along with the British Video Association encourages UK governments to regulate and legislate to reduce copyright infringement. As a result, the Digital Economy Act was passed in 2010. Further legislation has been suggested, such as the 2014 proposal for a general law to prevent search engines from returning file-sharing websites as search results. Digital Economy Act 2010 The Digital Economy Act 2010 is the only Internet- specific legislation regarding copyright in the UK. Progress on the implementation of the Act was slow, and in the end, its measures were never passed by Parliament. The Act had proposed a Code to be drafted by Ofcom and implemented by Parliament, containing provisions restricting the downloading of copyrighted material from the Internet. Under the Act, warning letters would have been sent to Internet users suspected of downloading copyright- infringing material (provided their ISP has more than 400,000 customers), and a customer receiving three such letters in one year would be recorded by their service provider and could have been subject to a civil claim by the copyright holder under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (the copyright holder having first sought the subscriber's identity using a court order). After these provisions have been in force for a year, additional rules could have then been applied, requiring ISPs to reduce the download speed of repeat offenders and in some cases disconnect their Internet supply. The Act originally allowed the Secretary of State to order the blocking of websites which provided material that infringed copyright, although this section was dropped following the successful use of court orders to block websites. Commentators debate the practicality of such controls and the ability of the UK government to exact control.

It rises on the slopes of Ott Mountain, in the Mourne Mountains, and enters the Irish Sea at Newcastle, on Dundrum Bay. It is acidic and nutrient-poor, as a result of which its most common flora are mosses and liverworts, including the rare Portuguese feather-moss and Holt's mouse-tail moss. Its principal fish are salmon and sea trout, and it is managed by the Shimna Angling Club. The river is an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI). The Shimna has a history of flooding; the most serious recent flooding was in 2008. There have also been incidents of pollution, and there were serious fish kills in 2004, 2006 and 2009. Course The source of the river is in the Mourne Mountains on the slopes of Ott Mountain. The river then flows in a northerly direction into Fofanny Dam. It continues its flow in a north- easterly direction into Tollymore Forest Park where the tributary Spinkwee River and Trassey River join it. The Shimna finally flows to the east, then takes a south easterly direction toward Newcastle where at one point it flows through Tipperary Wood. The final tributaries to join the river prior to it reaching the sea are the Burren River and the Tullybrannigan River, at Islands Park. Near the mouth, as it flows through Castle Park, it widens quite considerably to create a shallow boating pond. The river's geology, flora and fauna have made it an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI). Geology The Shimna is a short spate river, meaning it becomes deep and fast-flowing after periods of rain and is slow, with low water levels in drier weather. In sections of the river where the gradient is low, there are riffles and pools, sandy banks, and pebbles and scattered boulders on the river bed. Along steeper parts there is a faster flow, rapids and cascades, and the bed is made up of bedrock and boulders. Shale rock with dark basalt bands along the edge of the river as it flows through Tollymore Forest Park The bedrock of the upper part of the river, located in the Mourne Mountains, is composed of granite formed approximately 50 million years ago (mya). The bedrock of the river as it flows through Tollymore is shale from the Silurian age, more than 400 mya, and it forms step gorges along some sections of the river banks. Dark bands of basalt are found were molten basalt lava was forced through cracks in the bedrock about 60 million years ago. The river bed contains stones and gravel from as far away as Antrim, Tyrone and Scotland, which were carried there by glacial ice sheets during the last ice age. History Foley's Bridge Felix Magennis, a member of the Magennis clan and relative of Hugh Magennis, Lord of Iveagh, built a castle next to the mouth of the Shimna River in 1588. The town is referred to as New Castle in the Annals of the Four Masters in 1433 so it is likely that he built on the site of an existing structure. Magennis’ castle was demolished in 1830. The Hermitage, Tollymore Forest Park The river is crossed by 16 bridges as it flows through Tollymore Forest Park. The Old Bridge, built by James Hamilton in 1726, is the oldest of the current bridges. The Ivy Bridge was built in 1780 and Foley’s Bridge in 1787. Parnell Bridge, named in recognition of Sir John Parnell who visited Tollymore in the late 18th century, was constructed in 1842. It was the last stone bridge to be built in Tollymore. The more recent footbridges are constructed from wood. Castle Bridge is located near the mouth where Main Street crosses the river. It was originally called Fearsat an Chaislein Nui (The Ford or Pass of the Newcastle) and was next to the entrance to the castle. This was replaced by a wider, straighter bridge in the 1890s. The Hermitage is a small stone shelter built into the side of the gorge, above the river. It was designed by James Hamilton in the 1770s as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished in the river. Between 1994 and 2003, five flint artefacts were discovered near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper were found in two locations in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper and one of the blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late Mesolithic or Early Neolithic. A Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field. Flooding =2008= There was major flooding in the area on 16 and 17 August 2008 which was investigated by the Rivers Agency, part of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). Most of the flooding occurred along Bryansford Avenue and the Shimna Road, close to the Burren River and Shimna River confluence, causing damage to approximately 40 properties. There is a history of flooding in Newcastle, particularly after heavy, sustained rainfall. The Rivers Agency had commissioned a flood alleviation scheme along the nearby Burren River to reduce the risk of flooding in that area to 1 in 100 in any given year (national standards). This was completed in August 2007. There are no flood prevention measures in place along the Shimna River itself but in 2014 DARD commissioned a feasibility study for flood alleviation work to be carried out. The Rivers Agency concluded that the flooding was an extreme event, caused by weather that resulted in widespread flooding across Northern Ireland. The amount of water in the rivers exceeded the capacity of the flood defences and the natural river banks. They further concluded that the flooding was a result of overflow of the Shimna River into the Burren River catchment area through Islands Park, rather than from the Burren River itself. =2020= Major flooding occurred on 25 and 26 August 2020 when the Shimna River burst its banks during Storm Francis. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service deployed specialist flood rescue teams, and a number of elderly people were evacuated from homes on the Shimna Road and Bryansford Road in Newcastle. In response to the flooding, Infrastructure Minister Nicola Mallon stated that work on a flood alleviation scheme for the Shimna River was due to start in the summer of 2021. She later said this will be brought forward and work on the scheme will start as quickly as possible. There was also flooding in Tollymore Forest Park, where a number of bridges were washed away. Damage to one of the wooden bridges and the path in Tollymore, caused by flooding in August 2020 Flora The river is nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 4.33) which determines the type of plant life found there. Mosses and liverworts are the most common. Near the source compressed flapwort (Nardia compressa) and green algae are the most dominant species. Closer to the mouth water earwort (Scapania undulata), feather moss and bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (Isothecium holtii) is very common on the banks; the Shimna River is one of only three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (Platyhypnidium alopecuroides) is found. Other notable species include: *Rusty feather-moss (Brachythecium plumosum) *Fox-tail feather-moss (Thamnobryum alopecurum) *Yellow fringe-moss (Racomitrium aciculare) *Overleaf pellia (Pellia epiphylla) The most common trees found along the banks include oak, beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), birch and willow. Rhododendron, elderberry, blackberry, laurel and ivy are also common along parts of the river. Fauna A Grey heron fishing near the mouth of the river Atlantic salmon, brown trout and sea trout use the river to spawn. Other fish species found include Three-spined stickleback, minnow, stone loach, and eel. Dippers and Grey wagtails can also be seen feeding on insects along the river. Invertebrate species found include leeches, Simulidae and Ancylidae. Various Mayfly families are found, such as; Baetidae, Ephemerellidae, Heptageniidae and Caenidae. Stoneflies (Nemouridae, Chloroperlidae and Perlodidae families) and caddis larvae (Hydropsychidae, Polycentropidae, Rhyacophilidae and Limnephilidae families) are also present. A population of feral Mandarin ducks have been present on the river since 1978. Kingfishers and grey herons can also be seen. Otters are common near the mouth of the river. Angling The river is partly owned by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) and partly leased by the Shimna Angling Club, and is managed by the latter club under a management agreement. The principal fish are salmon and sea trout. The record for the largest sea trout in Ireland was set in 1983 when a 16 lbs 6oz (7.43 kg) fish was caught in the Shimna. Fishing season is from 1 March to 31 October. Pollution and fish kills There have been a number of incidents in recent years where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that this was not the first time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and sea trout. In July 2006, sewage discharge from a pumping station resulted in the death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board suggested that there may have been only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river. In 2009 there was another major fish kill, with over 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water treatment works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny Dam. Measures have been since been put in place to prevent a similar incident in the future. In 2010 a new fish counter was commissioned for the Shimna river and the initial results indicated that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009. However, in 2014 concerns about salmon levels in the river were raised again after it was observed that the number of eggs being laid was still below conservation limits.

He ruled Yemen from 378-430. ʼAsʽad is cited in some sources as the first of several kings of the Arabian Peninsula to convert to Judaism. He was the first one to cover the Kaaba with the kiswah. Conversion While some sources agree that Abu Karab was the first of the Himyarite kings to convert to Judaism, the circumstances of his conversion are immersed in myth and legend. According to the traditional account, Abu Karab undertook a military expedition to eliminate the growing influence of Byzantium in his northern provinces. His forces reached Medina, which was then known as \\"Yathrib\\". Not meeting any resistance, they passed through the town, leaving one of the king’s sons behind as governor of the town. A few days later, however, the people of Yathrib killed their new governor, the king's son. Upon receiving the news, the king turned his troops back to avenge his son’s death, and destroy the town. He ordered that all palm trees around the town be cut down, because the trees were the main source of the town's inhabitants' income, and then laid siege to the town. The Jews of Yathrib fought alongside their pagan Arab neighbors, trying to protect their town. During the siege, Abu Karab fell ill. Two local Jewish scholars, named Kaab and Assad, took the opportunity to travel to his camp, and persuaded him to lift the siege. The scholars also inspired in the King an interest in Judaism, and he converted in 390, persuading his army to do likewise. Kaab and Assad later returned with Abu Karab to his kingdom, where they were tasked with converting the population. However, while some scholars say the population converted on a wholesale basis, others opine that only about half became converts, the rest maintaining their pagan beliefs and temples. Among those who converted to Judaism was Harith Ibn-Amru, a nephew of Abu Karab, whom Abu- Karab appointed Viceroy of the Maadites on the Red Sea, and headed the government of Mecca and Yathrib. Tubba Abu Karab As'ad is said to have been killed by his own soldiers, who tired of his constant military campaigns. He left three sons: Hasan, Amru, and Zorah (Yusuf). One dissenter from the view that Abu Karab was a convert to Judaism is author J. R. Porter. Writing in the 1980s, Porter argued that the accounts of Karab's conversion first appear much later in the historical record and are therefore unreliable. Porter nonetheless acknowledged that a move toward Judaism on Karab's part would be \\"entirely credible\\", given the presence of powerful Jewish tribes in Yathrib. Porter states that a later Himyarite King, Dhu Nowas (517–525 CE) was \\"certainly\\" a convert to Judaism.Netton, Ian Richard (1986): Arabia and the Gulf: From Traditional Society to Modern States, Croom Helm Ltd., p. 10, .

Random House, New York (1995) in the Four Brothers mine near the village of Koptyaki, 15 km north from Yekaterinburg. In the pre-dawn hours of 17 July 1918, after the execution of the Romanov family, the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and his family (who had been murdered at the Ipatiev House) were secretly transported to Ganina Yama and thrown into the pit. A week later, the White Army drove the Bolsheviks from the area and launched an investigation into the fate of the royal family. An extensive reportSokolov, Nikolai A. Ubiistvo Tsarskoi Sem’i. Terra, Moscow (Reprinted 1996) concluded that the royal family's remains had been cremated at the mine, since evidence of fire was found and charred bones, but no bodies. But the Bolsheviks, realizing that the burial site was no longer a secret, had returned to the site the night after the first burial to relocate the bodies to another area. The secret Bolshevik report on the execution and burial did not give the location of the second burial site, but the description provided clues.Yakov Yurovsky's account of the execution and burial of the Imperial Family, alexanderpalace.org The second burial site, a field known as Porosyonkov Log (Поросёнков лог, \\"Piglet’s Ravine\\") four and a half miles from Ganina Yama (), was discovered in the late 1970s through clandestine research but kept secret until the political climate changed in 1989.Search Foundation, Inc. , searchfoundationinc.org In 1995, the remains found at the Porosyonkov Ravine were identified as Romanovs using DNA from living relatives of Nicholas and Alexandra’s parents. The Porosyonkov Ravine burial pit is marked by a cross and simple landscaping of the burial pit. A second, smaller pit was located at the Porosenkov Ravine in 2007 containing the remains of two Romanov children missing from the larger grave. Further excavation was planned for the summer of 2009.New excavations planned for Romanov family burial site, rian.ru, Novosti, October 27, 2008 The Russian Orthodox Church, relying on the White Army's reports in preference to Bolshevik reports, and doubting the DNA identification, declared the Ganina Yama site holy ground. (Romanov family descendants likewise have doubts about the DNA identification.) The royal family and their retinue had been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. The grounds were therefore dedicated to honor the family’s humility during capture and their status as political martyrs. With financial assistance from the Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, the Church constructed the Monastery of the Holy Imperial Passion-Bearers at the site in 2001. A tall cross marks the edge of the mine shaft, visible as a depression in the ground. Seven chapels were later constructed at the site, one for each member of the royal family. Each chapel is dedicated to a particular saint or relic. The katholikon is dedicated to the Theotokos Derzhavnaya, an icon particularly revered by the monarchists; it burnt to the groundhttp://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/1275090.html on 14 September 2010 but has now been fully restored. On the anniversary of the murder, a night-long service is held at the Church of All Saints (Church on the Blood) on the site of the Ipatiev House. At daybreak, a procession walks four hours to Ganina Yama for another ceremony. The former mine pit is covered with lily plants for the ceremony.Rappaport, Helen.

They participated in numerous actions during World War II. The Tenryū class was followed by the larger and more versatile . Background The Tenryū class was designed to act as flagships for destroyer flotillas. The design represented an intermediate class between the light cruiser (e.g.Chikuma class of 5,000 t) and the destroyer (e.g. Kawakaze-class destroyers of 1,300 t), which had few counterparts in other navies of the time, although it was inspired by a similar concept to the Royal Navy Arethusa class and s.Gardner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921, p. 237. The Imperial Japanese Navy and Japanese shipbuilding industry were still closely associated with the British due to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and were able to improve on the British experience. Plans for the small cruisers were developed in 1915, with orders placed in the 1916 fiscal year. The cost of construction was approximately 4.55 million yen. Soon after completion, the drawbacks of the small design became apparent to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff. Newer Japanese destroyers, such as the had a design speed of 39 knots, much higher than that of the Tenryū. Newer American cruisers, such as the also exceeded it in firepower.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45, pp. 12-15. Plans for an additional six ships were later abandoned in favor of a series of medium-sized (5500 ton class) cruisers, based on an enlarged version of the Tenryū design. From 1935-1936, plans were considered to convert the class into a dedicated anti-aircraft / anti- submarine platforms, using eight 127 mm guns in dual turrets, eight 25-mm guns, and four depth charge launchers with 36 depth charges. The redesign would also have involved combining the smokestacks into a single stack. Funding was approved for fiscal 1937, but the plan was cancelled due to an overload in the capacity of Japanese shipyards. The plan was floated again in 1938-1939 using eight Type 98 76.2 mm guns, but eventually abandoned in favor of the s. Design The Tenryū-class vessels, termed \\"small-model\\" (or \\"3,500-Ton\\") cruisers, were designed as fast flotilla leaders for the Imperial Navy's new first- and second-class destroyers.Lacroix and Wells, Japanese Cruisers of the Pacific War, p. 18. With improvements in oil-fired turbine engine technology and the use of Brown Curtiss geared turbine engines, the Tenryū class had more than twice the horsepower of the previous , and were capable of . Three sets of turbines were used, with ten boilers fitted into three boiler rooms. Two of the boilers were mixed-firing, using a combination of oil and coal, but were converted to oil firing before the start of World War II. However, in terms of weaponry, the Tenryū class was weaker than any other contemporary cruiser. The main battery for the Tenryū class consisted of four 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns, which were also utilized as the secondary battery on the s. However, the guns were situated in single mounts on the centerline, with only a limited angle of fire, and could fire only one gun at a target immediately in front or aft of the vessel. A further weakness was the lack of room for anti-aircraft guns. Despite awareness increasing about the growing threat of aircraft to surface ships, the secondary battery of the Tenryū class consisted of only a single dual-purpose 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun, plus two 6.5 mm machine guns. The class also was the first to use triple torpedo launchers, with two centerline-mounted Type 6 21-inch launchers. No reloads were carried. The hull design resembled enlarged destroyers, with a high ratio of length to width (11.28:1) and a raised bow deck. The No.1 gun turret was situated on the foredeck, followed by a short three-story tower superstructure with the mast, and the No.2 gun turret to the rear. This was followed by a stepped hull, housing a triple torpedo launcher on the centerline, followed by a narrow amidships superstructure forming the base for three relatively low smokestacks. This was followed by the aft triple torpedo launcher and the No.3 and No.4 gun turrets. The armor protection for the hull was weak, designed primarily against the 102 mm weapons used on contemporary United States Navy destroyers. =In service modifications= In 1930 (Tenryū) and in 1933 (Tatsuta), the ships were renovated with a modified bow superstructure, replacing the canvas sides of the bridge with steel plate, and lowering the mast for increased stability. In 1936, the bridge was further reinforced with steel plate as protection against shrapnel. In July 1937, two Type 93 13 mm AA machine guns in single mounts were added on platforms near the first smokestack. These were replaced in 1940 with two twin-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns; the 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun was removed at this time. Since both vessels were regarded as second-line units by the time of World War II, wartime modifications were minor. An additional two Type 96 25-mm twin mounts were added while at Truk in February 1942. Tatsuta received a fifth Type 96 twin mount in an August 1943 refit.

Hardie was born on at New Spynie near Elgin, Morayshire, Scotland, son of John Hardie, farmer, and his wife Margaret (née Masson). He attended school in Elgin before furthering his education at the University of Aberdeen (M.B., Ch.B., 1878), he worked there for two years as a demonstrator in anatomy, then started general practice in 1880 at Forres, Morayshire. On 6 June 1883 he married Marianne Jeans at Nairn. She was the daughter of Alexander Jeans and Isabella Blythe. His eldest daughter M.I.H. Hardie, (known as Helena) was born in 1886 at Forres. After gaining his medical doctorate at Aberdeen in 1887, David Hardie emigrated with his wife and daughter to Melbourne, Australia. They soon after settled in Brisbane and he was registered in Queensland on 5 May 1887. Living initially at Stanley Villa on the south bank of the Brisbane River, he settled finally in Wickham Terrace. In 1889 his only son John Hardie, was born. In 1893, David's youngest daughter (and biographer), Jean Blythe Scot Hardie was born.Hardie, J., Early Reminiscences of Brisbane's First Medical Knight (MS F1431, University of Queensland Library) Medical career Hardie specialized in the diseases of women and children, particularly those arising from climate. In 1893, he became president of the Medical Society of Queensland, which became a branch of the British Medical Association, the predecessor of the Australian Medical Association. On a visit to Europe in 1895 (with his wife and 3 children) he investigated Röntgen's work on x-rays but although he brought radiology equipment to Australia he did not pursue the work. During this trip he spent some time back in Moray with his ailing father, and also with his elder brother John's family at Westerton Farm, Pluscarden. In 1902 he built Firhall in Wickham Terrace where he resided and practised. Hardie was a capable family physician and popular with patients in all levels of society. He won many distinctions and became Queensland president of the British Medical Association in 1910 and 1920. He was a foundation member of the University of Queensland Senate between 1911 and 1916 and chaired the Emmanuel College Council from 1911 to 1940. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served with it in France in 1915-16. Hardie was a staunch Presbyterian and after the war he became the first chairman of the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association. He was an honorary physician for years to the Hospital for Sick Children, the Lady Bowen Hospital and the Lady Lamington Hospital and also served on the Central Board of Health from 1894 to 1915 and the Medical Board of Queensland from 1894 to 1934. He published numerous journal articles and one book in 1893, Notes on Some of the More Common Diseases in Queensland in Relation to Atmospheric Conditions. Hardie retired from active practice in 1922 and investigated the treatment of tuberculosis in England and Switzerland in 1922 and 1923 on behalf of the Queensland government. In 1927 he became a founding fellow of the (Royal) Australasian College of Surgeons. He helped form the Rev. John Flynn's Aerial Medical Service of the Australian Inland Mission from 1928 and fostered the development of Alfred Traeger's pedal radio. Sir David Hardie died in Brisbane and was cremated. His patients had ranged from the vice-regal to the humblest citizen. He was survived by his wife and three children. His son John later followed in his father's footsteps as a distinguished GP. He was awarded the Military Cross during his medical war service in World War I. Honours On the recommendation of the Denham ministry, he was awarded a Knighthood Kt in the New Year honours list for 1913 and thus became Queensland's first medical Knight. In 1919 the University of Aberdeen awarded him an honorary LL.D.

He raced for four seasons between 1848 and 1851, winning all but one of his fifteen races, including The Derby and the St Leger. On his final racecourse appearance he defeated Voltigeur in what was probably the most celebrated match race in the history of British thoroughbred racing, known as The Great Match. He went on to be a success at stud both in Britain and France, where he died in 1870. The Flying Dutchman was regarded by experts as one of the greatest British racehorses of the nineteenth century. Background The Flying Dutchman, bred at Kirkleatham in Yorkshire, was a dark bay or \\"brown\\" horse standing 15.3 hands high. He had a strong back, deep shoulders, powerful hindquarters, good bone, and was a bit \\"over at the knee\\" (as were many of his offspring). The roman-nosed animal also had an exceptional stride, a quiet temper and a \\"fiery eye\\". The Flying Dutchman was by Bay Middleton, who won every race in his two seasons on the turf until he was retired due to a problem with one of his forelegs.https://archive.org/stream/chaptersfromturf00newm/chaptersfromturf00newm_djvu.txt During that time, the colt won the Riddleton Stakes, the Bruton Street Stakes, the 2,000 Guineas, the Buckhust Stakes at Ascot, the Grand Duke Michael Stakes, The Derby (against Gladiator, Venison and Slane), and his final race, a match against and Muezzin. Bay Middleton was by Sultan, winner of the Derby, and out of The Oaks winning mare Cobweb. Bay Middleton also sired Aphrodite (winner of the 1,000 Guineas), The Hermit (2000 Guineas), Andover (Derby), and Fly By Night. As a broodmare-sire, he produced Ellen Middleton, and dams of Wild Dayrell, Saunterer, Mainstone, Sunbeam, and Mainbrace. He was the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1844 and 1849.http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/BayMiddleton.html The Flying Dutchman was out of the 15-hand mare Barbelle. She was by the stallion Sandbeck, who won the 1823 Club Stakes at Doncaster and 1824 York's Fitzwilliam Stakes, and produced the colt Redshank. Her other offspring included Van Tromp (by Lanercost), who was quite successful on the turf and at stud. His success led to Lord Eglinton's decision to agree to purchase any of her future foals £1,000. He thus became the owner of Barbelle's 1846 colt foal. The Flying Dutchman was sent into training with John Fobert at Middleham. Racing career =1848: two-year-old season= The Flying Dutchman was undefeated in five races as a two-year-old in 1848. He won the July Stakes at Newmarket and a £400 Sweepstakes at the same course. At Liverpool he won a Sweepstakes for £1400. In autumn he appeared at Doncaster where he won the Champagne Stakes and one other race. His winnings for the season were £4,095. =1849: three- year-old season= As a three-year-old, The Flying Dutchman did not race before The Derby and was rumoured to be less than fully fit. He nevertheless started joint-favourite with Tadmor for the race at odds of 2/1 in a field of twenty-six runners. Ridden by Charles Marlow he led after half a mile but was overtaken in the straight by the outsider Hotspur, who was travelling strongly in the havey, muddy ground. Marlow had to use the whip twice (the only time the whip was used on The Flying Dutchman in his career) to ensure that he regained the lead and won by half a length over, with Tadmor third. Lord Eglington won heavily in betting on the race, and members of the Army and Navy Club (\\"The Rag\\") of which he was a member, reportedly took £30,000 in winning bets. John Fobert celebrated by holding a feast for a hundred poor families at Middleham. King William III of the Netherlands who was a great admirer of The Flying Dutchman, presented Fobert with a \\"magnificent breast-pin\\" in the shape of a horseshoe to commemorate the victory. He had walk-overs when no rivals opposed him in his next two races, the Produce Stakes and the Bickerstaff Stakes, both at Liverpool. He returned on 12 September for the St Leger at Doncaster, in which he started 4/9 favourite against nine rivals. Although many of fashionable visitors were deterred by the poor weather, the race attracted a huge crowd, with many arriving by rail for the first time. The Flying Dutchman was held up in the early stages before making steady progress to turn into the straight in second place behind Vatican. The favourite took the lead a furlong from the finish and won very easily by two lengths in a time of 3:20.0 from the 2000 Guineas winner Nunnykirk who finished strongly to deprive Vatican of second. A few days later he had another walk-over in the Foal Stakes. He then won by forfeit, for £500, after Honeycomb (also by Bay Middleton) was withdrawn from a scheduled match race between the two: this win is not part of the Flying Dutchman's official race record. He finished the season with the Belvoir Stakes, winning by eight lengths. =1850: four-year- old season= At four, The Flying Dutchman first won the two and a half mile Emperor of Russia's Plate by eight lengths at Royal Ascot in June. He then won the 29-furlong Goodwood Stakes for four-year-olds by 10 lengths in July. It wasn't until the Doncaster Cup that he was defeated in a two-horse race, by the 1850 Derby winner Voltigeur who had won St. Leger two days before. It is possible that The Flying Dutchman's defeat was due to the fact that the horse was not properly conditioned, since his trainer had thought that Voltigeur would forfeit. Another factor was the behaviour of jockey, Marlow, who had been drinking and ignored instructions to wait on the colt, instead crying \\"Ill show you what I've got under me today!\\" and pushing him at break-neck speed at the beginning of the race. Having started the race at odds of 2/11, The Flying Dutchman's odds in running shortened to 1/10 as he pulled progressively further ahead of his rival. His stamina, however, was being used up and although he held the lead into the straight Voltigeur, receiving nineteen pounds, wore him down to win by half a length. It was decided to scrap the original plan of retiring The Flying Dutchman after the Doncaster, and instead run him in a match race against Voltigeur to try to regain his reputation. =1851: five-year-old season= The Great Match The two- mile race was held at York on 31 May 1851, for a purse of 1,000 sovereigns. The weights for the match were set by Henry John Rous, who decided that The Flying Dutchman should carry 120½ pounds to Voltigeur's 112. The race between the two Yorkshire horses generated enormous public interest, drawing an estimated 100,000 spectators, the largest crowd to the Knavesmire since the execution of Eugene Aram in 1759. Even the horses' exercise gallops attracted large crowds of fans attempting to assess their relative condition. On the day of the race the crowd was divided into partisan camps, cheering for either \\"Volti\\" or \\"The Flyer\\". The Flying Dutchman was successfully restrained in the early stages as Voltigeur made the running. In the final furlong the Flying Dutchman moved up level with his rival and then pulled ahead to win by a length. He was then retired to stud. Stud record During his first few years at stud, The Flying Dutchman stood at Rawcliffe Paddocks, for a fee of 30 guineas. He was later sold in 1858, for a sum of 150,000 francs, to Napoleon III's National Stud and stood there until his death in 1870. In England, The Flying Dutchman produced very little of merit, despite covering a great number of mares for that time (50 mares in his first season). He was one of the top sires from 1855 to 1862, making it up to second place in 1860 and 1861 mainly due to his filly, Flying Duchess. During this time he also sired Derby winner Ellington, some good broodmares, and good jumping horses. In France, he sired Dollar, and many other top race horses, making his time there much more successful than his breeding career in England. Additionally, his blood was sent to Australia and New Zealand through granddaughter Mermaid. =Notable progeny= * Brown Duchess: 1858 filly, won the Two Year Old Stakes, the New Stakes, St. Helen's Purse, Liverpool Cup, Stanley Stakes, and Filly Stakes and placed in the Queen's Plate, Stamford Plate, and Two Year Old Plate as a two-year-old.

The Flying Dutchman bloodline carries through his two daughters the Flying Dutchess and the Dutchmans Daughter to Galopin and Man o War and to many excellent horses of more current periods of racing including Secretariat, Ruffian, Affirmed, Barbaro and Forego. In fact every Triple Crown Winner can trace back to the Flying Dutchman in their pedigree. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. The Flying Dutchman was ranked sixth, having been placed in the top ten by forty-nine of the contributors. He was the highest-placed horse to have raced before 1850.

Rhadamiste killing Zenobia (1803). Luigi Sabatelli (21 February 1772 – 29 January 1850) was an Italian painter of the Neoclassic period, active in Milan, Rome, and his native city of Florence. Biography He studied in his native city and in Rome. In 1803, with the reorganization of the Brera Academy of Fine Arts of Milan, Sabatelli was named professor of painting, replacing il Traballesi,* and held the post until his death, except for a brief furlough between 1822 and 1825. His first important work in oils was the large picture representing the Meeting of David and Abigail, which now hangs opposite Benvenuti's Judith in the Lady Chapel of the cathedral at Arezzo. Sabatelli's reputation rests on frescos (1822–1825) in the Hall of the Iliad at the Pitti Palace (the first room of the Picture Gallery), consisting of eight lunettes and a large circular medallion illustrating scenes from the Homeric poems. His sons, Giuseppe (1813–1843) and Francesco Sabatelli (1801–1829), were painters and professors of art in Florence; both died young. Among his pupils were Carlo Arienti, Giuseppe Sogni, Luigi Pedrazzi, Giuseppe Penuti, Michelangelo Fumagalli, Giacomo Marinez, Girolamo Daverio Luzzi, and Giulio Arrivabene.Caimi, page 54.

Caelum was named after the constellation Caelum. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. Construction Caelum was laid down 30 June 1943, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull No. 1860, as the Liberty ship SS Wyatt Earp, by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; launched 25 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. H. N. MacKusick; transferred to the Navy 10 August 1943; commissioned 22 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Edgar Johnson in command; and reported to the US Pacific Fleet. Service history Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Caelum carried cargo between Pearl Harbor and Tarawa, Majuro, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Ulithi, in her first year of service. Her tireless operations included participation in the occupation of Kwajalein and Majuro in February 1944, and from June through October 1944, she was assigned to Service Squadron 10. = Supporting invasion forces = A San Francisco overhaul late in 1944, was followed by Caelums assignment from 20 January 1945, as station ship at Ulithi, and from 8 May, at Guam. At these bases she controlled and issued cargo and provisions to the ships which carried out the massive operations in the Palaus, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, and the task forces which pounded Japanese bases from the air. = End-of-war activity = Returning to the States for overhaul in June and July 1945, Caelum towed to Ulithi in August, and sailed on to support the occupation of Korea in September, and to provide logistic services to ships at Shanghai in early October. From 9 November, when she arrived at Samar, Philippine Islands, the cargo ship sailed from this and various Chinese ports until clearing for the United States 15 April 1946. Post-war decommissioning Decommissioned at Seattle, Washington on 30 July 1946, Caelum was returned to the Maritime Commission the next day. She was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Olympia, Washington. Fate On 19 October 1961, she was sold to Hyman-Michaels Company, for $82,011.11, to be scrapped.

The explosion started a fire which killed 21 newspaper employees and injured 100 more. It was termed the \\"crime of the century\\" by the Times. Brothers John J. (\\"J.J.\\") and James Barnabas (\\"J.B.\\") McNamara were arrested in April 1911 for the bombing. Their trial became a cause célèbre for the American labor movement. J.B. admitted to setting the explosive, and was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. J.J. was sentenced to 15 years in prison for bombing a local iron manufacturing plant, and returned to the Iron Workers union as an organizer. Background The Iron Workers Union was formed in 1896. As the work was seasonal and most iron workers were unskilled, the union remained weak, and much of the industry remained unorganized until 1902. That year, the union won a strike against the American Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the newly formed U.S. Steel corporation. American Bridge was the dominant company in the iron industry, and within a year the Iron Workers Union had not only organized almost every United States iron manufacturer, but had also won signed contracts including union shop clauses.Rayback, pp. 219–20.Taft, pp. 275–76. The McNamara brothers were Irish American trade unionists. John (known as J.J.) and his younger brother James (known as J.B.) were both active in the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers (the Iron Workers). =Strike against American Bridge Co.= James (left) and John McNamara In 1903, officials of U.S. Steel and the American Bridge Company founded the National Erectors' Association, a coalition of steel and iron industry employers. The primary goal of the National Erectors' Association was to promote the open shop and assist employers in breaking the unions in their industries. Employers used labor spies, agents provocateurs, private detective agencies, and strike breakers to engage in a campaign of union busting. Local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies generally cooperated in this campaign, which often used violence against union members. Hard pressed by the open shop campaign, the Iron Workers reacted by electing the militant Frank M. Ryan president and John J. McNamara the secretary-treasurer in 1905.Taft, p. 276. In 1906, the Iron Workers struck at American Bridge in an attempt to retain their contract.Foner, p. 8.Stimson, p. 380; Fine, pp. 33–46. However, the open shop movement was a significant success. By 1910, U.S. Steel had almost succeeded in driving all unions out of its plants. Unions in other iron manufacturing companies also vanished. Only the Iron Workers held on (though the strike at American Bridge continued).Foner, pp. 7–8; Welskopp, pp. 156–57; Gottlieb and Wolt, pp. 88–89. =Dynamite campaign= Union officials used violence to counter the setbacks they had suffered. Beginning in late 1906, national and local officials of the Iron Workers launched a dynamiting campaign. Between 1906 and 1911, the Iron Workers blew up 110 iron works, though only a few thousand dollars in damages was done. The National Erectors' Association was well aware who was responsible for the bombings, since Herbert S. Hockin, a member of the Iron Workers' executive board, was their paid spy. These hundreds of bombs were later described as perhaps the largest domestic terrorism campaign in American history.Robert Fitch (2006) Solidarity for Sale: How Corruption Destroyed the Labor Movement and Undermined America's Promise. Bublic Affairs Books =Los Angeles strike= Los Angeles employers had been successfully resisting unionization for nearly half a century. Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, was vehemently anti- union. Otis first joined and then seized control of the local Merchants Association in 1896, renaming it the Merchants and Manufacturers' Association (colloquially known as the M&M;), and using it and his newspaper's large circulation to spearhead a 20-year campaign to end the city's few remaining unions.Cross, p. 278; Kazin, p. 203; Milkman, p. 35. Without unions to keep wages high, open shop employers in Los Angeles were able to undermine the wage standards set in heavily unionized San Francisco. Unions in San Francisco feared that employers in their city would also soon begin pressing for wage cuts and start an open shop drive of their own. The only solution they saw was to re-unionize Los Angeles.Cross, p. 282.Stimson, pp. 33–133. The San Francisco unions relied heavily on the Iron Workers, one of the few strong unions remaining in Los Angeles. The unionization campaign began in the spring of 1910. On June 1, 1910, 1,500 Iron Workers struck iron manufacturers in the city to win a $0.50 an hour minimum wage ($13.26 in 2018 dollars) and overtime pay. The M&M; raised $350,000 ($9.3 million in 2018 dollars) to break the strike. A superior court judge issued a series of injunctions which all but banned picketing. On July 15, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously enacted an ordinance banning picketing and \\"speaking in public streets in a loud or unusual tone\\", with a penalty of 50 days in jail or a $100 fine or both. Most union members refused to obey the injunctions or ordinance, and 472 strikers were arrested. The strike, however, proved effective: by September, 13 new unions had formed, increasing union membership in the city by almost 60 percent.Foner, pp. 9–10. Leading up to the explosion On June 3, 1910, two days after the start of the strike, Eugene Clancy, the top Iron Workers' Union official on the West Coast, wrote to J. J. McNamara: \\"Now, Joe, what I want here is Hockin,\\" referring to Herbert Hockin, the union official in charge of the dynamite bombings. However, Hockin had been caught taking money earmarked for bombing jobs, and J. J. McNamara no longer trusted him. McNamara asked another dynamiter, Jack Barry of St. Louis, to go to California, but Barry turned down the job when he learned of the targets. J. J. McNamara finally sent his younger brother, James B. McNamara, to California on the bombing mission.Lew Irwin, Deadly Times (Guilford, Conn.: Lyons, 2013) 74. Bombing the present 1935 building. On the evening of 30 September 1910, J. B. McNamara left a suitcase full of dynamite in the narrow alley between the Times building and the Times annex, known as \\"Ink Alley.\\" The suitcase was left near barrels of flammable printer's ink. The dynamite had a detonator connected to a mechanical windup clock, set to close an electric battery circuit at 1 am, and set off the explosion. He then left similar bombs, also set to explode at 1 am, next to the home of Times publisher Harrison Gray Otis and the home of Felix Zeehandelaar, secretary of the M&M.; McNamara then boarded a train to San Francisco, and was out of town when the Times building bomb went off.Ortie McManigal testified that Jim McNamara had told him that all three bombs (the Times building, the Otis home, and the Zeehandelaar home) were set for 1 am (\\"M'Manigal repeats boast of M'Namara,\\" N.Y. Times, 15 Nov. 1912, p.4.) Most other sources reflect this, and say that the bombs were timed to explode at 1 am. For example: Geoffrey Cowan, The People v. Clarence Darrow (New York: Random House, 1993) 87, and Lew Irwin, Deadly Times (Guilford, Conn.: Lyons, 2013) 116-118. In addition, Jim McNamara's confession specified that he set the bomb at the Times building for 1 am. Dennis McDougal, however, wrote that the Times building bomb had been set for 4 am, but detonated prematurely; the bomb at the Felix Zeehandelaar home set for 1 pm, and the bomb at the Otis home for 2 pm. Privileged Son (Cambridge, Mass.: Perseus, 2001) 50, 53. This was an escalation of the bombing campaign. Previously, only nonunion workplaces had been targeted. Now the Iron Workers union was expanding the targets to the homes of anti-union leaders, and a newspaper noted for its anti-union editorial policy.Lew Irwin, Deadly Times (Guilford, Conn.: Lyons, 2013) 71. At 1:07 a.m. on October 1, 1910, the bomb went off in the alley outside the three-story Los Angeles Times Building located at First Street and Broadway in Los Angeles. The 16 sticks of dynamite in the suitcase bomb were not enough to destroy the whole building, but the bomb ignited natural gas piped into the building. The Times was a morning paper, and so had employees working during the late-night early-morning hours. The bombers were unaware that a number of Times employees were working overnight to produce an extra edition the next afternoon which would carry the results of the Vanderbilt Cup auto race.\\"Robert Sawyer.\\" Motorsport Memorial. 2012. Accessed 2012-10-11. The bomb collapsed the side of the building, and the ensuing fire destroyed the Times building and a second structure next door that housed the paper's printing press. Of the 115 people still in the building, 21 died (most of them in the fire).Cross, pp. 282–83; Adamic, p. 151.\\"Fire Kills 19, Unions Accused\\", New York Times, October 2, 1910.\\"Twenty-One Killed and More Injured In the Dynamited 'Times' Building,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 2, 1910; \\"Los Angeles Times Ruins Yield Five More Bodies\\", New York Times, October 3, 1910 The Times called the bombing the \\"crime of the century\\",\\"The Crime of the Century,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 16, 1910 and publisher Otis excoriated unions as \\"anarchic scum,\\" \\"cowardly murderers,\\" \\"leeches upon honest labor,\\" and \\"midnight assassins.\\"Adamic, p. 211 The exact number of deaths is uncertain. The remains of 20 were identified. Parts of either one or two additional bodies were pulled from the rubble.Lew Irwin, Deadly Times (Guilford, Conn.: Lyons, 2013) 337-338. An unresolved contradiction was J. B. McNamara's knowledge of the gas pipes in the Times building. After he confessed to the bombing, he insisted that he had not known of the gas pipes.McDougal, p. 53. However, Ortie McManigal testified that before their arrest, McNamara had told him that he had gone into the Times building – he was challenged twice, but each time passed by saying he was on his way to the composing room – went into the basement and wrenched off a gas valve, to maximize the destruction.\\"M'Manigal repeats boast of M'Namara,\\" N.Y. Times, 15 Nov. 1912, p.4. =Other bombs= On the morning of 1 October, Zeehandelaar's maid found a package behind a bush beneath a bedroom window. Police were called, and opened and disarmed the bomb. The spring of the mechanical clock had apparently been wound too tightly, slowing the clock, and preventing the bomb from exploding on time. The unexploded bomb contained valuable clues as to the bombers' method. In addition, investigators were able to trace the dynamite back to its source. The caretaker at the Otis home heard of the Zeehandelaar bomb, and decided to search around the Otis house. He found a leather suitcase behind some bushes under a bay window. Again the police arrived, and carried the suitcase away from the house and out in the open. But while they were cutting open the suitcase, the clockwork alarm went off inside the suitcase. The police ran to safety just before the bomb exploded. Investigators speculated that, like the Zeehandelaar bomb, the clock mechanism at the Otis house had been wound too tightly, delaying the explosion. On the same night as the Times building explosion, there was a reported attempted break-in at the Times auxiliary building, in which two men were chased off by a security guard. The incident was at first assumed to be another bombing attempt.\\"Editors and printers meet awful death in flames following big explosion,\\" Oakland Tribune, 1 Oct. 1910, p.2. The Iron Workers strike committee in Los Angeles and Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), immediately condemned the bombing and claimed no labor union or individual could have been responsible.Foner, pp. 11, 14; Irwin, pp. 14–15. =Bombing returns to L.A.= After several months, it appeared that the Times bombers had escaped arrest and gone to ground. The Iron Workers union decided it was time for more bombings in Los Angeles, and sent Ortie McManigal with a list of five bombing targets, including the Times auxiliary printing plant, the Llewellyn Iron Works, the Baker Iron Works, and two nonunion construction sites: the Los Angeles County Hall of Records and the Hotel Alexandria. J. J. McNamara told McManigal that he had promised the \\"coast bunch\\" a Christmas present, and wanted the explosions to take place on Christmas Day. McManigal set off a dynamite bomb at the Llewellyn Iron Works, partially wrecking the plant with the damage costing $25,000, but he found two of the other sites too closely guarded, and never visited the remaining two. J. J. McNamara was angry that only one of the sites was bombed, but McManigal told him that security was too tight.Taft, p. 281; Estrada, p. 140. Tracking down the bombers William J. Burns The Times and law enforcement authorities announced that the perpetrators would be caught immediately, but weeks passed, and no arrests were made. The City of Los Angeles posted a $25,000 reward for the capture of the bombers, and the M&M; raised another $50,000. Los Angeles Mayor George Alexander hired private detective William J. Burns on October 2, 1910, to catch the guilty parties.Associated Press, \\"Strange Story Is Told By Detective: Burns Narrative Takes on Color as Dynamite Case Is Fully Probed\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 1 December 1912, Volume XXXVII, Number 37, page 2. Burns had been investigating the nationwide wave of iron manufacturing plant bombings for the past four years on behalf of the National Erectors' Association,Adamic, p. 155. and took the City job as part of his investigation. From his paid Iron Workers spy, Hockin, Burns learned that Iron Workers union member Ortie McManigal had been handling the Iron Workers' bombing campaign on orders from union president Ryan and secretary-treasurer McNamara. McManigal and McNamara were borderline alcoholics who liked to drink and hunt at the same time. Burns infiltrated one of their late-winter hunting trips with a spy, and during the trip McNamara boasted of having blown up the Times building. The undercover private eye also surreptitiously took a photo of McNamara. Burns showed the photo to a hotel clerk in Los Angeles, who recognized McNamara as a \\"Mr. J. B. Bryce\\" who had checked in the day before the bombing and hurriedly checked out the following morning.McDougal, pp. 52–53. =Arrest of J. B. McNamara and Ortie McManigal= On April 14, 1911, Burns, Burns' son, Raymond, and police officers from Detroit and Chicago went to the Oxford Hotel in Detroit and arrested McManigal and James B. McNamara. Dynamite, blasting caps and alarm clocks were found in their suitcases.Foner, p. 12. The men were told they were being arrested for robbing a bank in Chicago. Since they had watertight alibis for that alleged crime, both men agreed to accompany Burns and the police officers back to Chicago.Burns, p. 146; Stimson, p. 387.McDougal claims that McManigal and McNamara were kidnapped, not arrested. When McNamara screamed for help, a local Detroit policeman intervened. Burns convinced McManigal to come quietly, and McManigal and McNamara did so. McDougal cites no sources for his version of the story. See McDougal, p. 54. In Chicago, McManigal and McNamara were not taken to a police station, but to the private home of Chicago Police Sergeant William Reed and held from April 13 until April 20.Historian Philip Taft characterizes this as a kidnapping, due to the lack of due process and jurisdiction. Taft, p. 277; see also Foner, p. 13. Burns apparently convinced McManigal that he knew everything and that McManigal could save himself by cutting a deal with authorities. McManigal agreed to tell all he knew in order to secure a lighter prison sentence, and signed a confession. He said that he had not participated in the Times bombing, but that Jim McNamara had told him all about it, and that it was done by Jim (J. B.) McNamara and two others, Matthew Schmidt and David Caplan (Schmidt and Caplan evaded arrest until 1915). McManigal also said that others involved included union president Ryan, J. J. McNamara, Hockin and other Iron Worker leaders.Burns, pp. 151–55; Stimson, pp. 387–88. Burns wired California officials and secured extradition papers for McManigal, J. B. McNamara and J. J. McNamara. Burns left for Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Iron Workers had their headquarters. With the assistance of officials of the National Erectors' Association, he convinced Governor Thomas R. Marshall to issue an arrest warrant for J. J. McNamara. =Raid on union headquarters and arrest of J. J. McNamara= On April 22, Burns and two local police detectives burst into an executive board meeting of the Iron Workers and arrested McNamara. J. J. McNamara was taken before a local circuit court. The judge refused McNamara's request for an attorney and, without legal authority to do so,Foner, p. 13. released J. J. McNamara into the custody of Burns. From arrest to departure took 30 minutes. The same day, McManigal and J. B. McNamara were taken by Los Angeles police by train to California. All three men arrived in Los Angeles on April 26.Taft, p. 277.Foner, pp. 12–13; Stimson, p. 389; Adamic, pp. 155–56. Organized labor unites in defense of the McNamaras The national labor movement was outraged by the way the McNamaras had been treated, and labor leaders were quick to defend the brothers' innocence. They contended that Burns had engaged in kidnapping, misrepresentation of his status as a law enforcement officer, and unlawful imprisonment in his handling of McManigal and J. B. McNamara. The local circuit judge had unlawfully denied J. J. McNamara access to legal representation and had no authority to approve his extradition. Both McNamaras had been arrested on the basis of a confession wrung from a third man who, they believed, had been kidnapped and perhaps coerced into confessing. To many in organized labor, the McNamara case appeared to be a repeat of the Bill Haywood case of 1906. In that case, leaders of the Western Federation of Miners were accused of using dynamite to assassinate an ex-governor of Idaho. As in the McNamara case, a union member had confessed and implicated union leadership, the defendants were extradited in a highly irregular manner, and the prosecution's investigation was led by a detective with strong ties to anti-union business interests. In that case, the accused union leaders were found not guilty.Foner, pp. 13–14. Labor leaders were also convinced of the McNamaras' innocence by other factors as well. The open shop movement and virulent hostility shown by Otis convinced many that the whole event was a frame-up (with some, including Eugene V. Debs, accusing Otis himself of bombing the Times building). Burns repeatedly implied that Gompers and other labor leaders were involved in the national bombing campaign, and AFL officials feared a national campaign of arrests designed to destroy the nascent labor movement might be in the works. Meanwhile, George Alexander, Mayor of Los Angeles, was locked in a very close re-election battle against Job Harriman, a Socialist Party of America candidate. The bombing, some felt, might simply be a plot to keep Harriman out of City Hall.Foner, pp. 14–16. Organized labor found J. J. McNamara an attractive figure to rally behind. By outward appearances, he did not look like a man who would dynamite his enemies. He was 34 years old, handsome, had an athletic build, always well-dressed and well-spoken. He had earned a law degree at night while working for the Iron Workers' Union.Geoffrey Cowan, The People v. Clarence Darrow (New York: Random House, 1993) 78-79, 110. J. J. McNamara assured Gompers that he had nothing to do with the Times bombing. Gompers believed him completely, and threw all his influence behind the McNamaras. With Gompers' endorsement, the entire US labor movement supported the McNamaras, with parades, mass rallies, publicity campaigns, and donations to the McNamaras' defense fund. Burns was offended by accusations from labor supporters that he had planted the evidence that he had seized at the union headquarters in Indianapolis. He was particularly critical of Samuel Gompers. Burns did not believe that Gompers was part of the dynamite plot, but blamed Gompers for being irresponsible in accusing Burns of framing the McNamaras, in the face of overwhelming evidence. Burns wrote that Gompers could not have been unaware of the four-year dynamiting campaign, which should have given him pause. =Gas explosion defense= The defense blamed the L.A. Times explosion on an accidental ignition of a gas leak, and denied that dynamite was in any way involved. The rest of the evidence, such as the other bombs found in Los Angeles the next morning, and all the material seized at union headquarters at Indianapolis, they claimed was planted. They accused Otis of taking advantage of a tragic accident to imprison union leaders on fabricated charges. To support the accidental gas explosion theory, the State Federation of Labor of California appointed a committee to travel to Los Angeles and investigate the matter. The committee included a number of Western Federation of Miners members, who would have been familiar with dynamite. The committee reported back that there were no signs of a dynamite explosion at the Times building, and that it was solely a gas explosion. They also concluded that Otis knew that it was an accident, but had fabricated charges against the McNamaras, partly to discredit labor unions, and partly to evade blame for his negligence that allowed the gas accident to happen. The report declared: > On the other hand. those who are familiar with the peculiarities of > explosions by dynamiting, the evidence furnishes an overwhelming certainty > that there was no dynamite connected with the affair.\\"Law's classification > in kidnapping case,\\" The Motorman and Conductor, May 1911, v.19 n.6 p.37. Some went farther. Eugene Debs accused Harrison Otis of blowing up his own building to frame labor leaders. He referred to the bombing as: \\"a job that General Otis did himself or had it done, for I know the man well.\\"The Commercial Telegraphers' Journal, Oct. 1911, v.9 n.10 p.300. Clarence Darrow for the defense Clarence Darrow Iron Workers president Frank Ryan asked Clarence Darrow to defend the McNamaras. Darrow had become a hero in labor circles for his successful defense of labor leader Bill Haywood in 1906. However, Darrow was in ill health, and although organized labor was convinced of the McNamaras' innocence, Darrow realized that the evidence against them was overwhelming and that the brothers were almost certainly guilty. Soon after the arrest, and before he agreed to represent the McNamaras, he confided this to a journalist as the reason he was reluctant to take the case.Geoffrey Cowan, The People v. Clarence Darrow (New York: Random House, 1993) 123. Ryan turned to Harriman, who agreed to be the brothers' defense attorney. Gompers, however, visited Darrow in Chicago and convinced him that the case required his expertise. Reluctantly, Darrow consented to be lead defense attorney. Harriman stayed on as his assistant. Darrow also recruited former Los Angeles county assistant district attorney Lecompte Davis, pro-union Indiana judge Cyrus F. McNutt, and president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Joseph Scott as co-counsel for the defense.Taft, pp. 278, 280; Foner, pp. 17–18. The McNamaras were arraigned on May 5, 1911. They pled not guilty. McManigal, who had turned state's evidence, was not charged at that time.Foner, p. 18. Darrow argued that he would need $350,000 ($ in ) for the defense. The AFL, who had already paid Darrow a $50,000 retainer, immediately began to raise the additional funds. The AFL Executive Council established a permanent \\"Ways and Means Committee\\" to seek money. The federation appealed to local, state, regional and national unions to donate 25 cents per capita to the defense fund, and set up defense committees in larger cities throughout the nation to take donations. Darrow also insisted that he needed popular support, to put political pressure on the prosecution. Pins, buttons and other paraphernalia were sold to raise money, and a film about J. J. McNamara—A Martyr to His Cause—was produced. It premiered in Cincinnati, Ohio and an estimated 50,000 people paid to see it. Labor Day throughout the nation was declared to be \\"McNamara Day\\", and mass marches were held in 13 major cities in support of the defendants.Foner, pp. 18–20. Members of the pool from which the jury was chosen. Jury selection began on October 25.Foner, p. 21. As voir dire continued, Darrow became increasingly concerned about the outcome of the trial.Darrow, p. 179–181. He felt J. B. could not be relied on as a witness and would break down under cross-examination. On October 15, he learned that the prosecution had acquired masses of evidence to support 21 separate charges. On October 18, he learned that U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham had obtained enough evidence on his own to secure, with President William Howard Taft's approval, a federal subpoena against the McNamaras. The first panel of jurors was exhausted on October 25, forcing the court to order an additional panel of jurors to appear. The jury was finally seated on November 7. =Plea negotiations= As jury selection continued, muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens arrived in Los Angeles. Steffens, convinced the McNamaras were guilty, visited them in jail. Steffens proposed to defend their actions in print as \\"justifiable dynamiting\\"Foner, p. 22. in the face of employer violence and state-sponsored repression of labor unions. J.B. was an eager proponent of Steffens' plans, but J.J. refused to cooperate unless Darrow agreed. Darrow was stunned by Steffens' report that the brothers had admitted their guilt to him, but with his health worsening and his pessimism about the defense growing, Darrow agreed to permit the McNamaras to cooperate with Steffens.Foner, p. 21–22; Darrow, p. 182; Steffens, p. 662. The weekend of November 19–20, Darrow and Steffens met with newspaper publisher E. W. Scripps. During their discussions of the trial, Darrow raised the possibility of pressuring the prosecution into accepting a plea bargain. In exchange for light prison terms for the McNamaras, the AFL would end its debilitating strike and organizing efforts against Los Angeles employers. Steffens met with Otis and Harry Chandler, Otis' son-in-law and assistant general manager at the Los Angeles Times.Chandler had left the Los Angeles Times building minutes before the October 1 bomb blast. See: \\"Fire Kills 19, Unions Accused\\", The New York Times, October 2, 1910 Both men agreed to the plan. The success of the AFL's public opinion campaign had apparently worried both newspapermen, and the Iron Workers' success in maintaining (even widening) the strike had weakened the resolve of many in the Los Angeles business community. Chandler offered to open negotiations with the district attorney, John D. Fredericks.Foner, p. 23.McDougal, p. 56–57; Darrow, p. 181; Steffens, p. 674–675. Although a group of Los Angeles businessmen had endorsed the secret talks, they had no legal power over the prosecutor, Fredericks. Fredericks refused to sanction any plan which let the McNamaras go free. The National Erectors' Association had learned of the talks (both the defense and prosecution had their paid spies in the other's camp),McDougal, p. 56. and was pressing Fredericks to reject any plea bargain. As a compromise, Fredericks demanded that J.B. receive life in prison and J.J. receive a much shorter term.Stimson, p. 405. =McNamaras plead guilty= The agreement was laid before the McNamara brothers. J. B. initially refused to agree to any plea bargain that did not set his brother free. But when Darrow told him that a settlement was possible only if both brothers pleaded guilty, J. B. gave his consent.Foner, p. 23-24; Darrow, p. 183; Steffens, p. 682. Darrow sent for a representative of the AFL. The shocked labor leader refused to accept the agreement until Darrow convinced him that the defense had almost no chance.Foner, p. 24. Darrow had hoped that a plea bargain (rather than an admission of guilt in open court) would be all that was needed. But Los Angeles employers were worried that defense attorney Harriman would trounce Mayor Alexander on election day (December 5). Nothing short of an actual admission of guilt in open court would discredit Harriman and prevent his victory, and the employers were pressing hard for one.Taft, p. 281. The defense's position weakened further when, on November 28, Darrow was accused of attempted bribery of a juror. The defense team's chief investigator had been arrested for bribing a juror, and Darrow had been seen in public passing the investigator money. With Darrow himself on the verge of being discredited, the defense's hope for a simple plea agreement ended.Cowan, p. 364-365. Puck magazine edition of December 27, 1911 (v. 70, no. 1817) depicting the flareback of the bombing. On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas in open court to guilty. James B. McNamara admitted to murder by having set the bomb that destroyed the Los Angeles Times building on October 1, 1910. John J. McNamara, setting foot for the first time in court, admitted to having ordered the bombing of the Llewellyn Iron Works on December 25.Foner, p. 25. J.J. McNamara later told an interviewer that Darrow had kept the McNamara brothers isolated from public opinion. Had they known how strongly the public was on their side, they would not have agreed to the plea deal, he claimed.Foner, p. 28. At his sentencing hearing, Jim McNamera's confession was read in court: Judge Bordwell rejected the defendants' assertions that they did not intend to harm the Times workers: > A man who would put sixteen sticks of 80 per cent dynamite in a building  > * in which you, as a printer, knew gas was burning in many places, and in > which you knew there were scores of human beings toiling, must have no > regard whatever for the lives of his fellow beings. He must have been a > murderer at heart.George P. Costigan Jr., Cases and Other Authorities on > Legal Ethics (St. Paul: West, 1917) 347. After sentencing, Judge Bordwell issued a long statement minimizing the role of Lincoln Steffens in bringing about the plea deal. Bordwell wrote that the prosecution had long sought a plea deal, but could not agree to J. B.'s insistence that his brother go free. The judge stated that what really broke the deadlock was the arrest of Bert Franklin, a detective hired by the defense, on a charge of attempted bribery of jurors. The bribery attempt, he wrote, revealed how desperate the defense was, and forced them to agree to a prison sentence for J. J.\\"With the two brothers in San Quentin all is quiet,\\" The Square Deal, Jan. 1912, v.9 n.78 p.530. =Reactions to the guilty pleas= Prosecutor Fredericks justified the plea deal because by having the McNamaras plead guilty, he said, there would be no doubt of their guilt; without a guilty plea, their supporters would always believe that they were framed.\\"With the two brothers in San Quentin all is quiet,\\" The Square Deal, Jan. 1912, v.9 n.78 p.527. Darrow was later criticized for misleading and pressuring the McNamaras into each pleading guilty. There remained a suspicion that, following the arrest of his chief jury investigator Burt Franklin on charges of attempted bribery of jurors,Christianson, Stephen G., \\"McNamara Brothers Trial: 1911\\", \\"Great American Trials\\", Knappman, Edward W., editor, Visible Ink Press, Detroit, Michigan, 1994, , page 252. Darrow needed to hurry up the guilty pleas, because he knew that he would be accused of attempted bribery as well, and one of his defenses would be that a plea deal had already been agreed upon, so that he had no motive to bribe jurors.Gerald F. Uelmen, \\"Fighting fire with fire: a reflection on the ethics of Clarence Darrow,\\" Fordham Law Review, 2003, v.71 n.4 p.1564. Darrow defended the guilty pleas by citing the overwhelming evidence against the brothers: > From the first there was never the slightest chance to win. To those who say > it would have been better to have gone to trial and suffered complete > defeat, I would call attention to the fact that there were thirty or forty > hotel registers, three in Los Angeles, many in San Francisco and others in > different parts of the country. There were scores of witnesses to identify > J. B. McNamara as being present practically on the very day, and one at > least, in the building. There was overwhelming evidence of all kinds, which > no one could have surmounted if they would.\\"With the two brothers in San > Quentin all is quiet,\\" The Square Deal, Jan. 1912, v.9 n.78 p.531. Following the guilty pleas, Darrow was criticized for using deception to raise money for his clients' defense: allowing supporters to believe in their innocence, in order to raise a war chest of $200,000 from contributions by working men, and spend about $100,000 of it to mount an expensive effort, while knowing all along that the McNamara brothers were guilty. Darrow said that his first duty was to his clients, and that he did whatever needed to raise the funds for the best defense possible.Geoge F. Costigan, Cases and Other Authorities on Legal Ethics (St. Paul: West, 1917) 343-352. Samuel Gompers was traveling by rail in New Jersey when the change in plea was made. A reporter with the Associated Press boarded his train, woke him, and handed him the dispatch regarding the guilty verdicts. \\"I am astounded, I am astounded\\", he said. \\"The McNamaras have betrayed labor.\\"Foner, pp. 25–26 The Socialist Party, however, refused to condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were justified in view of the supposed employer- and state- sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment.Foner, p. 27. Wrote Debs: > It is easy enough for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his > typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But let him be one of > them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the > brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to > strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his > wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate to condemn these as > criminals who fight against the crimes of which they are the victims of such > savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters. Darrow's co-counsel on the McNamara case, Job Harriman, was defeated by Mayor Alexander in a landslide loss on December 5. Although Harriman had run ahead of Alexander in the 5-way primary, winning 44% of the vote to Alexander's 37%, following the McNamara confession Harriman received just 38% of the votes in the runoff. The two brothers entered San Quentin State Prison on December 9. J.B. McNamara's post-trial conclusion was: \\"You see? ... The whole damn world believes in dynamite.\\"Hartshorn, p. 215. Big trial in Indianapolis As part of the McNamara brothers' plea bargain, Los Angeles prosecutors had agreed not to pursue other labor union officials for the L.A. bombings. But the federal government was not a party to the agreement, and in 1912 brought charges against 54 union men, mostly national and local officials of the Iron Workers Union, for involvement in a five-year nationwide campaign of dynamite. Because such things as murder or destruction of property were not federal crimes, the defendants were charged with the federal crime of conspiracy to illegally transport dynamite on railroad trains. A number of different attorneys represented different defendants, but leading the defense was sitting US senator from Indiana, John W. Kern. Leading up to the trial, the number of defendants was reduced from 54 to 48. The McNamara brothers were dropped from the trial because they were already imprisoned in California; two more pled guilty; one was a fugitive and could not be found; and the trial of one was delayed because of an injury. Judge A. B. Anderson dismissed charges against eight men after the trial started, for lack of evidence.\\"38 labor leaders are found guilty,\\" New York Times, 29 Dec. 1912, p.9. Frank Eckhoff, a friend of John J. McNamara, testified that, following the Times bombing, James B. McNamara had asked him to murder Mary Dye, a stenographer at union headquarters, because \\"she knew too much.\\" Jim McNamara had wanted him to plant an explosive under her seat on a commuter train. Eckhoff had refused.\\"Tells of dynamite plot to slay girl,\\" New York Times, 17 Nov. 1912, p.12. On 28 December 1912, the jury found 38 of the remaining 40 guilty. Two days later, Judge A. B. Anderson handed out sentences, calling the dynamite campaign \\"a veritable reign of terror,\\" and commenting: > The evidence shows some of these defendants to be guilty of murder, but they > are not charged with that crime; this court cannot punish them for it, nor > should it be influenced by such consideration in fixing the measure > punishment for the crimes charged.\\"33 dynamiters get prison terms,\\" New York > Times, 31 Dec. 1912, p.1. Six defendants were given suspended sentences. Union president Frank Ryan was handed the longest sentence, seven years. Six more men, including San Francisco labor leader Olaf Tveitmoe and prosecution informer Herbert Hockin, were given six years. The others received sentences of between a year and a day and four years. All prisoners were sent to the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.United Press, \\"Ryan is given 7 years,\\" Pittsburgh (PA) Press, 30 Dec. 1912, p.1.Taft, pp. 283–84; Stimson, p. 412. Thirty defendants appealed. In June 1914, the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ordered new trials for five of the convictions, including that of Olaf Tveitmoe. In the case of Tveitmoe, the court ruled that evidence implicating him in the Los Angeles Times bombing was irrelevant to the federal charges, because that incident did not involve interstate transportation of dynamite. Citing abundant evidence in the trial record, the court upheld the remaining 25 convictions.Ryan v. United States, United States Circuit Courts of Appeals Reports, 1915, v.132, p.257-305. The following month, the US district attorney announced that, in light of the court of appeals ruling, that the government would not retry the five defendants whose convictions were reversed; the five were released.\\"Labor conspiracy cases disposed of in federal court,\\" Rochester (NY) Democrat and Chronicle, 4 July 1914, p.1. The Iron Workers suffered severe membership losses, and appealed to the AFL for funds. The AFL declined to offer financial assistance or permit Gompers to speak at the next Iron Workers convention. The heads of a number of AFL unions did speak, however, and Iron Worker delegates re-elected Ryan president.Taft, pp. 284–85. Final cases: Caplan and Schmidt After the Indianapolis trials, the only cases remaining were of David Caplan and Matthew Schmidt, two anarchists who had helped Jim McNamara buy the dynamite used in the Los Angeles bombings. Both were indicted in 1911, but they became fugitives and evaded the police. On July 4, 1914, a dynamite bomb exploded in a New York tenement apartment occupied by three anarchists. All three men died in the explosion, which destroyed the building, killed a woman in the next apartment, and injured many more. Police speculated that the bomb was intended to be used the following day in Tarrytown, New York, where a number of anarchists, including one of the dead bombers, were due to face charges connected with attempted invasion of the Rockefeller summer estate.\\"Anarchist bomb believed for Rockefeller kills three I.W.W. makers and a woman-injures many--wrecks tenement house,\\" New York Sun, 5 July 1914, p.1. The incident seemed unconnected with the Iron Workers bombings, but William J. Burns learned that fragments of the bomb showed similar construction to the Los Angeles Times bombs. Based on the similarity of bombs, Burns concentrated his search on anarchist circles in New York City. He found Matthew Schmidt, and was at the scene when New York City policemen arrested Schmidt on February 13, 1915.\\"4-year chase lands alleged dynamiter,\\" New York Times, 14 Feb. 1915, p.1. Burns' agents had been watching Schmidt for some time, hoping to arrest Caplan as well, but finally settled for Schmidt alone. But a search of Schmidt's belongings found a letter that led them to the Seattle area, where local police arrested David Caplan on February 18, 1915.\\"Letter found here betrays Caplan,\\" New York Times, 20 Feb. 1915, p.6. San Francisco labor leader Olaf Tveitmoe, who had been released from prison the previous year, promised that the two men would be defended at the expense of West Coast labor unions.\\"Schmidt and Caplan face murder charge on coast,\\" Indianapolis Star, 4 Mar. 1915, p.2. \\"$5,000 donated by unions for Schmidt- Caplan Case,\\" Indianapolis Star, 7 Jan. 1916, p.5 c.3.

Schmidt and Caplan were tried separately in Los Angeles. Matthew Schmidt was convicted of murder in December 1915, and received life imprisonment.Associated Press, \\"Jury fixes sentence for life,\\" Oakland (CA) Tribune, 31 Dec. 1915, p.6. Upon his conviction, Olaf Tveitmoe, secretary of the California Building Trades Council said: \\"There will be ten years' war in Los Angeles. They will pay for this.\\"\\"Labor leaders and hypocrisy,\\" Sunset, Feb. 1916, p.32. David Caplan's first trial ended in a deadlocked jury.

Aftermath The labor movement in Los Angeles collapsed, and union membership in the city remained minuscule almost a century later. Employers refused to honor additional terms of the plea agreement, which required the convening of a meeting of labor union and employers and an end to the open shop campaign. Instead, employers redoubled their efforts to break the labor movement in Los Angeles. The Central Labor Council suffered severe membership losses in the early months of 1912, and the labor movement in the city did not begin to show signs of growth until the 1950s.Foner, pp. 29–30. Darrow was indicted on two charges of jury tampering. His chief investigator turned state's evidence, and even implicated Samuel Gompers in the bribery attempt. Darrow was in financial difficulty, and asked for AFL assistance in raising funds for his defense. Gompers declined to give it. When the presidents of the United Mine Workers of America and Western Federation of Miners issued an appeal for donations, the AFL Executive Council postponed consideration of a donation until the issue was moot.Taft, p. 284. Darrow was acquitted in his first trial. When charges were brought in the second bribery case, the trial ended in a hung jury.Cowan, pp. 428, 433. Journalist Lincoln Steffens was so troubled by the vituperation heaped on the McNamara brothers that he began a campaign to ease economic and class differences in the United States. By mid-1912, a number of prominent individuals — including social workers Jane Addams and Lillian Wald, industrialist Henry Morgenthau, Sr., journalist Paul Kellogg, jurist Louis Brandeis, economist Irving Fisher, and pacifist minister John Haynes Holmes—had asked President Taft to appoint a commission on industrial relations to ease economic tensions in the country. Taft requested that Congress approve a commission, and it did so on August 23, 1912. The reports of the Commission on Industrial Relations, led by Frank P. Walsh, helped establish the eight-hour day and the World War I-era War Labor Board, and profoundly influenced most New Deal labor legislation.Taft, pp. 286–87.Kaufman, pp. 3, 8–9. Ortie McManigal served two and a half years in prison before being released on parole.\\"McManigal's Liberty Near,\\" The New York Times, November 2, 1913 J. B. McNamara became a hero to radicals who believed in violence. Although he had not previously been political, he embraced violent radicalism in return. Despite repeated attempts by left-wing labor leaders and certain politicians to win his release, he refused to file any parole requests. James B. \\"J.B.\\" McNamara died of cancer in San Quentin on March 9, 1941.\\"M'Namara, Bomber, Dies In San Quentin\\", The New York Times, March 9, 1941Foner, p. 29.Lew Irwin, Deadly Times (Guilford, Conn.: Lyons, 2013) 335. J. J. McNamara left prison after nine years, and the Iron Workers' union welcomed him back as an organizer. He was convicted of threatening the destruction of a building unless the contractor hired union members, and was sent back to prison. Released once more, the union discovered that he had embezzled $200, and fired him. J. J. spent the rest of his life drifting from job to job, and died in Butte, Montana on May 8, 1941. In 1947, Matthew Schmidt married socially prominent Beth Livermore shortly after he was paroled from San Quentin Prison. Schmidt had been convicted of driving the getaway car. Schmidt was with Livermore when she drowned in 1954 after driving her car into a creek. He survived.

In Canada, he is noted as the first bishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Canada, and was the first Eastern Catholic bishop with full jurisdiction ever appointed in the New World. He was born into a fairly well to-do and political active peasant family in the village of Dobromirka in Zbarazh powiat (county), then part of Galicia, in Austria-Hungary in 1877. He received his primary education in his native village and the county town, and later studied at the classical gymnasium in Ternopil, where he graduated in 1897 with honors. He then worked as a tutor for the children of Prince Leo Sapieha in Bilche Zolote, and then did a year of military service, taking officer's training in Vienna. He studied law at the University of Lviv and theology at Lviv Theological Seminary. In 1902 he entered the Collegium Canisianum in Innsbruck, Austria. Budka was ordained as a priest by Metropolitan Andriy (Sheptytsky) in L'viv, the capital of Austrian Galicia, on October 25, 1905 at the age of twenty-eight. In 1907 Budka was named the prefect of the seminary in Lviv. In 1909 he wrote a doctoral dissertation on Byzantine religious history 1909 entitled Діссертация докторска: Дисциплїна Грецкої Церкви в сьвітлі полєміки за часів Фотия, but was not able to defend it due to ill health and later his departure for Canada. Besides his other duties he was later also made an adviser to the marriage tribunal and a consultant on emigration issues, which became his real avocation. During his studies, in 1907, he organized a Galician branch of the St. Raphael Society (an immigrants' aid charity) to protect Ukrainian emigrants from Galicia and Bukovina, and worked in the organization for five years, during which time he toured Ukrainian settlements in Prussia and Bosnia. He was also the founder and editor of the monthly publication Емігрант (\\"Emigrant\\") from 1910 - 1912. During this time he was charged with the care of Ukrainian immigrants in Austria, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Bosnia by Metropolitan Andriy. He was appointed bishop for Ukrainian Catholics in Canada and titular bishop of Patara on July 15, 1912 by Pope Pius XI, and was consecrated (ordained a bishop) on October 14 of that year. He arrived in Winnipeg in December of 1912 and immediately embarked on a tour of the Ukrainian block settlements of Western Canadian by train, horse, and foot in difficult winter conditions, returning in March 1913. His first organization tasks were to secure charters of incorporation under provincial laws for various parishes and one under federal law for the eparchy as a whole. The highly controversial issue of who should own church property in Canada: a local parish council, or the (Latin-controlled) hierarchy was thus somewhat diffused. He also took over the newspaper Canadian Ruthenian from the Latin bishops and published his pastoral letters in it. In Canada he helped to establish residences for Ukrainian youth, organize parishes, build churches and schools, and found the seminaries named for Andriy Sheptytsky in Saint- Boniface, Manitoba and Taras Shevchenko in Edmonton, Alberta. In Canada, he became known as a strident defender of the autonomy of the Ukrainian church from the Latin hierarchy, and a fierce opponent of missionary activities amongst Ukrainian Canadians by Russian Orthodox and Protestant churches, and of secularism. He was broadly supportive of Ukrainian nationalism. Before the Great War, his greatest struggle was against a group of young anti-clerical professionals, mostly teachers. They sought to establish or defend Ukrainian institutions in Canada with an overtly nationalist (and often secular) orientation. They saw Budka as insufficiently nationalist, bound to the Latin hierarchy, seeking to establish Catholic predominance over the Ukrainian community, and the hierarchy's control of the church (including the flash point issue of ownership of church buildings). This ultimately led to the creation of the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada by dissenting parishes in 1918 and a full schism between that group at the Catholic church. By the same token the socialist wing of the community started its own quasi- church institution, the Ukrainian Labour Temple Association, in 1918. While most Ukrainians in Canada were still Catholic, after 1918 the Catholic Church permanently lost its role as the predominate institution of Ukrainian life. Statue of Nykyta Budka on the grounds of St. Josaphat Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta In Canada Budka is most famous for his pastoral letter just before the outbreak of World War I, in which he urged Ukrainians in Canada with reservist obligations to return to their homeland to enlist and fight. Their homeland was Austria, which soon was at war with Canada. Although he later retracted his letter, the damage was already done. This helped inflame an existing suspicion and scrutiny of the Ukrainian Canadian community by the wider public and the government that led to the internment of Ukrainians in Canada during the war. Budka, who was naturalized as British subject (i.e. Canadian citizen) in 1918 or 1920 was charged twice with crimes of disloyalty and cleared in both cases. Following the war he continued his organizational work despite his eparchy's precarious finances: he help found the Ukrainian National Council in Winnipeg in 1919, hosted a sobor (synod) in Yorkton in 1924. He continued until 1927, when he left for a visit to Rome and while there asked to be transferred back to Galicia, exhausted from his fifteen years at the head of the Canadian church. In 1928, he returned to now Polish-controlled Galicia and became vicar general of the Metropolitan Curia in L'viv and worked on the restoration of the Shrine of the Virgin in Zarvanytsia. At the end of World War II, Galicia was occupied by the Soviet Union, and Budka opposed the communist-mandated separation of the Ukrainian Catholic Church from Rome, and for this he was imprisoned on April 11, 1945, along with other bishops. He was charged with teaching in an underground seminary, conducting a memorial service for the victims of the Soviet occupation of Galicia in 1939, and campaigning for the secession of Ukraine for the Soviet Union. Sentenced to 8 years imprisonment, he was sent to Kazakhstan to serve his sentence. He died in the Gulag on September 28, 1949 from what Soviet officials said was a heart attack. The location of the prison camp's cemetery was kept secret from locals but is believed to be where a pig farm is located today. Budka was beatified as a martyr on June 27, 2001, in a Byzantine rite ceremony by Pope John Paul II in Lviv.

Gonadoblastomas are by definition benign, but more than 50% have a co-existing dysgerminoma which is malignant, and an additional 10% have other more aggressive malignancies, and as such are often treated as malignant.Shahrzad Ehdaivand, Nalini Gupta \\"Gonadoblastoma\\", PathologyOutlines.com, 2 July 2014 Risk factors Gonadoblastoma is most often associated with an abnormal chromosomal karyotype, gonadal dysgenesis, or the presence of a Y chromosome in over 90% of cases. Gonadoblastoma has been found in association with androgen insensitivity syndrome, mixed gonadal dysgenesis and Turner syndrome, especially in the presence of Y chromosome-bearing cells. Women with Turner syndrome whose karyotype includes a Y chromosome (as in 45,X/46,XY mosaicism) are at increased risk for gonadoblastoma. Because of the risk of gonadoblastoma, individuals with Turner syndrome with detectable Y chromosome material (Mosaic Turner syndrome) should have their gonads prophylactically removed. In a population-based study, the cumulative risk for women with Turner syndrome and Y chromosome material was 7.9 percent by age 25 years.Lancet Oncol. 2008;9(3):239. Epub 2008 Feb 20 Diagnosis =Classification= Gonadoblastomas can contain elements of both germ cells and gonadal stroma.Kumar, Vinay; Fausto, Nelso; Abbas, Abul (2009) Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease (8th ed.). Saunders. Chapter 21. . Formerly, gonadoblastoma was sometimes regarded as a subset of dysgerminoma. In modern literature, it is sometimes considered to progress to dysgerminoma. Treatment Standard treatment would include surgical exploration via laparotomy. Laparoscopy may be an option if the surgeon is particularly skilled in removing ovarian neoplasms via laparoscopy intact. If the diagnosis of gonadoblastoma is certain, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) should be performed to remove both the primary tumor and the dysgenic contralateral ovary. If uninvolved, the uterus should be left intact. Modern reproductive endocrinology technology allows patients post BSO to achieve pregnancy via in- vitro fertilization (IVF) with a donor egg.

History In the 1780s, Spanish Canary Islanders, or Isleños, settled in the area after being given land grants from Spain. After selling their land grants to the planters, the Isleños frequently worked on the plantations they helped to create. Some began to resettle in the easternmost reaches of St. Bernard parish around the 1820s resulting in the firm establishment of Delacroix Island fishing community before the Civil War. By the 1900s, Yscloskey, Louisiana and Shell Beach, Louisiana near Lake Borgne were thriving communities. Seafood harvested by these fishermen in the 1800s and 1900s supplied New Orleans restaurants with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of shrimp, fish, crabs, and oysters.www.losislenos.org \\"St. Bernard Isleños LOUISIANA'S SPANISH TREASURE\\" Previously connected to the outside world by boat, in the 1930s a road was constructed to \\"the island\\" (in reality an inland area surrounded by marsh and bayous).

The entire area was flooded, and the majority of buildings completely destroyed. By 2010, much of this fishing town had been reconstructed, with most new construction elevated high on piers.

In 1900, the company purchased a five story building at Woodward and Gratiot to accommodate increasing business. When Ernst Kern died in 1901, his sons Ernst C. and Otto assumed control of the store.

Velz, Looking Back at Some Turns in the Road, in Burnt Orange Britannia (Wm. Roger Louis ed., 2005), at 390, 400. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree, Garner entered the University of Texas School of Law, where he served as an associate editor of the Texas Law Review. Career After receiving his Juris Doctor degree in 1984, he clerked for Judge Thomas M. Reavley of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit before he joined the Dallas firm of Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal. He then returned to the University of Texas School of Law and was named director of the Texas/Oxford Center for Legal Lexicography. In 1990, he left the university to found LawProse Inc., which provides seminars on clear writing, briefing and editing for lawyers and judges. Garner has taught at the University of Texas School of Law, the University of California at Berkeley (Boalt Hall), Texas Tech University School of Law, and Texas A&M; University School of Law. He has been awarded three honorary doctorates (Stetson, La Verne, and Thomas M. Cooley Law School). He serves on the Board of Advisers of The Green Bag. Author As a student at the University of Texas School of Law in 1981, Garner began noticing odd usages in lawbooks, many of them dating back to Shakespeare. They became the source material for his first book, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (1987). Since 1990, his work has focused on teaching the legal profession clear writing techniques. In books, articles, and lectures, Garner has tried to reform the way bibliographic references are \\"interlarded\\" (interwoven) in the midst of textual analysis. He argues for putting citations in footnotes and notes that in-text information that is important but non-bibliographic. He opposes references such as \\"457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 2521, 89 L.Ed.2d 744, 747\\" as interruptions in the middle of a line. However, such interruptions in judges' opinions and in lawyers' briefs have remained the norm. Some courts and advocates around the country have begun adopting Garner's recommended style of footnoted citations, and a surprising degree of internal strife has resulted within some organizations. For example, one appellate judge in Louisiana refused to join in a colleague's opinions written in the new format. Garner says that one of the main reasons for the reform is to make legal writing more comprehensible to readers who lack a legal education. That has attracted opposition, most notably from Judge Richard Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit,Richard A. Posner, \\"Against Footnotes\\", 38 Court Rev. 24 (Summer 2001) (answering Garner, \\"Clearing the Cobwebs from Judicial Opinions\\", 38 Court Rev. 4 (Summer 2001)). and from his co-author, Justice Antonin Scalia. Since 1992, Garner has contributed numerous revisions to the field of procedural rules, when he began revising all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules (Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal) for the Judicial Conference of the United States. Garner and Justice Scalia wrote Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges (2008). Garner maintains a legal consulting practice, focusing on issues in statutory construction and contractual interpretation. =English grammar and usage= Garner's books on English usage include Garner's Modern English Usage. This dictionary was the subject of David Foster Wallace's essay \\"Authority and American Usage\\" in Consider the Lobster and Other Essays. In 2003, Garner contributed a chapter on grammar and usage to the 15th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style, and later editions have retained it. = Black's Law Dictionary = In 1995, Garner became the editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary. He created a panel of international legal experts to improve the specialized vocabulary in the book. Garner and the panel rewrote and expanded the dictionary's lexicographic information.

Rotanin, which is a misspelling of the name \\"Rotanen\\", was named after the star Beta Delphini, a star located in the constellation Delphinus. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. Construction Rotanin was laid down 24 July 1943, under Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull No. 1872, as the Liberty ship SS William Kelly, by California Shipbuilding Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles, California; launched 18 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Andrew R. Bone; and commissioned 23 November 1943, Lieutenant William L. Howard, USNR, in command. Service history Completing shakedown 5 December, Rotanin loaded her first combat cargo and embarked her first military passengers at Port Hueneme, California, and on 12 December, sailed for Nouméa. Arriving 5 January 1944, she carried troops and cargo to Guadalcanal, then, on 27 December, continued on to the Russell Islands. By 2 February, she had discharged all cargo and was underway back to the Guadalcanal-Florida Island area. From then until March, she carried cargo and personnel throughout the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomons, the Fijis, and the New Hebrides. In April, she completed a run to Auckland, New Zealand, and in May, she moved supplies to Manus. She then resumed runs in the Solomons-New Hebrides-Fiji area. = Supporting the Allied invasion forces = In August, Rotanin shifted to the Marshalls-Marianas area and at the end of the month she moved further west, to Ulithi. In October, she carried US Army units to the Palaus, embarked Marines there, and transported them to the Russells. In November, she returned to operations in the Marianas, extended them to the Carolines, and in January 1945, returned to Nouméa. February and March took her back to Micronesia and New Zealand. In April, she was in the Solomons, and, in May, she took on Army supplies and reinforcements for the Okinawa campaign. Arriving off the Hagushi beaches on 21 May, she completed offloading by the end of the month and on 31 May, she steamed east. = End-of-war activity = During June and July, Rotanin again operated in the Marshalls and Marianas. On 28 July, she headed for Hawaii and the west coast. En route when hostilities ceased, she arrived at San Francisco, California, on 17 August. In October, she joined the ships assigned to transpacific operations to ferry occupation troops to Japan and Korea and to return veterans to the United States.  Post-war inactivation and decommissioning  On 2 February 1946, Rotanin arrived at San Francisco and reported to the Commander, 12th Naval District for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 5 April 1946, and returned to MARCOM. Her name was stricken from the Navy list on 17 April 1946. Fate She was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay Group, until purchased by Nicolai Joffe Corporation, 29 April 1966, for $50,165.

Four universities were members: the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The conference was formed to compete in football, baseball and track. It only survived for two seasons before disbanding due to financial problems throughout the league. The four schools came together again, along with Purdue University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois, to found the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives a couple of years later, known today as the Big Ten Conference. Formation The Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the Northwest (IAAN) was formed in April 1892 at a meeting in Chicago among representatives the Universities of Michigan, Minnesota, Northwestern and Wisconsin. An application by Iowa State University to join the IAAN was rejected, though tentative plans were made to include the newly-organized University of Chicago when it was ready to field athletic teams. The IAAN's jurisdiction covered football, baseball, track athletics, and lawn tennis. The impetus for the IAAN came from Ralph Stone, a student delegate from Michigan who was appointed as the organization's first president.(newspaper clipping located in the Ralph Stone papers, Bentley Historical Library, Box 1, folder \\"Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the Northwest 1950-1951\\")Manuscript titled \\"From the Old Scrap Book,\\" by Ralph Stone, Ralph Stone papers, Bentley Historical Library, Box 1. 1892 football season The Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the Northwest's inaugural season of competition kicked off on October 15 with a 10-6 Michigan win at Wisconsin. Michigan then traveled to Minnesota for a game two days later. Michigan was a heavy favorite to win, but Minnesota dominated the game. The final score was 14–6, with Michigan's points being scored just before the end of the game. October 29 saw Northwestern beat Michigan in a close game by a score of 10–8. The same day, Minnesota traveled to Wisconsin and won their game 32–4. However, the game was a close 8–4 at halftime before Minnesota pulled away in the second half. Northwestern went to Minneapolis on November 8 to play a game for conference supremacy. Both teams were undefeated in conference play - a Minnesota win would clinch the conference title and a Northwestern win would put them in a dominating position, needing to win only one of its last two games to win the conference. The game was a hard-fought contest, and was tied, 6–6, at halftime. In the second half, Minnesota's defense stopped Northwestern on downs only six yards from the end zone and then immediately drove down the field to take the lead. Northwestern scored almost immediately on a series of runs, but Minnesota managed another score to retake the lead. Northwestern drove down the field but was stopped at Minnesota's ten-yard line, ending the game. Minnesota's 16–12 win sealed the first Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the Northwest conference championship. =Standings= 1893 football season The conference's second (and final) season of football kicked off on October 28 with a Minnesota visit to Michigan. Minnesota won the game, 34–20, and then moved on to Evanston to play Northwestern two days later; they won that game, 16–0. Wisconsin traveled to Ann Arbor and beat Michigan, 34–18, on November 4. These events set up a situation similar to the previous year: Minnesota and Wisconsin were both undefeated in conference play and met on November 11 to decide the conference title. The game was expected to be a close one, and the game started out that way with no points being scored until Minnesota crossed the goal line twenty minutes into the game. Minnesota scored one more time before halftime giving them a comfortable, if not secure, lead. The second half, however, was completely one-sided. When Minnesota scored with five minutes left to take a 40–0 lead, Wisconsin requested that the game be called and Minnesota agreed. With that win, Minnesota had clinched its second consecutive Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the Northwest title. Financially, the 1893 season was a disaster for the league—low revenues received by visiting teams being the primary cause. A meeting was held in Chicago and the teams all agreed to disband the league. =Standings= References Sports in the Midwestern United States Defunct NCAA Division I conferences ","title":"Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the Northwest"},{"id":"12833042","text":"\\"You Used to Hold Me So Tight\\" is a song written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for American singer Thelma Houston's 1984 album Qualifying Heat.

Alternative common names for this species include western beefwood, beef oak, beef silky oak and silvery honeysuckle. Description The plant exhibits a range of growth forms, from a spindly shrub ~3m metres in height to a robust tree up to 15 metres. The trunk is covered in rough, brown, furrowed bark. The leaves are long, narrow and straplike, 10 to 45 cm long and up to 1 cm wide. Creamy- yellow flowers are produced in cylindrical spikes predominantly from August to December in Australia (late winter to early summer) although they may appear at other times of the year. These are followed by woody, beaked seed capsules which are about 1.5 cm long. It is a long-lived tree. In New South Wales, a tree still stands which bears an inscription in memory of a member of Charles Sturt's expedition in 1845. James Poole, having died of scurvy, was buried near the Beefwood tree at Preservation Creek near Milparinka, and an inscription \\"JP 1845\\" was carved into the tree. File:Grevillea striata leaves.jpgleaves File:Grevillea striata bark.jpgbark Taxonomy The species was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810. Distribution It occurs as scattered trees in open Eucalyptus or Acacia woodland and also in Triodia - shrubland communities. Uses Sap from the tree was used by Aboriginal people as a cement and for medicinal purposes. Due to its durability and the fact that it splits readily, the timber was used in the past for fence posts and shingles. It is known as Beefwood due to the intense red colour of its heartwood.

It was part of the First Kentucky Brigade. Service The 2nd Kentucky Infantry was organized in August 1861, at Camp Boone in Montgomery County, Tennessee, and became part of the Orphan Brigade. The men were recruited from Hickman, Fayette, Bullitt, Jefferson, Graves, Franklin, Harrison, Scott, Owen, Bourbon, and Anderson counties. In October of that same year, the regiment contained 832 men and, at the Battle of Fort Donelson, its force of 618 was captured. After being exchanged, the reconstituted regiment saw action at the Battle of Shiloh. It later was assigned to Hanson's, Helm's, and J.H. Lewis' Brigade. The 2nd Kentucky Infantry was involved in the battles of Murfreesboro and Chickamauga. It reported 13 killed, 70 wounded, and 21 missing at Murfreesboro, lost fifty- two percent of the 302 engaged at Chickamauga, and totaled 293 men and 214 arms in December 1863.

The Archbishop of Salvador is also ex officio Primate of Brazil. History View of the Cathedral in 1858. The Diocese of São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos, the first in the Portuguese colony of Brazil, was created in 1551, only two years after the foundation of Salvador by nobleman Tomé de Sousa. The first bishop, Pero Fernandes Sardinha, arrived in 1552, and a Jesuit college was established in 1564. Separately, a cathedral was built in the centre of Salvador around this time. Three Jesuit church buildings were erected on the site of the present-day cathedral, the final being destroyed during the Dutch occupation of Brazil. =Dutch occupation= The Dutch, upon their entry into Salvador in 1624, stripped the interior of the Jesuit college of its silverwork and a relic reportedly used by St. Francis Xavier. The Dutch used the church as a warehouse to store barrels of wine confiscated from the city. Salvador was reoccupied by the Portuguese in 1625, but the church, along with most buildings of the city, were heavily damaged and remained under siege by the Dutch until 1654. =Reconstruction of Jesuit complex= The Jesuits gathered to build a fourth church, the present structure, in 1654. The cornerstone of the present structure was laid in 1657 at a grand ceremony and mass. It was attended by Governor-General Jerónimo de Ataíde, the Conde de Atouguia (1610-1665) and numerous government and military figures. The mass was celebrated by Father Simão de Vasconcelos. The structure was completed in 1672. Its frontispiece dates to 1679 and its steeples were completed in 1694. The images of Saint Ignatius, Saint Francis Xavier, and Saint Francis of Borja were placed on the frontispiece in 1746. Housing for three religious communities, the father, the Escolásticas, and the Brotherhood; a smaller chapel; a refectory and kitchen; a novitiate; and a small school were completed soon after the opening of the church. The religious community numbered approximately 150, as evidenced by the seating of the domestic chapel. The novitiate was moved to the lower city in 1728 to the present-day Casa Pia and College of the Orphans of Saint Joachim. =Expulsion of the Jesuits= The Jesuit Order was expelled from Brazil by a Royal Letter dated August 28th, 1759. On December 26, 1759, The college was besieged by soldiers and all its inhabitants, including priests, students, and brothers, were detained on December 26, 1759. It was one of the final acts of governor Marcos de Noronha before the arrival of the new governor from Portugal, Antônio de Almeida Soares. Soares moved the entire community of Jesuits on January 7, 1760 into the domestic chapel of the college and sealed the doors and windows. The members of the community, now prisoners, were taken by armed soldiers to Novitiate of Jiquitaia in the lower city; other troops guarded the route to ward off observers. The community was held until April 18, 1760, when they boarded two boats. The Jesuits were taken to either dungeons in Lisbon or dispersed to pontifical territories in Italy. Their church was transferred to the Archbishopric in 1765 under Manuel de Santa Inês. =20th century= The remains of the school of the Jesuits, north of the current structure, burned in 1905. The church became the only remnant of the Jesuit complex. The Jesuit school was replaced by the Medical School of Bahia, and a corridor was built to connect the school to the church. The Old Cathedral of Salvador, built in the late 16th century, was demolished in 1933 under Archbishop Augusto Álvaro da Silva (1876-1968) in order to construct a tram route in Salvador. The former Jesuit church became the cathedral of the city. Location The Cathedral Basilica of Salvador is located on the edge of the bluff of the historic center of Salvador. It façade faces west and church doors open to the wide Terreiro de Jesus, a public square. The cathedral looks directly towards the Church of Saint Dominic at the opposite end of the square; the Medical School of Bahia and church Church of Saint Peter of the Clergymen to the north of the square; and 19th-century sobrados at the south of the square. The rear of the church faces the Bay of All Saints and the lower city. The cathedral is connected to the Medical School of Bahia by a corridor. The medical school dates to the early 20th century, and replaced the burned-out school of the Jesuits, once part of the church complex. The southern façade of the cathedral was connected to the Old Cathedral of Salvador until its demolition in 1933. The Praça da Sé, a broad square, was built after the demolition of the cathedral and the south façade of the Cathedral Basilica of Salvador, obscured for many centuries, looks onto the square. Art and architecture Interior of Cathedral of Salvador towards the main chapel. Side Chapels in the Cathedral Basilica of Salvador The origins is in several structures built by the Jesuit Order in Salvador. The Jesuits arrived in the city in the 1549 and planned a Jesuit college under Father Manuel da Nóbrega (1517-1570). The Colégio de Jesus (School of Jesus) was completed in 1585 through the financial support of the first governor-general of Bahia, Mem de Sá. Mem de Sá's tomb is located beneath high altar. =Façade= The Jesuits built the current church structure in the Mannerist style then fashionable in Portugal. The façade is very similar to contemporary Portuguese churches like the Jesuit Church of Coimbra. The façade is made in light Lioz stone brought from Portugal, a feature also found in the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in the lower city of Salvador. The facade is flanked by two short bell towers. It has three portals with statues of Jesuit saints, Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier and Francis Borgia. The gable on the upper storey of the façade is flanked by typical Mannerist volutes. =Interior= Inside, the cathedral is a one- aisled church of rectangular shape, without transept and with a very shallow main chapel. The interior of the church, similar to its frontispiece, is lined with lioz stone from Portugal. The side walls of the church have a series of lateral chapels decorated with altarpieces. This floorplan scheme is based on the Church of São Roque in Lisbon, the Jesuit church of the Portuguese capital, built a century earlier. The nave of the church has a deep central altar, two lateral chapels, two chapels at the transept, and three chapels at each side of the nave. The chapels were constructed at different times and reflect numerous architectural periods and styles. The chapels of the cathedral offer an interesting showcase of altarpiece art from the late 16th through the mid-18th centuries, all decorated with sculptures and paintings. Very rare are two 16th century Renaissance altarpieces that belonged to the previous Jesuit church and were reused in the new building. The altarpiece of the main chapel is a fine example of 17th century Mannerist art. Other chapels have Baroque altarpieces from the mid-18th century. The barrel vault covering the nave of the church is decorated with wooden panels dating from the 18th century and displays the Jesuit emblem \\"IHS\\". The paintings at the base of the nave are in vivid colors with an Asian design. They were painted by Charles Belleville (1657-1730), a Jesuit who had lived in Macau for ten years prior to his arrival in Bahia. The façade and floorplan of the Jesuit church of Salvador influenced several other colonial churches in Northeast Brazil, including the São Francisco Church of Salvador. =Sacristy= The sacristy of the church dates to 1694 and faces west towards the Bay of All Saints. The sacristy is called \\"Brazil's most exquisite\\". It was described in 1703 in the diary of an anonymous author as having \\"walls, floors, and a ceiling of jacaranda wood with fine paintings; extraordinary furniture, cabinets and gilded closets; with true perfection of joinery.\\" The sacristy now has three altars and is richly decorated with Baroque-style furniture. The sacristy cabinet dates to the 17th century and has paintings of the life of Jesus on copper panels. The walls are covered in 17th-century Portuguese azulejos; the ceiling has wooden panels painted with Mannerist motifs and portraits of noted members of the Jesuit order. Protected status The Cathedral of Salvador was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938. The structure was registered under the Book of Historical Works, Inscription 77 and Book of Fine Arts, fls. 14. The directive is dated May 25, 1938. Access The church is open to the public and may be visited. References * da Silva Telles, Augusto Carlos: Atlas dos Monumentos Históricos e Artísticos do Brasil. MEC/SEAC/FENAME, 1980.

It is a stone building in the Dutch Colonial Revival architectural style, located on East Market Street (Dutchess County Route 41) just east of US 9. It is a stone building modeled on an early house in the region. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a native of Hyde Park, took a personal interest in the construction of the new building during the New Deal. A series of murals inside depict major events in local history. In 1988 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The post office is located in the center of Hyde Park, on a corner lot at the intersection. Hyde Park Reformed Dutch Church is to the north; St. James Chapel is across East Market to the southeast. A decorative stone wellhead sits to the west, near the actual corner. Its front facade, four bays wide, faces south. The two-story main block is faced in fieldstone in a random ashlar pattern. Windows have louvered shutters It is topped with a hipped roof with boxed wooden cornice and plain modillions. The main entrance, in the western bay, has a small pedimented wooden porch with square piers. Two -story wings, on the east and west, have gabled roofs with clapboard siding in the gable ends. The cornices are shallower. The west wing has an entrance with paneled reveal and transom light. A larger, later wing extends from the north, of brick in common bond with a gambrel roof and cornice echoing the main roof. It ends in a loading platform. Inside, the lobby has a flagstone floor and wainscoting. Around the upper wall on three sides are murals of Hyde Park's history. Much of the woodworking and finishes are original. A small display case holds the trowel used by Roosevelt at the groundbreaking ceremony. History The post office as an institution is of local historic importance. Hyde Park takes its name from its first post office, located in the Hyde Park Inn. The settlement's name was originally Stoutenburgh, but the new name took on wide use and eventually became official in 1812. Nine years later the town was separately organized under that name. A century and a half later, Franklin D. Roosevelt took it upon himself as president to promote the use of the Dutch Colonial Revival style, and fieldstone, for new institutional buildings in his native Hudson Valley. He had personally made sure that new post offices in Poughkeepsie and later Rhinebeck, to the south and north, were built that way. Postmaster General James Farley asked him if he wanted to address Hyde Park's needs next, but the president told him to get Rhinebeck's post office built first since it had the greater need. In his speech at the 1939 groundbreaking for the Rhinebeck post office, he jokingly warned Farley and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. that they would not keep their jobs unless they made sure that there would be federal money available to build a new post office in Hyde Park. Rudolph Stanley-Mills, a former Treasury architect by then in private practice, was chosen to design a building for Roosevelt's ultimate approval, due to his successful work on Rhinebeck, Wappingers Falls and other stone post offices in the region. The Hyde Park site was chosen and purchased in April 1940 for a cost of $15,000 ($ in contemporary dollars). Three houses were removed and demolished to clear a site for the new building. The President personally chose the 1772 clapboard house built (but by then demolished) for early settler John Bard as the model for the structure; the President insisted on stone even though Bard's house had been frame. Stones, larger and more regular in size and shape than those used on the previous four stone post offices in the county, were procured from old stone walls on a farm once owned by Bard's son Samuel. The brick rear wing was added in 1963 and some modern light fixtures have been installed; other than that the building is as it was when opened. Public art Local artist Olin Dows painted murals in the lobby depicting Hyde Park's history, from Henry Hudson's Halve Maen docking in the nearby Hudson River during his 1609 voyage, to Britain's King George VI visiting Roosevelt at his house the year before. He had previously painted similar scenes in the Rhinebeck post office. Public art in the building caused a local controversy in 2001. The postmaster had instituted a local \\"Artist of the Month\\" program which, in October of that year, featured Fatgirl, a painting of the clothed torso and midsection of an obese woman by Audrey Martin. After the post office received several verbal complaints, and one written, it was removed from the building. Protests of censorship from the local arts community drew nationwide sympathy and support, but the Postal Service defended its decision on the grounds that it is not an art gallery, and ended the program.

Prestwich in command. Service history Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1943, the cargo ship was assigned to Service Squadron 8. During the next 11 months, she operated as a mobile supply source for the US Army. Her duties consisted of loading cargo and dispensing it to troops as needed. Among the ports from which she operated were Funafuti, Ellice Islands; Makin and Tarawa, Gilbert Islands; Kwajalein and Eniwetok, Marshall Islands; and Peleliu and Angaur, Palau Islands. = Under attack by Japanese aircraft = Allioth sailed from Peleliu on 14 November 1944, bound for Pearl Harbor. On the afternoon of the 20th, two Japanese airplanes attacked her, dropping several bombs but scoring no hits. Later that evening, one aircraft returned and dropped a bomb which exploded near the ship. Ten crewmen were slightly wounded, and the ship suffered minor structural damage from shrapnel. She continued her journey and arrived safely in Hawaiian waters on 11 December 1944. = Conversion to aviation supply issue ship = Two days later, the ship resumed her voyage toward the US West Coast of the United States, and she entered a shipyard at Alameda, California, on 24 December, for overhaul and conversion to an Aviation Supply Issue Ship. The alterations were completed in early March 1945, and Allioth received the new designation IX-204. = Servicing aircraft at Ulithi = On 10 March, the vessel got underway for Pearl Harbor. After taking on more cargo there, she resumed her westward voyage, dropped anchor at Ulithi on 8 April, and began supplying various units with airplane parts. On 3 May, her designation was changed to AVS-4. = Supporting aircraft in the Philippines = When the fleet moved from Ulithi, Allioth headed for the Philippine Islands, arriving at Leyte Gulf on 27 May. In early June, the ship sailed to Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, to load more spare parts. She returned to Leyte on 29 June, and resumed her supply duties. = Supporting aircraft in the Ryukyu Islands = Allioth moved to Okinawa in mid-September 1945, and remained there into the next year, supporting various airplane squadrons operating in the Ryukyu Islands. On 18 January 1946, the ship got underway to return to the United States. Allioth arrived back at Alameda, California, on 16 February, and began discharging cargo. Her crew also began stripping the ship of excess equipment in preparation for her deactivation.  Post-war decommissioning  Allioth returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 April, and was placed out of commission there on 18 May 1946. She was transferred to MARCOM on 13 May 1947, and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 22 May 1947. Under MARCOM, the ship resumed her first name, James Rowan. On 13 October 1964, she was sold to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, for $50,719.

HNUE High School, in Vietnamese: Trường THPT chuyên, Đại học Sư phạm Hà Nội, or, as commonly known, Chuyên Sư phạm (CSP)) is a public magnet school in Hanoi, Vietnam. The school was founded in 1966 as a national educational institution to nurture Vietnamese students who excelled at mathematics. One of the three national gifted high schools in Hanoi, along with Foreign Language Specialized School and Natural Science Gifted High School, HNUE High School is the second oldest magnet high school in Vietnam. The school and HUS High School for Gifted Students are often interchangeably ranked the first in National Science Olympiads for high school students and National University Entrance Examinations. HNUE High School ranks second nationally in the 2012 Vietnam university admission ranking.http://flss.edu.vn/Home.asp?param=news&NewsID;=147 Established as a school for mathematics talents, in recent years, HNUE high school's specialized education have spanned over other subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, English and literature.  Foundation and history  During the Vietnam War, aware of the important role of sciences for future of the country, a group of Vietnam leading scientists including Lê Văn Thiêm, Hoàng Tụy and Tạ Quang Bửu suggested that the government open up selective programs to nurture talented students, and to encourage them to follow science in their later years at universities and professions. As a premier national institution for training of science teachers, Hanoi National University of Education was selected to organize such a program. On December 24, 1966, at the height of the Vietnam War, the first class for gifted students was inaugurated with 33 mathematically inclined students, who were chosen from thousands of high school students in North Vietnam, at the evacuation site of the university in Phù Cừ District, Hưng Yên Province. This class was the foundation of HNUE High School. HNUE High School main building The history of Hanoi National University of Education High School is divided three periods: * From 1966 to 1995, the special math classes were under the administration of the faculty of Mathematics, Hanoi National University of Education. * In 1995, the school expanded to include a specialized stream in Computer Science. It was then renamed Specialized School for Maths and Computer Science. * In 2005, the school started offering classes specialized in Literature, Physics, Chemistry and Biology and was named \\"High School for Gifted Students of Hanoi National University of Education\\". The HNUE High School was honored with many national awards, including the 3rd degree Labor Decoration award in 1986, the 2nd degree Labor Decoration in 1996, and most recently the 1st degree Labor Decoration (2001).  Education  = Admissions = In the first period of establishment of the school in the 80s, HNUE High School for Gifted Students did not directly handle the admission process; this work was taken by the Ministry of Education and Training. During this period, students with outstanding abilities in mathematics (only in Northern region, from Nam Dinh province northwards) were nominated by the region to the Ministry of Education and Training before participating in an entrance exam. Students who passed the exam would be divided two schools: High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science and HNUE High School for Gifted Students or HSGS High School for Gifted Students. Since the end of 1980, with the wave of eradication of subsidy mechanism, HNUE High School for Gifted Students and HSGS High School for Gifted Students directly handle their own admission process. The school's entrance examinations are held in June, attracts students from all over the countries. Candidates must take three compulsory papers on the first day of testing (Vietnamese language, Mathematics and English) and on the second day, one elective paper (from Mathematics, Literature, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English studies ) for their specialization. These exams are highly competitive.

It incorporates [nanoscopic scale] structures to act as high surface-area electrodes to improve conductivity. In addition to being unusually thin, paper batteries are flexible and environmentally- friendly, allowing integration into a wide range of products. Their functioning is similar to conventional chemical batteries with the important difference that they are non-corrosive and do not require extensive housing. Advantages The composition of these batteries is what sets them apart from traditional batteries. Paper is abundant and self-sustaining, which makes paper cheap. Disposing of paper is also inexpensive since paper is combustible as well as biodegradable. Using paper gives the battery a great degree of flexibility. The battery can be bent or wrapped around objects instead of requiring a fixed casing. Also, being a thin, flat sheet, the paper battery can easily fit into tight places, reducing the size and weight of the device it powers. The use of paper increases the electron flow which is well suited for high performance applications. Paper allows for capillary action so fluids in batteries, such as electrolytes, can be moved without the use of an external pump. Using paper in batteries increases the surface area that can be used integrate reagents. The paper used in paper batteries can be supplemented to improve its performance characteristics. Patterning techniques such as photolithography, wax printing, and laser micromachining are used to create hydrophobic and hydrophilic sections on the paper to create a pathway to direct the capillary action of the fluids used in batteries. Similar techniques can be used to create electrical pathways on paper to create paper electrical devices and can integrate paper energy storage. 1.Used as both battery and capacitor. 2.It is flexible. 3.It is ultra thin energy storage device. 4.Long lasting. 5.Non toxic. 6.Steady power production. Disadvantages Although the advantages of paper batteries are quite impressive, many of the components that make them great, such as carbon nanotubes and patterning, are complicated and expensive. 1.Prone to tearing. 2.Nanotubes made from carbon are expensive due to use of procedures like electrolysis and laser ablation. 3.Should not be inhaled, as they can damage lungs Electrolytes This cellulose based spacer is compatible with many possible electrolytes. Researchers used ionic liquid, essentially a liquid salt, as the battery’s electrolyte, as well as naturally occurring electrolytes such as human sweat, blood and urine. Use of an ionic liquid, containing no water, would mean that the batteries would not freeze or evaporate, potentially allowing operation in extreme temperatures. The operating conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, static pressure) of such batteries would depend on the physical and chemical properties of the electrolyte, as well as the durability of the cellulose mesh; both potentially limiting factors.  Potential applications  The paper-like quality of the battery combined with the structure of the nanotubes embedded within gives them light weight and low cost, offering potential for portable electronics, aircraft, automobiles and toys (such as model aircraft). The batteries employ nanotubes, potentially slowing commercial adoption due to excessive cost. Commercial adoption also requires larger devices. E.g., a newspaper-sized device could be powerful enough to power a car. Paper can be integrated into several different forms of batteries, such as electrochemical batteries, biofuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and nanogenerators. =Electrochemical Batteries= Electrochemical batteries can be modified to integrate the use of paper. An electrochemical battery typically uses two metals, separated into two chambers and connected by a bridge or a membrane which permits the exchange of electrons between the two metals, thereby producing energy. Paper can be integrated into electrochemical batteries by depositing the electrode onto the paper and by using paper to contain the fluid used to activate the battery. Paper that has been patterned can also be used in electrochemical batteries. This is done to make the battery more compatible with paper electronics. These batteries tend to produce low voltage and operate for short periods of time, but they can be connected in series to increase their output and capacity. Paper batteries of this type can be activated with bodily fluids which makes them very useful in the healthcare field such as single-use medical devices or tests for specific diseases. A battery of this type has been developed with a longer life to power point of care devices for the healthcare industry. The device used a paper battery made using a magnesium foil anode and a silver cathode has been used to detect diseases in patients such as kidney cancer, liver cancer, and osteoblastic bone cancer. The paper was patterned using wax printing and is able to be easily disposed of. Furthermore, this battery was developed at a low cost and has other practical application. =Lithium-ion Batteries= Paper can be used in lithium-ion batteries as regular, commercial paper, or paper enhanced with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Enhanced paper is used as the electrode and as the separator which results in a sturdy, flexible battery that have great performance capabilities such as good cycling, great efficiency, and good reversibility. Using paper as a separator is more effective than using plastic. The process of enhancing the paper, however, can be complicated and costly, depending on the materials used. A carbon nanotube and silver nanowire film can be used to coat regular paper to create a simpler and less expensive separator and battery support. The conductive paper can also be used to replace traditionally used metallic chemicals. The resulting battery performs well, while simplifying the manufacturing process and reducing the cost. Lithium-ion paper batteries are flexible, durable, rechargeable, and produce significantly more power than electrochemical batteries. In spite of these advantages, there are still some drawbacks. In order for paper to be integrated with the Li-ion battery, complex layering and insulating techniques are required for the battery to function as desired. One reason these complex techniques are used is to strengthen the paper used so that it does not tear as easily. This contributes to the overall strength and flexibility of the battery. These techniques require time, training, and costly materials. Additionally, the individual materials required are not environmentally friendly and require specific disposal procedures. Paper lithium-ion batteries would be best suited for applications requiring a substantial amount of energy over an extended period of time. Lithium-ion paper batteries can be composed of carbon nanotubes and a cellulose based membrane and produce good results, but at a high price tag. Other researchers have been successful using carbon paper manufactured from pyrolyzed filter paper. The paper is inserted in between the electrode and cathode. The use of a carbon paper as an interlayer in Li-S batteries improves the batteries efficiency and capacity. The carbon paper increases the contact area between the cathode and the electrode which allows for greater flow of electrons. The pores in the paper allow the electrons to travel easily while preventing the anode and the cathode from being in contact with one another. This translates into greater output, battery capacity and cycle stability; these are improvements to conventional Li-S batteries. The carbon paper is made from pyrolyzed filter paper which is inexpensive to make and performs like multi-walled carbon nanotube paper used as a battery. =Biofuel Cells= Biofuel cells operate similarly to electrochemical batteries, except that they utilize components such as sugar, ethanol, pyruvate, and lactate, instead of metals to facilitate redox reactions to produce electrical energy. Enhanced paper is used to contain and separate the positive and negative components of the biofuel cell. This paper biofuel cell started up much more quickly than a conventional biofuel cell since the porous paper was able to absorb the positive biofuel and promote the attachment of bacteria to the positive biofuel. This battery capable of producing a significant amount of power after being activated by a wide range of liquids and then be disposed of. Some development must take place, since some components are toxic and expensive. Naturally occurring electrolytes might allow biocompatible batteries for use on or within living bodies. Paper batteries were described by a researcher as “a way to power a small device such as a pacemaker without introducing any harsh chemicals – such as the kind that are typically found in batteries — into the body.” Their ability to use electrolytes in the blood make them potentially useful for medical devices such as pacemakers, medical diagnostic equipment, and drug delivery transdermal patches. German healthcare company KSW Microtech is using the material to power blood supply temperature monitoring. =Supercapacitors= Paper battery technology can be used in supercapacitors. Supercapacitors operate and are manufactured similarly to electrochemical batteries, but are generally capable of greater performance and are able to be recharged. Paper, or enhanced paper can be used to develop thin, flexible supercapacitors that are lightweight less expensive. Paper that has been enhanced with carbon nanotubes is generally preferred over regular paper because it has increased strength and allows for easier transfer of electrons between the two metals. The electrolyte and the electrode are embedded into the paper which produces a flexible paper supercapacitor that can compete with some commercial supercapacitors produced today. A paper supercapacitor would be well suited for a high power application. =Nanogenerators= Nanogenerators are a more recent devices that convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. Paper is desirable as a component of nanogenerators for the same reasons discussed above. Such devices are able to capture movement, such as body movement, and convert that energy into electrical energy that could power LED lights, for example.

Funding T-REX was funded using no new state, county, city, or gas taxes. This was partially due to the TABOR laws enacted in 1992, and the State Leadership's stance against levying additional taxes on its constituents.Federal Highway Administration, \\"Colorado's T-REX: Mega, Multi-modal, Design-Build\\" http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hfl/successstory.cfm?id=5Bill Owens Memorial Highway? Why not?, http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/business_columnists/article/0,1299,DRMN_82_5260446,00.html Instead, metropolitan areas that would benefit from the expansion voted to approve an increase of property taxes required for the build out. In November 1999, voters in affected municipalities approved two property-tax increases which partially funded the transit portion of the project. Among those : * Design-build contract with Southeast Corridor Constructors worth $1.18 billion. * Light rail costs: $879 million, with $437 million coming from RTD and local matching funds; $525 million from an FTA full-funding grant agreement.T-REX Project Factbook, http://www.metrodenver.org/documents/T-REX%20Factbook.pdf * Highway costs: $795 million, from highway users taxes and matching federal revenue.SPG Media PLC/RoadTraffic Technology, http://www.roadtraffic- technology.com/projects/trex/ * 34 new light-rail vehicles: $91.8 million. * Elati Street Light Rail Maintenance Facility: $39.5 million. History T-REX's initial footsteps can be traced back to a 1992 traffic congestion study commissioned by the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG). The study found that traffic volume along the corridor had exceeded its maximum capacity of 180,000 vehicles per day and, within a few years, the freeway would be near gridlock most of the day. Adding to the gloomy forecast of gridlock, planners projected that 150,000 new jobs would be added in the downtown area and at the huge Denver Tech Center, which is 15 miles (24 kilometers) to the south, over the next 20 years. The study not only recommended widening the freeway by several lanes, but it also suggested incorporating some type of mass transit into any future improvements. In April 1995, The Colorado Department of Transportation and RTD took the first step toward developing the partnership that ultimately became T-REX. The two agencies and DRCOG commissioned the Southeast Corridor Major Investment Study (MIS), which sought the best solutions to the I-25/I-225 congestion problem.Civil Engineering News- Spotlight on Building The Future- T-REX project, http://www.cenews.com/article.asp?id=1314 Arapahoe and Douglas counties along with the cities of Denver, Aurora, and Greenwood Village participated in the initial MIS. Two other Denver-area corridor studies were also undertaken. The initial MIS was primarily transit-oriented in scope. The recommendations included light rail, highway improvements, pedestrian/bicycle facility improvements, enhanced Transportation Demand Management (TDM), Intelligent transportation system (ITS) measures. It also recommended safety improvements such as acceleration and deceleration lanes, wider shoulders. The initial MIS did not call for additional highway lanes. The Federal Highway Administration and CDOT were troubled by this omission, and leaders of all four agencies agreed that the MIS placed too much emphasis on transit.Public Roads Magazine-Federal Highway Administration- Colossal partnership: Denver's $1.67 billion T-REX project.(Brief Article), http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-82784226.html \\"We weren't going to spend over a billion dollars on this project without involving more highway capacity. It couldn't be a predominantly transit project,\\" Said Bill Jones, the Federal Highway Administration's Colorado Division administrator. \\"This was the turning point when we realized together that the transit part of the project couldn't be built without the highway part.\\"Public Roads Magazine- Federal Highway Administration, http://www.tfhrc.gov/pubrds/septoct01/trex.htm \\"We looked at ways to break down the highway vs. transit rivalry and started looking at mobility,\\" RTD Director, Cal Marsella said. \\"Let's look at highway and transit as coordinated pieces of a comprehensive strategy to maximize mobility in a project with limited available right of way. We set our sights on a project that was a win-win (proposition) for both transit and highway. What emerged was the T-REX project.\\"US Department of Transportation, Environmental Review Toolkit, 'Transportation Expansion (T-REX) Multi-Modal Transportation Project' http://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/casestudies/co.asp A second, more comprehensive MIS was completed two years later. Unlike the initial study, the scope included Core Infrastructure (Highway) improvements as well as Transit solutions. It recommended expanding highway lanes up to 7 wide in each direction as well as added light rail support throughout the corridor. Additionally, the cities of Lone Tree, Parker and Centennial were also included for input and feedback. DRCOG adopted the recommendations of the 1997 Study which included the of double-track light rail and 13 stations with the track running next to or in the median of I-25 and I-225. In November 1998, DRCOG adopted a 20-year regional transportation plan called Metro Vision 2020.Metro Vision 2020 - Comprehensive guide for regional planning that integrates previously separate plans for growth development transportation and water quality management, http://www.drcog.org/index.cfm?page=MetroVision2020 T-REX was a top priority in the plan.

Construction began only a few months later- in June 2001. The \\"Partnering Agreement\\" was a key to the success of the project. Signed by all stakeholders, and it established four primary goals: * Minimize inconvenience to the community, motorists, and public. * Meet or beat the total program budget of $1.67 billion. * Provide a quality project. * Meet or beat the project's operational deadline of June 30, 2008. Another vitally important element of the MIS process and success to the project was the early formation of two committees—A Policy Committee provided input on policy- related issues and monitored project progress relative to the overall public agency decision-making process, and a Technical Committee focused on all planning, engineering and environmental issues and assisted in the development and refinement of alternatives. Members of this committee were individuals from the various cities and jurisdictions within the study area who had a technical background. These two committees, (Policy Committee and Technical Committee) used goals from the \\"Partnering Agreement\\" to refine and evaluate each alternative. Public meetings and numerous workshops were held during NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) scoping and at key milestones during the study to present the definition of alternatives and to guide the Colorado Department of Transportation and RTD in the development and evaluation of any Preferred Alternatives. Committee members primarily consisted of elected and/or appointed policy/decision-making officials from the affected areas. After the adoption of the MIS, all four agencies in June 1998 signed a \\"partnering charter\\" that created a leadership team to identify and pursue the best multi modal solutions. CDOT and RTD next assembled the teams into one location. Top management from all four agencies began meeting every two weeks. The purpose of the senior-level meetings was \\"not just to get briefings,\\" said Chick Dolby, Federal Transit Administration deputy regional administrator, \\"but to do the planning and make decisions.\\" A project newsletter was published at key project milestones to keep the public informed. The committees remained intact during the NEPA and preliminary engineering process, and monthly meetings were held to keep them involved. This also helped with maintaining a constant public process and ongoing relations with the public through the release of project newsletters, which discussed the project, listed milestone dates and invited the public to attend open houses and provide comments. Press releases and a media tour were utilized to keep the project in the media, and project displays were placed in public buildings to keep the public informed. A project website was continuously updated with the latest documents and information. Project team members met over 215 times with community groups. By the end of 2002, working with a $100 million budget, the T-REX Project acquired six single-family homes, two duplexes and two apartment buildings. It negotiated 30 total acquisitions and 172 partial acquisitions. Businesses were also eligible for replacement property costs and moving costs. As with residential properties, the T-REX Project purchased business properties, and relocation experts helped businesses move. No one had to move until they found comparable replacement housing.T-REX Factbook page 19 - Right of Way Issues, http://www.metrodenver.org/documents/T-REX%20Factbook.pdf T-REX's five-year design-build project added of light rail and improved of highway through southeast Denver, Aurora, Greenwood Village, Centennial and Lone Tree. The unprecedented project is the result of a unique collaboration between the Colorado Department of Transportation, the Regional Transportation District, which is responsible for transit service in the metro Denver area, the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. Construction began in Fall 2001 and construction ended in December 2006, 22 months ahead of the original schedule. Additionally, light rail service along the Southeast Corridor began in late 2006.

Please add * Completed and opened on November 17, 2006 Unique Approach, and Success in \\"Design Build\\" Methodology T-REX is one of the first transportation projects in the US to use a design-build contract in which the same contractor is responsible for the project's engineering and construction. Under this type of contract, the contracting agency provides a general concept of the plan, and the contractor is responsible for most of the details, many of which are worked out as the project proceeds. \\"This project represents the first time, in any state, that a state transportation department and a transit agency have come together to build one project under a single financial plan, to provide travelers with integrated transportation system options.\\" said Randy Pierce, who served as consultant principal-in-charge/project manager of T-REX.Carter and Bergess -Managing Mega-Projects: T-REX, http://www.c-b.com/information%20center/transportation/ic.asp?issue=4&p;=1&tID;=23&pID;=87 \\"We think, based on our research, that it's the largest transportation design- build project in the country,\\" says Richard Clarke, T-REX project director. \\"We were able to get it done a lot faster because we finished a lot of the construction before the design was completely done.\\"On parallel tracks, http://americancityandcounty.com/features/government_parallel_tracks/ T-REX also is unique by combining light rail, highway, bike, pedestrian and other transit options, the project used a multi-modal approach to address some of the traffic problems. The multi-agency cooperation created an effective and efficient partnership. When all of these agencies worked together, they realized this complex project needed innovative approaches, which led to one of the strongest reasons why a design-build methodology was chosen. Success Metrics Design-build allowed for flexibility and creativity in support of the project goals, which were in line with the original \\"Partnering Agreement\\": * Minimize inconvenience to the public * Stay within the project's $1.67 billion budget * Design and construct a quality project * Complete the project on or before June 2008* (actual end date was Dec 2006, 22 months early) The project was regularly worked on during off hours between 9pm and 5am. The aggressive approach to the project schedule meant it was finished 22 months ahead of the original schedule. The public was generally in favor of the project. There was, however, some opposition from property owners who opposed the outright taking of, or encroachment onto their property, but relocation experts helped residents and businesses move. No one had to move until they found comparable replacement housing. Public input did result in minor changes to the project, including light rail alignment and station locations. Political support may also have been a factor in the expediting of the project. Colorado Governor Roy Romer supported the project from the outset, and there was local political support for light rail. However, some local politicians and special interest groups were against the highway.Federal Highway Administration, Planning Toolkit- Case Study Colorado,http://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/casestudies/co.asp Financial Benefits Denver residents are now saving about of motor fuel and related air pollution that is worth about $4 million per year.June 2006 issue of Mass Transit magazine.

It served as a model for T-REX. UDOT and the Utah Transit Authority worked to reconstruct a major Salt Lake City arterial, Interstate 15, and construction had to be finished for the 2002 Winter Olympics.The 2002 Olympics are transforming Salt Lake City, New York Times, https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E2D61130F93AA35752C1A961958260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=print This project required collaboration between UDOT and the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) because it combined a light-rail project with the roadwork, said Doug Dansie, principal planner for the Salt Lake City Planning Department. \\"The rail lines were built because just expanding the freeway wasn't enough to handle the commuter capacity,\\" Dansie says. Utah's rail line solution, unlike T-REX, were not in the interstates right-of-way. Dansie believes projects like T-REX that combine traffic and highway expansion are probably the best approach to relieving congestion, though there is currently a bias toward road expansion. \\"It really does need to be a balance,\\" Doug Dansie, principal planner for the Salt Lake City Planning Department said. * Representatives from the Arizona Department of Transportation, the Maricopa Association of Governments and the Valley Metro Rail system in Phoenix observed T-REX. Phoenix is in the early stages of a similar project on its Interstate 10 corridor, one that also involves expanding the highway and building more rail lines, says Wulf Grote, director of project development for Valley Metro Rail. \\"We hoped the trip to Denver would spark some discussion on working together,\\" Grote says. While Phoenix's light-rail project will not be complete until around 2019, the highway improvements are supposed to be finished in the next five years.

The film stars Vasanthi Chathurani and late Vijaya Kumaratunga in the lead roles. Adapted from a novel by Letitia Botejue, its script was written by veteran director Tissa Abeysekara. The music and English lyrics ('Banks of the River') were composed by Nimal Mendis. It was translated into Sinhala by Augustus Vinayagaratnam and was sung by Vijaya Kumaratunga, who also made his mark as a playback singer. Ganga Addara, which was the second production of Sumathi Films was set in Kandy, colonial Sri Lanka. Its plot is about a tragic love story between a boy and his uncle's daughter, where all the incidents take place around river Kalani, a famous river in Sri Lanka. It received many awards at the prestigious Sarasaviya Awards Festival including the Best Film Award, Best Director Award, Best Music Direction Award and Best Actress Award for Vasanthi Chathurani. Even after two decades, the film, which was a box- office hit in the eighties, still remains as one of the finest Sri Lankan films ever made.  Synopsis  England educated Dr. Sarath Pathirana (Vijaya Kumaratunga), who is willing to try out new methods to treat his patients, is directed towards a special patient by the Head Doctor (Henry Jayasena) at the mental hospital. This patient is a beautiful girl named Nirmala (Vasanthi Chathurani), who does not speak a single word nor trouble anyone excessively unlike any other patient at the hospital. In order to cure her, Dr. Pathirana seeks help from her father, a proud, rich man called D.J. Atapattu (Tony Ranasinghe) and the patient herself. He is certain that he can restore her to normal, if he can find out the causes for the sudden change in her mental makeup. Through the several characters in the story, it is revealed that Nirmala was in love with her cousin, Ranjith (Sanath Gunathilake). He was an educated youth, but not a financially able one like Nirmala's family and so her father refused their marriage. Instead, she was married to the son of the rich, dignitary Kobbekaduwa family from Kandy. After six months of their wedding, she becomes pregnant and is about to leave to her parents' home, when a white lady with two children arrive at their home. The two children are seen calling her husband, \\"Daddy.\\" As soon as Nirmala is aware of the fact that Kobbekaduwa was married with two children in England, she poisons herself and is taken to hospital. It is this incident that had changed Nirmala's life as well as her mental condition. She had not spoken a word since then. Yet, through Dr. Pathirana's kindness, she begins to gradually heal, when her forehead is hurt by another patient at the hospital. This accelerates Nirmala's recovery and she regains her lost memory. But, by that time, Dr. Pathirana has fallen in love with her. Her parents are now ready to tie their daughter's knot with Ranjith, who has returned from England after his higher studies. But, Ranjith's parents have already agreed on another girl.

The series is about a group of college students who participate in a fantasy role-playing game, and are magically transported to the world of the game by their gamemaster. The first book, The Sleeping Dragon, focuses on the former students struggling to survive in the world of the game. The series progresses with the students choosing to live in the 'game world' and forming their own community, which is in part based on opposition to the ubiquitous slave trade. The series then expands upon the students \\"Home\\" in the fantasy realm and their effecting societal change.https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/throwback-thursday- guardians-of-the-flame-takes-you-inside-the-fantasy/ In the later books, the focus shifts from efforts to destroy the slave trade and on to various characters dealing with the changes in the fantasy world wrought by the former students (now mostly 40-somethings). The final three books shift focus to a new set of protagonists, relegating the 'Other Siders' to supporting cast and cameo appearances.  Novels  There are ten novels in the Guardians of the Flame series:https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/joel-rosenberg/ #The Sleeping Dragon (1983) #The Sword and the Chain (1984) #The Silver Crown (1985) #The Heir Apparent (1987) #The Warrior Lives (1988) #The Road to Ehvenor (1991) #The Road Home (1995) #Not Exactly the Three Musketeers (1999) #Not Quite Scaramouche (2001) #Not Really the Prisoner of Zenda (2003) The first seven novels also have been reprinted in three omnibus editions collecting books 1-3, 4-5, and 6-7. The Science Fiction Book Club's omnibus editions of the first five books are titled Guardians of the Flame: The Warriors (Books 1-3, 1985) and Guardians of the Flame: The Heroes (Books 4-5, 1989). The Baen Books omnibus editions are titled The Guardians of the Flame (Books 1-3, 2003), Guardians of the Flame: Legacy (Books 4-5, 2004), and Guardians of the Flame: To Home and Ehvenor (Books 6-7, 2004).  The Flame  Repeated references to the Flame are made in both the series title and at the end of many of the books. The Flame is the flame of freedom, as explicitly stated in most of the book endings, and the students act as the guardians of the concept that slavery is evil. Thus, they are the Guardians of the Flame.

It is also known as the ruby shark, red-fin shark, red-finned shark, rainbow sharkminnow, green fringelip labeo, whitefin shark and whitetail sharkminnow.Red-fin Shark, Rainbow Shark, Ruby Shark (Epalzeorhynchus frenatus), Mongabay.com, 2006, retrieved on August 17, 2007Rainbow Shark (Epalzeorhynchos frenatum), AquariumLife.net (undated), retrieved on August 17, 2007 It is a popular, semi-aggressive aquarium fish. Unlike true sharks, which belong to the Chondrichthyes (\\"cartilagenous fishes\\") lineage, the rainbow shark is an actinopterygiian (\\"ray-finned fish\\"). Distribution and habitat Rainbow sharks are native to the basins of Mekong, Chao Phraya, Xe Bangfai and Maeklong in Indochina. They live in water with sandy substrates, near the river bottom. This species feeds on algae and plankton, and seasonally migrates into flooded areas, then recedes back to the rivers as the floods dry up. Description The rainbow shark has an elongated black, dark blue or bright blue body. The snout is pointed. The abdominal area is flat. The fins possess red to orange-red coloration. The linear area from the gill cover, the eye, and the mouth has a characteristic brief stripe. Compared to females, male rainbow sharks have thinner bodies with black lines along the tailfins. Males also have brighter coloration. They can grow up to about long. =Variants= The albino red-fin shark or albino rainbow sharkminnow is a variety of rainbow shark with a white body and red/orange fins.Fenner, Bob.

Retrieved 30 July 2014. The rainbow shark is also one of the types of genetically modified, fluorescent fish known as GloFish. In the aquarium =Behavior= Rainbow sharks are tank-bottom and aquarium-surface cleaners. Being bottom- and mid-level dwellers, they consume leftover fish food, but also eat the algae growing off surfaces. They are known to be peaceful with their own kind in the wild but have been known to be aggressive with one another if kept together in a tank. Threat displays and fighting are likely to occur. This fighting behavior involves head-and-tail butting, and also biting.. A large rainbow shark will continuously chase a smaller one until the smaller one dies, or chase other fish out of its territory, especially in confined environments like aquaria. It may also increase the risk of the fish jumping out of its tank. This makes breeding difficult. The provision of hiding places and hollowed decors such as plants or artificial cave-like and tunnel-like aquatic ornaments minimize this typical behavior. Due to this behavioral characteristic among its own kind, rainbow sharks are not recommendable to the new aquarist. Keeping them with relatives, such as red- tailed sharks, bala sharks and black sharks should be avoided, as they will chase and attack them as well. =Tank requirements= An adult rainbow shark thrives in a minimum of 30 gallons of water, with an aquarium length of 48 inches, at the neutral pH range (6.0 to 8.0 pH), with temperatures between , and water hardness maintained at 5 to 11 dH. They must have this much space, as they frequently swim around quickly and will terrorize other fish in any tank under this size. =Compatibility= Rainbow sharks are compatible with barbs and rainbowfish, which are upper- and middle-tank dwellers. They can also live with danios, loaches, plecos, rasboras, and gouramis. They are not compatible with smaller, more timid fish in the tank, as the sharks may terrorize them by chasing them from their territory.Rainbow Shark Information, TimsTropicals.com, 2007, retrieved on August 17, 2007 =Diet= Rainbow sharks are not picky herbivorous and omnivorous eaters, but are primarily consumers of algae in the form of tablets, wafers and flakes. They also eat live foods, such as insect larvae, tubifex worms, periphyton, crustaceans, phytoplankton, zooplankton and aquatic insects. Diet also include lettuce and spinach. They will also eat frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp. =Breeding= No actual breed sequence has been documented in an aquarium setting. Although known to be egg-layers, reproduction of rainbow sharks is difficult in an aquarium setting. Large numbers are bred in southeast Asian commercial farms.SeriouslyFish: Epalzeorhynchos frenatum. Retrieved 30 July 2014.

The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.46. (229/228–222 BC) was fought by Sparta and its ally, Elis, against the Achaean League and Macedon. The war ended in a Macedonian and Achaean victory. In 235 BC, Cleomenes III ( 235–222 BC) ascended the throne of Sparta and began a program of reform aimed at restoring traditional Spartan discipline while weakening the influence of the ephors, elected officials who, though sworn to uphold the rule of Sparta's kings, had by the time of Cleomenes come to wield extraordinary political power in the Spartan system. When, in 229 BC, the ephors sent Cleomenes to seize a town on the border with Megalopolis, the Achaeans declared war. Cleomenes responded by ravaging Achaea. At Mount Lycaeum he defeated an army under Aratus of Sicyon, the strategos of the Achaean League, that had been sent to attack Elis, and then routed a second army near Megalopolis. In quick succession, Cleomenes cleared the cities of Arcadia of their Achaean garrisons, before crushing another Achaean force at Dyme. Facing Spartan domination, Aratus was forced to turn to Antigonus III Doson ( 229–221 BC) of Macedon. In return for Macedonian assistance, the Achaeans were obliged to surrender the citadel overlooking Corinth to Antigonus. Cleomenes eventually invaded Achaea, seizing control of Corinth and Argos, but was forced to retreat to Laconia when Antigonus arrived in the Peloponnese. Cleomenes fought the Achaeans and the Macedonians at Sellasia, where the Spartans were routed. He then fled to the court of his ally, Ptolemy III of Egypt ( 246–222 BC), where he ultimately committed suicide in the wake of a failed revolt against the new Pharaoh, Ptolemy IV ( 221–205 BC). Prelude Cleomenes III ascended the throne of Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II. His accession to power ended a decade- long period of heightened conflict between the two royal families. Sparta's ancient dual kingship was explained by the founding legend that the original conquerors of Sparta were twin brothers and their descendants shared Sparta. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had executed his rival king, the reformist Agis IV.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 3; Plutarch. Life of Agis, 20. In 229 BC, Cleomenes took the important cities Tegea, Mantineia, Caphyae, and Orchomenus in Arcadia, who had by then allied themselves with the Aetolian League, a powerful Greek confederation of city states in central Greece. Historians Polybius and Sir William Smith claim that Cleomenes seized the cities by treachery; however, Richard Talbert, who translated Plutarch's account of Sparta, and historian N. G. L. Hammond say Cleomenes occupied them at their own request.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.46; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4; . Later that year, the ephors sent Cleomenes to seize the Athenaeum, near Belbina. Belbina was one of the entrance points into Laconia and was disputed at the time between Sparta and Megalopolis. Meanwhile, the Achaean League summoned a meeting of her assembly and declared war against Sparta. Cleomenes in return fortified his position. Aratus of Sicyon, the strategos of the Achaean League, tried to re-take Tegea and Orchomenus in a night attack. Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes nonetheless discovered the plan and sent a message to Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina. Cleomenes responded to this by saying: \\"If it's all the same to you, write and tell me why you brought along those torches and ladders.\\"Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4; Smith, William. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Cleomenes III\\". Early years and Spartan success A map of the Peloponnese (the southernmost area of Greece) showing important cities and locations of the Cleomenean War. The Achaean League is shown in red. After fortifying Belbina, Cleomenes advanced into Arcadia with 3,000 infantry and a few cavalry. However, he was called back by the ephors, and this retreat allowed Aratus to seize Caphyae as soon as Cleomenes returned to Laconia.. Once this news reached Sparta, the ephors sent Cleomenes out again; he managed to capture the Megalopian city Methydrium before ravaging the territory surrounding Argos. Around this time, the Achaean League sent an army under a new strategos—Aristomachos of Argos, who had been elected in May 228 BC—to meet Cleomenes in battle. The Achaean army of 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry advanced on the 5,000-strong Spartan army at Pallantium. Aratus, who had accompanied Aristomachos, advised him to retreat because even 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 4; . Aristomachos, listening to Aratus' advice, retreated with the Achaean army. Meanwhile, Ptolemy III of Egypt, who had been an ally of the Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his financial support to Sparta. Ptolemy made this decision after calculating that a resurgent Sparta would be a more valuable ally against Macedon than a failing Achaean League.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.51; ; ; . In May 227 BC, Aratus was once again elected strategos and attacked Elis. The Elians appealed to Sparta for aid; as the Achaeans were returning from Elis, Cleomenes attacked and routed their entire army near Mount Lycaeum. Taking advantage of a rumour that he had been killed during the fighting, Aratus attacked and seized Mantinea.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 5; . Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, claims that Cleomenes had him poisoned.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 2.9.1. In order to strengthen his position against the ephors, who were opposed to his expansionist policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene to ascend the Eurypontid throne, but as soon as Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 5.37; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 5; . Battle of Ladoceia and reforms Later in 227 BC, Cleomenes bribed the ephors to allow him to continue his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded with his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and captured the village of Leuctra. In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city, and inflicted a minor defeat on the Spartan army based nearest the city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue the Spartans across the ravine, but Lydiadas of Megalopolis disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of the Spartans. Taking advantage of the difficult terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his Cretan and Tarentine soldiers against Lydiadas. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead. The Spartans, encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and defeated the entire army. The Achaeans were so outraged and demoralized by Aratus' failure to support Lydiadas that they made no further attacks in that year.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 6; Smith, William. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Cleomenes III\\". Traditional Greek phalanx with spears and large shields (aspis). Cleomenes, now confident of the strength of his position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him of the need to do away with the ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 7; ; . With the ephors vanquished, Cleomenes initiated his reforms. First, he handed over his land to the state; he was soon followed by his stepfather and his friends, and then by the rest of the citizens. He divided up all of the Spartan land, awarding an equal lot to each citizen. He increased the citizen population by granting citizenship to some perioeci, who constituted the Spartan middle class, but did not at that time have Spartan citizenship. Expanding the citizen population meant that Cleomenes could build a larger army; he trained 4,000 hoplites and restored the old Spartan social and military discipline. He also strengthened his army by introducing the Macedonian sarissa (pike). Cleomenes completed his reforms by placing his brother, Eucleidas, in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 11; ; Smith, William. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Cleomenes III\\". Domination of the Peloponnese A coin depicting Ptolemy III of Egypt. Ptolemy III of Egypt offered continued assistance to Cleomenes on the condition that the Spartan king would offer his mother and children as hostages. Cleomenes hesitated but his mother, after learning of Ptolemy's offer, went voluntarily to Egypt.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 22; . In 226 BC, the citizens of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops crept into the citadel and removed the Achaean garrison before marching off to nearby Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme, where he was met by the entire Achaean army. In the Battle of Dyme, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 14; ; . The Achaeans were demoralized by this battle; Aratus declined the generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace.; . Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, but as the talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, he would return to the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank too much water, which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 15; ; . Aratus took advantage of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis had been sent to Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed.. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked for control of Acrocorinth in return.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 16. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.. When the Achaeans arrived at Argos for an assembly, Cleomenes came down from Tegea to meet them. However, Aratus—who had reached an agreement with Antigonus—demanded that Cleomenes present 300 hostages to the Achaeans and enter the city alone, or approach the city with all his forces. When this message reached Cleomenes, he declared that he had been wronged and once again declared war on the Achaeans.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 17. Achaea was now in turmoil, and some cities were close to revolt; many residents were angered at Aratus' decision to invite the Macedonians into the Peloponnese. Some also hoped that Cleomenes would introduce constitutional changes in their cities. Encouraged by this development, Cleomenes invaded Achaea and seized the cities of Pellene, Pheneus, and Penteleium, effectively splitting the Achaean League in half.. The Achaeans, concerned about developing treachery in Corinth and Sicyon, dispatched their mercenaries to garrison the cities and then went to Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games. Cleomenes estimated that Argos would be easier to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The people of the city were too terrified to offer resistance. They accepted a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 17; ; . The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, one of the most famous generals of the age, had been killed while trying to take the city.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 18. Soon after the seizure of Argos, Cleonae and Phlius surrendered themselves to Cleomenes. Meanwhile, Aratus was in Corinth investigating those suspected of supporting Sparta. When he heard what had happened at Argos, Aratus expected the city to fall to Sparta. He summoned an assembly and, with all the citizens present, he took his horse and fled to Sicyon. The Corinthians did surrender the city to Cleomenes, but the Spartan king criticized them for failing to arrest Aratus. Cleomenes sent his stepfather Megistonous to Aratus, asking for the surrender of Acrocorinth—the citadel of Corinth, which had an Achaean garrison—in return for a large amount of money.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 19; . In quick succession, Hermione, Troezen, and Epidaurus surrendered to Cleomenes, who went from Argos to Corinth and started besieging the citadel. He sent a messenger to Aratus proposing that Acrocorinth should be garrisoned jointly by both the Spartans and the Achaeans, and that he would deliver a twelve talent pension. Aratus faced the hard decision of whether to give the city to Antigonus or to let it fall to Cleomenes. He chose to conclude an alliance with Antigonus and sent his son as a hostage to Macedon. Cleomenes invaded the territory of Sicyon and blockaded Aratus inside the city for three months before Aratus was able to escape to attend the Achaean council at Aegium.; . Macedonian intervention Antigonus, who had brought with him a large force of 20,000 infantry and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese.. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality at that point in the war.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.52; . Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.52; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 20; . Despite numerous attempts to break through the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 20. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack on the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes had not made any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was in the hands of the Argives.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 21; . The Isthmus of Corinth and nearby cities. When Cleomenes heard about the revolt at Argos, he sent his stepfather with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus for fear of being encircled and left Corinth to fall into the hands of Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced his way into the city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.53; Plutarch. Cleomenes, 21; . After retreating into Arcadia and receiving news of his wife's death, Cleomenes returned to Sparta. This left Antigonus free to advance through Arcadia and on the towns that Cleomenes had fortified, including Athenaeum—which he gave to Megalopolis. He continued to Aegium, where the Achaeans were holding their council. He gave a report on his operations and was made chief-in-command of all the allied forces.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.54; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 22. Antigonus took the opportunity to revive the Hellenic League of Philip II of Macedon, under the name League of Leagues. Most of the Greek city states took part in the league. These included Macedon, Achaea, Boeotia, Thessaly, Phocis, Locris, Acarnania, Euboea, and Epiros. Peter Green claims that for Antigonus, the League was just a way to further Macedon's power.; . In the early spring of 223 BC, Antigonus advanced upon Tegea. He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it. The Tegeans held out for a few days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons. After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to Laconia, where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him. When his scouts brought news that the garrison of Orchomenus was marching to meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke camp and ordered a forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea, and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia. Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops to winter at home.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.54; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 23; . Knowing that Cleomenes got the money to pay for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, according to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this assumption is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without money to pay for his mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all helots able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 23; . Fall of Megalopolis Cleomenes noted that Antigonus had dismissed his Macedonian troops and only traveled with his mercenaries. At the time Antigonus was in Aegium, a three- day march from Megalopolis. Most of the Achaeans of military age had been killed at Mount Lycaeum and Ladoceia. Cleomenes ordered his army to take five days' worth of rations and sent his troops toward Sellasia, to give the appearance of raiding the territory of Argos. From there he went to the territory of Megalopolis; during the night he ordered one of his friends, Panteus, to capture the weakest section of the walls, while Cleomenes and the rest of the army followed. Panteus managed to capture that section of the wall after killing the sentries. This allowed Cleomenes and the rest of the Spartan army to enter the city.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 23; Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.55. When dawn came, the Megalopolitans realised that the Spartans had entered the city; some of them fled, while others stood and fought against the invaders. Cleomenes' superior numbers forced the defenders to retreat, but their rearguard action allowed most of the population to escape—only 1,000 were captured. Cleomenes sent a message to Messene, where the exiles had gathered, offering to give back their city if they became his allies. The Megalopolitans refused; in retaliation the Spartans ransacked the city and burnt it to the ground. Nicholas Hammond estimated that Cleomenes managed to accumulate around 300 talents of loot from the city.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.55; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 24; ; . Battle of Sellasia The destruction of Megalopolis shook the Achaean League. Cleomenes set off with his army to raid the territory of Argos, knowing that Antigonus would not resist him due to a lack of men. Cleomenes also hoped that his raid would cause the Argives to lose confidence in Antigonus because of his failure to protect their territory.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.64; . Walbank describes this raid as being \\"an impressive demonstration, but it had no effect other than to make it even more clear that Cleomenes had to be defeated in a pitched battle.\\". In the summer of 222 BC, Antigonus summoned his troops from Macedon, who arrived together with other allied forces. According to Polybius, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 Macedonian infantry, most of them armed as phalangites, 3,000 peltasts, 1,200 cavalry, 3,000 mercenaries, 8,600 Greek allies, and 3,000 Achaean infantry, making a total of 29,200 men.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.65; . A drawing of a Macedonian phalanx, similar to the one that fought at the Battle of Sellasia (the shields are smaller and lighter than with a traditional hoplite phalanx, the sarissa is twice as long as the traditional spears and fully enclosed helmets were not as widespread as the drawing suggests).. Cleomenes had fortified all the passes into Laconia with barricades and trenches before setting off with his army of 20,000 men to the pass at Sellasia, on the northern border of Laconia. Overlooking the pass at Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother, Eucleidas, with the allied troops and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries. When Antigonus reached Sellasia with his army, he found it well guarded and decided against storming the strong position. Instead he pitched camp near Sellasia and waited for several days. During this time, he sent scouts to reconnoiter the areas and feign attacks on Cleomenes' position.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.66. Unable to force a move from Cleomenes, Antigonus decided to risk a pitched battle. He positioned some of his Macedonian infantry and Illyrians facing the Evas hill in an articulated phalanx. The Epirots, the Acarnanians and 2,000 Achaean infantry stood behind them as reinforcements. The cavalry took a position opposite Cleomenes' cavalry, with 1,000 Achaean and Megalopolitan infantry in reserve. Together with the rest of his Macedonian infantry and mercenaries Antigonus took his position opposite that of Cleomenes.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.66; . The battle started when the Illyrian troops on the Macedonian right wing attacked the Spartan force on Evas. The Spartan light infantry and cavalry, noticing that the Achaean infantry was not protected at the rear, launched an assault on the back of the Macedonian right wing, and threatened to rout it.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.67. However, at the critical moment, Philopoemon of Megalopolis (who later became one of the greatest heroes of the Achaean League, eventually conquering Sparta), tried to point out the danger to the senior cavalry commanders. When they did not take notice of him, Philopoemon gathered a few other cavalrymen and charged the Spartan cavalry. The Spartans attacking from the rear broke off their engagement with the enemy, which encouraged the Macedonians to charge at the Spartan positions. The Spartans' left flank was eventually forced back and thrown from their position and their commander, Eucleidas, killed; they fled the field.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.69. Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on the left flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a considerable amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape with a small group of men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought survived the battle.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.69; Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 28; ; . Aftermath Following his defeat at Sellasia, Cleomenes briefly returned to Sparta and urged the citizens to accept Antigonus' terms. Under cover of darkness, he fled from Sparta with some friends and went to the city's port of Gythium, where he boarded a ship heading to Egypt.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.69; Plutarch. Cleomenes, 29; ; . Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, its first foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the population generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, although he did not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham.. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell into the hands of successive tyrants.Polybius. The Rise of the Roman Empire, 2.70; Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 30; ; ; . On his arrival at Alexandria, Cleomenes was greeted by Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to respect him and promised to send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents.Plutarch, Life of Cleomenes, 32. However, before he could fulfill his promise, Ptolemy died—and with him any hope for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak Ptolemy IV ascended the throne.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 33; Smith, William. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Cleomenes III\\"; . Ptolemy IV began treating Cleomenes with neglect and soon his chief minister, Sosibius, had Cleomenes put under house arrest after he was falsely accused of plotting against the king.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 34. In 219 BC, Cleomenes and his friends escaped from house arrest and ran through the streets of Alexandria, trying to encourage an uprising against Ptolemy. When this failed, Cleomenes and all of his friends committed suicide.Plutarch. Life of Cleomenes, 37; Smith, William. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Cleomenes III\\"; ; .

Various meetings were held across Australia from January to August 2007, with the event cumulating in Leaders Week, where the heads of government of each member economy attended Sydney, New South Wales from 2 to 9 September 2007. Planning for APEC Australia 2007 As the role of APEC host economy rotates between member economies, Australia had been the designated host for 2007 for a number of years. In August 2004, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet established the APEC 2007 Taskforce to allocate a host city within Australia and to organise the event. On 9 February 2005, Prime Minister John Howard announced that Sydney, New South Wales would host the ultimate Leaders Week event. It was also announced that various preliminary meetings would be held in all Australian state and territory capital cities. Overall security planning was overseen by the Protective Security Coordination Centre (PSCC) of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Attorney-General's Department, through the establishment of an APEC 2007 Security Branch (ASB). The PSCC performed a similar role for the 2006 Commonwealth Games held in Melbourne. At state level, the New South Wales Police Force formed an APEC Police Security Command (APSC) to secure the Leaders Week meetings in Sydney in September. In 2006, the New South Wales government declared 7 September 2007 a public holiday that encompassed the Sydney metropolitan area, so that people would be kept away from the inner city \\"to assist with the smooth operation of the APEC event\\".APEC public holiday to cost businesses about $320m ABC News 28 February 2007. Retrieved 17 September 2007 Preliminary meetings A significant number of meetings have been held all over Australia from January through until August 2007, involving both government departments and businesses from the various APEC member economies: *Canberra, Australian Capital Territory was host to a Senior Officials Meeting in January. *Perth, Western Australia was host to a meeting of mining ministers in February. *Hobart, Tasmania was host to a small and medium enterprises ministerial meeting in March. *The Hunter Valley, New South Wales was host to a Food Safety Cooperation Forum in April. *Adelaide, South Australia was host to a senior officials meeting in April. *Gold Coast, Queensland was host to Fisheries and Marine Resources conservation meetings in April. *Brisbane, Queensland was host to the Agricultural Technical Cooperation Working Group in May. *Darwin, Northern Territory was host to the Energy Ministers Meeting in May. *Sydney, New South Wales was host to the Health Ministers Meeting in June. *Port Douglas, Queensland was host to the Digital Economy Forum for Women and Women Leaders Network Meeting in June. *Cairns, Queensland was host to separate Senior Officials, Trade and Emergency Management meetings in July. *Coolum, Queensland was host to the Finance Ministers Meeting in July and August. *Melbourne, Victoria was host to the Small and Medium Business Enterprise Summit in late August. APEC Leaders Week The venues for Leaders Week meetings included the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre at Darling Harbour and Government House. A giant illuminated APEC Australia 2007 logo was affixed to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a fireworks display occurred on Saturday 8 September between the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. Leaders' spouses attended an event at Bondi Beach, and animals from Taronga Zoo were transported to Garden Island naval base to form a private zoo. International news media reported on an otherwise routine introduction speech at the APEC Business Summit by US President Bush due to several gaffes. He accidentally referred to APEC as \\"OPEC\\", but seemed to recover and turned it into a joke; when thanking the Australian Defence Force for its cooperation, he used the phrase \\"Austrian troops\\"; and finally he attempted to exit the stage in the wrong direction. =Criticism and public response= APEC Leaders Retreat The APEC meeting has been widely criticised for having severe security arrangements, which resulted in closure of roads without sufficient warning as leaders' motorcades travelled around the city. Some Sydneysiders also feared similar disruptions to those experienced during the visit by US Vice President Dick Cheney which caused massive transport disruptions, including the closure of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Civil liberties and political groups were also concerned about changes to NSW law enacted for the APEC meeting, giving the NSW Police Force new powers, including a suspension of the normal function of habeas corpus, freedom of movement, an excluded persons blacklistFive more activists added to blacklist Alexandra Smith, Jordan Baker, and Edmund Tadros, Sydney Morning Herald, 5 September 2007.

Police and security forces had also erected a security perimeter around much of inner city Sydney. Another point of criticism is the cost of security for the event with official budget figures at A$169 million. New South Wales Police Minister David Campbell justified the strong security presence and curtailment of civil liberties on the fear of 'violent protest' from the Mutiny collective, and other protest groups.Anarchist training manual 'justifies' APEC security ABC Online 3 September 2007. Retrieved 12 September 2007 There was also criticism of an allegedly heavy-handed response to some incidents by the police. In one case, for example, a 52-year-old accountant who crossed a road in front of an official motorcade while on his way to lunch with his son was arrested and detained for 22 hours. The Philippine government has sought a clarification regarding an APEC press release describing the Filipino national costume for men, the barong Tagalog, as a \\"peasant shirt\\". A year after the APEC meeting, the Sydney Morning Herald gained access through Freedom of Information to the list of people on the excluded persons list. This revealed that 61 people were on the list, more than double the 29 people the police had indicated during APEC. The list included student activists, 12 members of Mutiny and 13 Greenpeace activists. APEC in action =The first test= NSW Transport Minister John Watkins warned Sydney that traffic conditions in the city were only going to worsen during APEC, and traffic would be held up due to arriving leaders and their motorcades moving throughout the CBD and Sydney area. Buses were stopped because of security measures on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Eastern Distributor off ramp, and passengers walked because traffic was not moving during the morning peak on Wednesday. However, so many Sydneysiders took time off or avoided the city that the regular peak hour traffic was greatly reduced. =Chaser incident= Fake security passes used by the comedians. On 6 September 2007, eleven cast and crew of the Australian satirical TV comedy series, The Chaser's War on Everything including executive producer Julian Morrow and Chas Licciardello, were detained by police outside the InterContinental Hotel after driving a fake motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breaching an APEC security zone. The group breached the secure area by masquerading as the motorcade of the Canadian delegation to APEC. Police only realised that the motorcade was a hoax when Chas Licciardello, dressed as Osama bin Laden, stepped out of an official- looking car replete with a Canadian flag flying from the bonnet, outside the hotel, where U.S. President George W. Bush was staying. They were subsequently detained at Surry Hills Police Station for questioning, and charged with \\"entering a restricted zone without justification\\" under the APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007. Licciardello, Morrow and nine other members of the production team were released on bail, to appear in court on 4 October 2007. The incident led to criticisms of the event's security, and the security of APEC restricted areas. Their forged accreditation contained the printed phrase \\"It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass\\" above the photograph and \\"JOKE\\" next to it. On 28 April 2008 the charges against all eleven members were dropped by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) as it was considered that the police gave \\"tacit\\" permission for the group to enter the restricted zone by failing to identify the fake security badges. The following day, more members of The Chaser team (except for Morrow and Licciardello who were required by police to stay away from APEC security areas) conducted a further stunt, this time dressing up as a line of black limousines made from cardboard. Police detained and questioned them but, as they were outside the exclusion zone, no arrests were made. =Saturday 8th Protest= Saturday 8 September saw the biggest of the organised APEC protest rallies. Attendance was estimated at 3000 by police, 5000 by the media, and 10,000 by event organisers. While police expected crowds of 20,000, heavy rain dampened attendance. The rally was largely peaceful, consisting mainly of students, and mothers and fathers. One incident of violence was reported, with 17 protesters arrested. Two police officers were injured, one officer struck in the forehead with a dart and the other officer struck with an iron bar. A riot control truck equipped with a water cannon was called in but it was not used. = Police Name Tag Removal Inquiry = An inquiry into the removal of name tags by dozens of police officers at the Saturday 8th protest was launched by the New South Wales Police Professional Standards Command following public complaints. Human Rights Monitors member Dale Mills took over 200 photographs of officers with removed name badges. Photographs taken during the protest showed officers wearing badgeless uniforms. A video taken during the protest has one officer stating that the badges were removed as \\"It's one of the policies the bosses have this week\\". Authorities denied that the intent of this policy was to conceal officers' identities. Instead they stated that pin- backed identification tags presented a risk to police officers and that in the future, police assigned to protest duty would be wearing cloth identification tags. Demonstrators have contested this version, stating the police officers at the protest were wearing velcro tags. On Tuesday 18 September, the inquiry cleared all officers of wrongdoing as the name tags 'compromised safety' of the officers. Decisions =Climate change= The \\"Sydney Declaration on Climate Change\\" was signed on 8 September 2007 by the leaders present at APEC. It indicates the wish of signatories to work towards unspecified non-binding \\"aspirational\\" goals on energy efficiency per unit of GDP.

A chemocline is similar to a thermocline, the border at which warmer and cooler waters meet in an ocean, sea, lake, or other body of water. (In some cases, the thermocline and chemocline coincide.) Chemoclines most commonly occur where local conditions favor the formations of anoxic bottom water -- deep water deficient in oxygen, where only anaerobic forms of life can exist. The Black Sea is the classic example of such a body, though similar bodies of water (classified as meromictic lakes) exist across the globe. Aerobic life is restricted to the region above the chemocline, anaerobic below. Photosynthetic forms of anaerobic bacteria, like green phototrophic and purple sulfur bacteria, cluster at the chemocline, taking advantage of both the sunlight from above and the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) produced by the anaerobic bacteria below. In any body of water in which oxygen-rich surface waters are well-mixed (holomictic), no chemocline will exist. To cite the most obvious example, the Earth's global ocean has no chemocline.

History Project Adventure began as an adventure-based physical education program at the Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School in Massachusetts in 1971. Across approximately half a heavily wooded acre behind the school, a range of stations were installed including a low tightrope, a \\"monkey bridge\\" approximately twenty feet above ground, and a trapeze hanging about six feet away from a small platform at the top of a tall pegged pole. At this latter station, students on belay climbed the pole, stood upright on the small platform, and leaped across to try to grasp the trapeze. Students developed problem solving and collaboration skills, as well as overcoming fears and gaining confidence in their physical abilities. Another related tradition at the school was the infamous \\"mud walk\\" where students in the biology program were lashed together for a walk through the Miles River swamp which abutted the Project Adventure grounds. The shortest of students often needed to be helped by others from disappearing below the surface; this support did not always keep them from being submerged temporarily, and all clothes had to be discarded after the activity. However, students were always permitted to opt out of the Project Adventure exercises and the mud walk. By applying Outward Bound's adventure learning principles in schools, the organization received federal funding to expand its programs across the United States.Neill, J.

CWIN supports street children, children subjected to child labour, children who are sexually exploited, and also those victimized by violence. The organization's objective is to protect the rights of children in Nepal. It was established in 1987 by a group of students at Tribhuvan University who, upon investigating the conditions of children living on the streets in Kathmandu, Nepal, recognized the need for advocacy in this area. As a \\"watchdog\\" in the field of child rights in Nepal, CWIN acts as a voice for the disadvantaged and exploited children. It does this by lobbying, campaigning, and pressuring the government to protect and promote children's rights, and to end exploitation, abuse and discrimination against children. The CWIN philosophy of working with children is summed up in its motto: \\"For children, with children\\". It works with the Government of Nepal to develop child-friendly policies, even though the government fails to prevent the violation of children's rights. CWIN researches violations of children's rights and works to inform the government and other decision-making bodies. The organization has a National Resource and Information Centre, a source of information on children's rights. CWIN publishes monthly e-newsletters in English and Nepali, which are distributed worldwide. It also publishes reports, fact-sheets and other materials in audio-visual and print formats. Advocacy and education has always been an important component of CWIN's work. It organizes lobbying campaigns, publishes advocacy material, and organizes training and community action in furtherance of children's rights. It runs classes for adolescent girls from impoverished areas on empowerment.  Background  National Emblem of Nepal During the 1950s, the eradication of malaria in Nepal's Terai region led migrants from other parts of the country to move in and occupy land traditionally owned by the Tharu ethnic community. The Tharu community was not wealthy enough to protect their land. Since there was no tangible proof that they owned the land, they were displaced and used as laborers. It was also during this time when the Kamlari system was put into place. Kamlari is defined as a contracted system in which young girls from poor families are sold into domestic slavery. The practice of Kamlari was applied with the families being used as farmers, having them do agricultural work, then evolved to mainly the women and children used for slavery. This system existed for many years in Nepal's history. Brokers would travel to western Nepal to purchase daughters from their families to work in the Kamlari industry. These brokers usually had an agreement with the families. The deal was typical to provide the daughter with work and her wages would be sent to the family. There was an additional benefit for these poor families, as the bargain relieved them of one more child they would have to feed and provide for. Another part to the agreement was that the children were to be given an education, but this occasionally did not occur. Kamlari was often hidden from the public eye; even though it was conducted in daylight, people in the community were generally unaware of what was truly going on.  Role of United Nations  The United Nations General Assembly fostered the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959. The declaration demanded that every child had the right to education, shelter, good nutrition, health care, and protection. They came to the conclusion that after World War II there was a need to protect and advocate for children around the world. The war left children in danger. UNICEF (United Nations International Child Emergency Fund) was adopted to the UN in 1953 and began a campaign to help children suffering from yaws. Yaws is an easily curable disease, but unfortunately some places around the world do not have access to penicillin which is the cure. UNICEF worked to provide children around the world with this vaccination. In 1989, the UN adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This international treaty was the most adapted human rights treaty in history. The Convention on the Rights of the Child changed the way children and children's rights were viewed in the public eye.  Foundation of CWIN  CWIN originated when a group of Tribhuvan University students saw the need for advocacy for the children in Nepal. They were more specifically focused on the children's living and working conditions. Similarly to UNICEF, CWIN's mission is to protect children around the world from things that are out of their control, whether it be Kamlari practices or the spread of diseases. The students founded CWIN on 1 January 1987. The founder-president was Gauri Pradhan. Since then, CWIN has grown from a small local group in Kathmandu to an organization that is recognized internationally. = Kathmandu = CWIN's initial research was a study of the conditions of street children in Kathmandu. This was the first of numerous academic research projects which CWIN has undertaken into various aspects of children's rights. In 1989, CWIN began to provide practical support for street children in Kathmandu, by opening a \\"common room\\" where they could rest and get medical help, and finding school placings for some of them. In 1995, it established a center for street children and other children at risk in Pokhara. In 1994, CWIN opened Balika Home, a residential crisis-intervention center that provides support for female victims of labor exploitation, sexual abuse, trafficking, domestic violence, torture, and armed conflict. In 1999, it opened a support center at the main Kathmandu bus station for children migrating to the city. CWIN also opened free telephone helplines for children in Kathmandu, Hetauda, Nepalgunj, Pokhara, and Biratnagar, to provide counseling and aid to suffering children. They also opened a hostel for school-aged children who have no roof over their head, or simply no parental support.  Locations  CWIN is mainly based out of Kathmandu, where it was started. Although Kathmandu is where the organization has its central office and a multitude of support buildings, CWIN is present in 37 of the 75 districts in Nepal.

The translation of the document allowed the Nepali people to educate themselves regarding children's rights. During this time, CWIN also published a magazine called Voice of Child Workers, the first ever child advocacy magazine in Nepal. 1988: CWIN organised the first South Asian Seminar-Workshop on Working Children. This provided an opportunity to discuss issues like child servitude and other urgent, child-related issues at the regional level. The workshop was beneficial in expanding the reach of CWIN. The organization also began a non-formal education program, providing learning opportunities for street children. CWIN registered at the Cottage Industry Board as a non-profit organisation. 1989: CWIN's informal education program was developed into the Street Children Support and Socialization Program. The \\"Common Room\\" was created out of demand for a space for children living in Kathmandu who needed a safe spot for medical support, rest, or simply a safe place to be. In addition, CWIN found schools for some of these children to be placed in. 1990: CWIN's leaders were arrested when taking part in the People's Movement in 1990 and were later exiled. Despite this, they continued their research which was later published as: \\"Child Workers in the Stone Quarries\\" and \\"Lost Childhood: survey study on the street children of Kathmandu\\". 1991: This was a busy year for CWIN. It began a national election campaign for child rights. The campaign did not favor any political party; instead representing a broad commitment to better the rights of children. With this campaign, CWIN made 20 recommendations regarding children's issues for the discussion of a new constitution in Nepal. CWIN was officially registered under the Social Service National Coordination Council as a child's rights and advocacy organisation. CWIN continued their research with two projects: \\"Child Workers in Tea Estates of Nepal\\" and \\"Trafficking in Girls in Nepal; Realities and Challenges\\". 1992: Through CWIN's efforts, Nepali government ratified an act prohibiting child labor with the goal of completely eliminating child labor in Nepal. CWIN published three more published research papers: \\"Misery Behind the Looms: child labor in carpet factories in Nepal\\", \\"A Survey Study on Child Workers in Brick Kilns of Kathmandu\\", and \\"Voices form Tea Shops\\". 1993: CWIN organised a major study course of children at risk, such as street children, those working in different sectors (especially the carpet industry), young victims of trafficking prostitution, and children in debt bondage. It organized three other groups to promote advocacy of children's rights: Volunteer Community Initiative, Children at Risk Networking Group, and Women Defend Pressure Group. The organisation published two research documents: \\"Bonded Child Labor: Slavery exists in the Kamalya System and Child Workers in Listi, Sindhupalchowk\\" and \\"Trafficking in Young Women, Mahankal Village, Sindhupalchowk; a brief study on Untouchable Sarki Children in Naikap Bhanjyang\\". 1994: CWIN opened the CWIN children's home, a transit center for children at risk: CWIN Balika. This program helped young girls reintegrate themselves back into the community. CWIN provided them a temporary housing and other services. 1995: Assisting young women coming out of laboring, CWIN established the Self-Reliance Center. The center offered job skill training and placement support. CWIN submitted a document regarding the elimination of child labor to Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari. The Prime Minister then submitted a report regarding a possible solution to the issue of child labor. CWIN also conducted three other case studies: \\"Children at Risk in Pokhara\\", \\"Situation and problems of Tempo Conductor Boys in Kathmandu\\", and \\"Child Marriage in Nepal\\". 1996: CWIN acted together with the government and other organizations to rescue 142 Nepali girls from brothels in Mumbai and return them to their families. Along with this, CWIN worked to organize the South Asian March against Child Servitude to further advocate for children going through harsh realities. 1997: CWIN advised and provided input to the first Child Labour Act in Nepal. They also researched \\"children working as conductors in temps (three wheeler public vehicle\\". 1998: CWIN officially became the regional coordinator for South Asia of the Global March Against Child Labor, greatly expanding their influence. They created a helpline program, which provided services to children at risk such as an ambulance service, therapy, medical and legal advice, and emergency shelters for those trying to escape child labor. CWIN created Sunrise Hostel for children who need shelter and parental care, and also created their website. To further their advocacy for children's well being, the CWIN Local Action Program was created to bringing education regarding the harms of drugs and alcohol use. 1999: CWIN opened a contact centre in Kathmandu city, right outside the bus terminal, for children migrating into the city for laboring jobs based on their research, \\"Far Away from Home\\". They had identified a need for shelter for these children who were alone and were headed for laboring jobs in the city. Becoming aware of pedophilia and child sex tourism in Nepal, CWIN cooperated with the police to take down a foreign officer who was sexually abusing children and hiding it under a child care home. 2000–Present: Since 2000, CWIN has been recognized by UNICEF as a huge advocacy leader when it comes to caring about children's rights. Children have been brought home to their families and have escaped their abuse.  Civil war  During the civil war from 1996 to 2006, 328 children (232 boys and 93 girls) were killed, and 250 children (167 boys and 83 girls) were seriously injured. The civil society raised a strong voice against violence, but the series of child killings and violence against children didn't stop. CWIN, during this period, tried to make everyone aware, using the slogan \\"Children are Zones of Peace\\". CWIN ran training sessions and published advocacy material. They also provided training for peace workers in different parts of the country, to promote the \\"Children are Zones of Peace\\" campaign.

Lyrical themes The song appears to be commenting on moral decay in society; \\"Like those gasping for their last breath. We cannot hide, there's nothing left\\" \\"This world was never worthy, but how can I call it 'unfaithful'? Every promise was fulfilled as decay crawled from its throat.\\" On the album version of the song, both the clean and the screamed vocals in the chorus are sung by vocalist Tim Lambesis, but in the live video shown on Fuel TV's \\"The Daily Habit\\", drummer Jordan Mancino sings the clean lyrics. In most live shows now, bassist Josh Gilbert sings the clean part. Music video The video was directed by Brian Thompson. It starts as if the instrumental intro \\"Separation\\" was part of the song. It shows a dark future in which everyone who is \\"infected\\" is condemned. Several televisions throughout the video show the image of a supposed dictator with the subtitle \\"Condemn The Infected\\". The story starts with a woman who notices a mark on her neck, the mark of the infected. She wears a scarf to conceal the mark, but the scarf is removed later on. Consequently, several people notice and point their fingers at her. The dictator arrives on the scene and takes her to the ancient Roman Colosseum. At the Colosseum, she is stripped of her clothing and humiliated in front of thousands of spectators. She is then taken from the Colosseum and led to the edge of a cliff, where the video ends. The video for \\"The Sound of Truth\\" continues this story. The story continues with a rebellion of infected people being formed (against the supposed dictator) and two infected men rescuing the woman and donning the suits of the two soldiers who were about to throw her off the cliff. The two men go to the room where the supposed dictator is controlling the televisions that he is seen on and capture him. The end of the video shows people screaming for the dictator to be punished. The dictator is thrown on the ground and calls for help but the people continue screaming. The dictator's black leather gloves are then thrown off and the people stop screaming when they see that he is infected, and the video ends. The video for \\"Nothing Left\\" is intercut with shots of the band performing in a room with computers, while the video for \\"The Sound of Truth\\" shows the band performing on top of a building downtown in a storm.

In 2006, under pressure from a new administration led by University President Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., the name of the festival was changed to Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narratives, Spectatorships. The 2007 incarnation of the festival again changed names to Qlassics: Reimagining Sexuality and the Self in Recent American Cinema. More recently, the series has been titled the GlobaLGBTQ+ Film Festival, with a primary focus on films produced outside of the United States. 2004 The first Notre Dame Queer Film Festival ran from February 11, 2004-February 14, 2004 on the campus of The University of Notre Dame. All films were shown at the Hesburgh Library Auditorium. The festival was sponsored by The Gay and Lesbian Alumni/ae of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College (GALA-ND/SMC) as well as several university academic departments, including the Department of Film, Television, and Theater, Department of English, Department of Anthropology, Gender Studies Program, and OutreachND (an unrecognized gay and lesbian student group). The original official mission of the festival was to promote discussion and awareness of queer films in a context of acceptance of all sexualities at the University of Notre Dame, and, in the words of Liam Dacey, co-founder and festival student chair, to \\"normalize the existence of gay students on this campus and offer to the entire community the opportunity to enjoy and study the extraordinary accomplishment of gay cinema artists in the United States.\\" The other co-founder, Richard Friedman, a fifth year architecture and psychology major, worked to establish University and community support and to promote the event. After gaining the support of academic departments, the Queer Film Festival was sanctioned an official academic event. Notre Dame, under president Rev. Edward Malloy, C.S.C., allowed the festival to occur on the principle of academic freedom. As stated by Richard Friedman at the time, \\"You have to understand what a breakthrough this is - the University's administration had even barred gay groups from advertising in the student newspaper.\\" Liam Dacey, a senior film major at the time, worked with Gus Hinojosa, co-founder and GALA ND/SMC Chair, to raise funds, attract national filmmakers, and seek community support. Other notable GALA ND/SMC members who worked on the festival included David Pais and Kevin Heffernan. In a 2004 interview, Dacey said: \\"We want to create an awareness that the gay members of the Notre Dame community are members like anyone else. We also wanted to exhibit a lot of different films by gay artists that you wouldn't normally see.\\" On February 11, 2004, the documentary Jim in Bold screened with producer Malcolm Lazin and Young Gay America co-founders Mike Glatze and Scott MacPhae. On February 12, 2004, Hedwig and the Angry Inch was shown to a sold-out audience. A question and answer session followed with director and star John Cameron Mitchell. Go Fish was shown on February 13, 2004 with an introduction by Notre Dame Professor Jill Godmilow. The final day of the festival featured two films and talkbalk sessions: All Over the Guy with producer/star Dan Bucatinsky, and The Opposite of Sex with director Don Roos. Three panels also took place during the festival. Tom O'Neil led a panel called \\"Gay Hollywood: Still in the Closet\\" on February 12, 2004. Don Roos hosted a screenwriting workshop on February 13, 2004, and Ron Gregg, Programming Director and Lecturer for the Committee on Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Chicago, moderated an academic panel entitled \\"Film and the Construction of Sexual Identity\\" on February 14, 2004. The Queer Film Festival attracted national media attention and was covered in such outlets as The Chicago Tribune and The Fox News Channel. Dacey said at the end of the festival that \\"\\"it's been the best weekend I've had at Notre Dame.\\" 2005 The second Notre Dame Queer Film Festival was held from February 10, 2005-February 12, 2005. The venue of the festival moved to the state-of-the- art Debartolo Center for the Performing Arts Browning Cinema. Dacey shifted his role from student chair to director of operations and media relations for the festival. Joanna Basile was the student chair and GALA ND/SMC Chair Gus Hinojosa remained the alumni chair. The second festival featured Saved! on February 10, 2005 with a talkbalk with director Brian Dannelly. On February 11, 2005, the documentary In Good Conscience: Sister Jeannine Gramick's Journey of Faith screened preceded by a panel on gay marriage with producer Brendan Faye, director Barbara Rick, Rick Garcia, Notre Dame Proefessor Gail Bederman, and Sister Jeannine Gramick. The panel was moderated by GALA ND/SMC member David Pais. A second documentary entitled Gay Pioneers also was shown that day with a talbalk by the late longtime gay and lesbian civil rights activist Barbara Gittings(1932–2007). The film adaptation of Angels in America was shown on the evening of February 11 and afternoon of February 12 while Love! Valour! Compassion! screened on that evening with a question and answer session by director and Tony award-winner Terrence McNally. Matthew Storin, University of Notre Dame Vice President of News and Information, said of the 2005 festival: \\"There are people who object to it and we respect those opinions. But if we attempted to stop the culture of the United States of America in the year 2005 at the gate on Notre Dame Avenue and on Juniper Road, not only would that be a fruitless exercise, but we really wouldn't be preparing our students for the world they're going to enter into.\\" Bishop John D'Arcy of the Ft. Wayne-South Bend, IN diocese condemned the festival as \\"an abuse of academic freedom.\\" Storin responded in a written statement, which said: \\"within reason, we would prefer that our students encounter the secular American culture, with all its faults, in the context of their Catholic education rather than attempting to cloister them till the time they graduate, only then to confront reality.\\" References Film festivals in Indiana LGBT film festivals in the United States LGBT events in Indiana University of Notre Dame Queer culture Film festivals established in 2004 2004 establishments in Indiana ","title":"Notre Dame Queer Film Festival"},{"id":"12834111","text":"Peter D.

He played a major role in the Septimanian rebellion in 672 A.D. Argebad was a strong supporter of King Recceswinth, and remained a supporter of his succesor. When the dux Paul was sent to Narbonensis to quell a revolt of Hilderic of Nîmes in 672, he conspired with the rebels and with his own supporters to stage a revolt and have himself crowned king in opposition to the legitimate monarch, Wamba. Having been apprised of Paul's intentions, Argebad sent word of it to Wamba, but before he himself could prepare the defences of Narbonne to prevent Paul's entering, the rebel and usurper marched on the city and took it. Argebad appears to have come to terms with the insurrectionists, however, for he was at Nîmes with them in late summer. On 2 September 672, Paul, with the counsel of his leading followers, sent word with Argebad to Wamba, who was within four miles of Nîmes. Argebad asked that the rebels be spared their lives and, further, that they be spared any penalty for their disloyalty. Wamba agreed to the first request, but denied the second.

Plot San Francisco debutante Jessica Poole hasn't seen her father \\"Pogo\\" Poole since the divorce between him and her mother Katharine, many years before. Pogo went off to travel the world and enjoy himself, while Katharine remarried to stodgy banker Jim Dougherty. Now Jessica is about to marry Roger Henderson, a cattle rancher from the Valley of the Moon in Sonoma County, and Pogo has been invited to the wedding. Pogo arrives, as charming as he ever was. He is delighted by Jessica, and captivates her in return. He makes peace with Katharine, and even wins over Toy, the Doughertys' prized cook, though not Jim and Roger. But Pogo is still as irresponsible as before. He invites Jessica to come away with him and \\"see the world\\". He even tries to break up her engagement, to Katharine's dismay. He also seems to be coming between Jim and Katharine, who has never quite got over her love for him. Despite Pogo's maneuvers, the wedding goes through. But Pogo has reserved two airline tickets: who's going with him? Katharine, fearing that Pogo has won over Jessica after all, rushes to the airport.

Named 'portrait painter-extraordinary' to Queen Victoria, his pictures depict many of the notable figures of his time. Born in Glasgow, he was the second son of twelve children of Samuel Partridge.Graves RE. ‘Partridge, John (1789–1872)’ (Noble C, revd), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press; 2004) (accessed 23 August 2007) His brother Richard Partridge became the President of the Royal College of Surgeons; his nephew Sir John Bernard Partridge was an illustrator and actor. Education and early career Partridge studied with the portrait painter Thomas Phillips from 1814; he exhibited his first painting, 'Miss Foote in the Character of Lucilla' at the Royal Academy in 1815.Ormond R. (1967) John Partridge and the Fine Arts Commissioners Burlington Magazine 109: 397–403 (accessed 19 August 2007) He moved to London the same year, entering the Royal Academy Schools in 1816. At first he lived in Marylebone, then a popular neighbourhood with artists.Museum Network: Creative Quarters: The Art World in London 1700 to 2000 (accessed 19 August 2007)Museum of London: John Partridge (1790–1872) (accessed 19 August 2007) In 1820, he married his cousin Clementina Sarah Campbell; she features in his painting 'The artist and his family in his house at 21 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square' (c. 1828–35). From 1823 to 1827, he lived in Italy, staying in Florence, Venice, and Rome. During his time there, his focus widened from purely portraits; he sketched landscapes and made copies of Renaissance masters including Correggio, Raphael, Rubens, Tintoretto and Titian. During his stay in Italy, he gained several wealthy patrons. In 1828, soon after his return from Rome, he left Marylebone for the more upper class Brook Street, off Grosvenor Square, where many of his sitters resided. Royal patronage The move seems to have paid off: his career blossomed. Between 1827 and 1845, he painted over two hundred portraits, earning him £2762 in 1841 alone. Many were of prestigious sitters, including an 1836 commission from Leopold I of Belgium, which led two years later to the patronage of Queen Victoria. He painted several successful portraits of the Queen and of Prince Albert,The Royal Collection: John Partridge (accessed 19 August 2007) and in 1843, he became 'portrait painter-extraordinary' to the Queen. Queen Victoria's attentions were, however, to prove fickle, and the 1842 arrival of Franz Xaver Winterhalter, soon the new favourite, cut short Partridge's career as a royal portraitist. Later career and legacy In 1846, Partridge made the decision never to exhibit again at the Royal Academy, after two of his portraits were placed insultingly badly, probably in consequence of a dispute more than a decade earlier with fellow artist and Royal Academician, Ramsay Richard Reinagle, over Partridge altering one of Reinagle's pictures for the owner. He did not change his mind even when, two years later, Reinagle was discredited for claiming another artist's work as his own.Corley TAB. 'Reinagle, Ramsay Richard (1775–1862)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press; 2004) (accessed 23 August 2007) Although Partridge set up a gallery in his studio to exhibit his works, commissions plummeted, with only 76 portraits in the period from 1845 to 1865, and his income inevitably suffered. Towards the end of his life, Partridge railed against this injustice in a pamphlet, On the Constitution and Management of the Royal Academy (1864), writing that he had been \\"driven from the position I held in public estimation and employment ... as the penalty for maintaining any degree of self-respect and independent feeling.\\" Partridge died in London in 1872. He had earlier donated some of his unsold paintings to the National Portrait Gallery, where many are still on display.National Portrait Gallery: John Partridge (1790-1872), Portrait painter (accessed 19 August 2007) Portraits and other works Partridge portrayed many of the notable people of the day, with over three hundred portraits in total. In addition to the royal subjects previously mentioned, he painted the prime minister, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, and many other political or noble figures including Henry Fitzalan- Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen, Frederick Lamb, 3rd Viscount Melbourne, Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay, Maharaja Duleep Singh, George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland and Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston. Other subjects included members of the artistic community such as Daniel Asher Alexander, Robert Trewick Bone, John James Chalon, William Dyce, Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, John Gibson, Charles Robert Leslie, Joseph Severn and Thomas Uwins, and prominent scientists such as Joseph Hodgson and James Watt.Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online: Hodgson, Joseph (1788 - 1869) (accessed 19 August 2007)The Glasgow Story: James Watt: Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection (accessed 19 August 2007) He worked mainly in oil on canvas; several of his paintings were subsequently engraved. His early style was significantly influenced by his teacher Thomas Phillips, who in turn was influenced by Sir Thomas Lawrence. His other works encompassed landscapes, often depicting Italy, paintings with literary themes, and studies, often of children. The majority were exhibited at the British Institution. Usually small, they included numerous pencil sketches, sometimes incorporating an ink or watercolour wash.

Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) eject parts of the gut in order to scare and defend against potential predators such as crabs and fish. The organs are regenerated in a few days by cells in the interior of the sea cucumber. Description When stressed, the sea cucumber faces away from the attacker and contracts its body wall muscles sharply. This causes the wall of the cloaca to tear and the anus to gape. The evisceration process in Eupentacta quinquesemita proceeds as follows: #Three main structures weaken over a period of about 1–3 minutes, become soft and transparent, and eventually separate from their attachments. These are the basal part of the tentacles, the attachment points of the introvert retractor muscles to the longitudinal muscles (there are 10 of these), and the junction of intestine and cloaca. The softening is a state-transformation of the collagen components in the tissue. #Parts eviscerated include the gut, associated haemal vessels, tentacles, and introvert (the dexterous anterior extensible portion of the body wall). The gut tears away from the mesenteries that suspend it within the coelomic cavity. #Most of the gonad stays behind. Only strands of gonad tangled in the gut are eviscerated. The paired respiratory trees and cloaca also remain (although they may be expelled in other species) #The introvert changes from being firm and opaque to being soft and translucent. The body-wall muscles contract and the increased pressure forces coelomic fluid and viscera into the introvert. It enlarges like a balloon and soon ruptures, expelling the fluid and viscera. #This takes about 20 minutes, with final detachment of the tentacles and introvert sometimes taking as long as 12 hours. #The anterior rupture seals, at first by muscular contraction and then by healing as a plug of connective-tissue. Function During evisceration in some species, several hundred Cuvierian tubules (part of the respiratory tree) may be expelled. Water from the respiratory tree is forced into these tubules causing a rapid expansion and they elongate by up to 20 times their original length. They have great tensile strength and become sticky when they encounter any object. The adhesive is unique among marine invertebrates and a firm grip is obtained in under ten seconds. The mass of threads can entangle and immobilise potential predators such as small fish or crabs. The threads become detached from the sea cucumber which crawls away. The tubules are readily regenerated, a process that takes about 17 days in Holothuria leucospilota and five weeks in Holothuria forskali. The tubules contain a toxic saponin called holothurin, which is also present in the body wall in some sea cucumber species. Occurrence The giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus californicus) will often eviscerate due to rough handling, temperature shock, or other stressful treatments. The event occurs through the anus and the eviscerated parts are mainly the respiratory trees. Holothuria arenicola is described as a sea cucumber suitable for keeping in aquaria as it does not eviscerate, whereas the \\"Australian\\" sea apple (Paracucumaria tricolor) frequently eviscerates. Similar behaviour Some starfish evert their stomachs through their mouths to eat their prey. The starfish then retracts its stomach back inside of its body.

The congregation was formally recognized by the Holy See on 16 July 1935. The Sisters of Divine Providence began to serve in the Americas in 1876, now present in the United States, Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo and Peru. They also serve in Korea.  History  =Founding= Kettler was a leading figure in the religious response to the social upheavals of the period in Germany, becoming known for his stands in social justice. He was a strong supporter of organized labor and a decent wage for workers. As part of his efforts to serve the struggling people of his diocese, he founded the Sisters of Divine Providence in the Mainz borough of Finthen on 29 October 1851. The Sisters provided both educational and nursing care to the towns in which they served. He appointed De la Roche, who had been given the religious name of Mother Marie, as the first Mother Superior of the new community. =Growth= When the Sisters of Divine Providence began to operate again in the late 19th century, after the loss of their institutions under the German policy of Kulturkampf, they opened the following nursing facilities: Josefsstift (1890–1973) (now the Ketteler Nursing Home), and the Gastell'sches Hospital (later the De la Roche Nursing Home) in Mombach (1892–1984), St. Elizabeth Women's Clinic (1893–1906), Mary Nursing Home (1898–1912), the municipal nursing home of Heinsberg (1958–1969), St. Hildegarde Nursing Home, now the Catholic Clinic of Mainz (1912) and the Wilhelm-Emmanuel-von-Ketteler School (1973). During the 1920s, the American Province of St. Peter, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had requested the Holy See for autonomy from the congregation in Germany. Instead, the advice was given that provinces should be established. This led to the establishment of three provinces in Germany: Mainz, Offenbach am Main and Bad Homburg, with the one American province in Pittsburgh. =Expansion to America= Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania In 1876 the congregation answered the request for teachers of Richard Gilmour, the Bishop of Cleveland, and sent six Sisters to the United States to begin a new foundation, under the leadership of Mother Xavier Schneider. Sailing from Germany on 7 June, they arrived in New York on 25 June, only to find that the priest in whose parish they were to serve, the Rev. Edward J. Vattrnann of St. Philip Neri Parish in Dungannon, Ohio (now part of Hanoverton, Ohio), never arrived to meet them. They then traveled on their own by train to Cleveland, only to learn that to get to Dungannon required a further 4-hour journey by stagecoach. The Sisters arrived and found a community living in deep poverty. They often starved, despite the goodwill of the people they served. A chance visitor advised these Sisters to settle in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to teach the children of the many German immigrants settled in that region. At the invitation of the Rev. Hune, pastor of Sts. Peter and Paul Parish in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh, they relocated in that parish, where they soon built St. Joseph Motherhouse. As the community expanded, they began to staff parochial schools in the region and eventually became St. Peter's Province, comprised by the Sisters in the United States. St. Louis, Missouri The Sisters of Divine Providence first arrived in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1879, just three years after their arrival in the United States. They moved farther west in order to teach, specifically the children of German immigrants in St. Louis. There they staffed St. Francis de Sales School from 1879 to 1903. Mother Aloysia Bansbach, the new Provincial Superior of the Province of St. Peter, would visit her brother, who was a resident of St. Louis, Missouri. While on a visit there in 1920 she was introduced to a local priest, the Rev. Peter Paul Kaenders, Pastor of St. Mark Catholic Church in Venice, Illinois, who had recently purchased a hospital in Granite City, Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from the city. He wanted to convert the hospital to serve the Catholic community of the region, which included a large German immigrant population, and he invited Mother Aloysia to purchase it for that purpose. The Provincial Council agreed to the sale and in January 1921 six Sisters of Divine Providence arrived at the hospital and assumed responsibility for it. They renamed it St. Elizabeth Hospital, which they operated until 2001 (now Gateway Regional Medical Center). By 1926 the Sisters had expanded into education in the area. The community there grew sufficiently so that, on 1 August 1930, they were formed into a separate province of the congregation. The Sisters of Divine Providence also staffed many Catholic elementary schools in the Dioceses of Belleville, Illinois, Springfield, Illinois, Shreveport, Louisiana, Springfield-Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Jefferson City, Missouri and the Archdiocese of St. Louis. They operated Mount Providence School for Boys in Normandy, Missouri, for 64 years, which also served as the Provincial Motherhouse. Puerto Rico The Sisters of the Province of St. Peter answered a request for help by the Holy Ghost Fathers and established a mission there in 1932. A community of six Sisters was sent, who settled in the town of Arecibo and began to teach in the Casino of Arecibo. They also would teach the Catholic faith to the children of the surrounding countryside. In addition to their other challenges to service on the Caribbean island, for ten years they had to share a house with the family from whom they had purchased it. The Sisters later established a new mission in the town of Utuado. New England The congregation acquired a former dairy farm in Kingston, Massachusetts, in 1946. This served as both a summer camp and the site of Sacred Heart School. Later the Sisters founded Sacred Heart High School on the grounds. The Sisters began to staff schools in Vermont as well. They eventually were all formed into the Province of New England. Current status In 2001, the three American provinces—Pittsburgh, St. Louis and New England, together with the region of Puerto Rico and the mission of Santo Domingo, became one United States-Caribbean province, called the Marie de la Roche Province. At present, the congregation has three provinces: Germany, United States-Caribbean and Korea. There are also Sisters of Divine Province serving in Peru, which is a semi-autonomous region. As of 2013, the congregation currently numbers 460 vowed members and 184 associates. In St. Louis, the Sisters operate Room at the Inn, for homeless families, and La Posada Providencia in Texas for immigrant families.

The watersheds are located in the states of Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in the United States, and in the province of Ontario in Canada. The basin is part of the Great Lakes Basin and Saint Lawrence River Watershed, which feeds into the Atlantic Ocean. 80% of the lake's water flows in from the Detroit River, with only 9% coming from all of the remaining watersheds combined. (The remainder (11%) is derived from direct precipitation into the lake.) A littoral zone serves as the interface between land and lake, being that portion of the basin where the lake is less than in depth.Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy for New York, pp 235-236 History  The Wisconsin glaciation formed the Great Lakes basin The Lake Erie Basin was formed at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation.

National and state environmental agencies, as well as interstate and binational cooperative efforts, focus on water quality, especially since the freshwater lake is used extensively for drinking water, recreation, and the fishing industry. Habitat and flow alteration cause siltation and sedimentation issues which can require dredging. Fertilizer runoff from farms and residences and unplanned releases from sewage treatment plants promote eutrophication through nutrient and organic enrichment, bacterial contamination, and the appearance of ammonium hydroxide. Industrial land use adds metals that flow into the basin and cause sediment contamination.Biological and Water Quality Study of the Toussaint River and Rusha Creek Basins, 2005, Ohio EPA, pp x-xv  See also  * Great Lakes * Waterways that feed the Lake Erie Basin  Indiana  Michigan  New York  Ohio  Ontario  Pennsylvania  References   External links  = Overall = * Lakenet map of North American watersheds * Lakenet profile of Lake Erie Basin * Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP) * Lake Erie Basin integrated habitat and mapping project of the Great Lakes Commission * USGS Water Quality in the Lake Erie / Lake Saint Clair Drainages - MI, OH, IN, NY and PA 1996-1998 (Circular 1203) = Indiana = * See Map of Ohio's Principal Streams and Drainage Areas, including a small but important extension of waterway mapping across Ohio's Lake Erie Basin borders into the states of Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania = Michigan = * Michigan and the Lake Erie Basin * See Map of Ohio's Principal Streams and Drainage Areas, including a small but important extension of waterway mapping across Ohio's Lake Erie Basin borders into the states of Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania = New York = * Lake Erie Basin (pp 235-279 of the Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy for New York) * Lake Erie/Chautauqua Creek Watershed Waterbody Inventory = Ohio = * Map of Ohio's Lake Erie watersheds * Map of Ohio's Principal Streams and Drainage Areas, including a small but important extension of waterway mapping across Ohio's Lake Erie Basin borders into the states of Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania * Chagrin River Watershed Partners * Report on Toussaint River and Rusha Creek watersheds includes detailed map on page 4 = Pennsylvania = * Pennsylvania's watersheds * Interactive map of Pennsylvania's watersheds * Pennsylvania Lake Erie NEMO Project on land use and water quality * Pennsylvania Lake Erie Drainage Basin map * Pennsylvania Lake Erie Basin Subwatersheds map * See Map of Ohio's Principal Streams and Drainage Areas, including a small but important extension of waterway mapping across Ohio's Lake Erie Basin borders into the states of Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania * Samuel Bates' History of Erie County, Pennsylvania, 1884, Chapter IV Streams, Lakes, Bays, Bridges and Culverts * Mill Creek Flood of August 3, 1915 = Ontario = * Priority Environmental Site Map for Ontario Watersheds of Canada Watersheds of the United States Watersheds of Michigan Lake Erie ","title":"Lake Erie Basin"},{"id":"12834452","text":"Bump in the Night is the second album by former Small Faces and Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan, released in 1981 on Mercury Records.

Over 2,000 decorated rock fragments extend to the foot of the mountain. These petroglyphs, some believed to date back to the Paleolithic (12,000 BCE), are carved onto dark brownish-black volcanic stones left behind by an extinct volcano. Later Chalcolithic and Bronze Age cultures continued to create petroglyphs at the site; \\"the largest variety and number of carvings date to this period and the early Iron Age, before it was finally abandoned except for a few carvings made by lonely shepherds spending their summers on the mountain top.\\"http://www.armenianheritage.org/en/monument/Ughtasar/120 Although the site was discovered in the early 20th century, it was not really studied until the 1920s and again in the late 1960s; it is still not fully understood today. The carvings on the rock fragments depict hunting scenes, a wide array of animals, spirals, circles and geometric shapes, and even zodiac signs. Research suggests that the area served as a temporary dwelling for nomadic cattle-herding tribes, and studies of the rock carvings indicate that they were in use for hundreds of years, with peoples of later eras adding their own engravings to the stones. According to the research of Hamlet Martirosyan, the pictograms of Ughtasar represent a writing system known as \\"goat writing\\" or \\"itsagir\\". Many scholars believe that this was due to the large number of goats drawn on the stones, but according to Martirosyan it is because in the ancient Armenian language, the words “goat” and “writing” were homonyms. They would use these homonyms to express concepts through pictures, thus the abstract concept of “writing” (which in ancient Armenian can be expressed with words like “shar” – arrange, “sarel” – compile, “tsir” – a line) found its reflection in the representation of a goat (“zar”), because the words for “writing” and “goat” sounded the same. Goats are a prevalent theme on the stones, possibly because the word “dig” in ancient Armenian meant goat and was close enough to “diq,” the ancient word for gods. By combining abstract signs with the images of animals and people in horizontal or vertical rows, prehistoric engravers were able to convey specific messages. Reproductions of the petroglyphs, or rock engravings, of Ughtasar can be found all over Yerevan; they are inscribed onto silver jewelry, painted onto coffee cups, traced into hand-made pottery, and they adorn the walls of cafes. Reaching the petroglyphs of Ughtasar can be challenging.

After Japan's defeat, the US Occupation authorities classified Watanabe as a war criminal for his mistreatment of prisoners of war (POWs), but he managed to evade arrest and was never tried in court. While in the military, Watanabe allegedly ordered one man to report to him to be punched in the face every night for three weeks, and practiced judo on an appendectomy patient. One of his prisoners was American track star and Olympian Louis Zamperini. Zamperini reported that Watanabe beat his prisoners often, causing them serious injuries. It is said Watanabe made one officer sit in a shack, wearing only a fundoshi undergarment, for four days in winter, and that he tied a sixty-five- year-old prisoner to a tree for days. According to Hillenbrand's book, Watanabe had studied French, in which he was fluent, and had interest in the French school of nihilist philosophy which holds that life and human existence is basically meaningless.  Later life  In 1945, General Douglas MacArthur included Watanabe as number 23 on his list of the 40 most wanted war criminals in Japan. However, Watanabe went into hiding and was never prosecuted. In 1952, all charges were dropped. In 1956, the Japanese literary magazine Bungeishunjū published an interview with Watanabe titled \\"I do not want to be judged by America.\\" He later became an insurance salesman, and grew wealthy. Prior to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, the CBS News program 60 Minutes interviewed Watanabe at the Hotel Okura in Tokyo as part of a feature on Louis Zamperini who, four days before his 81st birthday, was returning to carry the Olympic Flame torch through Naoetsu en route to Nagano, not far from the POW camp where he had been held. In the interview, Watanabe acknowledged beating and kicking prisoners, but was unrepentant, saying, \\"I treated the prisoners strictly as enemies of Japan.\\" Zamperini attempted to meet with his chief and most brutal tormentor, but Watanabe, who had evaded prosecution as a war criminal, refused to see him. Watanabe died in April 2003.  Legacy  Accounts of Watanabe's abusive behavior are given in Laura Hillenbrand's book about Zamperini titled Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption (2010). Watanabe also appears in Dr. Alfred A. Weinstein's memoir, Barbed Wire Surgeon, published in 1948. In 2014, Japanese musician Miyavi played Watanabe in Angelina Jolie's Unbroken, the film adaptation of Hillenbrand's book.

McLemore moved to Texas in 1878 and was employed as a cowboy, printer, and newspaper reporter, and later as a miner in Colorado and Mexico. He returned to Texas and settled in San Antonio working primarily in the newspaper business in Kyle, Texas. Political career McLemore moved to Corpus Christi in 1889 and established the Gulf News and was elected to the Texas House of Representatives, serving from 1892 to 1896.Handbook of Texas Online He later moved to Austin, where he was elected to the Board of Aldermen for one term. McLemore was elected Secretary of the Democratic State executive committee from 1900 to 1904. In 1903, he founded a weekly magazine entitled State Topics, which eventually became Texas Monthly Review and State Topics. McLemore relocated, now to Houston, in 1911, where he again engaged in the newspaper publishing business. In 1915, he was elected as a Democrat to Congress to represent one of the state's two at-large districts. He served two terms, from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1919. McLemore was an ardent opponent of America's entry into World War I, a position that he believed he held in common with President Woodrow Wilson, who campaigned for reelection on the slogan \\"He kept us out of war\\".

They were one component of a confederation which consisted of Yagma, the Karluks, the Chigils and other tribes which founded the Kara-Khanid Khanate. From the seventh century until the Karakhanid period, the Yagma were recorded in Arabic, Persian, and Chinese accounts as a prominent and powerful political entity in the Tarim Basin, Dzungaria, and Jeti-su. History The Yagmas appear to be of Toquz Oghuz origin or are closely associated with them. According to Hudud al-'alam \\"their king is from the family of the Toquz-Oghuz kings.\\" According to the Persian work Mujmal al-Tawarikh wa-'l-Qisas, the Yağma \\"padšâh\\" bore the title of Bogra Khan. The Yagma title of Bogra Khan allowed V.Bartold to suggest that Karakhanid Il-khans were from the Yagma tribe. Mahmud al-Kashgari mentioned the Yagma and Tukhsi tribes, with a clan of Chigils, along the Ili River.1, 85 In the tenth century the Yagma tribe lived in the Kashgar area and further northwest. Al Gardezi, who used sources composed in the eighth century, wrote that the Yagma united numerous tribes between the Uyghurs and Karluks in the larger part of the eastern Tian Shan, including Kashgar City and District. Gardezi called the Yagma a \\"rich people with large herds of horses\\" in a country of \\"one month of travel\\". The Yagma constantly clashed with the Karluks and the Kimaks, and were a dependent of the Western Turkic Kagans until their demise. Etymology According to Yury Zuev, a semantic meaning of the word yağma in the ancient Common Turkic language, is \\"attack, onslaught.\\"Yu. Zuev, \\"Early Türks: Essays on history and ideology\\", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 227, However, according to Peter Golden, the word may have derived from Turkic verbal root yağ- \\"to pour down, rain\\", but noting that the form with -ma is unusual. He also noted the Persian word yaġmâ meaning \\"prey, plunder, booty, spoils\\", and that it is unclear if it has any relationship with Yağma.

She was the bronze medalist for springboard diving at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Fauntz was born in New Orleans, and raised in Chicago, where she attended Hyde Park High School. Unable to compete in high school swimming competitions because of a ban on female interscholastic athletics in Illinois, Fauntz competed as a teenager first for Hirsch Center and then for the Illinois Women's Athletic Club swimming and diving teams. In March 1928 she set new world records for the 100-yard breaststroke (1:20.3) and 100-meter breaststroke (1:29.3) at a dual meet against a Canadian team. About six months before that she was hit by a car and severely injured the radial nerve in her right arm. At the age of 17 at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Fauntz finished in fifth place in the women's 200-meter breaststroke. Her specialty, however, was diving. Describing Fauntz during the Olympic diving competition, author Paul Gallico wrote in the New York Daily News: > \\"..Her marvelous body flowed through the dives with the smoothness of > running quicksilver.\\" That \\"marvelous body\\" became a source of mild controversy at the Los Angeles games, when a Hungarian diving judge, Dr. Leo Donath, ordered the diving competition halted until the American divers changed their suits; he had objected to the near-backless cut of the team-supplied swimsuit. At the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) swimming indoor national championships in Chicago in 1929, Fauntz won two national titles within the space of one half-hour, winning the one-meter springboard and 100-meter breaststroke titles. Fauntz captured the three-meter springboard bronze medal at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, finishing 5 points behind gold medalist Georgia Coleman and a single point behind silver medalist Katherine Rawls, helping the United States team to a sweep of the event. Fauntz led the competition after the compulsory dives, but slipped to third after mistiming the entry on her next-to-last optional dive. (Fauntz later said this dive was \\"the worst one I'd ever done. There went my world; I didn't even want to come up from the pool.\\") Fauntz parlayed her Olympic success to a career in marketing, modeling, and professional aquatic exhibitions. She became one of the first female athletes to appear on the Wheaties cereal box; she was also one of many celebrities of the time recruited to endorse cigarettes (in her case, Camels) and beer (Falstaff). Jane also appeared as cover girl for Life and Ladies Home Journal. She worked as a model for Saks Fifth Avenue. As a professional diver, Fauntz appeared in exhibitions at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, where she met future husband Edgar \\"Eggs\\" Manske, an All-American football star at Northwestern University; they married in 1936. An artist by training (B.A., art education, University of Illinois) and vocation, Fauntz was a painter and sculptor. While her husband was serving in the United States Navy during World War II, she made ceramic figurines for California Faience in Berkeley, California, and later sold her figurines under the trade name \\"Jane Fauntz Original\\". She taught high school art classes for 20 years at Las Lomas High School in Walnut Creek, California, where she also coached boys' diving. Her bronze bust of former University of California football coach Lynn \\"Pappy\\" Waldorf is on display at the university's Sports Hall of Fame. Fauntz died of leukemia on May 30, 1989. In 1991 she was posthumously inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

It contains both flavin and nonheme iron as cofactors. The enzyme has a very broad specificity and can act on most D-amino acids. D-amino acid + H2O + acceptor <=> a 2-oxo acid + NH3 + reduced acceptor This reaction is distinct from the oxidation reaction catalysed by D-amino acid oxidase that uses oxygen as a second substrate, as the dehydrogenase can use many different compounds as electron acceptors, with the physiological substrate being coenzyme Q. D-amino acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes NADPH from NADP+ and D- glucose to produce D- amino acids and glucose dehydrogenase. Some but not limited to these amino acids are D-leucine, D-isoleucine, and D-Valine, which are essential amino acids that humans cannot synthesize due to the fact that they are not included in their diet. Moreover, D- amino acids catalyzes the formation of 2-oxo acids to produce D- amino acids in the presence of DCIP which is an electron acceptor. D-amino acids are used as components of pharmaceutical products, such as antibiotics, anticoagulants, and pesticides, because they have been shown to be not only more potent than their L enantiomers, but also more resistant to enzyme degradation. D-amino acid dehydrogenase enzymes have been synthesized via mutagenesis with an ability to produce straight, branched, cyclic aliphatic and aromatic D-amino acids. Solubilized D-amino acid dehydrogenase tends to increase its affinity for D-alanine, D-asparagine, and D-alpha-amino-n-butyrate. In E. coli K12 D-amino acid dehydrogenase is most active with D-alanine as its substrate, as this amino acid is the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. The enzyme works optimally at pH 8.9 and has a Michaelis constant for D-alanine equal to 30 mM. DAD discovered in gram-negative E. coli B membrane can convert L-amino acids into D-amino acids as well. Additionally, D- amino acid dehydrogenase is used in Dye-Linked dehydrogenase (Dye-DHs) which uses artificial dyes such as 2,6-Dichloroindophenol (DCIP) as their electron acceptor rather than using their natural electron acceptors. This can accelerate the reaction between the enzyme and the substrate when the electrons are being transferred. Use in synthesis reactions D-Amino Acid Dehydrogenase has shown itself to be effective in the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids such as D-Leucine, D-Isoleucine, and D-Valine. In the given study, researchers were successfully able to use D-amino acid dehydrogenase to create high amounts of these products from the starting material of 2-oxo acids, in the presence of ammonia. The conditions for this were variable, though the best results appeared at around 65 °C. Amino Acids obtained through these reactions resulted in a high enantioselectivity of >99% and high yields of >99%. Given the nature of this enzyme, it may be possible to use it in order to create non-branched D-amino acids as well as modified D-amino acids. Obtaining D-Amino Acid Dehydrogenase In one study, in order to test the viability of using D-amino dehydrogenase in synthesis reactions, researchers used mutant bacteria to obtain and create different strains of the enzyme. These researchers found that it only required five mutations in order to modify the selective D-Amino Dehydrogenase into working with other D-amino acids. They also found that it retained its highly selective nature, capable of receiving mostly D-enantiomers after mutation, with yields in excess of 95%. A heat- stable variant of D-amino acid dehydrogenase was found in the bacterium Rhodothermus marinus JCM9785. This variant is involved in the catabolism of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline. From the given studies, in order to obtain D-amino acid dehydrogenase one must first introduce and express it within a given bacterial species, some of which have been previously referenced. It must then be purified under favorable conditions. These are based upon the particular species of D-amino acid dehydrogenase used in a given research experiment. Under incorrect conditions, the protein may denature. For example, it was found that specifically D-alanine dehydrogenases from E. coli and P. aeruginosa would lose most of their activity when subjected to conditions of 37 - 42 °C. After this, it is possible to separate and purify through existing methods. Artificial D-Amino Acid Dehydrogenase Due to the drawbacks of current methods, researchers have begun work on creating an artificial enzyme capable of producing the same D-amino acids as enzymes from naturally occurring sources. By adding five amino acids to a given sample isolated from U. thermosphaericus, they succeeded. By modifying the amino acid sequence, researchers were able to change the specificity of the molecule towards certain reactants and products, showing that it may be possible to use artificial D-amino acid dehydrogenase to screen for certain D-amino acid products.

Written by Chuck Dixon, with artwork by Jeff Johnson and Tom Ryder, the series ran for a total of twenty-four issues before its publication was stopped due to CrossGen's bankruptcy. The series is set in CrossGen's Sigilverse shared universe in the Empire of Shinacea, on the planet Hann Jinn. This planet is also the setting for two other Sigilverse series, The Path and Brath. Publication history The twenty-four published issues of Way of the Rat were dated from June 2002 to June 2004. Silken Ghost, one of the series' supporting characters received her own five issue limited series in 2003. Characters *Boon Sai Hong: A thief from the city of Zhumar, known as the Jade Rat and the series main character. Named and nicknamed after famous thief Boon Sai Hong, who lived in the 15th century and stole an artifact called \\"The Jade Rat\\" that has never been found. *Po Po: A sapient monkey and Boon's advisor. *Tei Su: The daughter of one of Zhumar's prominent scholars. She is secretly the masked warrior known as the Silken Ghost. Plot synopsis =Issues #1-6= The series begins with Boon Sai Hong, a local thief in the northern city of Zhumar breaking into the house of the scholar Wing Tei. He finds Tei already dead and steals two objects he later discovers to be the Ring of Staffs (which turns the wearer into an instant master of Bōjutsu) and the Book of the Hell of the Hungry Dragons. He fails to find the third object he intended to steal, the Phoenix Heart, which he later discovers was stolen before his arrival by fellow thieves, Jao and Yan. Discovered in the act, Boon must fight his way past agents of Zhumar's corrupt ruler Judge X'ain. As he runs he gains an advisor, the sapient monkey Po Po and discovers the ring he now wears gives him the ability to be a master of any art using any type of staff weapon. He also learns that the scroll is the gateway to a hell dimension population by dragons who devour the souls of all those unlucky enough to fall into their realm. As all of this goes on, Bhuto Khan, the leader of the nomadic tribes to the west of Zhumar prepares his army to attack the city. Khan bears a ring known as the Ring of Blades, giving him the ability to use any bladed weapon at a master level of skill. =Issues #7-12= Having beaten Bhuto Khan in combat and now in possession the Ring of Blades, Boon is carried through the streets of Zhumar by a celebrating populace. They ask him his name, but mishear him and begin to chant the name Poon Fei Lhong. The celebration reaches the house of Judge X'ain who invites Boon to dinner that night. There Judge X'ain takes possession of the Book of the Hell of the Hungry Dragons. Using his new toy, Judge X'ain releases the dragons intending to use them for some unknown purpose. He quickly loses control when they begin to devour one another and grow bigger until there is only one singular huge dragon left. It kills Judge X'ain and his agents and breaks free into Zhumar itself. Boon, with help from the Silken Ghost and the Emperor's daughter, Princess Zheng Mai Lo (with secret aide from Tiger Mah and Old Mother, the leaders of Zhumar's thieves guild—The Brotherhood of Scoundrels) defeats this huge dragon by slicing its belly and releasing all of the smaller dragons inside. He recovers the Book of the Hell of the Hungry Dragons and the Silken Ghost reads the scroll to send the dragons back. Princess Zheng Mai Lo is dragged back with them. In the aftermath of the battle, Boon gives the Ring of Blades to the Silken Ghost. =Issues #13-18= In the wake of the fight with the Dragons, a mass exodus from Zhumar begins to occur. This is quickly stopped when the newly appointed ruler, Minister Hyun orders the city gates closed. Inside, Boon and his allies seek a way to free Princess Zhend Mai Lo from the Hell of the Hungry Dragons using the Phoenix Heart. This effort fails, but results in the return of the ghost of Judge X'ain to the land of the living. Old Mother uses the Phoenix Heart and Judge X'ain is pulled inside, but he almost immediately returns having released all the trapped ghosts inside. As a result of this event all the dead in Zhumar begin to rise and the city is quickly filled with ghosts. This attracts the attention of a being known as Kung Kung Yi, a spirit that devours other spirits. Kung Kung Yi begins to feast and eventually gains enough power to allow it the ability to rip the souls from the bodies of living beings. Tei Su's grandfather, one of the ghosts who have returned, shows her where she can find Ghost Slayer, a sword capable of destroying any spirit, including Kung Kung Yi. As all of the released ghosts flee into the safety of the Phoenix Heart to escape Kung Kung Yi, Boon and the Silken Ghost engage the evil spirit in battle. =Issues #19-24= As the Silken Ghost takes care of the evil spirits that remain in Zhumar, the ghost of Judge X'ain discovers how to possess the living and uses this ability to once again take control of Zhumar. In the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Scoundrels, Boon searches for the missing Jao and Yan. Unknown to Boon, the two had stolen a powerful cursed object from Old Mother's room. This object is a wishing doll, a small porcelain statuette that grants any wish, but twists the words used for the wish in the most evil ways it can. Jao and Yan had wished for riches and the doll had sent them inside a sealed treasure chamber with no way to escape and no food or water. Boon picks up the doll and wishes to know where they are and the doll sends him and Po Po to Jao and Yan's location As this is happening a stranger arrives at the front gates of the city. He identifies himself as Poon Fei Lhong and declares that he has come to Zhumar to seek out the man who has stolen his name. He wears a third magic ring—the Ring of Fists. He is confronted by the Silken Ghost who, after a short battle, convinces him that Boon did not mean to steal his name. He decides to leave Zhumar and takes a new name Nung Boa—No Name. In the treasure vault Boon, Po Po, Jao and Yan encounter the vault's guardian monsters. As they fight for their lives Old Mother discovers the wishing doll sitting in the middle of Jao and Yan's room and quickly figures out what happened to them. After working a great deal of time crafting a wish for which the wording cannot be twisted by the wishing doll she wishes Boon, Po Po, Jao and Yan home.

It was filmed in Shelburne, Nova Scotia. The original screenplay was written by Valarie Trapp about her maternal grandmother, Virginia. Plot Virginia Lofton is a 13-year-old girl living with her older sister Caroline and their father Ford. Deborah, the mother of Virginia and Caroline, was killed three years earlier after a fall in a riding accident. Ford has sold their horse, Twister, to a neighbor and forbidden his daughters from riding in an effort to keep them safe. Ford and Caroline both blame Twister for Deborah's death. Twister dies in childbirth while she delivers a foal and Virginia names the foal Stormy. Virginia sneaks out to care for Stormy and ride him at night. The owner, Blake, tries to train Stormy to race for his son Darrow, who is also Caroline's boyfriend, but the horse doesn't get along well with him. Blake decides to sell Stormy and Virginia is heartbroken. Ford is able to track down the person who bought Stormy and he buys him back to give to Virginia as a birthday present. Virginia has started working with one of Blake's trainers, Jessie. Virginia tells her how much she loves horses and how riding them is a way to remember her mom. After trying to reason with him Ford explains to Jessie that he's trying to protect Virginia. Jessie tries to get Ford to understand that by not letting Virginia ride, he is only crushing her spirit. Ford realizes that Deborah wouldn't have wanted him to stop riding or to keep Virginia away from horses. He starts riding with Virginia and giving her lessons. There is a race on Memorial Day and he thinks that she and Stormy are ready. Virginia is riding by herself and she comes across Darrow riding with his buddies. He challenges her to a race to the train tracks and Virginia barely makes it, missing the train by a few feet. Darrow realizes that she is a better rider and that he needs to do something to prevent her from beating him in the race. He and his buddies kidnap Stormy. When Virginia finds out that Stormy is missing, she is distraught. Her father believes that Stormy has just escaped, but she tells her sister that she believes Darrow stole him. Caroline thinks that she can find out what happened by coming on to one of his friends, who tells her where to find Stormy. Virginia finds Stormy and gets to the town square where the race is about to begin. The race officials refuse to let her race because she is late, but after the crowd starts chanting, \\"Let Virginia Ride! Let Virginia Ride!\\" she is allowed to participate. She starts out behind but catches up to the pack. Darrow was in the lead since the beginning, but when he sees Virginia he resorts to cheating. He knocks her off her horse and then hides a trail marker flag, so she will get lost. When she can't figure out which way to go by looking at her map, Stormy knows she is lost and he tells her which way to go. She catches up to Darrow again and wins the race. Darrow's father convinces the MC to disqualify Virginia for some vague and unspecified violation and Darrow tries to accept the trophy. Virginia notices something in his pocket and tells Caroline to check it out. She sneaks up to him and pulls out the flag. He is disqualified for cheating and Virginia accepts the trophy while two men from the audience toss the MC into a water trough. At home, the family is eating dinner with Jessie. Blake has fired Jessie and Caroline has broken up with Darrow. Virginia comments that they are happier than they have been in a long time. She walks outside to feed Stormy and knows she would not won the race if not for memories of her mother.

New Narrative strove to represent subjective experience honestly without pretense that a text can be absolutely objective nor its meaning absolutely fluid. Authenticity is paramount in New Narrative, and is possible with a variety of devices, including fragmentation, meta-text, identity politics, explicit descriptions of sex and undisguised identification with the author's physicality, intentionality, interior emotional life and external life circumstances. The New Narrative movement includes many gay and lesbian authors, and the works were greatly influenced by the AIDS epidemic in the '80s. In addition to founders Bruce Boone and Robert Gluck, New Narrative writers include Gail Scott, Michael Amnasen, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Sam D'Allesandro, Cookie Mueller, Dennis Cooper, Kathy Acker, Bo Huston, Camille Roy, Steve Abbott, Gary Indiana and filmmakers Warren Sonbert.  Overview  The term \\"New Narrative\\" was first coined in Steve Abbott's magazine Soup. The movement was founded by Robert Glück and Bruce Boone, two poets living in San Francisco in the late 1970s as a reaction and growth from the Language poets. The New Narrative writers began to emerge from a workshop held at Small Press Traffic Bookstore by Robert Glück. New Narrative writings strive to combine a representation of the author as theory-based with a representation of the author as a member of a particular identity without alienating any certain demographic of readers.Glück, Robert. “Long Note on New Narrative.” Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative. Ed. Mary Burger et al. Toronto: Coach House Books, 2004.  The Role of the Author  In New Narrative writing, the author acknowledges being a physical being and confronts sexuality directly.Bellamy, Dodie. “Low Culture.” Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative. Ed. Mary Burger et al. Toronto: Couch House Books, 2004. 226. This closeness between writing and writer as a body is also achieved by transgressions that appear in many of the New Narrative authors’ works.Schultz, Kathy Lou. “Proceed Queerly: The Sentence as Compositional Unit.” Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative. Ed. Mary Burger et al. Toronto: Couch House Books, 2004. 222. Authors create a dialogue between themselves and the readers by directly addressing and engaging the reader in their pieces. The authors also situate themselves in time and space by including pop culture references. Some authors define New Narrative writing by physical space rather than actual writing style, since the movement originated from the physical space in the writing workshops held by Robert Glück in the back of Small Press Traffic Bookstore.  Characteristics of New Narrative  The characteristics of New Narrative are determined and explained by members of the movement itself. In her essay \\"Reading Tour\\" in Pink Steam, with Kevin Killian\\" In his piece Long Note on New Narrative, Robert Glück defines the New Narrative movement as writings that possess the following characteristics: awareness of physical space, metatext, poetic strategies applied to prose, creating works out of found material of autobiography, and \\"gossip as legitimate art.\\" Cunningham, Brent. Recent Bay Writing.  New Narrative and Language Poets  In \\"Long Note on New Narrative,\\" Robert Glück says that Language Poetry seemed very \\"straight male,\\" and he strove to find a genre that would embrace those of different identities, specifically one affiliated with the gay, lesbian, and feminist writing encompassed in New Narrative. New Narrative authors make \\"emotions and the experience of the body\\" and celebrate the idea of experimenting with prose as a community of writers rather than as individuals, two elements that Language Poetry seems to be lacking.Neigh, Janet. Review of Biting the Error. To summarize the difference, Dodie Bellamy wrote, \\"I think of Bob Perelman's parody of lyric poetry, 'I look out the window and I am deep.' New Narrative, at its worst, would be, 'I have sex and I'm smarter than you.'\\" Bellamy, Dodie. “The Cheese Stands Alone.” Academonia. San Francisco: Krupskaya, 2006. 115. In an interview, Kevin Killian said that the New Narrative authors agreed with the Language Poets' ideas of transforming narrative structure, but they thought language poetry lacked \\"fun.\\" Also, he claimed that Language Poets were more well-versed in theory.An interview with Kevin Killian While Killian states that one of the differences between Language Poets and New Narrative writers is the Language Poets' knowledge of theory, Glück says that the New Narrative has its inspiration in the theorists Georg Lukács, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, and Georges Bataille. For Killian and other New Narrative writers, the key difference here is more than simply whether or not New Narrative works use theory in general; rather, these New Narrativists are drawing our attention to their distinctly punk means of learning theory in the first place. Far from the ivory tower origins of most LANGUAGE Poetry, New Narrative writers often came into a theoretical and philosophical maturity via the free, open-to-the-public workshops that were something between a book club, a street protest, and a lecture hall.For more on the early days of New Narrative and the origin of its first wave of authors, see Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian's anthology \\"Writers Who Love Too Much: New Narrative Writing 1977-1997\\" (Nightboat Books).  Publications  Presses that publish New Narrative writing include Hard Press, Serpent's Tail, Black Star Series, and Semiotext(e). New Narrative work is also included on Robert Glück's online magazine, Narrativity, and in the published companion Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative, edited by Glück, Gail Scott, Mary Burger and Camille Roy. In 2017, Nighboat Books published Writers Who Love Too Much: New Narrative Writing 1977-1997, an anthology edited by Bellamy and Killian.

The film was the directorial debut of Jia Zhangke, one of the major figures of the so-called Sixth Generation of Chinese cinema and stars Wang Hongwei in the titular role along with Hao Hongjian and Zuo Baitao. Xiao Wu was filmed in the city of Fenyang in 16 mm. Synopsis The film is set in 1997, with the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong being mentioned in the background. The place is a small provincial town, dirty and poor. Xiao Wu is one of a group of pickpockets, most of whom have moved on to become small traders and legal or semi-legal. One of them, formerly a close friend, is getting married and decides not to invite Xiao Wu, a reminder of the past. He drifts around, discontent with this, but makes no effort to change. He acquires a girlfriend, a prostitute who takes a liking to him, but she drops him when she finds someone better. He visits his poor-peasant family but ends up quarrelling with his parents and saying he won't ever come back. Finally he gets arrested and we last see him handcuffed in the middle of the street with a disapproving crowd watching him. There is a big crack-down on crime, something mentioned at the start of the film, so his fate is likely to be harsh. Production history While a student in the mid-1990s, Jia Zhangke remained a relative unknown at China's prestigious Beijing Film Academy. While still in school, Jia directed the short film Xiao Shan Going Home which he was eventually able to screen abroad, winning the top prize at the 1997 Hong Kong Independent Short Film & Video Awards This success brought Jia into contact with cinematographer Yu Lik-wai and producer Li Kit Ming. With their support, Jia was able to begin work on Xiao Wu, which would become his first feature film. Xiao Wu was shot on a mere 400,000 RMB budget (or about $50,000 US). Reception Xiao Wu was praised by the American filmmaker Martin Scorsese, a noted fan of Jia's works. =Awards and nominations= *Berlin International Film Festival, Forum section, 1998  NETPAC Award  Wolfgang Staudte Award *Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, 1999  Official selection *Nantes Three Continents Festival, 1998  Golden Montgolfiere (Tied with Wandâfuru raifu) *Pusan International Film Festival, 1998  New Currents Award *San Francisco International Film Festival, 1999  SKYY Prize *Vancouver International Film Festival 1998  Dragons and Tigers Award Notes External links  *Xiao Wu at the Chinese Movie Database * 1997 films 1998 films 1997 drama films Chinese films Chinese independent films Films directed by Jia Zhangke Films set in 1997 Films set in China Films set in Shanxi Mandarin-language films 1998 directorial debut films 1997 directorial debut films 1998 drama films ","title":"Xiao Wu"},{"id":"12835147","text":"Lev Shcherba (commonly Scherba) (Russian: Лев Влади́мирович Ще́рба, Belarusian: Леў Уладзіміравіч Шчэрба) ( – December 26, 1944) was a Russian linguist and lexicographer specializing in phonetics and phonology. Born in Igumen (Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire,In his Curriculum Vitae, Scherba gave his place of birth as St. Petersburg. now Chervyen, Belarus) to the family of an engineer. Shcherba went to secondary school in Kiev, where he graduated in 1898, and briefly attended Kiev University before he moved to the capital and entered St. Petersburg University.Shcherba's Curriculum Vitae in \\"Три автобиографии Л.В. Щербы\\" There, he studied under Jan Baudouin de Courtenay and graduated in 1903. In 1906 he traveled abroad, first to Leipzig and then to northern Italy, where he studied Tuscan dialects. During the autumn holidays of 1907 and 1908, on the advice of Baudouin de Courtenay, he studied the Sorbian languages and wrote a description of the Mužakow dialect (spoken in the east, near Muskau). In late 1907 he went to Paris, where he worked in the experimental phonetics laboratory of Jean-Pierre Rousselot studying the phonetics of a series of languages using experimental methods;Yazykovoi ostrov bio on his return to Russia he began setting up an experimental phonetics laboratory, paying for equipment from his own stipend, and this became the institution that now bears his name.\\"Sto let eksperimental'no-foneticheskikh issledovanii v Rossii\\" As early as 1912, basing himself on the ideas of Baudouin de Courtenay, he elaborated the concept of the phoneme, defined by him as the grouping of sounds into \\"sound types\\". In 1912 he defended his master's thesis and in 1915 received his doctorate from St. Petersburg University, where he was a professor from 1916 to 1941. He became the founder of the so-called \\"Leningrad school\\" of phonology, which included M. I. Matusevich and L. R. Zinder among others and carried on a polemic with the \\"Moscow school.\\"Peoples.ru bio However, he spent the last few years of his life in Moscow, where he died. He became an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1943. Beyond phonology, Shcherba made significant contributions to the wider fields of linguistics and lexicography. In contrast to Ferdinand de Saussure, he recognized three rather than two objects of study: speech activity, language systems, and language material. He placed emphasis on the question of the capacity of the speaker to produce sentences never previously heard, a question which would become important to the linguistics of the later twentieth century. He also emphasized the importance of experiments in linguistics, particularly that of negative results, developing methods which became important for field study. He was the teacher of the lexicographer Sergei Ozhegov, author of the most widely used Russian dictionary. Shcherba is the author of the glokaya kuzdra sentence, which consists of words whose roots do not exist in Russian, but has correct construction in terms of Russian morphology and syntax — similar to Chomsky's Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. He invented this sentence to illustrate the distinction between grammar and vocabulary. Selected works * 1912.

It was first published in hardcover by Doubleday in 1983 and in paperback by the Fawcett Crest imprint of Ballantine Books in 1985. The book collects thirty stories by Asimov, most reprinted from magazines and a few previously unpublished, together with a foreword and afterword by the author. Each story is set at a club known as the Union Club, in which a conversation between three members prompts a fourth member, Griswold, to tell about a mystery he has solved. These are often tall stories, and often based on his time in US intelligence. The format is based on that utilized by P. G. Wodehouse in recounting his golf stories. According to reviewer John H. Jenkins, these stories are not rated particularly well by Asimov fans, and are less well regarded than his better known Black Widowers mysteries. He does regard a few of them more highly, particularly \\"No Refuge Could Save\\" and \\"Hide and Seek,\\" but feels the brevity and format of the stories allows the author little scope.The Union Club Mysteries – a book review by John H.

In some rural areas nonsubscribers would even run long cables to distribution boxes on nearby utility poles. Set-top boxes were required with some systems, but these were generic, and often in an unknowing violation of contract, former customers would donate them to thrift stores for sale or retain them indefinitely in storage when they ended their subscription to the service rather than return them to the provider. To prevent this, cable providers built stronger protection against theft into new digital cable systems which were deployed beginning in the mid-1990s as part of the changeover to the new digital HDTV standard, along with assessing a large fine for the entire cost of a set-top box if the customer didn't return it upon the termination of services. This has greatly reduced cable theft, although pirate decryption continued on some DVB-C systems which are based on the same compromised encryption schemes formerly used in satellite television broadcasting. Most cable companies have also issued new secured outside distribution boxes which require certain keys only given out to their installers to access, making theft via outside split line more difficult. As of 2017, many cable providers have switched to digital-only systems which require mandatory use of either their approved set top boxes or an approved CableCARD device. In many cases, no analog channels are available, and if they are, are usually just the provider's paid programming, Emergency Alert System and barker channels, or merely a one-channel signal which lets a customer or installer know the signal is viewable on a television set. Channels and programming may also be available through digital media player devices such as the Roku or Apple TV (along with tablets and smartphones) via provider apps, which confirm subscriber eligibility through a private internal IP network and require an on-network connection to the provider (including disallowing connections to outside virtual private network services to emulate a home network connection elsewhere), making any piracy through that venue virtually impossible. Digital cable systems In most modern digital cable systems the signals are encrypted, so cases of people obtaining illegal service are less common. The subscriber requires a set-top box provided by the cable company to decrypt and receive the cable signal. Unlike the older analog set-top boxes, the digital set-top box will not function until the cable company activates it by sending it a unique activation key through the cable, which is sent only after the subscriber signs up. Each set-top box is individually addressable, so a given box can be deactivated by command from the company if the subscriber fails to pay his bill (this is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \\"bullet\\"). A box only decrypts the channel being watched, so each box can only be used with one television, requiring subscribers to lease additional boxes at greater expense for multiple televisions. One minor loophole is that the cable company has no way of knowing where a given set-top box is located, and once activated a box will function anywhere in the local cable system. Subscribers are often provided with several set-top boxes as part of their subscription, and can give or sell unneeded activated boxes to neighboring nonsubscribers who can use them in their own residences, though a provider using IP location using the cable modem within a set-top box featuring advanced two-way features can avert this situation. This system is dependent on the security of the encryption system chosen by the cable company in question. Old cable equipment used an analog signal that was scrambled by tuning the signal so the picture was unsteady, just as Macrovision does at an attempt to copy a video. The equipment would descramble the signal so that it can be viewed by the subscriber. It also is addressable, meaning that it can be remotely controlled by the company's technical staff. The first major case covered by the media was when 317 subscribers were caught in 1991 when the company they subscribed to sent a \\"bullet\\" (a video signal that turns off the equipment) to their cable boxes. The boxes were modified, but possibly belonged to the cable company.

She also trained in ballet as a child, having a love of dance from a very early age. Specialising in Latin American and representing England with Paul Killick, she won the titles of United Kingdom Open Champion, International Champion, World Series Champion, World Masters Champion, Dutch Open Champion, United States Open Champion, Asian Open Champion, Kremlin Cup Champion and also became the British National Champion four times. Together they were also runner up in every major professional championship, such as the World Championship, European Championship and also the British Open Championship, where in 2002 they came close to taking the title, after being placed first in two out of five dances: Rumba and Paso Doble. Before partnering Paul Killick, Karttunen also danced professionally with Sandro Cavallini for Italy, Geir Bakke for Norway and Rick Valenzuela for the United States. As an amateur competitor, she danced for her home country, Finland, becoming a national champion and international finalist with Jaakko Toivonen. Karttunen has credited Markku Siltala and former world professional Latin American champion Espen Salberg as two of her main coaches throughout her career. In 2004, Karttunen took part in the first series of the BBC television show Strictly Come Dancing, where she danced with EastEnders actor Christopher Parker. Although they were regularly placed last by the judges, Parker's enormous fan base was enough to keep them in the competition right up to the final, where they ended the series in second place. Since then, Karttunen has appeared as a guest performer on the show in Russia, South Africa, Italy, United Kingdom and the United States. When Paul Killick announced his retirement from competition in May 2004, Karttunen went on to partner Victor Da Silva in the style of Exhibition. Representing South Africa, together they won the World Championships and the British Open Championships three times each. They were also invited to lecture and perform at some of the biggest and most prestigious dance events in the world. Early on in 2008, Karttunen returned to the style of Latin American, partnering fellow champion Slavik Kryklyvyy. They represented Finland and danced only one competition together, the United Kingdom Open Championship in January 2009 where they placed 6th, before announcing the termination of their partnership just one year after it had begun. Following this, Karttunen returned to Exhibition and resumed her former partnership with Victor Da Silva.

Castronovo was born to a Sicilian father and an Ecuadorian mother in Queens, New York, but grew up in Southern California. He attended California State University, Fullerton, for undergraduate studies in classical voice. During his time at the university, his talent came to the attention of William Vendice, the chorusmaster of the Los Angeles Opera, who promptly hired him as a chorister.http://www.losangelesopera.com/artist/castronovo.charles.htm Career He began his professional career as a resident artist with the Los Angeles Opera. In the summer of 1998 he was a participant in San Francisco Opera's prestigious Merola Opera Program, and later joined the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist Development Program. After garnering much experience at the Metropolitan Opera, a series of significant role debuts soon followed such as Don Ottavio (Mozart's Don Giovanni), Ernesto (Donizetti's Don Pasquale), Fenton (Verdi's Falstaff), Ferrando in Mozart's Così fan tutte, Tamino (Mozart's Die Zauberflöte) and Alfredo in Verdi's La traviata. He has sung at many of the world's leading opera houses such as: the Metropolitan Opera, Royal Opera, Covent Garden, Berlin State Opera, Vienna State Opera, San Francisco Opera, Salzburg Festival and Santa Fe Opera. The 2006/07 season marked a series of role debuts such as Rodolfo in La bohème, Nadir (Les pêcheurs de perles), the Duke in Verdi's Rigoletto, and Mylio in Édouard Lalo's Le roi d'Ys. The 2007/08 season marked the role debut of Tom Rakewell (The Rake's Progress) at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, and a return to Los Angeles Opera singing the role of Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni. During the 2008/09 season, Castronovo debuted at the Washington National Opera, and performed his first Edgardo in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. In June 2009, Castronovo returned to San Francisco Opera as Alfredo opposite Anna Netrebko in Verdi's La traviata. Later, in November, he performed the title role in Faust for the Washington Concert Opera. In the Fall of 2010, Castronovo debuted the role of Mario Ruoppolo in the world premiere of Daniel Catán's Il Postino at the Los Angeles Opera, along with Plácido Domingo, which was repeated in June 2011 at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris, again with Plácido Domingo. In the Summer of 2011, Castronovo made his debut with the Aix-en- Provence Festival, appearing with French soprano Natalie Dessay in Verdi's La traviata. The 2011/12 season marked Castronovo's debut with the Lyric Opera of Chicago, singing the role of Tamino. In August 2011 he appeared at the Royal Albert Hall with the John Wilson Orchestra in the now celebrated series of Proms, dedicated to the great Hollywood musicals. In June 2012, Castronovo debuted the role of Nero in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea with Teatro Real. In the summer of 2014, he performed the title role in Hector Berlioz's La damnation de Faust, standing in for Ramón Vargas, at the Verbier Festival.

The \\"art of representation\\" () is a critical term used by the seminal Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski to describe a method of acting. It comes from his acting manual An Actor Prepares (1936). Stanislavski defines his own approach to acting as \\"experiencing the role\\" and contrasts it with the \\"art of representation\\".In addition to Stanislavski's An Actor Prepares, for his conception of 'experiencing the role' see Carnicke (1998), especially chapter five. It is on the basis of this formulation that the American Method acting teacher Uta Hagen defines her recommended Stanislavskian approach as 'presentational' acting, as opposed to 'representational' acting.Hagen (1973, 11-13). This use, however, directly contradicts mainstream critical use of these terms. Despite the distinction, Stanislavskian theatre, in which actors 'experience' their roles, remains 'representational' in the broader critical sense.See the article Presentational acting and Representational acting for a fuller discussion of the different uses of these terms. 'Experiencing' and 'representing' Preparing a rhetorical performance before a mirror.Stanislavski warns explicitly against the use of a mirror in his own training method: \\"You must be very careful in the use of a mirror. It teaches an actor to watch the outside rather than the inside of his soul, both in himself and in his part\\" (1936, 19). The use of the word 'soul' indicates the idealistic dimensions of his approach; in a more socially-orientated, materialistic approach, Bertolt Brecht recommends 'living the role' as a rehearsal process, but insists that this should be articulated dialectically with another, critical process of viewing the character externally, from the perspective of society. The 'mirror exercise', in which actors behave as mirror-images to one another, is common in actor-training (see Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed techniques or the improvisation exercises of Viola Spolin). The image is a detail from a frontispiece portraying Demosthenes and Andronicus. It is taken from John Bulwer's Chironomia (1644). The 'inner' experience may be supplemented by an 'outside' perspective on the role in the 'art of representation' approach to acting. In \\"When Acting is an Art\\", having watched his students' first attempts at a performance, Stanislavski's fictional persona Tortsov offers a series of critiques, during the course of which he defines different forms and approaches to acting.\\"When Acting is an Art\\" is the second chapter of An Actor Prepares (Stanislavski 1936, 12-30). They are: 'forced acting', 'overacting', 'the exploitation of art', 'mechanical acting', 'art of representation', and his own 'experiencing the role'. One symptom of the recurrent myopic ideological bias displayed by commentators schooled in the American Method is their frequent confusion of the first five of these categories with one another; Stanislavski, however, goes to some lengths to insist that two of them deserve to be evaluated as 'Art' (and only two of them): his own approach of experiencing the role and that of the art of representation. In Stanislavski's estimation, the crucial difference between the two approaches that are worthy to be considered 'Art' lies not in what an actor does when preparing for a role during the rehearsal process but rather what they do during their performance of that role before an audience.There are, however, differences between their respective rehearsal processes, some of which Stanislavski discusses. See the note attached to the picture of a rhetorician before a mirror in this article. During rehearsals, Stanislavski argues, both approaches make use of a process of 'living the part', in which the actor becomes \\"completely carried away by the play ..., not noticing how he [sic] feels, not thinking about what he does, and it all moves of its own accord, subconsciously and intuitively.\\"Stanislavski (1936, 13). The actor immerses themselves in the character's experience of the fictional reality in the play. In a state of absorption, the actor responds 'naturally' and 'organically' to that situation and the events that proceed from it (a 'natural' and 'organic' response conceived along lines originating from Pavlovian behaviourism and James-Lang via Ribot Psychophysiology).See Roach, especially chapter six, 'The Paradoxe as Paradigm: The Structure of a Russian Revolution' (1985, 195-217). The two approaches diverge in the way this work relates to what an actor does during a performance. In Stanislavski's own 'experiencing the role' approach, \\"you must live the part every moment that you are playing it, and every time. Each time it is recreated it must be lived afresh and incarnated afresh.\\"Stanislavski (1936, 19). As the repeated use of 'afresh' suggests, Stanislavski's approach retains a quality of improvisation in performance and strives to enable the actor to experience the emotions of the character on- stage (though emphatically not by means of focusing on those emotions).Stanislavski insists: \\"Fix this for all time in your memories: On the stage there cannot be, under any circumstances, action which is directed immediately at the arousing of a feeling for its own sake. To ignore this rule results only in the most disgusting artificiality. When you are choosing some bit of action leave feeling and spiritual content alone. Never seek to be jealous, or to make love, or to suffer, for its own sake. Of the thing that goes before you should think as hard as you can. As for the result, it will produce itself\\" (1936, 40-41). In contrast, the approach that Stanislavski calls the 'art of representation' uses 'living the role' during rehearsals as \\"but one of the preparatory stages for further artistic work.\\"Stanislavski (1936, 18). The actor integrates the results of their 'living the part' from their rehearsal process into a finished artistic form (in contrast to the improvisatory quality of Stanislavski's approach). \\"The portrait ready, it needs only to be framed; that is, put on the stage.\\"Stanislavski (1936, 22). In performance, Stanislavski continues (quoting Coquelin), \\"the actor does not live, he plays. He remains cold toward the object of his acting but his art must be perfection.\\" The actor does not focus on 'experiencing the role' afresh, but, instead, on its accuracy and artistic finish. This conception of the actor's work originates in the philosopher and dramatist Diderot's Paradox of Acting.See Roach (1985), especially the chapter on Stanislavski. The distinction between Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' and Coquelin's 'representing the part' turns on the relationship that the actor establishes with their character during the performance. In Stanislavski's approach, by the time the actor reaches the stage, they no longer experience a distinction between themselves and the character. The actor has created a third being, or a combination of the actor's personality and the role. (In Russian, Stanislavski calls this creation artisto-rol.)See Benedetti (1998, 9-11) and Carnicke (1998, 170). In the art of representation approach, while on-stage the actor experiences the distinction between the two. (Diderot describes this psychological duality as the actor's paradox.)

Originally designed to resemble situations a horse and rider might actually encounter when on a trail in a natural habitat, modern trail classes now tend to focus more heavily on agility and manners, with courses bearing very little resemblance to real-world natural trails. A typical trail course requires horse and rider to open and pass through a small gate while mounted; walk across a fake bridge; cross over a set of rails or logs at a walk, trot or lope; back up, often with a turn while backing; sidepass, often over a rail or log; turn on the forehand or hindquarters within a confined area; and tolerate some type of \\"spooky\\" obstacle, such as having the rider put on a vinyl raincoat. The horse is asked to perform all three gaits in the process of completing the course.Strickland Competing in Western Shows p. 48-53 Additional obstacles or tests may include walking over a plastic tarp or through water; having the horse ground-tie (remain standing in one spot while the rider walks away); to walk, trot or lope in very tight quarters, such as traveling through a series of cones or markers in a serpentine pattern; or take a small jump (usually under 18 inches, as riders are in western saddles and cannot easily get off the horse's back into a jumping position).

WS20-24 accessed on August 28, 2007 Course designers often add both beauty and challenge to a course by adding potted shrubs, flowers, and brightly painting various obstacle elements. Local shows not governed by the rules of a national organization may have simpler courses that do not require all three gaits, have fewer, simpler obstacles, or easier spacing. On the other hand, unsanctioned shows may also have far more imaginative courses than do larger competitions. Obstacles not allowed at most sanctioned shows but sometimes seen at the local level may include asking a horse to load in a strange trailer; asking the horse to pass quietly by animal hides (cow hides are common, but even bear skins may be seen) or asking the horse to pass by or even lead unusual live animals (everything from goats and mules to llamas). Often, the only limit is the course designer's imagination. Another popular event that combines elements of a trail class with actual natural conditions is the judged trail ride, where riders travel a natural trail, usually of five to ten miles, and periodically come upon obstacles where the horse's manners and performance are judged.

It is typically given to children and sometimes teachers, often in conjunction with the game of Dreidel. In the 20th century, candy manufacturers started selling Hanukkah-themed chocolate \\"coins\\" wrapped in gold or silver foil, as a substitute or supplement to real money gifts. History =Money= Rabbi A. P. Bloch has written that > \\"The tradition of giving money (Chanukah gelt) to children is of long > standing. The custom had its origin in the 17th-century practice of Polish > Jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their > teachers. In time, as children demanded their due, money was also given to > children to keep for themselves. Teenage boys soon came in for their share. > According to Magen Avraham (18th century), it was the custom for poor > yeshiva students to visit homes of Jewish benefactors who dispensed Chanukah > money (Orach Chaim 670). The rabbis approved of the custom of giving money > on Chanukah because it publicized the story of the miracle of the oil.\\" According to popular legend, it is linked to the miraculous victory of the Maccabees over the ancient Greeks. To celebrate their freedom, the Hasmoneans minted national coins. It may also have begun in 18th-century Eastern Europe as a token of gratitude toward religious teachers, similar to the custom of tipping service people on Christmas. In 1958, the Bank of Israel issued commemorative coins for use as Hanukka gelt. That year, the coin bore the image of the same menorah that appeared on Maccabean coins 2,000 years ago. =Chocolate= American chocolatiers of the 20th century picked up on the gift/coin concept by creating chocolate gelt. In the 1920s, Loft's, an American candy company, produced the first chocolate gelt, wrapped in gold or silver foil in mesh pouches resembling money bags.The gelt chronicles, Leah Koenig, The Jewish Daily Forward, reprinted in Haaretz, November 12, 2009; Rabbi Deborah R. Prinz, \\"Chanukkah and Christmas Chocolate Melt into Gelt,\\" in On the Chocolate Trail: A Delicious Adventure Connecting Jews, Religions, History, Travel, Rituals and Recipes to the Magic of Cacao, Jewish Lights Publishing, 2013. Chocolate 'geld' is also given to children as part of Saint Nicholas Day in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands (geld, spelled with a d, being both the Dutch and German word for money). Today most of the chocolate Hanukkah gelt sold in the United States is imported, including from Dutch firms Steenland Chocolate and the Israeli firms Elite and Carmit. Gourmet versions of chocolate gelt have been produced in the United States and Europe as well. Customs Parents often give children chocolate gelt to play dreidel with. In terms of actual gelt (money), parents and grandparents or other relatives may give sums of money as an official Hanukkah gift. According to a survey done in 2006, 74 percent of parents in Israel give their children Chanukah gelt. In Hasidic communities, the Rebbes distribute coins to those who visit them during Hanukkah. Hasidic Jews consider this to be an auspicious blessing from the Rebbe, and a segulah for success. The amount is usually in small coins.

(It should not be confused with Tyrone House, Marlborough Street, Dublin, a townhouse designed by Richard Cassels for The 1st Earl of Tyrone of the 3rd creation in 1740.) Its original owner was Christopher St. George, scion of an old Norman Galwegian family. The house was reputedly designed by John Roberts (1712–1796) of Waterford, who also designed Moore Hall in County Mayo and Waterford Cathedral. The St. George family at the time owned much of the area around Kilcolgan. Arthur French St. George was described as a resident proprietor in 1824. In 1912, Tyrone House was described as \\"rather dilipated\\" by visitor Violet Martin. It served as an inspiration for the novel \\"The Big House at Inver\\" by Edith Somerville, published in 1925.

He served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1943 to 1966 and from 1969 to 1972, representing the Division of Eden-Monaro for the Labor Party. Early life Fraser was born in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton and brought up in Tasmania. He left State High School, Hobart at 17 to become a journalist on the Hobart Mercury. He worked for the Argus in Melbourne from 1922 to 1929 when he moved to Canberra to work for The Sun. He married Eda Kathleen Bourke in 1931. In 1933, he worked for The Times in London, before returning to Australia to work for the Sun and the Sydney Daily Telegraph, but was sacked in 1938. Bob Heffron, the leader of the Industrial Labor Party, which had broken from the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party led by Jack Lang, appointed him as his secretary. He acted as Heffron's media officer and helped formulate the strategy that overcame Lang's control of the branch. He subsequently worked as news editor on the Daily News and then returned to the Canberra parliamentary press gallery in 1940 as political correspondent for Ezra Norton's Truth and from 1941 Norton's new Daily Mirror. Fraser was active in the Australian Journalists Association and had been secretary, treasurer and president of its Victorian district between 1926 and 1929 and treasurer of the New South Wales district from 1937 to 1938. Between 1941 and 1944 he was president of the Canberra sub-district of the AJA. Political career Fraser in 1965. ABC interview with Robert Menzies and Allan Fraser, discussing their recollections of the Petrov Affair. In 1943, Fraser beat Jessie Street for Labor preselection for Eden-Monaro. He entered federal parliament at the 1943 election, which gave John Curtin's ALP government a large majority. A split in the conservative vote knocked United Australia Party incumbent John Perkins into third place, allowing Fraser to become only the second Labor member ever to win the seat. Fraser tended to be independent and at times critical of his party. In particular, he condemned H. V. Evatt in relation to his handling of the Industrial Groups and the 1954 Labor Party split (although he himself was no Grouper). After Labor's defeat in 1955 Fraser stood against Evatt for the leadership, but lost 58 to 20 and lost his high ranking in caucus' executive. He later became increasingly interested in foreign affairs and was particularly critical of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War. In the 1966 election Labor's opposition to the war led to its being vanquished in a landslide, and Fraser lost his seat to Liberal challenger Dugald Munro. He regained it in 1969, when the war had become less popular and a strong swing to Labor nearly allowed it to win government. He retired at the 1972 election, when the Whitlam government came to power. In 1974, Fraser won a seat in Fraser as an independent in the original Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly1974–1986 and was, in consequence, expelled from the Labor Party. He died in Canberra and was survived by his wife and son. His brother, Jim Fraser, was MP for the adjoining seat of Australian Capital Territory from 1951 to 1970.

Early history As part of the peace terms that ended the Natchez War of 1716, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville required the Natchez to build the fort by providing materials and labor. Sited close to the main Natchez settlement, called the Grand Village of the Natchez, Fort Rosalie served as the primary French stronghold and trading post among the Natchez. French settlements and tobacco plantations were established in Natchez territory, with the fort serving as the local seat of colonial government. Growing tension between the French and the Natchez erupted into violence several times during the 1720s, culminating in a massive Natchez attack on November 29, 1729. They destroyed the entire French settlement, killing nearly all the men and taking hundreds of women and children captive. The Natchez seized and occupied Fort Rosalie. Retaliation by the French and allied Choctaw forces in 1730 forced the Natchez to evacuate, leaving the fort in ruins. By 1731 the French, with their more numerous Indian allies, had killed, captured, or dispersed most of the Natchez, and they ceased to exist as a tribe. The French sold surviving Natchez into slavery, many destined for French plantations in the Caribbean. Some escaped and found refuge among the Chickasaw, Creek, and Cherokee of the region. The French rebuilt Fort Rosalie in the early 1730s. Fort Panmure Following the Treaty of Paris in 1763 after the British won the Seven Years' War, the French ceded the fort and part of present-day Louisiana to British control (with New Orleans and the land west of the Mississippi River going to Spain). The British renamed the fort Fort Panmure. The British fort was named after William Maule who was the Earl of Panmure. Capture of Fort Panmure The British controlled the fort from that cession (1763) until the Spanish campaign under Galvez in 1779 (sixteen years). After Bernardo de Galvez conquered Baton Rouge (1779), Fort Panmure capitulated without further Spanish action. Spanish military intervention was only required in 1781 to put down a rebellion by local settlers loyal to Britain <[Dunbar Rowland, title=Mississippi the heart of the South, 1912]>. Galvez was the Governor of Spanish Luisiana and Commander of the troops of the Catholic Majesty. During the American Revolutionary War, Spain declared war against Great Britain and held control of the fort from 1779 to 1798. After 1798, the United States took over, establishing the Mississippi Territory with Natchez as its first territorial capital. Today The U.S. abandoned the fort in 1804. The city of Natchez traces its origin to the founding of Fort Rosalie in 1716. Today the site of the fort is part of Natchez National Historical Park.

He was the eldest son of Jahanara Imam. In her memoir about the war, Ekatorer Dinguli, Rumi was portrayed as the premier character. Rumi was murdered by the Pakistani Army and for being the mother of a martyr from the liberation war, Jahanara Imam was also known as Shaheed Janoni or martyr's mother. Early life Rumi was born on 29 March 1951 in the higher middle-class family of Jahanara and Sharif Imam. He started his education at a local kindergarten school in Azimpur. Rumi passed his matriculation from Adamjee Cantonment Public School & College in 1968. He stood third in the Pakistan Education Board. During his college days, Rumi joined the University Officers Training Corps along with his friends. He was later promoted to the rank of Sergeant. By october 1970, he completed his H.S.C. and got admitted in Engineering College (currently BUET). He was also enrolled into Illinois Institute of Technology but did not attend due to the war. Bangladesh Liberation War During the earlier part of the war, Rumi constantly attempted to convince his mother for giving him the permission to attend the war. As his mother finally agreed on 19 April 1971, Rumi compiled his first attempt to cross the border to India on 2 May. But he had to come back for adverse situation and became successful in his second try. He took training for the war in Melaghar, Agartala under Sector-2. It was the sector supervised by Khaled Mosharraf and Rashid Haider. After his training he came to Dhaka to join the Crack Platoon, a group that conducted major guerrilla operations against the Pakistan Army. His major target was to bomb the Siddhirganj Power Station. Rumi participated in hit and run attacks, including the shooting of police guards outside a house Dhanmondi Road 18 that led to his capture, detention and demise. In the Dhanmondi operation, Rumi and his friends carried out a successful assault on the Pakistanis, shooting and killing soldiers from the back window of a black Morris Oxford and then giving the pursuers the slip. The whole street of Dhanmondi gentry celebrated it. Arrest by Pakistan Army and aftermath After his operation he became an icon to his fellow warriors. He stayed the night of 29 August 1971 to his house, the night when Pakistan Army caught most of the guerrilla fighters based on their information from an unknown source. His father, younger brother and a cousin were also arrested with him by the oppressors, led by a Captain Quayyum. They were first taken to the intersect of Mirpur Road and Elephant road. There they were lined up in front of a military jeep and intelligence officers identified each of them by throwing headlights on the faces. Among all Rumi was separated and took to a military vehicle while Sharif with other arrested family members got in their family car. Sharif himself was driving and was accompanied by two armed military personnel, was following the military convoy. Later Rumi told to his father in detention that in that vehicle Rumi was accompanied by almost all the freedom fighters he fought with days prior to the arrest. However, from Elephant Road they were taken to Ramna Police Station where a new series of identification took place. From there the military convoy headed to Dhaka Cantonment, this time too Sharif was driving as a part of the convoy though was one of the detainees. In Dhaka Cantonment army tortured both Rumi and others seriously and kept them in a small room somewhere near or inside a hostel in the cantonment. There they were accompanied by many other victims of that night including artist Altaf Mahmud, Abul Barak and Rumi's colleague Azad, Jewel and others. In that room Rumi explained to his brother Jami that army already are fully aware of his operations and he and his colleague Bodi took the full responsibly of the attacks. He advised Sharif and Jami to give the same statements and to tell the army that the family (of Rumi) were completely unaware of his activities. Rumi's cousin, who was arrested with them, was freed on 2 September 1971 reportedly because he was able to show a bus ticket which incidentally was in his pocket and proved him not be a permanent resident of Rumi's residence. Sharif, Jami were cut loose two days later on 4 September. They returned with harrowing tales of torture. Sharif, exhausted from tiredness and injured from severe torture, drove his car to his Elephant Road residence. Rumi with others of his co-fighters Bodi, Jewel and others, were later never found, assumably became one of the hundreds of thousands of people massacred by the military junta. Some sources claim that a number of arrested freedom fighters were executed at midnight of 4 September and Rumi had been one of them. Among the captured, Chullu, one of Rumi's valiant co-fighters, was confined in the Central Jail of Dhaka, from where he was rescued by a group of sector-2 freedom fighters after the allied forces occupied Dhaka on 16 December. As Rumi along with his co-fighters had been acting as the key masterminds of Dhaka metropolitan oriented guerrilla warfare to that date and among them almost all then staying in Dhaka were captured on days around 29 August, the crackdown appeared as a temporary halt to Mukti Bahini operations in Dhaka . Later, though the Sector 2 commander Maj. Khaled Mosharraf had to largely curtail his Dhaka supplies because of intensifying frontier conflicts, by the end of September the capital again started being shaken by frequent guerrilla attacks on military units and bombing on key locations, and this time it continued almost up to the Pakistani surrender in December later that year. As Yahya Khan was set to announce mass mercy on 5 September 1971 many family relatives instated to ask mercy petition for Rumi to the government. Rumi's parents took the suggestion and thought over it but later decided to not do so because they considered it to be a dishonor to Rumi's views and ideology. Rumi's father Engr. Sharif Imam underwent a massive heart-attack on 13 December 1971, was rushed to IPGMR (popularly known as PG hospital), where he died at late night because the defibrillator couldn't be used due to a blackout being carried out as an official Indo-Pak war had started a week ago. Verdict for killing Rumi On 18 July 2013, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed was found guilty and received life sentence on the charge related to the killing of Rumi along with Badi, Jewel, Azad and Altaf Mahmud at the army camp set up in Nakhalpara, Dhaka, during the Liberation War.

Yates. The book delves into the history of Hermeticism and its influence upon Renaissance philosophy and Giordano Bruno. With the publication of Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, Yates transformed Renaissance historiography. In it, she revealed the hermeticism with which the Renaissance was imbued, and the revived interest in mysticism, magic and Gnosticism of Late Antiquity that survived the Middle Ages. In the face of longstanding conventional interpretations, Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of heliocentricity.

The members of the band that brought him to fame (which was known by several names: The Hill Billies, Al Hopkins' Original Hill Billies, and Al Hopkins and His Buckle Busters) came variously from Hopkins' own Watauga County, North Carolina, and from Grayson and Carroll Counties in Virginia.Archie Green, Hillbilly Music: Source & Symbol (part 2) , Southern Folklife Collection, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Accessed 19 August 2007.David Sanjek says \\"North Carolina and Kentucky\\", but it is an aside in an article not focused on Hopkins or his group. Although the group formed up in 1924 in Galax, Virginia, they were based in Washington, D.C., and performed regularly on WRC. In 1927 they became the first country musicians to perform in New York City. They were also the first to play for a president of the United States (Calvin Coolidge, at a Press Correspondents' gathering) and the first to appear in a movie (a 15-minute Warner Bros./Vitaphone short released along with Al Jolson's The Singing Fool). Family and musical influences Hopkins was born in Watauga County, North Carolina, an area known for the richness of its folk culture. His father, John Benjamin Hopkins, a sometime North Carolina state legislator, built organs as a hobby, played the fiddle, piano, and organ, and had a good repertoire of traditional fiddle tunes. His mother, Celia Isabel Green Hopkins, sang old ballads and church music, among other tunes. Hopkins and his siblings all showed musical talent early. In 1904 the family moved to Washington, D.C., and Hopkins' father went to work for the United States Census Bureau. His sister Lucy later remarked that Al and his brothers and sisters also had plenty of exposure to the popular music of the time. Early career In 1910 Al Hopkins launched his professional music career. He and his younger brothers Joe, Elmer, and John formed a group called the Old Mohawk Quartet, which played regularly at Washington's Majestic Theater. About 1912 the family built a large new house at 63 Kennedy Street in an area of Northwest Washington, D.C., that was not yet built out. Hopkins' mother and the younger children summered at the family farm in Gap Creek, North Carolina, so their contact with rural life remained strong. In the early 1920s Hopkins' oldest brother, Jacob, a surgeon and musician, established a rural hospital/clinic in Galax, Virginia, where he often invited local banjo players to entertain the hospital patients. Doctor Hopkins was renowned and active as a surgeon and musician. Al Hopkins worked for him in Galax as hospital office manager and secretary. Joe, who would later play with Al in his recorded bands, worked at this time as a Railway Express agent in White Top Gap, Virginia. Joe played guitar here and there in his spare time, including at his brother's clinic. In late spring 1924, Joe met fiddler and journeyman barber Alonzo Elvis \\"Tony\\" Alderman in the latter's Galax barber shop. The two of them and Al Hopkins were soon a trio. John Rector, a local general store keeper and five-string banjo player who has already, recorded decided that they were better than his current band, and joined them. They soon traveled to New York City to record, a three-day trip in a Ford Model T. That initial recording session was a disaster: the technology for recording such groups was still in its infancy. That wasn't their only bad fortune that year: Doctor Hopkins died July 26, 1924. Early the next year they made it back to New York (this time in a new Dodge Rector had bought) and, on January 15, 1925, recorded six pieces much more successfully for Ralph Peer at OKeh.  Hill Billies and Buckle Busters  Lacking a band name, at the OKeh session Hopkins (whose now-urban father had been kidding him about the direction his life was taking) told Peer \\"We're nothing but a bunch of hillbillies from North Carolina and Virginia. Call us anything.\\" In fact, no one in the band conformed to the stereotype of a backwoods hillbilly. The Hopkins brothers father was a legislator and civil servant; Rector owned a store; Alderman had grown up in an isolated cabin, but his father was a surveyor, civil engineer, and justice of the peace. Still, they became The Hill Billies, and although they soon had qualms about the name (Alderman would later say, \\"Hillbilly was not only a funny word; it was a fighting word.\\"), fellow musician Ernest Stoneman encouraged them to keep it: \\"Well, boys, you have come up with a good one. Nobody could beat it.\\" With Hopkins' doctor brother dead, there was no reason to stay in Galax, and the band based itself in Washington, D.C., where they soon became regulars on WRC; on the radio, Hopkins mother sang with them on the ballads. On May 8, 1925, they played at an enormous fiddler's convention in Mountain City, Tennessee, sponsored by the local Ku Klux Klan. At this time Charlie Bowman joined the band as an additional fiddler. Other members would later come and go, but this completed the classic lineup. They played gigs from South Carolina to New York. commenced – at schools, vaudeville shows, fiddlers' competitions, political rallies, and even a White House Press Correspondents' gathering before President Coolidge. For OKeh they recorded only the on 1925 session produced by Ralph Peer. Later, they would record for Vocalion (as The Hill Billies), and Brunswick (as Al Hopkins and His Buckle Busters). The Vocalion and Brunswick recordings were identical except for the band names. Hopkins and his band tried at one point to control the name \\"Hill Billy\\" as it applied to music. They incorporated their group January 21, 1929, as Al Hopkins' Original Hill Billies, but ultimately accepted that their band name had become the name of a genre of music. Hopkins and his band continued to perform until his death in a car accident in Winchester, Virginia, in 1932. The band broke up after his death.

It belongs to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Name and description The Hanging Church is named for its location above a gatehouse of Babylon Fortress, the Roman fortress in Coptic Cairo (Old Cairo); its nave is suspended over a passage. The church is approached by twenty-nine steps; early travelers to Cairo dubbed it \\"the Staircase Church\\". The land surface has risen by some six metres since the Roman period, so the Roman tower is mostly buried below ground, reducing the visual impact of the church's elevated position. The entrance from the street is through iron gates under a pointed stone arch. The nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard decorated with modern art biblical designs. Up the steps and through the entrance is a further small courtyard leading to the eleventh-century outer porch. History The Hanging Church was probably built during the patriarchate of Isaac (690–692), though an earlier church building may have elsewhere existed dating as early as the 3rd or 4th century. However, the earliest mention of the church was a statement in the biography of the patriarch Joseph I (831–849), when the governor of Egypt visited the establishment. The church was largely rebuilt by the Pope Abraham (975–978) and has seen many other restorations including an extensive repair and restoration of the church and its surroundings completed in 2011. Objects of historical interest that were no longer of service went to the Coptic Museum. Importance The Hanging Church is the most famous Coptic Christian church in Cairo, as well as possibly the first built in basilican style. The church is the site of several reported Marian apparitions.BBC Newshour, Oct. 11, 2014, 20:00 GMT. She is said to have appeared in a dream to Pope Abraham in the 970s in the story of how the Mokattam was moved by the faith of Simon the Tanner. Seat of Coptic Pope The Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria was, historically, Alexandria. However, as ruling powers moved away from Alexandria to Cairo after the Muslim conquest of Egypt during Pope Christodolos's tenure, Cairo became the fixed and official residence of the Coptic Pope at the Hanging Church in 1047. Infighting between the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the el Muʿallaqah (the Hanging Church) broke out due to that patriarch's desire to be consecrated in the Hanging Church, a ceremony that traditionally took place at Saints Sergius and Bacchus. Icons and decoration The Hanging Church has 110 icons, the oldest of which dates back to the 8th century, but most of them date to the 18th century. Nakhla Al-Baraty Bey gave some of them as gifts, in 1898, when he was the overseer of the church. =Iconostasis= The iconostasis of the central sanctuary is made of ebony inlaid with ivory, and is surmounted by icons of the Virgin Mary and the Twelve Apostles. =Altar: screen and icons= The main altar (Egyptian Arabic: ') screen is made of ebony inlaid with ivory that is carved into segments showing several Coptic Cross designs that date back to around the 12th or 13th century. Over the altar screen lies a long row of seven large icons, the central one of which is Christ seated on the throne. On one side, the icons of the Virgin Mary, Archangel Gabriel and St Peter are lined up. On the other, icons of St. John the Baptist, Archangel Michael and St. Paul.

He was a municipal councillor in Edmonton, Alberta. Biography William Clark was born in London, England on July 1, 1869. After being educated in London's public schools, he went to work for his father at age sixteen in the building and contracting business. He moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1889 and on to Edmonton in 1895. In Edmonton, he founded W. H. Clark & Company, which produced sash, doors, and interior furnishings. In this capacity, he did the millwork for many significant buildings, including the Civic Block, the medical building at the University of Alberta, and several hospital units. In 1898, he married Agnes Jane Robson, with whom he would have three sons and a daughter. In the 1904 municipal election, Clark ran for Edmonton City Council as an alderman. He finished fifth of seventeen, and was one of four candidates elected to one year terms (the top four candidates were elected to two year terms, the next four to one year terms). He sought re-election in the 1905 election, but finished fifth of ten candidates; only four were elected. Clark established the Edmonton Lumber Company in 1905, which logged on the North Saskatchewan River. He was also President of the Edmonton Brick Company. In the 1908 municipal election he ran for the public school board, and was one of three candidates elected (he placed third of seven candidates). He was re-elected in 1910 to what was nominally a two-year term, but all municipal officials had their terms truncated by the merger of Edmonton with Strathcona. Accordingly, Clark sought re-election in the February 1912 election, and was elected to a one-year term. He did not seek re-election at its conclusion. Clark was a director of the YMCA, and a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Sons of England, the Edmonton Club, and the Masonic Lodge. He died December 24, 1913, from tuberculosis.

He is the founder of the Yahad-In Unum, an organization dedicated to locating the sites of mass graves of Jewish victims of the Nazi mobile-killing units in the former Soviet Union. He received the Légion d'honneur, France's highest honor, for his work documenting the Holocaust. Education Desbois attended the Université de Dijon, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1977. He entered the Grand Seminary of Prado in 1981 and was ordained as a priest in 1986. That same year he earned a master's degree in theology from the Catholic University of Lyon. Career In 1978, Father Desbois worked as a math teacher for the French government in Africa. He later worked for Mother Teresa in Calcutta, where he helped set up homes for the dying. After being ordained in 1986 at the age of 31, he became the Superior of the Grand Seminary in Prado, Lyon, in 1992. From 1992-99, he served as Secretary of Jewish Relations for Cardinals Albert Decourtray, Jean Balland and Louis-Marie Billé. After he requested to work with the Jewish community of France, he was appointed secretary to the French conference of Bishops for Relations with the Jewish community from 1999 to 2016. Since 2016 he is a chargé de mission of the Cardinal of Paris. He serves as well as advisor to the Vatican on relations with Judaism. In 2004, he joined leaders in the French Catholic and Jewish community in founding Yahad-In Unum (\\"together\\" in Hebrew and in Latin.) The organization's purpose is to further relations between Catholics and Jews. Its largest and most ambitious initiative is to locate the sites of mass graves of Jewish victims of the Nazi mobile killing units, the Einsatzgruppen, in the former Soviet republics and Eastern bloc. His work has been sanctioned by the Pope, recognized and encouraged by the President of France and supported in Europe and the United States. Desbois has been internationally recognized for his extraordinary efforts; his awards include the Medal of Valor by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Roger E. Joseph Prize by Hebrew Union College, the Humanitarian Award by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Jan Karski Award by the American Jewish Committee, the B'nai B'rith International Award for Outstanding Contribution to Relations with the Jewish People and more recently, the National Jewish Book Award for his 2008 book Holocaust by Bullets (Palgrave-Macmillan). In 2013, he received the LBJ Moral Courage Award from the Holocaust Museum Houston. Between 2015 and 2016, he taught at the Program for Jewish Civilization in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University as an adjunct professor. Since 2016 he is the inaugural holder of the Braman Endowed Professorship of the Practice of the Forensic Study of the Holocaust at the Center for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University. Work with Yahad–In Unum Father Desbois' interest in the Holocaust started at a young age, because his grandfather, who helped raise him, was a French soldier who had been deported to the Nazi prison camp in Rava-Ruska during World War II. His grandfather did not speak much of his time in the camp, and Father Desbois remained curious about the Holocaust and its Jewish victims. As a consequence of his childhood interests, Father Desbois studied the Jewish faith while preparing for his ordination as a Catholic priest. He studied anti-semitism at Yad-Vashem, and later Jewish religion and culture with Dr Charles Favre, a leader in the French Jewish community. In 2002, he traveled to Ukraine, so he could see where his grandfather had been imprisoned during the war, and to pay respects at a memorial to the lives lost. Upon his arrival, he was shocked to discover that there existed not a single marking or commemoration to 1.25 million Jewish victims in all of Ukraine and Belarus. Speaking of his initial experience, Desbois narrated how: > In 2002, while traveling in Ukraine, he visited the site of his > grandfather's imprisonment, Rawa-Ruska. Desbois knew that before World War > II more than 15,000 Jews had lived in the town, but when he asked to see > where they had been murdered, the mayor brushed him off and said no one knew > anything about it. \\"How could more than 10,000 Jews be killed in the village > and nobody knows?\\" he says. \\"I knew I needed to find out what happened. So I > came back two times, three times, four times to Rawa-Ruska. And then the > mayor lost the election and a new mayor was elected, much less Soviet.\\" The > new mayor led Desbois to the forest where, Desbois says, approximately 50 > elderly men and women of the village were gathered in a semicircle. \\"You are > standing on the graves of the last 1,500 Jews of Rawa-Ruska,\\" the mayor > said. One by one the villagers stepped forward and told of their experiences > during World War II. They told of how the Jews were marched out to this > clearing, forced to dig steep pits and hand over their valuables before > being shot. They recounted stories of how the Germans had forced them – > children or teenagers at the time – to guard the Jews to prevent them from > escaping, to cover the corpse-filled pits, to serve the German soldiers food > and even bring them a gramophone so they could listen to music. Desbois > recalls one woman – \\"an old lady with a blue scarf\\" – who tearfully told > him, \\"I was at my farm, I was 14, and they told me, 'Come, come' and I had > to climb in the trees and pick up pieces of corpses and hide them with > branches in the grave so that the next Jews will not see them. And then > there arrived trucks and trucks and trucks of Jews from Rawa-Ruska.\\" > Following these revelations, the villagers told Desbois they had never > before publicly spoken of what had happened. Many asked the priest before he > left, \\"Why are you coming so late? We have been waiting for you.\\" In order to right the egregious wrong, Father Desbois helped found Yahad-In Unum in 2004. The organization collects information about the mass killing of Jews and Roma in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Moldova and Romania between 1941 and 1944. Local contemporary witnesses are interviewed about the mass shootings which took place next to their home and the mass graves are located. Desbois estimates that there are no less than 1 million victims buried in 1,200 graves in Ukraine. Desbois conducts many of the interviews with the witnesses himself (and with translators). Using metal detectors, Desbois and his team have unearthed German cartridges and bullets from the pits where bodies were thrown, as well as jewelry belonging to the victims. Criticisms leveled against Father Desbois include his acceptance of the confessions of complicity in war crimes by those whom he interviews. Professor Omer Bartov has stated: \\"Desbois doesn't ask a lot of the people that he speaks with. ...He gives the impression that it was the Germans doing all the killing, but in fact much of the organization of the genocide had a lot to do with auxiliary and local police forces. He is not interested in that\\". Paul Shapiro of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has countered that: \\"Some people have been critical of his methodology, but no one else is going out and doing this kind of work. It is easy to be critical; it is much harder to have the drive, stamina and commitment to go again and again to these places.\\" In March 2014, French president François Hollande praised the work of Father Desbois:Speech of François Hollande (March 2014), elysee.fr; accessed 4 October 2015. > A moment ago, you honored Father Patrick Desbois.

In July 2017, Pope Francis sent a blessing and a message of encouragement to Father Desbois and Yahad-In Unum, writing: , zenit.org; accessed 27 January 2018. > The Holy Father encourages the members of ‘Yahad-In Unum’ to continue their > struggle for the just recognition of the violence suffered by so many men > and women belonging to different communities.

Bishop's committee for relations with Judaism Due to his position as Director of the French Episcopal Conference's Committee for Relations with Judaism, Father Desbois has had to deal with the controversy following negationist comments made by SSPX bishop Richard Williamson.

Biography Yeshu was born in the early 11th century at Melitene, where he studied philology, philosophy, and religion, and later became a monk at a nearby monastery. He studied under Patriarch John IX bar ʿAbdun, and served as his syncellus (secretary). After the death of the patriarch John bar Abdun in 1057, Yeshu was elected and consecrated as patriarch of Antioch at Amid by eastern bishops under the jurisdiction of the maphrian, upon which he assumed the name John. Western bishops, who outnumbered the eastern bishops, disputed John's election, and elected Athanasius V as patriarch instead, and brought the issue to the Muslim rulers. John subsequently abdicated, allowing Athanasius to serve as patriarch until his death in 1063/1064, after which John was restored to the position. For most of his tenure as patriarch, John made his residence at Amid, and also resided for a time at Harran and Maypherqat, which were under Muslim control, as opposed to Melitene, so to avoid eastern Roman persecution. Relations with the other non-Chalcedonian religious leaders were strained during John's reign as the church came under criticism for its practices, and John sent a treatise to the Armenian Catholicos Gregory II the Martyrophile in its defence. John also sent a letter to the Coptic Pope Christodoulos of Alexandria to refute criticism of the practice of mixing of salt and oil with the sacramental bread. He served as patriarch of Antioch until his death at Amid on 6 or 27 November 1072/1073. Works John wrote extensively on theological, canonical, and liturgical matters. He composed seven books of propitiatory prayers (pl. ), four books of poetry on the Turkish sack of Melitene in 1058, and an anaphora. As well as the aforementioned letter and treatise in defence of the church's practices, John wrote two treatises to refute Islam and the Melkite church of Antioch.

His early positions included demonstrator of anatomy at the Windmill Street School of Medicine, demonstrator of anatomy (1831–36) and professor of descriptive and surgical anatomy at King's College (from 1836), and assistant and full surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital (1836–40). In 1840, he was appointed surgeon at the newly established King's College Hospital, a position he held until 1870. From 1853, he also held the position of professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy. Partridge was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1837.The Royal Society: Sackler Archive Resource: Partridge; Richard (1805–1873) (accessed 19 August 2007) He was one of the three hundred original fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons, serving as vice-president in 1865 and president in 1866. He also served as vice-president (1847–48) and president (1863–64) of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. London Burkers Partridge was instrumental in the apprehension of the gang of murderers and body snatchers called the London Burkers, after the Edinburgh murderers Burke and Hare of three years earlier. On 5 November 1831, shortly after he had taken up the position of demonstrator of anatomy at King's College, the four members of the gang attempted to sell him the body of the so-called 'Italian Boy' for nine guineas. Both Partridge and the dissecting- room porter, William Hill, were suspicious of the fresh state of the body, which looked as if it had never been buried, as well as of a cut on its forehead. Partridge is said to have delayed the gang members with the ruse of claiming to lack change for a fifty-pound note, whilst raising the alarm with his superior, Herbert Mayo. All four members of the London Burker gang were arrested while still awaiting payment.Wise S. The Italian Boy; A Tale of Murder and Body Snatching in 1830s London (Metropolitan Books; 2004) (accessed 19 August 2007)The Newgate Calendar: John Bishop and Thomas Williams (accessed 23 August 2007) He was present during the autopsy on the boy's body, and gave evidence at the murder trial of the four gang members, stating that the boy's injuries seemed consistent with a blow to the back of the neck. Witnesses had identified the victim as an Italian beggar, Carlo Ferriere, who exhibited white mice in a cage. Three of the gang were found guilty of the murder; before they were hanged, John Bishop and Thomas Williams confessed to drowning the boy in a well after drugging him with laudanum, stating, however, that the victim was actually from Lincolnshire. The third gang member, James May, had his sentence respited to transportation, but died on the way to Australia. The bodies of Bishop and Williams were dissected, the former at King's College London and their remains displayed. The crime seems to have caught the public interest to an extraordinary degree; a crowd of thirty thousand turned up to watch the hangings, and a play The Italian Boy (featuring the original story of the Italian beggar and his white mice) was later put on at Shoreditch.Kenyon Jones C (2006) The anatomist, the Italian boy and the resurrection men Comment (King's College London newsletter) 165: 15 (accessed 24 August 2007) Partridge's involvement placed him in the public eye at a young age, and the case seems to have made a strong impression on him; he is said to have often included the tale in his lectures. The public outcry about the case put pressure on the government which led to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832; the act had been presented in 1829, following the Burke and Hare case, but was defeated. By permitting the bodies of paupers unclaimed by relatives to be supplied to medical schools for dissection, the act did away with the trade of the Resurrectionists. Consultation on Giuseppe Garibaldi Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1866, four years after surviving a bullet wound misdiagnosed by Partridge In September 1862, Partridge was selected to travel to Italy to attend Giuseppe Garibaldi, who had been shot just above the right ankle during his march on Rome that summer.Moscucci O (2001) Garibaldi and the surgeons J R Soc Med 94: 248–252 (accessed 19 August 2007) Before the invention of X-rays, detection of the bullet was highly problematic, and the surgeons treating Garibaldi disagreed over whether the ball had lodged in his ankle. When, after two weeks, the condition of the ankle had worsened, some began to favour amputation, and fears for the popular Italian patriot grew in England. A public subscription raised over a thousand guineas to send a British surgeon to Italy to provide a second opinion on the bullet wound. The reason for choosing Partridge for this role is unclear. Although he was, by then, one of the more eminent British surgeons, he never achieved the fame of his colleague, Sir William Fergusson. The Royal College of Surgeons' biography characterises him as 'a painstaking but not a brilliant surgeon; minute in detail and hesitating in execution'. More importantly, he had no experience with gunshot injuries. The contemporary medical press attacked the mission for its serious breach in medical etiquette in presuming to consult on a patient without having been invited to do so by the attending medical practitioners. It amounted to patient stealing, and was an affront to the dignity of the profession (newly self-regulating since the creation of the General Medical Council in 1858).Lancet (1862) ii: 874–875, also in British Medical Journal; quoted in Moscucci 2001 The Lancet was also scathing about the 'new manifestation of the proverbial insular pride which is ever insisting upon the immense superiority of everything British'. Despite all the mission's detractors, Partridge seems to have been received warmly by the surgeons attending Garibaldi on his arrival in Varignano on 16 September 1862. After examining the patient, he concluded, based largely on the unswollen nature of ankle, that 'the bullet did not enter the joint nor effect a lodgement elsewhere', and that Garibaldi would recover with rest and nursing care.Br Med J (1862) ii: 396; quoted in Moscucci 2001 Auguste Nélaton, whose porcelain- tipped probe was key to saving Garibaldi's leg Unfortunately, this optimistic prediction was not fulfilled; by the end of October, the development of sepsis made amputation appear inevitable. The French surgeon Auguste Nélaton, known for innovations in surgical tools, was asked to examine Garibaldi. An electrical probe designed by Favre had been used previously, without success, in an attempt to determine if the bullet remained. Nélaton used a normal surgical probe to examine the wound, concluding that Partridge had been mistaken and the bullet was indeed lodged in the joint; he recommended extraction using ball forceps. He later designed a special probe with a tip of unglazed porcelain, which could be introduced into the wound and retain an impression of any bullet present. Using this improved probe, the Italian surgeon Zanetti became convinced of the bullet's presence, and successfully extracted it on 23 November, saving Garibaldi's limb. The triumph of an innovative surgical instrument in this case was just one example of a trend over the latter half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth towards the acceptance of surgery as a craft, with instruments as essential tools of that craft. Although Partridge had re-examined the wound shortly after Nélaton's consultation and changed his mind to concur with his French rival, severe damage to the relations between the British and Continental schools of surgery was inevitable. His mistake also substantially harmed his professional reputation. Characteristics and works Although nervous during operations, Partridge was careful during after-care of patients. He was a skilled draughtsman, having taken drawing lessons from his brother, John Partridge, and an able lecturer and teacher. He published an article on the face in The Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology (1839), edited by Robert Bentley Todd, and also wrote and illustrated a work on descriptive anatomy, which was never published.Partridge R. 'Face' in The Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology (Todd RB, ed.) (Vol. 2), pp. 207–229 (Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper; 1839) Personal life He married Frances Janette Turner; they had several children, among whom was the illustrator and actor Sir John Bernard Partridge. He died in London in 1873. His career never recovered from his error in overlooking the bullet in Garibaldi's wound.

Bendix two years earlier had portrayed baseball player Babe Ruth in the biographical film The Babe Ruth Story. One of the ballplayers in this picture is played by Jeff Richards, billed as Richard Taylor, a minor-league ballplayer before becoming an actor. Plot Bill Johnson is a former baseball player whose fanatical devotion to the game has cost him several jobs. He remains steadfast in one thing: he hates umpires. Matters are complicated by the fact that his father- in-law Evans is a retired umpire. During a period of unemployment, needing a job to support his loyal wife Betty and two daughters, Johnson is forced by his father-in-law to matriculate in an umpire school. Johnson initially tries to get himself expelled by school director Jimmy O'Brien, but eventually comes to enjoy his new job. He becomes an ump in the minor leagues, where blurred vision, caused by using the wrong eyedrops, causes him to see everything twice, earning him a nickname as \\"Two-Call\\" Johnson. When he calls a visiting team's player safe at home plate, the crowd accuses him of dishonesty, not aware that the catcher actually dropped the ball when the runner slid into home plate, leading to a near-riot during which the home team's catcher is knocked out cold. Johnson must disguise himself as a woman, and engage in several madcap subterfuges, to get to an important game on time, but his reputation is restored when the injured catcher recovers and praises him for his honesty as an umpire. The crowd accepts this, although quickly reversing its opinion again after Johnson, inevitably, makes another call they do not like. The film's climax is a manic chase scene, scripted by animator and future Jerry Lewis director Frank Tashlin.

Beshbarmak Kyrgyz cuisine is the cuisine of the Kyrgyz, who comprise a majority of the population of Kyrgyzstan. The cuisine is similar in many aspects to that of their neighbors. Traditional Kyrgyz food revolves around mutton, beef and horse meat, as well as various dairy products. The preparation techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's historically nomadic way of life. Thus, many cooking techniques are conducive to the long-term preservation of food. Mutton and beef are the favorite meats, although in modern times many Kyrgyz are unable to afford them regularly. Kyrgyzstan is home to many different nationalities and their various cuisines. In larger cities, such as Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Karakol, various national and international cuisines can be found. Non-Kyrgyz cuisines that are particularly common and popular in Kyrgyzstan include Uyghur, Dungan, Uzbek, and Russian cuisines, representing the largest minorities in the country. Meat dishes Meat in various forms has always been an essential part of Kyrgyz cuisine. Among the most popular meat dishes are horse-meat sausages (kazy or chuchuk), roasted sheep's liver, beshbarmak (a dish containing boiled and shredded meat with thin noodles), and various other delicacies made from horse meat. =Beshbarmak= Beshbarmak is the Kyrgyz national dish, although it is also common in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and in Xinjiang (where it is called narin). It consists of horse meat (or mutton/beef) boiled in its own broth for several hours and served over homemade noodles sprinkled with parsley. Beshbarmak means \\"Five Fingers\\" in the Kyrgyz language, and is so called probably because the dish is typically eaten with the hands. Beshbarmak is most often made during a feast to celebrate the birth of a new child, an important birthday, or to mourn a death in the family, either at a funeral or on an anniversary. If mutton is used instead of horse meat, a boiled sheep's head is placed on the table in front of the most honored guest, who cuts bits and parts from the head and offers them around to the other guests at the table. =Dimlama= Dimlama is a stew consisting of meat, potatoes, onions, vegetables and sometimes fruits. =Kuurdak= Kuurdak is one of the main meat dishes. =Shashlik= Skewered chunks of mutton grilled over smoking coals that come with raw sliced onions, is served in restaurants and often sold on the street. The meat is usually marinated for hours before cooking. Shashlyk can also be made from beef, chicken, and fish. Each shashlik typically has a fat-to-meat ratio of one-to- one. =Shorpo= Shorpo (or sorpo) is a meat soup. =Paloo= Cooking paloo Paloo ( or күрүч/аш) is the Kyrgyz version of what is generally referred to as plov in Central Asian cuisine. It consists of pieces of meat (generally mutton or beef, but sometimes chicken) fried in a large qazan (a cast-iron cauldron) and mixed with fried shredded carrots, jiucai(garlic chives) and cooked rice. The dish is garnished with whole fried garlic cloves and hot red peppers. Uzgen paloo is made with locally grown rice from the southern Uzgen District of Kyrgyzstan. Shirin paloo, a close relative of shirin plov in Azerbaijani cuisine, is a vegetarian dish in which meat is replaced with dried fruits, such as prunes, apricots, and raisins. Paloo is the Kyrgyzified form of the Persian word polow or polo, related in etymology to pilaf. In Russian the dish is called plov (), in Turkish pilav, in Turkic languages ash, and in Tajik osh. Noodles and dumplings Dungan cuisine\\" (Дунганская кухня, Dunganskaya kukhnya) Manty are steamed dumplings filled with ground meat and onions. Samsa are little pockets with meat and vegetables wrapped in flaky pastry or bread, very similar to Indian samosas. They are most often stuffed with mutton and fat, but are also made with chicken, cheese, cabbage, beef, and even pumpkin. They can be bought in most bazaars or on street corners in larger cities. Lagman (or laghman) is a very popular noodle dish. It consists of thick noodles created by stretching a very simple flour dough, then covered in chopped peppers and other vegetables and served in a spicy vinegary sauce. Lagman is served everywhere in Kyrgyzstan, but is considered a Dungan or Uyghur dish. Bread and tea thumb Naan at a market in Osh Common types of bread ( []) available in Kyrgyzstan include Central Asian flat bread (nan), and thick, sturdy Russian breads. Central Asian flat bread is cooked over coals in tandoori ( []) ovens, and is round and relatively flat. More traditional bread products include qattama and boorsoq, two types of fried bread. The Kyrgyz often eat various breads by dipping it in jam, kaymak, butter (or sary may), etc. Boorsoq is sometimes eaten suspended in tea, or dipped in honey. Bread is valued as sacred in Kyrgyz culture, and a good host always offers a guest bread at the very least (often with tea), even if the guest is only staying for a few moments. Beverages Mare's milk is used to make kymyz A popular Kyrgyz beverage is kymyz ( ), a slightly alcoholic drink made by fermenting mare's milk. This drink is considered to be the signature drink of Euroasian nomadic culture, as it is also consumed in Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Fresh kymyz is only available in the summer, from about May until August, when it can commonly be purchased by the roadside in mountainous areas. Bottled kymyz is also available year-round in most food shops in the country. There are many beverages which could be described as traditional Kyrgyz drinks. One such non-alcoholic beverage which is very popular in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the summer, is maksym, a slightly fizzy drink made by fermenting grains. Maksym was traditionally made in small quantities by women for family consumption; however, this drink was introduced as a commercial product in Bishkek by the company 'Shoro', after which it became widely available all over Kyrgyzstan. Maksym is usually made from malt, but other types of grains may be used in its preparation. There are different methods and recipes for it which vary by region. It is prepared by boiling grounded malt or other type of cereals in water. After reaching a certain state of readiness this substance is cooled and undergoes a fermentation process caused by yeast. Maksym is usually consumed chilled. Jarma is a similar drink derived from ground cereals. It is made in almost the same way as maksym, except that it isn't fermented, instead it is mixed with ayran to make it slightly fizzy. Another fizzy drink made from ayran is chalap (sometimes marketed as Tan). Other traditional drinks are sheep's milk and its products (such as qurut) and camel's milk. The two primary companies which commercially produce Kyrgyz national drinks are Shoro and Enesay. Bozo is slightly alcoholic drink prepared from wheat.

Established in 1920, the school enrolled approximately 1,000 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom four percent identified as Indigenous Australians and ten percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Darryl Ward. History Albury High School was established in 1920 and occupied an old hospital building in Thurgoona Street, Albury. Under the guidance of the first headmaster, J. G. Monaghan, the school quickly grew and gained more than 200 pupils. This significantly dropped in the mid 1920s, however after the establishment of a parents and citizens association that was treated as a separate body, the school began to grow once more. The school moved into its current location in Kiewa Street on 28 March 1928, after the building of a permanent site to the tune of $50,000. The enrolment at the class slowly grew, with only a minor hitch when the school was classified as a Third Class High School. Eventually, the school gained its classification as a First Class High School and the numbers continued to grow. The addition of further buildings in the 1970s as well as the decision to include the Principal's residence as a teaching space helped aid the increasing enrolment. In 2014 a fire destroyed the administration office.

The shells of species in the family Vermetidae are extremely irregular, and do not resemble the average snail shell, hence the common name \\"worm shells\\" or \\"worm snails\\". These snails usually grow cemented onto a hard surface, or cemented together in colonies. Shell description These snails do not have typical regularly coiled gastropod shells; instead, they have very irregular elongated tubular shells which are moulded to, and cemented to, a surface of attachment such as a rock or another shell. In the adult, the apertural part of the shell is usually free, with the opening directed upward. Some species have an operculum and some do not. Damaged sections of the shell can be sealed off by calcareous septa when necessary. Some vermetids are solitary, whereas others live in colonies, partially cemented together. The shells of species within this family vary greatly and can sometimes be extremely challenging to identify. Comparison with annelid worm tubes The empty calcareous tubes of certain marine annelid tube worms, for example the Serpulidae, can sometimes be casually misidentified as empty vermetid shells, and vice versa. The difference is that vermetid shells are shiny inside and have three shell layers, whereas the annelid worm tubes are dull inside and have only two shell layers.

It is common on rocks and other substrates in the intertidal zone of north-western Europe and both coasts of North America. Description Adult S. balanoides grow up to in diameter, and are sessile, living attached to rocks and other solid substrates. They have six greyish wall plates surrounding a diamond-shaped operculum. The base of the shell is membranous in Semibalanus, unlike other barnacles which have calcified bases. When the tide rises to cover the barnacles, the operculum opens, and feathery cirri (modified thoracic appendages) are extended into the water to filter food from the seawater. When the tide falls, the operculum closes again to prevent desiccation; the reduction from the primitive condition of eight wall plates to six is believed to decrease water loss even further by reducing the number of sutures through which water can escape. Distribution S. balanoides is found in the intertidal zone in the world's northern oceans. Its distribution is limited in the north by the extent of the pack-ice and in the south by increasing temperature which prevents maturation of gametes. The mean monthly temperature of the sea must drop below for it to breed. In Europe, S. balanoides is found on Svalbard and from Finnmark to north-west Spain but excluding part of the Bay of Biscay. It is common throughout the British Isles, except in parts of Cornwall, the Scilly Isles and south-western Ireland. On the North American coast of the Atlantic Ocean, it reaches as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and on the Pacific coast, it reaches as far south as British Columbia. S. balanoides is the most common and widespread intertidal barnacle in the British Isles, and the only intertidal barnacle of the north-east coast of North America. Ecology S. balanoides can be the dominant species of rocky shores, where it grows in a range of situations, from very sheltered to very exposed. It is typically found lower on the shore than another barnacle, Chthamalus montagui, although with some overlap. S. balanoides can tolerate salinities down to 20 psu, allowing it to colonise parts of estuaries. On semi-exposed shores, S. balanoides may form a patchwork with patches of seaweeds, such as Fucus serratus, and limpets; the fronds of the seaweeds brush the barnacle larvae from the rocks, allowing limpets to colonise it instead. At the southern limit of its range, including Cornwall, S. balanoides is replaced by Chthamalus montagui. Although capable of living in the sublittoral zone, S. balanoides tends to be restricted to the intertidal by predation and by competition from species such as the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Chondrus crispus. Life cycle =Feeding= S. balanoides feeding, Upernavik, Greenland Semibalanus balanoides is a filter feeder, using its thoracic appendages, or cirri, to capture zooplankton and detritus from the water. If there is a current, then the barnacle holds its cirri stiffly into the flow, but when there is no current, the barnacle beats its cirri rhythmically. Plankton levels are highest in Spring and Autumn, and drop significantly during Winter, when the barnacles are dependent on reserves of food which they have stored. =Reproduction= Breeding takes place in winter at an optimal temperature of . S. balanoides is hermaphroditic, but cannot fertilise itself. Gametes are transferred with a penis which may be up to long; barnacles that are further apart than about are therefore unable to reproduce together. One barnacle may inseminate another up to eight times, and up to six concurrent penetrations may occur. The penis degenerates after copulation, and a new one is regrown the following year. Up to 10,000 eggs may be produced, and they are stored in sacs within the shell cavity. While the eggs are developing, the adult barnacle does not moult. The eggs hatch into nauplius larvae, which have three pairs of legs, one pair of antennae and a single eye and are released to coincide with the spring algal bloom. These spend several weeks in the water column, feeding on plankton. Over a series of moults, the larva passes through six naupliar instars before changing into a cypris larva, with a two-valved carapace. These larvae can survive weeks embedded in sea ice. The cypris larva does not feed but seeks out a suitable substrate for its adult life. Having settled on a substrate, the larva examines the area until it finds another barnacle of the same species and then attaches itself to the substrate with its antennae, whereupon it metamorphoses into the adult. Sexual maturity is usually only reached after two years, and adults of S. balanoides may live for up to seven years, depending on their position on the shore. =Parasites and predators= Predators of Semibalanus balanoides include the whelk Nucella lapillus, the shanny Lipophrys pholis, the sea star Asterias vulgaris, and nudibranchs. Although they have no eyes, barnacles are aware of changes in light, and withdraw into their shells when threatened. Parasites of S. balanus include Pyxinoides balani, a protozoan which lives in the barnacle's midgut, and Epistylis horizontalis, a ciliate which lives on the gills. The isopod Hemioniscus balani occurs from France to the Faroe Islands and the Oslofjord, and from Labrador to Massachusetts, and is a parasite of S. balanoides, effectively castrating the barnacle if it is heavily infested. The lichens Arthropyrenia sublittoralis and Pyrenocollema halodytes may colonise the shells of barnacles.

He then headed out of the Czech Republic, spending time at Odd Grenland in Norway and Artmedia Bratislava in Slovakia. In 2009, he returned to the Czech Republic to play for Brno. Pospěch joined Second League side Opava in September 2009, five years after having left his boyhood club. In November 2009, the Czech Disciplinary Commission suspended Pospěch, which left him unable to play professional football until October 2010. Pospěch moved on loan from Brno to Slavia Prague in February 2011 until the end of June. Pospěch missed almost two years of league football before scoring on his return to action in a 1–0 win for Slavia Prague against former club Slovan Liberec in March 2011. He finished the spring part of the 2010–11 Czech First League as Slavia's top scorer with seven goals. In June 2011, as his loan was coming to an end, he signed a three-year contract with Slavia. Despite scoring a total of 13 league goals in a season and a half with Slavia, making him their leading scorer, Slavia terminated Pospěch's contract in June 2012, leaving him free to look for a new club. After signing for Dukla Prague in the summer of 2012, Pospěch took until October 2012 to score his first league goal for the club, which came in a 1–0 win against Hradec Králové.

Buckwheat is eaten mainly in Bumthang, maize in the Eastern districts, and rice elsewhere. The diet in the hills also includes chicken, yak meat, dried beef, pork, pork fat, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat, rice, ferns, lentils, and dried vegetables, spiced with chili peppers and cheese, are a favorite meal during the cold seasons. Zow shungo is a rice dish mixed with leftover vegetables. Ema datshi is a spicy dish made with large, green chili peppers in a cheesy sauce (similar to chili con queso), which might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it. Other foods include jasha maru (a chicken dish), phaksha paa (dried pork cooked with chili peppers, spices, and vegetables, including turnips, greens, or radishes), thukpa, bathup, and fried rice. Cheese made from cow's milk called datshi is never eaten raw, but used to make sauces. Zoedoe is another type of cheese made in the Eastern districts, which is added to soups. Zoedoe is normally greenish in color and has a strong smell. Other types of cheese include Western types like Cheddar and Gouda. Western cheese is made in the Swiss Cheese Factory in Bumthang or imported from India. Popular snacks include momo (Bhutanese dumplings), shakam eezay, khabzey (dried fritters made with flour, water, and sugar, which are then deep-fried), shabalay, juma (Bhutanese sausages marinated in spices), and noodles. Restaurants in the country can serve Chinese, Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian foods, which are very popular and in recent years Korean restaurant have opened due to the increasing popularity of Korean popular culture in the country. Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Popular beverages include butter tea prepared using tea leave, salt and butter (called suja), milk tea (called ngaja), black tea, locally brewed ara (rice wine), and beer. Spices include curry, cardamom, ginger, thingay (Sichuan pepper), garlic, turmeric, and caraway.

One of the character's main storylines includes being impersonated by fellow character André DiMera, at various points in the character's tenure. However, both roles were played by Penghlis. He reprised the role in a guest capacity in March 2019, before returning in a recurring capacity later that July. Storylines Count Tony DiMera arrived in Salem in 1981 with two purposes. He wanted to win back his wife, Liz Chandler, whom he had never officially divorced. He also wanted to scope out Salem on orders from his father Stefano DiMera to see if it was suitable to relocate the DiMera family business. Setting up his penthouse with hidden cameras, Tony throws a big party with invites sent to all of Salem's finest. After the party, Tony shows the videos to Stefano. Learning that the Brady family, the DiMeras sworn enemy, is alive and well in Salem, Stefano has Tony plant roots in the business community in order to continue the vendetta against them. In 1982, Tony proposed to Renée DuMonde, who accepted. However, Renée discovered Lee DuMonde's diary. Reading the diary she learned that Lee was really her mother and that Stefano DiMera was her father, making Tony her half-brother. Renée quickly broke things off with Tony, not telling him the real reason in order to spare his feelings. Tony refused to let Renée go, and when she told him the truth he refused to believe they were siblings. Tony blamed Stefano for breaking them up. When Tony tried to leave town Stefano faked a heart attack. Tony later learned that he and Renée were in fact not related due to a death-bed confession by his mother Daphne DiMera and had the blood tests to prove it. Renée had moved on and was married to David Banning when Tony learned the truth. Despite the evidence that they were not related, Renée refused to leave David. She was later killed by André. Around the same time Liz Chandler became pregnant with Neil Curtis' child, though Tony believed it was his. Tony would grant Liz her divorce, but only after the baby was born, because he wanted the baby if it proved to be his. Liz gave birth to her baby, and when Tony realized it was Neil Curtis' child he quickly divorced Liz. In 1984, Tony and evil lookalike André came face to face. André chained Tony up and took his place pretending to be Tony. It was the first, but wouldn't be the last time he impersonated Tony in the next 20 years. In 1985, Tony and Anna became engaged once again. Their attempts at marriage encountered many rocky starts. Their first attempt was sabotaged by Alex Marshall and an actor playing a minister, thus their \\"marriage\\" was invalid. When they attempted a second time to get married, Anna was kidnapped. Eventually Tony and Anna were finally married, and returned to Salem. After returning from Salem Anna was accused of murder and while trying to prove her innocence Tony disappeared. Anna was also blamed for her husband's disappearance, but in truth Tony was held captive by a very much alive Claud Van Zandt, Anna's supposed victim. Claud was eventually discovered as being alive, and Anna was acquitted of all charges. Eventually, Tony was blackmailed by Emma Donovan to divorce Anna and leave Salem. In 1994, Kristen Blake promised her ailing father, Stefano that she would marry Tony. She goes through with her wedding to Tony, who is later revealed to be Tony's lookalike, André (Penghlis). Kristen travels to the family estate in New Orleans, Maison Blanche, where she is taken captive by a very much alive Stefano forcing John Black to come to the rescue. She later discovers \\"Tony's\\" schemes to impregnate her and moves in with John. She and John are about to marry when it is revealed that John is actually a priest; Kristen, a devout Catholic, returns to \\"Tony.\\" Later, John and Kristen are reunited after he is released from his vows and her marriage to \\"Tony\\" is annulled. In November 1995, Kristen goes to Aremid as her brother Peter Blake is preparing to marry Jennifer Horton (Melissa Reeves). While there, \\"Tony\\" fakes his death and frames John. Though she believes in John's innocence, Peter forces Kristen to testify against him despite John being exonerated. After over twenty years outside of Salem, Tony was finally located on a deserted island. Anna convinced him to return to Salem to confront his past (and his father), and Tony agreed to team up with the Bradys to end the DiMera/Brady feud once and for all. In 2009, Count Antony \\"Tony\\" DiMera was pronounced dead in Salem University Hospital after falling and becoming impaled, following a fight with Philip Kiriakis over a fuels project that Tony acquired from Titan Industries. The fight was witnessed by Tony's then sister-in-law Nicole Walker. In March 2019, Tony appears in a dream to Marlena Evans. In July 2019, he is revealed to be alive when Kristen (Stacy Haiduk) visits him in Chicago, after it is revealed she helped him escape from a warehouse explosion, where he was being kept during Dr. Rolf's experimental treatment. There, Kristen blackmails Tony into marrying her — under the disguise of Nicole — in order to gain control of DiMera Enterprises. Paternity Before her death, Daphne DiMera claimed that her lover Enrico, the DiMera family gardener, was Tony's real father and blood tests in the early 1980s supported this as fact.

Biography David Latta was born June 6, 1869 in Ballycarny, County Wexford, Ireland. He was educated in nearby Enniscorthy, and came to Canada in 1889. He settled briefly in Ontario before moving to Whitemouth, Manitoba, where he joined the North- West Mounted Police in 1890. He was stationed near South Battleford, Saskatchewan, where he founded a sheep farm after being discharged in 1893. While there, he married Jessie Scott. In 1897 he sold the farm and moved to Edmonton, lured by the Klondike Gold Rush. In Edmonton, he worked as a carriage maker for three years, during which time his wife died in childbirth. He remarried in 1899 to Emily Decoteau, sister of athlete and officer Alex Decoteau. In 1900 he established a blacksmith and carriage shop, which would become Latta and Lyons Company after he partnered with John H. Lyons in 1902. In 1905, Latta was appointed to Edmonton City Council to complete the term of Kenneth McLeod, who had resigned. He served until the 1906 municipal election, in which he did not run, and did not return to politics thereafter, disillusioned by the bickering of his fellow council members. In 1912, Latta's partnership with Lyons ended, as the latter left to found Lyons Motors Ltd. The old company continued business as D. G. Latta Ltd. It did well, and developed a specialty and shoeing racehorses to improve their speed. Latta shifted his focus to selling blacksmith supplies wholesale after many of his staff enlisted to fight in World War I. In 1918, Latta founded Belatta Collie Kennels; dogs from the kennel captured prizes at dog shows in Alberta and British Columbia. In 1931, Latta retired and moved to Vancouver with his wife, leaving the business in the hands of his accountant. He suffered a stroke in January 1948, and returned to Edmonton where he died November 11. He was survived by his second wife, four daughters, and five sons. In 1952, Latta Bridge in Edmonton was named in his honour.

Opus was founded in 1954 by then economics lecturer Cyril Renwick, at what was then the Newcastle University College of the University of New South Wales, in the Newcastle suburb of Callaghan. Renwick proposed a student journal to promote student unity and expression. Teaming up with his secretary's husband, George Kirkby, the first edition of Opus was a four-page broadsheet newspaper replete with the refinement and formality of 1950s journalism.Perrin, M. 2008, Opus and its History, Opus, No. 1 2008, pp. 6-7> The format and style of Opus has changed many times throughout its history. The 1970s the publications name was briefly changed to The Stockton Ferry. In a 1998 interview, the late emeritus Professor Godfrey Tanner explained that > \\"[The Stockton Ferry was] the brainchild of James Beisers and his co-editor > who were into drug reform. The idea being that readers would be encouraged > to take short trips after reading its contents.\\" A special edition of the magazine, released in 2002, and edited by BA graduate Matthew Glenn Ward commemorated the life of Godfrey Tanner, a prominent classics professor at the university who had died that year. Opus takes its name from the former Newcastle City motto, finis coronat opus which is Latin for \\"completion crowns the work\\". The implementation of voluntary student unionism by the Howard government in 2006 had a significant impact on the viability of student media across Australia, compulsory student union membership fees having been the major source of income for most. Opus has been able to continue publishing despite the new law. Opus was rebranded and relaunched in 2016 after a period of stagnation. Opus is edited by the NUSA Media Officer and a team of volunteers. The Media Officer is elected for one- year terms by the student population at the University of Newcastle. In 2018, Opus became a newspaper again, published monthly.

Plot Wonderland is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's book Alice in Wonderland, with the player taking on the role of Alice. It does not involve anything from that book's sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. Gameplay With this game, Magnetic Scrolls introduced a bespoke windowing system dubbed \\"Magnetic Windows\\". The player's inventory, the location's graphic, the map and so on are all in separate windows that can be moved and resized independently. (A similar system is used in unrelated adventure games like Deja Vu.) The developers stated they believed it would make the game more accessible, giving it a much wider appeal. Development Development began in December 1987, when David Bishop pitched the concept to Scrolls' Anita Sinclair. Bishop would become project manager. Reception Computer Gaming World favorably reviewed the game's graphics and interface, describing it as \\"a satisfying romp through Wonderland ... fun stuff to play\\". ACE gave the IBM PC version a score of 910 out of 1000, praising the puzzles, interface (if used with a mouse) and the graphics, with the lack of sound being a negative point. Keith Campbell of CU Amiga called it \\"an outstanding game that is a pleasure to play, extremely entertaining, and with widespread appeal to gamesters from nine years of age to ninety.\\" In Zero, Mike Gerrard wrote that it is \\"a very open adventure, designed to appeal to people who maybe haven't tried an adventure before. Regular adventures will try it and love it, but newcomers will find it very accessible and easy to play... if not easy to solve.\\" He strongly praised its presentation and ease of use, calling its window interface \\"wondrous\\". Reviewing Wonderland for Amiga World, Peter Olafson summarized, \\"Frankly, the game is an almost unalloyed delight.\\" He praised its graphics, music and interface, and found its difficulty level to be fair. Olafson believed that the game was \\"destined to restore interest in [the] sadly vanishing genre\\" of interactive fiction. In PC Magazine, Cristina Córdova wrote that \\"Wonderland brings the best of text-based and graphics-based games to Alice and her adventures.\\" She praised it for combining the \\"complexity and detail\\" of interactive fiction with visuals, and she praised the ease-of-use of its interface. Strategy Pluss Theo Clark noted that Wonderland had received significant hype prior to release, and he believed that the game lived up to these expectations. He praised its interface and parser, calling them \\"very close to ... ideal.\\" While he was let down by the limited music, he found the visuals to be \\"a feast\\" and enjoyed the hint system. He concluded, \\"If the purchasing public has any sense at all the sales should be brisk enough to ensure a rapid start to [a sequel].\\" The magazine's editors later named Wonderland the best adventure game of 1990, over nominees including The Secret of Monkey Island. Editor-in-Chief Brian Walker wrote, \\"Witty, charming, and of course, [with] a wonderful storyline, it proved that the text adventure is not dead after all.\\" He believed that it was \\"destined to be a classic of its kind.\\" In 1991, PC Format placed Wonderland on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors described it as \\"a very impressive windowing system that takes you through Wonderland in the company of Alice and cronies.\\" References * External links  at the Magnetic Scrolls Chronicles 1990 video games Amiga games Acorn Archimedes games Atari ST games DOS games 1990s interactive fiction Video games based on Alice in Wonderland Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games featuring female protagonists Virgin Interactive games ","title":"Wonderland (video game)"},{"id":"12835928","text":"Onésiphore Ernest Talbot (August 15, 1854 - May 6, 1934) was a Canadian politician.

He played predominantly as a midfielder. Career His career started in Unex Uničov where he played as a youngster. At the age of 17 he joined the youth team at FC Vítkovice and after some solid performances for the juniors he also managed to make 4 appearances for the senior team in the Czechoslovak First Division. Following his spell at FC Vítkovice he joined VTJ Znojmo for the 1994/95 season making just 6 appearances for the club. After his season with Znojmo he made his move to 1st Division outfit Boby Brno. He had a very successful stay at this club becoming a key member of the squad. After 5 and a half years at Brno he had amassed 157 first team appearances scoring a total of 20 goals from midfield. His great run in Boby Brno was followed by another successful spell in the Czech first division with outfit SK Sigma Olomouc where he spent a total of 3 seasons, again becoming an integral part of the team and netting 13 goals in 81 appearances for the club. His good form had begun to generate interest from bigger clubs outside of the Czech Republic and in 2004 he completed a loan move to 2.Bundesliga team SSV Jahn Regensburg in Germany to test his abilities abroad. His spell however proved fruitless and Jahn Regensburg were relegated and the end of the season. Siegl had managed to make 10 appearances during his spell. He returned to the Czech republic and decided to rejoin his former club 1. FC Brno, where he had previously experienced so much success. His second spell with the club stretched on for 4 years with Siegl making 110 appearances and scoring 3 goals. In the 2006–07 Czech First League, Siegl was one of four players in the league to play every minute of every match. At the end of the 2007/08 season he pined for another move abroad and secured a transfer to newly promoted Kapfenberger SV in the Austrian Bundesliga. This proved a good spell as well with the team managing to stay up in the top tier of Austrian football. In his two seasons Siegl completed 68 appearances finding the net 8 times.

Diodorus ascribes the erection of the first fort to rebel Assyrian captives in the reign of Sesostris, and Ctesias dates it to the time of Semiramis; but Josephus, with greater probability, attributes its structure to some Babylonian followers of Cambyses, in 525 BC. The Romans built a new fortress nearer the river, with typically Roman red and white banded masonry. Within the fortress's enclosure are the Coptic Museum, a convent, and several churches, including the Church of St. George and the Hanging Church. Name Babylon was originally the dominant city of Mesopotamia. According to Egyptologists the ancient name of modern Babylon area in Cairo is Kheriaha, although Spiegelberg derives the modern Babylon name from Perhabinon. Situation Babylon lay northeast of Memphis, on the east bank of the Nile, at latitude 30° N, and near the commencement of the Canal of the Pharaohs connecting the Nile to the Red Sea. It was the boundary town between Lower and Middle Egypt, where the river craft paid tolls when ascending or descending the Nile. During an uprising, Babylonian prisoners established a stronghold between Memphis and Heliopolis, on an elevation on the east bank of the Nile. Persians and Romans later garrisoned the fortress with their troops. Because of water delivery problems, the Roman Emperor Trajan relocated the fort to its present location, which at that time was nearer to the river. Since then, the Nile's course has moved some to the north. Roman and Byzantine era In the age of Augustus the Deltaic Babylon became a town of some importance, and was the headquarters of the three legions which ensured the obedience of Egypt. In the Notitia Imperii, Babylon is mentioned as the quarters of Legio XIII Gemina.It. Anton. Ruins of the town and fortress are still visible a little to the north of Fostat or Old Cairo, among which are vestiges of the Great Aqueduct mentioned by Strabo and the early Arabian topographers. The town was the seat of a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of Leontopolis, the capital and metropolitan see of the Roman province of Augustamnica Secunda. The names of several of its bishops are recorded. After the Council of Chalcedon (451), some are of those who accepted the council, but most are of those who rejected it.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 555–560Klaas A.

Queen Charlotte enjoyed the play so much that she decreed it be performed for the royal family once a season for several years.Winter Synopsis The play's double plotline concerns the romance between Letitia Hardy and Doricourt, as well as the relationship between Sir George Touchwood and his wife, Lady Frances Touchwood. The story comes to a dénouement at the masquerade ball of the last act. As described by the press office of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, \\"Set in 1780s London, The Belle's Stratagem is the tale of Letitia Hardy, promised to the charming Doricourt whom she hasn't seen since childhood. Her plan to enchant him with her wit and charm is turned upside-down when she discovers she's fallen madly in love with him, and he seems quite unmoved by her. Desiring to marry a man who adores her equally, she plans a bold deception--to have love as she likes it. Interwoven with Letitia's scheme to trick Doricourt into passion is the story of the newly married Touchwoods. Sir George is wildly jealous of his lovely country-bred wife and his fear of her being corrupted by fashionable life encourages plots by his acquaintance to turn Lady Frances into a fine lady in order to spite Sir George.\\" The role of the ingenue heroine, Letitia Hardy, proved to be a successful vehicle in Paris for Harriet Smithson, who infatuated Hector Berlioz. It was also \\"a favorite role\\" for Ellen Terry,http://www.osfashland.org/news/releases/article.aspx?id=28 who was both photographed and engraved in her character's costume. Characters include... *Kitty Willis, *Tony, *Saville, *Courtall, *Doricourt, *Flutter, *Villers, *Mrs. Racket, *Letitia Hardy, *Old Hardy, *Sir George Touchwood, *Miss Ogle, *Lady Frances Touchwood  Author  In 1743, Hannah Cowley was born in Tiverton, Devon. Her father, Phillip Parkhouse, was an educated bookseller, which helped develop Cowley’s literary interest and skill. In 1772, she married Thomas Cowley, a bookseller’s son. Most female playwrights of the time period were either unmarried or abandoned playwriting shortly after their marriage. However, Thomas’s small earnings as a writer allowed her to try her hand at playwriting. Cowley’s interest in playwriting was allegedly sparked by a “dull night out at the theatre”; she decided she could write a better play than the one she had just watched, so shortly after, she wrote The Runaway. Cowely’s first play The Runaway debuted in February 1776. With the help of David Garrick, The Runaway became a huge success and earned Cowley over 500 pounds. The Runaway was Garrick’s last production before he retired, and Cowley had “lost the ‘patron’ to whom her ‘heart [was] devoted’”.Hughes, Derek, 1944. Eighteenth‐Century Women Playwrights, Pickering & Chatto, Brookrield, Vt;London;, 2001. Cowley’s next manager, Richard Sheridan, would not be as kind. While he delayed and rejected her ideas, Cowley saw her rival, Hannah More, become popular with plays that strongly resembled Cowley’s works. The two quickly began a very public “paper war” After the Hannah More scandal, Cowley returned her focus to playwriting, and in February 1780 The Belle’s Stratagem, Cowley’s most popular play premiered.  Influence  The Belle's Stratagem still remains Hannah Cowley's most popular play to date, and is very \\"before her time\\" in writing strong and intelligent female characters. In The Belle’s Stratagem, the topic of social injustices in marriage is blatant, the play mostly focusing on how women are supposed to be docile in most social settings. To break up this social narrative, Cowley creates female characters who are sharp and witty, women who know what they want and are determined to get it. Around the time of this play, marriage began to change and the idea of marrying for love instead of duty was more prominent.Moore, Wendy. \\"Love and Marriage in 18th-Century Britain.\\" Historically Speaking 10.3 (Nov. 3, 2009): 8-10. Project MUSE [Johns Hopkins UP]. Web. 2 Mar. 2017. Cowley uses this play to comment on social constructs of marriage, and how romantic love is becoming accepted and sought after by women looking towards marriage. Cowley sets the audience up to ask big questions about equality in marriage, because if Letitia is smart enough to trick Doricourt, she should also be trusted with decision making within the marriage. Cowley presents her female characters as virtuous and smart. She uses characters who are high in social status, and she does not often make people the butt of jokes. Her comedic formula is witty and reaches for high ideals, and this can be shown in how she writes her female characters. Letitia is brilliant. She comes up with a plot to prove to her fiancé that she can be as flirtatious as the European women, as well as be virtuous when doing so. She warns Doricourt to “beware of imprudent curiosity” when he tells her to take off her mask so it is obvious Letitia does not pine for his affection, because she knows she does not need to. She also does not sit back and let her fiancé set her aside. She does something about it, which is very admirable for a female character of this time period.

Career Jack Norton was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 2, 1882. In his early career he had a vaudeville comedy act with his wife Lillian Healy.Erickson, Hal Biography (Allmovie) Norton made his Broadway debut in 1925 in that year's edition of Earl Carroll's Vanities, and also appeared in Florida Girl, which was produced and staged by Carroll. Norton's first film work was for a musical short, School for Romance, in 1934, in which a young Betty Grable appeared, but his scenes were deleted. His work survived to reach the screen in his next assignment, The Super Snooper, a comedy short, and in his third film, his first full-length movie, Finishing School, which featured Frances Dee, Billie Burke, Ginger Rogers and Bruce Cabot, Norton played a drunk, setting the pattern for many of his future performances. Although he also played stone sober characters as well, he was best known for his inebriated characterizations, and he improved his work by following genuine drunks around, picking up behavioral tips. Norton worked continuously and consistently, sometimes appearing in as many as 20 films in one year, although many of his performances went uncredited. One of the few times he was credited as part of the main castAllmovie Filmography was in 1945 for the film A Guy, a Gal and a Pal In the 1940s, Norton was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors, appearing in five films written and directed by Sturges.Norton appeared in Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Hail the Conquering Hero and The Sin of Harold Diddlebock. He is perhaps best known to modern audiences as A. Pismo Clam, the drunken film director whom W.C. Fields is hired to replace in The Bank Dick (1940). In 1947, Norton retired from films due to illness, his last appearance being in Alias a Gentlemen, which was released in 1948, although he did make some live television appearances in the early 1950s. Jack Norton's final appearance would have been in the 1956 episode of The Honeymooners entitled \\"Unconventional Behavior\\", but age and infirmity had so overwhelmed him that he was literally written out of the show as it was being filmed, though Jackie Gleason saw to it that Norton was paid fully for the performance he was ready, willing, but unable to give. Norton died on October 15, 1958 in Saranac Lake, New York at the age of 76.

It is believed in Christian tradition that the Holy Family visited this area and stayed at the site of Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Abu Serga).Coptic Cairo egyptologyonline Coptic Cairo was a stronghold for Christianity in Egypt both before and during the Islamic era, as most of its churches were built after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 7th century.  History  There is evidence of settlement in the area as early as the 6th century BC, when Persians built a fort on the Nile, north of Memphis. The Persians also built a canal from the Nile (at Fustat) to the Red Sea. The Persian settlement was called Babylon, reminiscent of the ancient city along the Euphrates, and it gained importance while the nearby city of Memphis declined, as did Heliopolis. During the Ptolemaic period, Babylon and its people were mostly forgotten. It is traditionally held that the Holy Family visited the area during the Flight into Egypt, seeking refuge from Herod. Further it is held that Christianity began to spread in Egypt when St. Mark arrived in Alexandria, becoming the first Patriarch, though the religion remained underground during the rule of the Romans. As the local population began to organize towards a revolt, the Romans, recognising the strategic importance of the region, took over the fort and relocated it nearby as the Babylon Fortress. Trajan reopened the canal to the Red Sea, bringing increased trade, though Egypt remained a backwater as far as the Romans were concerned. Under the Romans, St. Mark and his successors were able to convert a substantial portion of the population, from pagan beliefs to Christianity. As the Christian communities in Egypt grew, they were subjected to persecution by the Romans, under Emperor Diocletian around 300 AD, and the persecution continued following the Edict of Milan that declared religious toleration. The Coptic Church later separated from the church of the Romans and the Byzantines. Under the rule of Arcadius (395-408), a number of churches were built in Old Cairo. In the early years of Arab rule, the Copts were allowed to build several churches within the old fortress area of Old Cairo. The Ben Ezra Synagogue was established in Coptic Cairo in 1115, in what was previously a Coptic church that was built in the 8th century. The Copts needed to sell it, in order to raise funds to pay taxes to Ibn Tulun. In the 11th century AD, Coptic Cairo hosted the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria, which is historically based in Alexandria. As the ruling powers moved from Alexandria to Cairo after the Arab invasion of Egypt during Pope Christodolos's tenure, Cairo became the fixed and official residence of the Coptic Pope at the Hanging Church in Coptic Cairo in 1047. The Coptic Museum was established in 1910, and it houses the world's most important examples of Coptic art.  Churches  Coptic Cairo is, to this day, a predominantly Christian area, hosting many historically important churches: * Saint Mary Church (Haret Elroum) * Saint Mercurius Church * Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Abu Serga) * The Hanging Church * Church of the Holy Virgin (Babylon El-Darag) * Saint Barbara Church * The Church of Saint Menas * Nunnery and Church of St. George (Cairo) * Monastery and Church of St. George (Greek Orthodox)  See also  * Copts in Egypt * Coptic Orthodox Church * Coptic architecture * Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria * Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Cairo * Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria) * Church of the Virgin Mary (Haret Zuweila) * Holy family in Egypt * Ben Ezra Synagogue  Notes   References    External links  * Coptic Cairo Online * Coptic Cairo on egyptology online * Rising from the ashes, Al-Ahram Cairo Old Cairo Coptic history ","title":"Coptic Cairo"},{"id":"12836131","text":"Hafez Nazeri & Shahram Nazeri, 2001 Hafez Nazeri (, ) is a Kurdish Iranian singer and composer.

Drafted with the 8th selection in the 2004 Draft, Meesen had a long wait to play his first senior game for the Adelaide Crows. Playing for Norwood in the South Australian National Football League, Meesen was a leading ruckman in the senior side, but was incapable of surpassing Rhett Biglands, Ben Hudson and Matthew Clarke for a spot in the Crows team. Following Biglands' 2007 season-ending injury in the 2006 preliminary final and Clarke's move to St Kilda, it was thought that Meesen would begin season 2007 as back-up ruckman to Hudson. However an injury- plagued pre-season saw Jonathon Griffin and Ivan Maric move ahead of him in the pecking order. Meesen finally made his debut in round 20 of 2007 against the Western Bulldogs at AAMI Stadium in the Sunday twilight fixture. He came in at the expense of Griffin. It was thought that he may have made his debut a week earlier in his home town of Geelong against the Cats due to Hudson's club-imposed suspension, but the club decided that having an inexperienced ruckman playing alongside a debut ruckman wouldn't be a suitable situation. In October 2007 Meesen was traded to the Melbourne Football Club for the 37th selection in the 2007 AFL Draft. He made his debut for Melbourne in Round 3, 2009. Meesen was delisted at the end of the 2009 season along with Michael Newton; both were re-drafted as mature age rookies. After failing to play a senior match in 2010 due to injury, Meesen was delisted at season's end. Melbourne subsequently appointed Meesen to the role of part-time development coach. Recently, Meesen returned to his home grown club, Modewarre, where he took the opportunity to co-coach a young and talented team alongside veteran, Josh Finch. Meesen immediately attained the respect from his teammates and committee and begun a very successful 2018 season in Geelong's Bellarine Football League (BFL). Modewarre begun the season with just one win through the first four matches, however, turned the season around winning 9 of the next 11 games to ultimately gain a spot in the BFL Grand Final against the red hot favourites, Barwon Heads. Meesen was a dominant force in the ruck which reflected in his team's performances and brought Modewarre's first Premiership to the club since entering the BFL competition. Meesen was awarded best on ground for his grand final performance to complete his successful season. Meesen also finished runner up in the BFL League Les Ash Medal vote count however Meesen was reported during a minor incident in the 2018 season.

B: Biomedical Applications 145 137–140. and is produced by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with phenethylamine as a substrate. PEA and NMPEA are both alkaloids that are found in a number of different plant species as well.T. A. Smith (1977). \\"Phenethylamine and related compounds in plants.\\" Phytochemistry 16 9–18. Some Acacia species, such as A. rigidula, contain remarkably high levels of NMPEA (~2300–5300 ppm).B. A. Clement, C. M. Goff and T. D. A. Forbes (1998) Phytochemistry 49 1377–1380. NMPEA is also present at low concentrations (< 10 ppm) in a wide range of foodstuffs.G. B. Neurath et al. (1977) Fd. Cosmet. Toxicol. 15 275–282. NMPEA is a positional isomer of amphetamine. Biosynthesis Chemistry In appearance, NMPEA is a colorless liquid. NMPEA is a weak base, with pKa = 10.14; pKb = 3.86 (calculated from data given as KbW.H. Carothers, C. F. Bickford and G. J. Hurwitz (1927) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 49 2908–2914.). It forms a hydrochloride salt, m.p. 162–164°C.C. Z. Ding et al. (1993) J. Med. Chem. 36 1711–1715. Although NMPEA is available commercially, it may be synthesized by various methods. An early synthesis reported by Carothers and co-workers involved conversion of phenethylamine to its p-toluenesulfonamide, followed by N-methylation using methyl iodide, then hydrolysis of the sulfonamide. A more recent method, similar in principle, and used for making NMPEA radio-labeled with 14C in the N-methyl group, started with the conversion of phenethylamine to its trifluoroacetamide. This was N-methylated (in this particular case using 14C – labeled methyl iodide), and then the amide hydrolyzed.I. Osamu (1983) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 8 385–388. NMPEA is a substrate for both MAO-A (KM = 58.8 μM) and MAO-B (KM = 4.13 μM) from rat brain mitochondria.O. Suzuki, M. Oya and Y. Katsumata (1980) Biochem. Pharmacol. 29 2663–2667. Pharmacology NMPEA is a pressor, with 1/350 x the potency of epinephrine.W. H. Hartung (1945) Ind. Eng. Chem. 37 126–137. Like its parent compound, PEA, and isomer, amphetamine, NMPEA is a potent agonist of human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1). It has comparable pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic properties to that of phenethylamine, amphetamine, and other methylphenethylamines in rats. As with PEA, NMPEA is metabolized relatively rapidly by monoamine oxidases during first pass metabolism; both compounds are preferentially metabolized by MAO-B. =Toxicology= The \\"minimum lethal dose\\" (mouse, i.p.) of the HCl salt of NMPEA is 203 mg/kg;A.

Schools which follow Rudolf Steiner's theories are known as Steiner schools, or Waldorf schools. Sophia Mundi was founded in 1985 by a group of parents. Classes Prep to Year 12 are based in the St. Mary's building of the Abbotsford Convent complex. A Playgroup is also offered on site. Name The name \\"Sophia Mundi\\" (\\"Wisdom of the World\\") is a combination of the Greek word \\"sophia\\" (wisdom) and the Latin word \\"mundus\\" (world). Facilities The school is located in the Heritage listed St Marys building of the Abbotsford Convent artistic and historic precinct and overlooks a bend of the Yarra River and the Collingwood Children's Farm. The School site is located approximately 4 km from the Melbourne City Centre and is well served by public transport (Bus and Train) and is on the main Yarra Bike Path. In December 2011 the School was granted approval to build four classrooms and to convert a disused swimming pool into a playground and meeting area. These improvements were to replace facilities lost in the sale of the old St Joseph's Technical School, Abbotsford site in Nicholoson Street, Abbotsford by the Catholic Diocese in Oct 2010. The old site had previously been used by the schools senior school classes. These classrooms, and the associated community meeting area and playground were opened in August 2012. 338px Curriculum Key subjects are taught in concentrated, progressive, three-week blocks (main lessons) so that the subject matter can be fully enjoyed, consolidated and digested. Drama, Art, Craft and Music are an integral part of the curriculum. Every child from Class Three onwards learns a musical instrument from the string family and participates in ensembles. The school supports the approach of Steiner Education Australia to create an ACARA endorsed Steiner curriculum for years 1-10 as an alternative to the Australian Curriculum, and plans to offer this curriculum now that it has been approved. 300px =Senior School Curriculum up to 2010= Up until 2010 the school offered a combined, ungraded VCE with a Steiner course for students in Years 11 and 12 which included a year-long research project of their choosing. The senior curriculum was changed due to reduced demand for this Steiner/Ungraded VCE combined offering and to recognise the desire from Students and parents for a more predictable tertiary pathway than a case by case negotiated pathway. =Senior School Curriculum from 2012= The school was granted World School Status in October 2011 by the International Baccalaureate Organisation to offer the IB Diploma from 2012 for Years 11 and 12. The school became the third school to offer a combined Steiner and IB offering. The other two are Waldorfschoul Letzebuerg in Luxembourg and Colegio Internacional Rudolf Steiner in Ecuador. The first cohort of students graduated from the IB Diploma program in 2013. Following this the school also plans to offer a Vocational program as an alternative to the IB Diploma for senior students. This will be designed to provide a flexible learning framework tailored by the school to meet the individual needs of students, the local community and the world beyond.

There he graduated in 1879. He worked in Naples from 1893 to 1901 as CEO of Rinascimento di Napoli. Then he came back to the Rome area and started working in the Terni steel/chemical/hydroelectric industrial district. In August 1902, when maintenance was being carried out on the hydroelectrical power plant of Papigno (Terni), the closure of a water pipe caused its explosion and great damage to the plant. Allievi investigated the problem immediately thereafter and published his fundamental study on the water hammer problem the same year. He continued to study this problem in the following years while still working on hydroelectric power plants and becoming vice president of the Union of Industrials (in Italy). Allievi wrote in 1895 a booklet titled Cinematica della Biella Piana (Tipografia Francesco Giannini e Figli, Naples 1895) where a completely analytical solution to mechanisms design problems is given.

It weighs approximately 12 tons and is deployable from a C-130; thus, the Black Knight can be airlifted by military transport aircraft. Similar in appearance to a tank, it is armed with a turret-mounted 30 mm gun and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun. The vehicle is fitted with a 300-horsepower Caterpillar Inc. diesel engine. The vehicle is currently being evaluated by the US Army. It is a proof of concept for military unmanned vehicles, specifically as a combat asset.  History  The project began as the ARD, or Armed Robotic Demonstrator. Designed in 2005 and 2006, its purpose was to evaluate the performance of previous unmanned vehicles. In 2006, the ARD made its first public appearance at the Association of the United States Army in Washington D.C. The following year, a remote operation capability because of all the interest it received during that same convention in Washington. They showcased the Black Knight's new attributes in an annual experiment named AAEF in Fort Benning, GA. It was during the AAEF or Air Assault Expeditionary Force field trials and as soon as the tank passed the safety conditions it underwent testing during the Fall of 2007, and after 200 hours of operation, the Black Knight was able to perform tasks successfully. BAE reintroduced the Black Knight in March 2017 as the Armed Robotic Combat Vehicle (ARCV).At AUSA BAE Systems come back with its project of ARCV Armed Robotic Combat Vehicle - Armyrecognition.com, 15 March 2017  Characteristics  The Black Knight is capable of being used off-road meaning that it go through any type of terrain such as rocks or water. The vehicle is used in military tests that allows Soldiers to figure out the major roles of the tank in order to use it in a more advanced military force. Because of its autonomous and semi-autonomous (being able to control itself and be controlled by someone else) components this helps operators plan an efficient plan of attack as well as avoiding obstacles while finding its way from point A to point B. It also consists of three modules: the Robotics Operator, the Mission Commander, and the Safety Officer each serving their own purpose. The Black Knight is basically operated through the Robotics Operator Control Station (ROCS) which is inside an armed vehicle. Meaning that it controls the remote and autonomous operations while the Mission Commander has the task of reading the data and then transferring it to the whole system allowing it to better direct the robotics operator. The Safety Officer controls the remote hand controller which is used when there's an unsafe situation and an emergency stop command is needed. Its main role is to insure the safety of those around the vehicle and after each task, it needs to be remotely parked in a certain location like a garage or onto a truck. = Remote operation =  Advantages  UGCVs (Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicles) can be used at any time of the day missions deemed too dangerous for manned ground vehicles, including forward scouting, RSTA, intelligence gathering, and investigating hazardous areas. Its biggest advantage is that the unmanned vehicle can investigate areas that are too hazardous for a group of soldiers to see or check and it can be controlled by a Dismounted Control Device. These advantages allow operators to receive data from unmanned forward positions and verify their plan of attack by utilizing the information they received from the map data to check for unsafe conditions or obstacles. The Black Knight can be controlled by soldiers safely from inside a manned fighting vehicle (Bradley Fighting Vehicle) giving them protection. The Black Knight's computer system allows it to perform a variety of functions by itself such as moving the turret, navigation, and planning a route.  Challenges  The technology driving Black Knight is still a work in progress, with limitations in its GPS, sensors, and wireless communication. However, the one with the most limitations is wireless communication. The biggest challenge is making sure that the vehicle is safe without affecting its capability to do certain functions, as well as focusing on how to create the tank in a more efficient and easy way.

Sexual meanings are social and cultural constructs, and they are metabolized and subjectivized by the individual only after cultural and social mediation. In the first systematic study on this issue, Michel Foucault, with his 1976 History of Sexuality, was the first to study this issue with a systematic approach.

Design science research focuses on the development and performance of (designed) artifacts with the explicit intention of improving the functional performance of the artifact. Design science research is typically applied to categories of artifacts including algorithms, human/computer interfaces, design methodologies (including process models) and languages. Its application is most notable in the Engineering and Computer Science disciplines, though is not restricted to these and can be found in many disciplines and fields. In design science research, or constructive research, as opposed to explanatory science research, academic research objectives are of a more pragmatic nature. Research in these disciplines can be seen as a quest for understanding and improving human performance. Such renowned research institutions as MIT’s Media Lab, Stanford's Centre for Design Research, Carnegie-Mellon's Software Engineering Institute, Xerox’s PARC and Brunel’s Organization and System Design Centre use the Design Science Research approach. Objectives According to Van Aken, the main goal of design science research is to develop knowledge that the professionals of the discipline in question can use to design solutions for their field problems. This mission can be compared to the one of the ‘explanatory sciences’, like the natural sciences and sociology, which is to develop knowledge to describe, explain and predict. Hevner states that the main purpose of design science research is achieving knowledge and understanding of a problem domain by building and application of a designed artifact. Evolution Since the first days of computer science, computer scientists have been doing design science research without naming it. They have developed new architectures for computers, new programming languages, new compilers, new algorithms, new data and file structures, new data models, new database management systems, and so on. Much of the early research was focused on systems development approaches and methods. The dominant research philosophy has been to develop cumulative, theory-based research to be able to make prescriptions. It seems that this ‘theory-with-practical-implications’ research strategy has seriously failed to produce results that are of real interest in practice. This failure led to search practical research methods such as design science research. Characteristics The design process is a sequence of expert activities that produces an innovative product. The artifact enables the researcher to get a better grasp of the problem; the re-evaluation of the problem improves the quality of the design process and so on. This build-and-evaluate loop is typically iterated a number of times before the final design artifact is generated. In design science research, the focus is on the so-called field- tested and grounded technological rule as a possible product of Mode 2 research with the potential to improve the relevance of academic research in management. Mode 1 knowledge production is purely academic and mono- disciplinary, while Mode 2 is multidisciplinary and aims at solving complex and relevant field problems. Guidelines in information systems research Hevner et al. have presented a set of guidelines for design science research within the discipline of Information Systems. Design science research requires the creation of an innovative, purposeful artifact for a special problem domain. The artifact must be evaluated in order to ensure its utility for the specified problem. In order to form a novel research contribution, the artifact must either solve a problem that has not yet been solved, or provide a more effective solution. Both the construction and evaluation of the artifact must be done rigorously, and the results of the research presented effectively both to technology-oriented and management-oriented audiences. Hevner counts 7 guidelines for a design science research: # Design as an artifact: Design-science research must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, a model, a method, or an instantiation. # Problem relevance: The objective of design-science research is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant business problems. # Design evaluation: The utility, quality, and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods. # Research contributions: Effective design-science research must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, design foundations, and/or design methodologies. # Research rigor: Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact. # Design as a search process: The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment. # Communication of research: Design-science research must be presented effectively both to technology- oriented as well as management-oriented audiences. Artifacts Artifacts within DSR are perceived to be knowledge containing. This knowledge ranges from the design logic, construction methods and tool to assumptions about the context in which the artifact is intended to function (Gregor, 2002). The creation and evaluation of artifacts thus forms an important part in the DSR process which was described by Hevner et al., (2004) and supported by March and Storey (2008) as revolving around “build and evaluate”. DSR artifacts can broadly include: models, methods, constructs, instantiations and design theories (March & Smith, 1995; Gregor 2002; March & Storey, 2008, Gregor and Hevner 2013), social innovations, new or previously unknown properties of technical/social/informational resources (March, Storey, 2008), new explanatory theories, new design and developments models and implementation processes or methods (Ellis & Levy 2010). A three-cycle view Design science research can be seen as an embodiment of three closely related cycles of activities. The relevance cycle initiates design science research with an application context that not only provides the requirements for the research as inputs but also defines acceptance criteria for the ultimate evaluation of the research results. The rigor cycle provides past knowledge to the research project to ensure its innovation. It is incumbent upon the researchers to thoroughly research and reference the knowledge base in order to guarantee that the designs produced are research contributions and not routine designs based upon the application of well-known processes. The central design cycle iterates between the core activities of building and evaluating the design artifacts and processes of the research. Ethical issues Design science research in itself implies an ethical change from describing and explaining of the existing world to shaping it. One can question the values of IS research, i.e. whose values and what values dominate it, emphasizing that research may openly or latently serve the interests of particular dominant groups. The interests served may be those of the host organization as perceived by its top management, those of IS users, those of IS professionals or potentially those of other stakeholder groups in society.

URENIO is a non-profit research organization that started its operation in 1995. URENIO is mainly involved in competitive projects from the European R&D; Framework Programs (FP), the Competitiveness and Innovation Program (CIP), the territorial cooperation programs, the OECD, and the United Nations. Research Focus The initial research focus of URENIO concerned the technological development of cities and regions and their ability to create environments supporting R&D;, human skills, and innovation. Interest in the contribution of technological innovation to urban and regional development peaked after 1980 by economic geography research on industrial districts of central Italy, new industrial spaces in the west coast of the US, and the planning of large technopoles in Japan. These new forms of agglomeration brought on the surface a series of phenomena with major impact on urban and regional development, such as the geographical concentration of innovation, the role of R&D; and innovation in regional competitiveness and growth, the drivers of innovative agglomerations, the new divides and gaps in terms of knowledge and innovation. Since then, technology and innovation have been a standard point of reference in the development and planning of cities and regions. The current research emphasis is on innovation ecosystems and intelligent cities. Intelligent cities are advanced ecosystems of innovation, combining knowledge-intensive clusters, technology learning institutions, and digital spaces. Intelligent cities constitute a discrete category of intelligent environments created by the agglomeration of creativities, smaller systems of innovation that operate within cities (technology districts, technology parks, innovation poles, innovative clusters), and digital networks and online services. alt=intelligent city levelsTheir added value lies in the ability to bring together and connect three forms of intelligence: human intelligence of the city's population, collective intelligence of institutions supporting learning and innovation, and artificial intelligence of smart environments, digital networks and online services. Main fields of URENIO's research are: * Development and planning of innovative clusters, technology districts, technopoles, science parks, innovation centers, and incubators. * Regional innovation systems and strategies: Knowledge-based urban and regional development. Management of regional systems of innovation. Regional innovation strategies, RIS and RITTS projects. Measuring and benchmarking of regional innovation performance. * Intelligent cities: Design and development of digital innovation environments. Intelligent clusters and technology parks. Living Labs. Intelligent city strategies. Applications for collective intelligence, technology transfer, collaborative new product development, and product promotion. Innovation ecosystems, smart cities and future Internet technologies. Intelligent city platforms URENIO has developed a series of digital spaces and tools which facilitate the design and development of virtual innovation ecosystems and intelligent cities. alt=intelligent city platforms The platforms support key innovation processes: * Strategic intelligence, allowing to gather and analyze information about technologies, markets, and competitors; * Technology acquisition and learning, allowing to learn about available technologies and ways to valorise them; * Collaborative innovation and crowdsourcing for creation of networks of product design and new product development; * Digital marketplaces and online marketing of products and services, and * New companies incubation. Academic Activities Academic activities of URENIO focus on undergraduate and post-graduate teaching on urban development, learning regions, and digital cities. Recent post-graduate activities include: * The annual post-graduate seminar 'Intelligent cities: Systems and environments of innovation'; * The creation of a series of educational platforms facilitating the design of intelligent cities. Accomplishments URENIO is mainly known for its research record in the field of ‘regional innovation’ (TII Innovation JournalTII Innovation Journal: Regional Innovation on the Internet); research carried out in the Lab is acknowledged by leading organizations in this field (CORDIS,CORDIS : Guidance : Innovation Services IMProve;IMP³rove - Valuable links and references Observatory PascalURENIO: Urban and Regional Innovation Research Unit  Observatory PASCAL); it is among the few academic organizations promoting research in the field of intelligent cities (Intelligent Cities NetworksIntelligentcities) having introduced the concept of intelligent cities as physico-virtual territorial systems of innovation, and most advanced innovative agglomerations. The website of the Unit is at the 1st position of ALEXA's ranking of top sites in the Urban and Regional Planning Education category(Alexa Bot generated title -->). The website of URENIO offers a global watch on research and planning activities related to environments of innovation, user-driven innovation ecosystems, and intelligent cities. News, software, books, papers, reports, and best practices are presented in 18 categories dealing with innovation theory and metrics, innovation ecosystems and clusters, virtual innovation environments, digital, smart, and intelligent cities.

This was a direct result of the colonisation of Malaya, Sarawak, and North Borneo by Britain between the early 19th century to 1960s. The supreme law of the land—the Constitution of Malaysia—sets out the legal framework and rights of Malaysian citizens. Federal laws enacted by Parliament of Malaysia that apply throughout the country. There are also state laws enacted by the State Legislative Assemblies which applies in the particular state. The constitution of Malaysia also provides for a unique dual justice system—the secular laws (criminal and civil) and sharia laws. History Adat (customary practices and tradition) provided Malay law before colonization. Prior to the independence in 1957, most of the laws of United Kingdom were imported and either made into local legislation or simply applied as case laws. Malaysian law is also based on other jurisdictions namely Australia and India. The criminal law in Malaysia—the Criminal Procedure Code—was based on the Indian criminal code. Similarly, the Contracts Act is based on the Indian model. Malaysian land law is based on the Australian Torrens system. The Federal Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It provides the legal framework for the laws, legislation, courts, and other administrative aspects of the law. It also defines the government and monarch, and their powers, as well as the rights of the citizens. Dual justice system The dual system of law is provided in Article 121(1A) of the Constitution of Malaysia. Article 3 also provides that Islamic law is a state law matter with the exception for the Federal Territories of Malaysia.\\"Malaysia Toward an Islamic State\\" , Islamic World. Accessed 19 August 2007. Islamic law refers to sharia law, and in Malaysia it is known and spelled as syariah. The court is known as the Syariah Court. Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively small role in defining the laws on the country. It only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts has jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states there are sharia criminal laws, for example there is the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 5000, and imprisonment to not more than 3 years. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law.\\"Minister: Study proposal on switch to Syariah law thoroughly\\" , The Star, 24 August 2007. =Complications= Complications have arisen with regard to the dual justice system, for example with regard to freedom of religion. Article 11 of the Constitution provides that \\"Every person has the right to profess and practice his religion\\". However, in the case of Lina Joy—a Malay who converted to Christianity—the Federal Court of Malaysia refused to allow her to change her religion indicated in her identity card (MyKad). The judges held that they had no jurisdiction on the matter—that it was a matter of the Shariah Court, as indicated in Article 121(1A) of the Constitution. Federal law and state law The Malaysian Parliament Building. Federal laws are made by legislators (members of Parliament and senators) sitting in the Parliament of Malaysia and applies nationwide. Federal laws are known as Acts (of Parliament). State laws are made by assemblymen sitting in the State Legislative Assembly (Dewan Undangan Negeri) and only applies in the particular state. State laws are often referred to as enactments or ordinances. Article 75 of the Constitution states that a federal law shall prevail over any inconsistent state laws, including sharia laws. =Sabah and Sarawak= After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the Federal Constitution was amended to include special provisions applicable to the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Some federal Acts of Parliament apply to these states differently on a number of matters, particularly on issues related to immigration, land and natural resource management. For example, in the Peninsular, the National Land Code governs most of the laws relating to land. In Sabah, the main legislation is the Sabah Land Ordinance; and in Sarawak, the Sarawak Land Code. =Kelantan attempts to impose strict Islamic laws= In recent years, hudud has been attempted to be introduced by Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) in Kelantan to Islamise the state. Common law The Sultan Abdul Samad Building used to house the apex courts of Malaysia. The laws of Malaysia can be divided into two types of laws—written law and unwritten law. Written laws are laws which have been enacted in the constitution or in legislation. Unwritten laws are laws which are not contained in any statutes and can be found in case decisions. This is known as the common law or case law. In situations where there is no law governing a particular circumstance, Malaysian case law may apply. If there is no Malaysian case law, English case law can be applied. There are instances where Australian, Indian, and Singaporean cases are used as persuasive authorities. The application of English law or common law is specified in statutes. Section 5 of Criminal Procedure Code states that English law shall be applied in cases where no specific legislation has been enacted. Similarly, in context of civil law, Sections 3 and 5 of Civil Law Act allows for application of English common law, equity rules, and statutes in Malaysian civil cases where no specific laws have been made. In 2007, Chief Justice of Malaysia, Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim questioned need to resort to English common law despite Malaysia having already been independent for 50 years and proposed to replace it with Islamic law jurisprudence or sharia law. However, Malaysian Bar Council responded by saying that common law is part of Malaysian legal system and that is no basis to replace it. Court appeals to Privy Council in England have already been abolished in 1985. The principle of stare decisis also applies in Malaysian law. This means that any decisions by a court higher in the hierarchy will be binding upon the lower courts.

It requires notification to the United States Congress if the cost per unit goes more than 25% beyond what was originally estimated and calls for the termination of programs with total cost growth greater than 50%, unless the Secretary of Defense submits a detailed explanation certifying: # the program is essential to national security, that no suitable alternative of lesser cost is available; # new estimates of total program costs are reasonable; and # management structure is (or has been made) adequate to control costs.

Origins Markham was the son of John Markham, a judge of the Common Pleas, by either his first or second wife. Francis Markham, in his manuscript 'History of the Family’, written in 1606 (which informed Thoroton in his 'History of Nottinghamshire'),Markham Memorials, by Sir Clements Robert Markham, K.C.B., Heraldically Illustrated by Mabel Markham, pub. London 1913. page v., accessed 1 July 2017 and Wotton in his ' Baronetage’ described him as the son of the second wife, but the writ of dower which she brought in 1410 against 'John, son and heir of her husband by his wife Elizabeth,' seems to point the other way. His extreme youth when his father died, however, makes it almost certain that he was a son by the second marriage. Career He does not appear as an advocate until 1430, having studied the law, according to a doubtful authority, at Gray's Inn. At Easter 1440 he was made a serjeant-at- law, served the king in that capacity, and on 6 February 1444 was raised to a seat on the king's bench. In the subsequent troubles, though he probably took no active part, he was popular with the Yorkists. He and his elder brother Robert were both made knights of the Bath at the coronation of Edward IV. In October 1450 he reproved an enemy of John Paston for the injuries done to Paston, and for 'ungoodly' private life. On the accession of Edward IV he was immediately promoted to the office of chief justice of the king's bench, 13 May 1461, in place of Sir John Fortescue. He was credited with having procured a knighthood for Yelverton, 'who had loked to have ben chef juge,' to console him for his disappointment. On 23 January 1469 Markham was superseded by Sir Thomas Billing. Judicial reputation Fuller, who couples him with Fortescue as famous for his impartiality, tells us that the king deprived him of his office because he directed a jury in the case of Sir Thomas Cooke, accused of high treason for lending money to Margaret of Anjou (July 1468), to find him guilty only of misprision of treason. Markham certainly presided on the occasion in question, and his removal closely followed it. Sir John Markham then laid down the maxim of our jurisprudence that 'a subject may arrest for treason, the king cannot, for if the arrest be illegal the party has no remedy against the king.' He is said to have won the name of the 'upright judge,' and Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, when on his trial in 1554, urged the chief justice to incline his judgment after the example of Judge Markham. and others who eschewed corrupt judgments. Death and descendants Markham spent the rest of his life in retirement at Sedgebrook Hall, Sedgebrook, Lincolnshire, which he had inherited from his father, and dying there in 1479, was buried in the parish church. By his wife Margaret, daughter and coheiress of Sir Simon Leke of Cottam, Nottinghamshire, he had a son Thomas and a daughter Elizabeth. A descendant of Sir John Markham was created a baronet by Charles I in 1642. The title became extinct in 1779.

The yacht was originally named Triton and her first owner was philanthropist James Coats. Following his death, she was purchased in 1913 by Sir George Bullough, owner of the Scottish island of Rùm. He renamed her Rhouma. During World War I, Rhouma was hired for use as an auxiliary patrol yacht. Between the wars, she was lengthened and had an upper deck of cabins added, and her engines were converted to run on oil fuel. In World War II, she served in the Royal Navy as a Royal Patrol Yacht and transported King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth II.

There were two agencies with the same name. The first, the National Wage Stabilization Board, was the successor to the National War Labor Board, and existed from January 1, 1946, to February 24, 1947. The second, the Wage Stabilization Board, was a part of the Office of Defense Mobilization and existed from September 9, 1950, to February 6, 1953. National Wage Stabilization Board The first agency, known as the National Wage Stabilization Board, was established by President Harry S. Truman within the United States Department of Labor in on January 1, 1946.Wood, Lewis. \\"Stable Pay Board to Succeed NWLB.\\" New York Times. January 1, 1946.

December 13, 1946; \\"Truman's Statement and Order Consolidating War Agencies.\\" Associated Press. December 13, 1946. Wage Stabilization Board The Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950. After an initial (and significant) surge of inflation, President Harry S. Truman's war mobilization effort began to achieve some success in stabilizing the American economy.Hogan, p. 353-355. On September 8, 1950, the U.S. Congress enacted the Defense Production Act. The Act gave the President statutory authority to order companies to do business with the United States in order to furnish equipment and services needed for national defense; to establish federal agencies as needed to implement the Act; and to allocate resources, personnel and funds to ensure national defense needs were met.Hogan, p. 344. However, the Act tied wage controls to prices. If any price ceiling was imposed, the government was required to issue regulations and orders stabilizing wages in the affected industry.\\"Everybody's Fight,\\" Time, September 18, 1950. The next day, President Truman issued Executive Order (EO) 10161, which established the Economic Stabilization Agency (ESA) to coordinate and supervise wage and price controls. Utilizing the wage and price control model developed in World War II, the Truman administration created two sub- agencies within ESA. The Office of Price Stabilization (OPS) was given the power to regulate prices, while the Wage Stabilization Board (WSB) oversaw the creation of wage stabilization rules. The division of labor was specifically designed to unlink wages from prices. If prices rose automatically with wages, the inflationary spiral would continue unabated. Placing the onus solely on workers to keep wages low risked the wrath of labor, a lesson the administration had learned from the WWII experience. Delinking wages and prices leveled the playing field. Both workers and employers would now be forced to justify, independently, the wages and prices they demanded.Marcus, p. 9-10. The Wage Stabilization Board was authorized to control wages only for hourly employees.Pierpaoli, p. 145. However, the WSB's authority in this regard was extremely limited. Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Truman Establishes Agency To Bar Inflation as U.S. Arms.\\" New York Times. September 10, 1950. =Structure= The Economic Stabilization Agency had overall authority to coordinate and implement wage and price policies. Within ESA were three sub- agencies:\\"Bureaucracy in Blossom,\\" Time, February 26, 1951. *The Office of Price Stabilization (OPS), which recommended price control policies to the ESA, and implemented policies which ESA had approved. *The Wage Stabilization Board, which recommended wage control policies to the ESA, and implemented policies which ESA had approved. *The Office of the Housing Expediter (OHE), which recommended rent control policies to the ESA, and implemented policies which ESA had approved. The WSB had nine members. Three members represented the public, three represented labor, and three represented business and industry.Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Truman Setting Up Price Unit with Ching Slated As Head.\\" New York Times. September 30, 1950. Initially, the WSB's three \\"public\\" members were Cyrus S. Ching, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service; Clark Kerr, professor of industrial relations at the University of California, Berkeley; and John Thomas Dunlop, a professor of economics at Harvard University. The three labor representatives were Harry C. Bates, president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers; Emil Rieve, president of the Textile Workers Union of America; and Elmer Walker, president of the International Association of Machinists. The three business representatives were Henry B. Arthur, manager of the research department at meat processor Swift & Co.; J. Ward Keener, vice president of the B.F. Goodrich tire company; and Reuben B. Robinson president of the Champion Paper Co.Loftus, Joseph A. \\"Board of 9 Sworn As Pay Stabilizers.\\" New York Times. November 29, 1950. The WSB was politically divided, however. On April 21, 1951, President Truman issued Executive Order 10233, which reconstituted the Wage Stabilization Board. Its members increased from nine to 18, and it was now given the power to issue recommendations and reports directly to the President in wage disputes.Marcus, p. 24. =History= The reconstituted board did not retain all its powers for long, however. Executive Order 10276, issued on July 31, 1951, established the Office of Rent Stabilization. The new office was given the WSB's rent control powers, as well as given new powers to encourage the construction of rental units in areas near defense industries. By the end of 1951, the Office of Rent Stabilization had controlled the rent for 6.8 million rental units.\\"'Annual Budget Message to the Congress: Fiscal Year 1953.'

Cameron McNeish FRSGS is a Scottish wilderness hiker, backpacker and mountain walker who is an authority on outdoor pursuits. In this field he is best known as an author and broadcaster although he is also a magazine editor, lecturer and after dinner speaker as well as being an adviser to various outdoor organisations. Early days McNeish was brought up in the Glasgow area in Scotland and did much of his early walking as a youth in the Campsie Fells. As his confidence grew, he moved further afield to bigger mountains and his first Munro was Ben Lomond. For a number of years McNeish worked for the Scottish Youth Hostels Association as a warden and for a period ran the busy hostel at Aviemore, in his early years he also worked as a ski and climbing instructor. 1978 saw the publication of his first book, \\"Highland Ways\\" which was about backpacking in Scotland. In 1982 he started a weekly outdoor column in his local newspaper the Strathspey and Badenoch Herald called \\"McNeish at Large\\" and in the same year co-founded the outdoor magazine Footloose with two colleagues. In the media In 1985, he became editor of Climber and Rambler magazine, leaving in 1991 to become editor of TGO Magazine (formerly The Great Outdoors). Since 2010, he has been editor-at-large of TGO Magazine giving him more time to work on other projects. In 1999 he became outdoor correspondent of the Sunday Herald writing the weekly Peak Practice column. Throughout the late 1980s, McNeish contributed and wrote regularly for outdoor programmes on BBC Radio Scotland, in 1991 he scripted and hosted The Munro Challenge for BBC Radio 4 to celebrate 100 years of the Munro Tables. During this time Cameron was still writing books and the immensely popular The Munros Almanac and The Munros: Scotland’s Highest Mountains were released in the 1990s. In 1994, McNeish moved into television, presenting the BAFTA- winning The Edge: One Hundred Years of Scottish Mountaineering and in the same year The Great Outdoors, a six-part series for Channel 4. His best known television work is the Wilderness Walks programmes that he made for BBC Two: the first series was broadcast in 1997 and the second in 1998. McNeish was a consultant and guest on the 2007 series Mountain. In the first programme he guides series presenter Griff Rhys Jones to the summit of Scotland's most northerly Munro, Ben Hope, in a snowstorm. He is also a regular contributor to the BBC Scotland series, The Adventure Show. After a break of a number of years from book writing, McNeish released \\"The Sutherland Trail: A Journey Through Scotland's North-west\\" in August 2009 in conjunction with award- winning photographer and film maker Richard Else. The book is a description of a week-long walking route through Sutherland, in the far north-west of Scotland. That book was followed by others co-authored with Richard Else - The Skye Trail and Scotland End to End. In 2018 Cameron produced an autobiography, There's Always the Hills, published by Sandstone Press. That book became the Great Outdoor Magazine Book of the Year. Travels Cameron McNeish has travelled in many of the remote places in the world having hiked, backpacked, skied and climbed in the Alps, the Pyrenees, Spain, Iceland, North America, Norway, Sweden, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Central America, Slovenia, Russia, Guatemala, Corsica, Jordan and Turkey. Despite this most of his walking is done in the Scottish Highlands collecting data for his newspaper columns and creating podcasts for his personal website [ ]. Cameron completed his first round of the Scottish Munros in 1991 becoming Munroist no. 913, he completed his second round in 1996 and a third round in 2008.

He was born at Tremaran, Llanuwchllyn, Merionethshire, the son of Sir Owen Morgan Edwards, and was educated at Bala grammar school and University of Wales, Aberystwyth. After military service on the Western Front during World War I, he studied at Lincoln College, Oxford, taking a degree in history. He worked as a teacher and lecturer from 1920 to 1948, when he gave up the profession to concentrate on his work for the Urdd. In 1922, Edwards wrote a letter to the periodical Cymru'r Plant, which led to the founding of the Urdd, and the first Urdd recreational camp was held at Llanuwchllyn in 1928, under his direction. The first ever Urdd local branch was founded in Treuddyn. It was gradually followed by more permanent camps and residential centres. In partnership with J. Ellis Williams, he made the first Welsh language sound film, The Quarryman. In 1947 he was knighted in recognition of his youth work, and the Urdd had his portrait painted by Alfred Janes in 1956. He was a director of Television Wales and the West and encouraged the making of television programmes in Welsh. His son, Owen Edwards, would become the first chief executive of S4C.

Biography Dearson was born in Ynysybwl, Glamorgan. He began his football career as an inside forward with Barry and moved to First Division Birmingham in 1934. By 1936–37 he had established himself as a first-team player. The following season, he was joint top goalscorer, sharing the honour with Welsh international colleague Wilson Jones. In the last full season played before the Second World War, he moved to half-back. He won three full caps for Wales in their last three pre-war internationals. A qualified electrical engineer, he was in a reserved occupation during the war, and was available to represent his country in 15 wartime and victory international matches. Chosen to play against England at Birmingham's home ground, St Andrew's, in 1941, Dearson missed a penalty; Wales lost 2–1. He also made 166 appearances for Birmingham in wartime football, including helping the club to the championship of the 1945–46 Football League South. By the time the Football League proper resumed after the war, Dearson was past his best. He played another half-season for Birmingham as a full back before moving to Second Division Coventry City and then to Walsall of the Third Division South, before finally giving up League football at the age of 37. He still played another couple of years of non- league football with Birmingham Combination side Nuneaton Borough and Bilston.

FZL is also active internationally and is an active member within the International Union of Socialist Youth and Young European Socialists. Labour Youth Forum’s Mission Statement The aim of the Labour Youth Forum is to promote Socialist Democratic values and progressivism amongst the youths in Malta and Gozo. At the same time the Labour Youth Forum works towards promoting confidence in the abilities of youths. In order for these aims to be reached, the Labour Youth Forum has to build upon the values of social justice: equal distribution of the common good produced by the nation and the European Union, equal opportunity for everyone to enjoy the environment, quality educational opportunities for all and the guarantee of high quality healthcare. So that each and every one can benefit from all the above, the Labour Youth Forum has to strive against all kind of social, economic and political discrimination. The Labour Youth Forum has to be on the forefront to prevent anyone from being discriminated because of disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or political affiliation. The Labour Youth Forum together with its European colleagues is duty bound to struggle in favour of a new social Europe which invest in people and strengthens solidarity. (Statute of the Labour Youth Forum, 2009 Chapter 2) History The Labour Youth Forum aims at increasing the ability of the youths especially in cultivating them as the present and the future political leaders of our nation. Historically Labour Youth Forum was a force that brought change in the history of Malta in the last sixty years. The associated youths were not only witnessing change in Malta, but were themselves active and protagonists of re-writing the history of our nation. =Origins= The Labour Youth was established on 14 January 1951, thirty years after that the Labour Party (Malta) was founded. The name of this branch of the Labour Party was originally known as ‘Labour League of Youth’. =Structure= According to the Labour Youth Forum statute the Executive is the highest body. The Executive is elected during the General Meeting every two years. The General Meeting is held annually. The Executive is made up of the administration: which includes the President, Vice President, Secretary, Vice Secretary and the Financial Officer. Other positions in the Executive are the Political Co-ordinator, the Information Officer, an Officer responsible for the branches, an Officer responsible for organising events and five official members. In reality all these members meet together and today there is no difference between the administration and the other executive officers. =Role in the event of 28 April 1958= On 21 April 1958, the Prime Minister Dom Mintoff and his Ministers met Governor Robert Laycock and handed in their resignation from the Legislative Assembly. Preceding this event was a powerful speech by the Prime Minister Mintoff that reached its peak with the final two paragraphs: ‘Is-Siegħa tal-Prova waslet. Il-poplu Malti li tant iġġieled fl-imgħoddi battalji ta’ ħaddieħor issa wasal biex juri lid-dinja jekk veru kibirx u sar nazzjon. Biex ikun irrispetat minn popli oħra irid juri li hu lest biex il-battalja għad-drittijiet tiegħu jiġġelidha b’aktar qilla, b’sagrifiċċju akbar u b’rieda aktar soda milli fl- imgħoddi kien jiġġieled il-gwerer ta’ ħaddieħor Quddiem Alla għandna raġun. Issa sta għalina li dan ir-raġun neħduh ukoll mingħand in-nies ta’ din id- dinja. Jekk inkunu ġwejjef aħna, jisħtuna uliedna u wlied uliedna. Illum waslet is-siegħa meta kull Malti jrid juri bil-fatti li Malta għalina tiġi l-ewwel u qabel kollox.’ On 28 April 1958 a major event for Malta and the Labour Party occurred. That day was declared by the General Workers Union to be a general strike day or day of mourning. From early in the morning the strike was seen as a success but two factors led to the escalation of the events. The first factor was that the British Government in Malta prohibited the officials of the General Workers Union from using the ‘Rediffusion’ (radio station) to inform their members who should or should not go to work. The second factor was that the drivers of the public transport were being intimidated and persuaded to work on the day of the strike or else they will lose the license to work. Some of the drivers feared that they would lose their jobs and thus they tried to work but they were becoming the target of the protesters who were blocking the roads with barricades and spreading oil on the streets. Fighting between the protesters and the Police, which were helped by the British commandos occurred in Raħal Ġdid and Marsa with the worst episode happening at ‘It-Telgħa ta’ Kordin’. Other smaller accidents were reported. The day after, the British Government embarked on a mission to arrest the protesters. The protesters were mainly General Workers Union officials and supporters of the Labour Party, amongst them even Ministers. It is good to understand that the Labour Party and the General Workers Union were at that time working together for the benefit of the workers. One of the founders of the Labour League of Youth: the first Secretary General; Gerry Żammit was at that time serving as the Secretary responsible for the civil workers of the General Workers Union. He was arrested and imprisoned for thirty six days. Cutajar (2011) lists ninety-nine names of those that were arrested during the mentioned revolts. Seventy-eight out of ninety-nine people that were arrested were aged between sixteen and thirty-five years. =Role in Church-Labour Party conflicts= Following the Referendum for Integration with Great Britain in 1956 and the general strike of 1958, the Roman Catholic Church in Malta was becoming more suspicious of the Labour Party. After World War II humanity witnessed the world being divided between those countries supporting Capitalism of the United States of America and the Western allies and those that were allied with the Soviet Union and her satellites supporting Communism. In the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx, he wrote that ‘Religion is the opium of the people’. Some Communist countries became atheists and the churches were banned from practising their faith. In the 1950s the Labour Youth Forum used to organise Socialists Summer Camps and was being criticised by adversaries as spreading the Communist ideas amongst its members. The Labour Youth Forum published their first edition of its newspaper ‘The Struggle’ on 6 August 1959. ‘The Struggle’ became popular and had a vast audience. Some youth columnists’ names are quite popular since they went on to be the leaders of the Labour Party such as Lino Spiteri, Lorry Sant, Joe Micallef Stafrace, Danny Cremona and Pawlu Xeureb. On 21 February 1960, Archbishop of Malta: Sir Michael Gonzi and the Bishop of Gozo Gużeppi Pace, wrote a Pastoral Letter to be read in all churches of both dioceses to prepare the believers for the coming Lent . This Pastoral Letter was an attack on the Labour Party at its youths. Following the Pastoral Letter, the next edition of ‘The Struggle’ was a response by the columnists of the Labour Youth Forum. The Pastoral Letter was criticised of having nothing to do with the Lent, and instead it was an attack on the Labour Party and Socialism. The Roman Catholic Church in Malta answered with condemning the article from ‘The Struggle’ with Interdict if the columnist will not publish an apology which would have to be satisfactory for the Bishops, in the next edition of ‘The Struggle’. Meetings were set up and apologies were written but were not satisfying the Bishops. ‘The Struggle’ was published again in April 1960. On the front page a big heading title: ‘Tibqa’ ddur’, an article by John Rizzo who was in fact a ‘nom de plume’. The article mentions the story of the astronomer Galileo Galilei who had to sign a declaration in front of the Inquisition in Rome in 1633, that he was rejecting his theories that the world circulates around the sun. The story tells us that while the Inquisitor and his court was leaving the hall, the astronomer stated two words in Italian: ‘Eppur si mouve’ (Tibqa’ ddur – ‘But it moves’) meaning that it was useless to say that the world was not moving when in fact it was. Galilei was then imprisoned. Although the Roman Catholic Church tried to stop the progress, progress could not stop and later on even the Church accepted Galileo's theory. The 9 April 1960 was the day when the editor of ‘The Struggle’: Lorry Sant was handed a personal condemnation of Interdict by the Bishops for insulting the authority of the Bishops. ‘The Struggle’ was also condemned by condemning those that write in it or read it as they will be doing a mortal sin. The name of the newspaper was ideal since a struggle started between the Labour Party and the Roman Catholic Church in Malta. Almost a year later the Interdict was extended to the Labour Party Executive. Following the Interdict, The Labour Youth Forum stated that it would remain loyal to its leader and the National Executive of the Labour Party. The conflict between the two entities made some progress when on 21 September 1964; Malta was celebrating Independence from Imperialist rule of Great Britain and the Labour Party's Executive and Lorry Sant (since he was personally condemned) condemnation was lifted by the Curia. It was only in 1969 when both parties reached an agreement that distinguished the role of the Church from that of the State. Every sanction that the Church had on the Labour Party was then removed. On the 12, 13 and 14 June 1971 the General Elections were won by the Labour Party. The 70's were golden years for the Labour Party especially as it continued the struggle for complete Independence. Malta became a Republic on 13 December 1974 and the struggle reached its peak when Malta held Freedom Day on 31 March 1979. The Labour Party won the General Elections of 1971, 1976 and that of 1981. The 1981 General Election was tainted with trouble since that the Labour Party won the majority of seats in the Parliament of Malta but did not win the majority of the electorate. In those days it was the majority of seats that counted and not the majority of the electorate so the Government was a legitimate one. =Modernising= In 1992 the Labour Youth Forum became a full member of the ‘Kunsill Nazzjonali taż-Żgħażagħ’. The Labour Youth Forum had new challenges in adapting to the new world of technology, but the organisation understood that to keep in touch with the youths, it had to speak the language of the youths and thus technology was becoming the way forward to keep contact with the electorate. In a globalised world no one can isolate himself and thus the Labour Youth Forum's intentions during the 1990s was to find other partners around Europe to work with them and even to get an international recognition. In fact the Labour Youth Forum became member of the ‘European Community Organisation of the Socialist Youth’ (ECOSY – now YES: ‘Young European Socialists’) which is a branch of the ‘Party of European Socialists’ (PES). This membership and similar alliances with other European countries were beneficial for the maturity and experience of the Labour Youths who were attending seminars and training while exposing their abilities in front of other European politicians. This modernisation was taking place at a time when Malta was discussing its membership within the European Union. The 1990s and even in the dawn of the new millennium Maltese politics were highly concerned with issues related to the full membership in the European Union and Malta's partnership with the European Union. This issue came to an end when Malta became a full member of the European Union on 1 May 2004. =2008 to date= In 2008 a new Labour Youth Forum Executive board was elected. The year 2008 was also the year when Joseph Muscat became the new leader of the Labour Party at the age of 34, himself being a young man (he was also a former FZL member). From his very first day Dr Joseph Muscat was ready to put youths in the centre of his plan for the Labour Party. On 21 January 2012, Dr Joseph Muscat carried out his discourse at the end of the General Conference of the Labour Party with a speech that was to be the base of his vision for Malta. He mentioned youths and showed how much he believed in the young generations. ‘Qalbi kienet qed tgħidli li kelli ċ-ċans li nuri lill-pajjiż li aħna ż-żgħażagħ lest għar- responsabbilta’ u l-isfidi tal-ġejjieni ma jaqtgħulniex qalbna iżda jimlewna b’enerġija. (Engerer, 2013) ‘Stand Up’ Campaign In our political history it is very unusual to see a movement of people coming from different political ideologies and joined together in campaigning for an issue. This campaign saw the Labour Youth Forum gaining importance since it was working with people who sympathised with the Nationalist party but who were in favour of the introduction of divorce in Malta. This campaign was ironic for the Nationalist party, since it was one of its Members of Parliament that presented a private member's bill before Parliament for its introduction. ‘Re-Discover, Re-Think, Re-Act’ Campaign After the success of the divorce campaign the Labour Youth Forum embarked on another campaign; ‘Re- Discover, Re-Think, Re-Act’. The aim was to discuss gender equalities and to steer awareness through talks and discussions that all of us have the same potentials. Discussing issues does not mean that one is in favour or against but that one is ready to listen, to learn and to understand other people's issues. ‘START’ Campaign The year 2012 was a difficult year for the Nationalist Party in government. The one seat majority obtained in 2008 was hard to be kept and it was a time of uncertainty for the government. The general election could have come as early as January 2012 when Franco Debono, a Nationalist member of parliament was threatening not to support the government. In 2012 the ‘START’ campaign was introduced with the aim of encouraging and giving all aid to young people who wanted to be involved in the local council elections. It was once again another successful campaign since a good number of youths were elected as mayors and councillors in their respective localities. As part of ‘START’, youths were invited to address the Annual General Conference of the Labour Party and have their say about issues concerning our country. This campaign brought in the localities a new image for the Labour Party, an image that was a juvenile one, an image that youths were not only used in partisan politics to decorate the stages during meetings but it created a network of active new labour politicians around the islands. ‘Join Us’ Campaign Enthusiastic with the success obtained during the previous campaigns, the Labour Youth Forum launched the ‘Join Us’ campaign. The general election was coming close so it was important for the Labour to increase the number of youths that were ready to support and be active in it. ‘It’s Time’ Campaign In mid-2012 the Labour Party started its unofficial electoral campaign with gatherings every Sunday in squares where a tent was set up. At these meetings some issues were discussed with the general public prompted to participate in discussions with the aim to include the people's views in the electoral manifest. Subsequently, Labour Youth Forum launched a campaign which was carried out mainly on Facebook. This campaign was called: ‘It’s time’. Youths easily wrote what they think it should be inserted in the Labour Party's electoral manifest. ‘I’m In’ Campaign Once the General Elections date was set, then the campaign ‘I’m In’ was launched. ‘I’m In’ was a very personal campaign, making youth feeling really part of what was happening. It was a campaign for the youths within the Labour Party's general election's campaign. Although both campaigns were to be organised together in order to create one whole image, still the ‘I’m in’ campaign was an independent one led by the Labour Youth Forum. During the electoral campaign Thursdays were normally the days dedicated for the youths. The Labour Party's leader met youths and he was present in all the formal and informal activities of the campaign.  References  * AZZOPARDI, Josef. Youth Campaigning in the Labour Party.

The California Series Telecaster model also features vintage hardware such as Kluson-style tuners and a vintage bridge with six individual steel saddles. Medium jumbo frets make string bending and playability by far easier in contrast to the usual thin vintage frets. All Telecaster bodies of this particular series were routed for a humbucker pickup in the neck position.

Fate The Burning of the Queen Charlotte of 110 Guns Lord Keith's flagship off the Harbour of Leghorn, in the Mediterranean, 17 March 1800 At about 6am on 17 March 1800, whilst operating as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, Queen Charlotte was reconnoitering the island of Capraia, in the Tuscan Archipelago, when she caught fire. Keith was not aboard at the time and observed the disaster from the shore. The fire was believed to have resulted from someone having accidentally thrown loose hay on a match tub. Two or three American vessels lying at anchor off Leghorn were able to render assistance, losing several men in the effort as the vessel's guns cooked off in the heat. Captain A. Tod wrote several accounts of the disaster that he gave to sailors to give to the Admiralty should they survive. He himself perished with his ship. The crew was unable to extinguish the flames and at about 11am the ship blew up with the loss of 673 officers and men.

History and mythology  It is believed that the hillock or gudda in Kannada language that hosts the main deity Sri Prasanna Anjaneya Swamy was formed from a heap of Raagi/Finger Millet and hence was termed \\"Ragigudda\\". Local mythology has it that this place owes it to a dharmic lady Sudharma who was the wife of a local chieftain. She is an embodiment of good character and a very pious. One day the trinity come in the form of visitors and ask for bhiksha (alms). She gives them newly harvested Raghava Dhanya or Ragi. Her mother in law disapproves it and wants it back. This being an unholy act she says that if the visitors do not want the bhiksha then she does not need the Ragi. This Ragi becomes a hillock. In the end, the holy trinity are pleased with her selfless behavior and grant her their sacred darshan. The holy trinity expressed their will to remain near the hillock and turned themselves into stones nearby. These three stones now bear engravings of the trinity.

It was filmed in 1992 and 1993 in his hometown of Wells, England when Wright was only 18. He wrote, edited, produced and directed the film as well as shooting and recording the sound. It is a Zucker Brothers-style comedy that parodies the action thriller genre, most notably the Dirty Harry series (Dead Right was the working title for the original Dirty Harry). The film is shot on SVHS and contains an impressive cast of 70 actors (mostly amateur), mainly made up of Wright's school friends and colleagues. Clips from the film were first broadcast on Take Over TV – the Channel 4 series consisting entirely of video clips sent in by viewers – that also launched the careers of comedy duo Adam and Joe. Plot The film opens with a parody of the Simon Bates intro that used to accompany VHS rentals where Bates would explain to the viewer what certificate the film had received – 18 apparently – and what adult content they could expect to see. The story begins with a serial killer bumping off the residents of a small Somerset community. Maverick DI Barry Stern is assigned to the case and – despite his reluctance – is partnered with by-the-book fellow DI Mike Tight. On their first time out together Barry shoots a dealer trying to sell him cocaine in a public toilet. Meanwhile, the killer stalks a woman home from the supermarket and kills her by electrocution with a kitchen light. Mike and Barry show up at the scene of the crime and discover the woman electrocuted to death. A box of cereal has been left on her head leading Barry to surmise that they are now looking for a cereal killer. Back at the precinct Mike addresses his fellow inspectors. He tells them that to catch the killer they must look at and obey the formula that most cop movies go by even though it is a British movie and there won't be any car chases. Barry points out that the partner usually dies in these kind of movies but Mike says he is thinking more along the lines of the Lethal Weapon films. The following day the police stakeout the local supermarket where they expect the killer to strike next. Barry is disguised as a mime. Mike is disguised an old lady to ensnare the killer. A small boy asks Barry for a mime. Barry gives him the finger that leads to him getting beaten up by the boy's elder brother. Meanwhile, Mike proceeds to the local park followed by the killer. Once there he realises he is being followed and radios for help but it's too late. The killer attacks Mike and stabs him. Barry arrives on bike to find Mike dying. Mike says he loves Barry and gets him to give him a final kiss. Before he dies he tells him to look in the script to see where the killer is hiding out. Barry arrives at a creepy looking house. There he is captured by the killer and tied to a chair. Barry says he knows who he is and proceeds to tell him his back-story: The killer is Philip Quinn. As a child he was made to eat cereal every day. He couldn't do it and in later years developed an inferiority complex about it. He then murdered his parents with a Black and Decker jigsaw and inherited their estate. He surrounded himself with waifs-and-strays that, like him, were hooked on cereal and slowly built up an army of hockey stick carrying box-men. He got a job at the local supermarket to satisfy his desire for cereal but he couldn't stand it when people would buy it for themselves and so he would follow them home and murder them. Philip leaves Barry under the watchful eye of his beautiful sister Antonia. She seduces him and ten seconds later they are lying in bed together post-coitus. Barry handcuffs her to the chair and makes his escape. Outside Barry encounters one of the box-men. He manages to defeat him by jumping on his face, which blows up. Meanwhile, Antonia sounds the alarm which summons a whole army of box-men. They chase him into a room that turns out to be an armoury. He tools-up and proceeds outside to face his adversaries. A gun battle ensues during which Barry discovers that one of the box-men is MI5 undercover agent Nigel Roscoe. The pair join forces to fend off the box-men. After a lengthy action sequence they manage to slaughter the army leading to much splatter and carnage. However, by this point Antonia has escaped and she hurls a knife into Nigel's back killing him. Barry shoots Antonia in the head. Back at the supermarket Philip is working. Barry turns up to catch him but DI Jackson is waiting there to take Barry in. Barry subdues Philip but when Jackson interferes Barry lets Philip go to recapture him elsewhere. He tells Jackson not to follow him and lays chase. In the local park Philip takes Edgar the director hostage and kills him. Barry breaks character, grabs a passing extra and gets her to direct the rest of the film. Barry corners Philip in a playground. The pair have a showdown where they fight it out one-on-one. The fight culminates with Barry shooting Philip in the chest but only after reciting the \\"do you feel lucky\\" speech from Dirty Harry. Philip begs for mercy and says he wants to be Barry's best friend. Barry shoots him in the head. As the police show up to clear up the mess Barry has created he sits forlornly on a park bench. Disillusioned with the police he throws his badge away before rifling through his pockets and pulling out a pin, a police radio and a grenade. Realising too late that the pin was actually from the grenade and it goes off, ending the film.

At the time of the film's production he was a student at the Arts Institute of Bournemouth and would only be able to shoot the film whilst back home during term breaks. The shooting script was only a first draft and not properly formatted. The budget for the film came solely out of Wright's pocket and went mainly on tape stock, props (water pistols painted black), costumes and food colouring. The surprisingly large cast was made up of his friends but he has said he went \\"outside my social circle\\" when it came to filling all the roles the film had to offer. Dead Right contains many early examples of filming techniques that would later become Wright's trademarks such as transitions, whip-pans, wipes, tracking steady-cam shots and dolly zooms. However, there are very few sound effects unlike his later films for example Hot Fuzz where there is a heavy reliance on sound. Both Dead Right and Hot Fuzz were attempts to film a British cop movie in the style of a US cop movie. Wright says \\"There was a little wave of sub-standard British thrillers I used to think were quite pathetic trying to take on the Americans at their own game and failing miserably. That was the germ of the idea . . . to have our cake and eat it by both examining the gulf between British action films and American ones and trying to become more American.\\" References * Hot Fuzz DVD * Am Blam: Making Dead Right * Edgar Wright's Commentary 1993 short films 1993 films British television films British short films British films English- language films Films directed by Edgar Wright Films with screenplays by Edgar Wright ","title":"Dead Right (film)"},{"id":"12836793","text":"John Ridley (26 May 1806 – 25 November 1887) was an English miller, inventor, landowner, investor, farming machinery manufacturer, farmer and preacher who lived in Australia between 1839 and 1853. He is best known for the development, manufacture and invention of \\"Ridley's Stripper\\", a machine that removed the heads of grain, with the threshing being done later by a separate machine. The suburb of Ridleyton in the city of Adelaide, Australia was named for him. Early life Ridley was born near West Boldon, County Durham, England. His father, also John Ridley, was a miller who died when his son was five years old. His mother, Mary (a cousin of John Sr.), carried on the business; when Ridley was 15 years of age he began to share in its management. Ridley had little formal education, but had a love of books and a remarkable memory. He had come across an encyclopaedia soon after he was able to read, and took the greatest interest in the scientific articles which he read and re-read. Science and theology were the great interests of his life. He began preaching at 18, and at 23 was a recognised local preacher in the Sunderland circuit. After his mother's death in 1835, Ridley married Mary Pybus, and in November 1839 sailed for South Australia aboard the Warrior with his wife and two infant children, arriving in Adelaide on 17 April 1840. Career in Australia On arrival in South Australia he bought a piece of land at Hindmarsh close to Adelaide, took over the flour-mill of the South Australian Company, installed the first steam engine (a Watt's Beam) in South Australia able to cut wood and grind meal, and began growing wheat at Hindmarsh. Foreseeing that the heavy spending by governor George Gawler would lead to depression and increased rural production, Ridley let his farm and devoted his time to seeking grain for his mill, purchasing land, and investing in the developing copper-mine at Burra. Being much interested in mechanical inventions, he also spent some time on a horizontal windmill to be used for raising water. It was said of him at this period that if his child cried in the night, his first thought would be how to make an apparatus for rocking the cradle. By 1843 the colony's expanding wheat crop threatened to exceed the capacity of the work force available to harvest it. Ridley gave much time to the problem of devising a mechanical method of harvesting the wheat and building a reaper based on a woodcut in John Claudius Loudon's An Encyclopaedia of Agriculture (3rd ed., London, 1835). In September 1843 the corn exchange committee offered a prize of £40 to anyone submitting a model or plans of a reaper of which the committee would approve. Ridley did not compete because his machine was nearing completion in the factory of John Stokes Bagshaw. On 23 September 1843 it was reported that several models and plans had been submitted, but no machine had been exhibited which the committee felt justified in recommending for general adoption. In October Ridley's machine was ready for its first tests, and a month later a rebuilt machine was successfully tested on his tenant's crop, reaping in a week. On 18 November 1843 the Adelaide Observer announced that \\"a further trial of Mr Ridley's machine has established its success\\". Over the next year he planned the improvement and manufacture of the machine, in 1845 he made seven machines, and by 1850 over 50 machines were operating in the colony and others had been exported. The Ridley stripper received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program. Return to England Although Ridley's returns from the harvesting machine were substantial, they were meagre compared with the dividends from his original shares in the Burra copper-mine, his flour-mill and his land investments. He was in comfortable circumstances, and in 1853 he and his family left Australia for a lengthy journey through Europe. After several years they eventually settled in England where he devoted \\"his eccentric enthusiasm to invention and religion\\". At his own cost he had printed tens of thousands of copies of sermons and tracts that appealed to his principles and distributed them widely to grateful and ungrateful recipients. He was also an energetic lay preacher and made many gifts to evangelical churches and missions. Legacy Ridley died on 25 November 1887 in London and was survived by two daughters. A silver candelabrum, presented to him by old South Australian colonists in 1861, is now at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. He was commemorated in 1933 by the erection of the Ridley Gates at the Adelaide Showgrounds, Wayville. The Adelaide suburb of Ridleyton and Ridley Grove, a thoroughfare in the suburbs of Ferryden Park and Woodville Gardens, were named for him.  Controversy regarding the inventor of the Stripper  For more than 140 years an argument has continued, off and on (and sometimes acrimoniously) over the invention of the South Australian wheat \\"stripper\\". Some, such as G. L. Sutton (1937), have claimed that the real inventor was a farmer, John Wrathall Bull (1804–1886), and that Bull's idea was stolen and then commercially exploited by the Hindmarsh flour-miller John Ridley (1806–1887). Indeed, following Sutton, most modern Australian agricultural and general historians have accepted this view without question, and incorporated it into their own works. Ridley and his supporters, however, always staunchly denied the charge (which was originally laid by J.W. Bull in 1845), insisting that Ridley himself was the sole and unaided inventor. Although it was claimed that the machine was invented in principle by John Wrathall Bull,H. J. Finnis (1966), Bull, John Wrathall (1804–1886), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, Melbourne University Press, p. 175. none disputed that Ridley was its first practical producer. In 1844 he was awarded a special prize by the Agricultural and Horticultural Society and in 1858 he was thanked by the South Australian parliament for a service that had helped to make possible the vast increase of wheat-growing in the province. The rival claims of Bull and Ridley to the title of inventor of the stripper were the subject of long controversy. In 1843 Ridley had the limelight. The controversy was revived in 1875. Supported by influential friends and by mechanics who had made the original harvesting machine, Bull petitioned parliament in 1880 for a grant in recognition of his invention. After long inquiry he was given £250 in 1882 \\"for services in improving agricultural machinery\\". Bull claimed that he was the real inventor of Ridley's reaping machine, his claims are set out in his volume Early Experiences of Colonial Life in South Australia. Bull sent in a model that was rejected by the committee, and his contention was that Ridley had seen his model and constructed his machine on its principles. Ridley, a man of the great probity, denied this, and his denial is borne out by the fact that his machine had had two successful trials within two months of the models being exhibited. In those days a machine could be constructed in Adelaide only by primitive methods, and it would have been virtually impossible to make a machine, overcome all the practical difficulties of adjustment, and have it in working order in so little time. Bull devised an idea for a machine based on the comb and beater principle which reaped and threshed on his Mount Barker farm in 1842. He had the assistance of his good friend, brother-in-law and respected colonist Thomas Hudson Beare to create a working model for exhibition at the Corn Exchange committee meeting in 1843. \\"Having no wish for any personal gain, he donated his design for the good of the colony\\". \\"Much to Bull's surprise, John Ridley, (who exhibited no machine, or any proposals for one, at the Corn Exchange committee meeting), later emerged with a machine which was based on similar principles to those designed by Bull\\". Many other colonists backed Bull in testimonials and letters which appear in his book and also papers of the day. In Ridley's final letter to the Adelaide Register written in 1886, he said that the first suggestion of his machine had come from a notice of a Roman invention given in John Claudius Loudon's Encyclopaedia of Agriculture, and that \\"from no other source whatever did I receive the least help or suggestion\\". Both Bagshaw and John Dunn, who were involved in the manufacture and testing of Ridley's prototype, supported his claim.Cumming, D.

He served with the rank of furir in the first two Swedish UN battalions in Suez- Gaza 1956-1957 as part of UNEF. In Congo, he belonged to Battalion XIIK in 1961. Stålnacke became known during the Congo Crisis for his gallant conduct in action on 14 September 1961. In connection with an attack on a weapons depot two of his comrades were shocked and Stålnacke advanced by himself against an enemy firing position, armed with a Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. He took out an enemy armored car and a number of enemies before his jaw was shot to pieces. His chin hung down to his chest and he was suffocating. With his fingers he cleared the neck free from bone fragments and was thereby able to breath again. During the retreat, and with whistling bullets around him, Stålnacke kept his chin up with one hand and held the recoilless rifle with the other and managed with hand gestures and kicks get his two badly shocked comrades from the battlefield. Because of fightings around the Italian Red Cross hospital in the center of Élisabethville, the ambulance could not drive all the way to it. The last hundred meters Stålnacke and his comrades had to run to the hospital under the protection of the house walls. The Italian chief medical director Giuseppe Cipolat who initiated the treatment of Stålnacke in Élisabethville, said to colonel Jonas Wærn: \\"I served as a field medic in World War II, including the desert battles of Tobruk, and have taken care of wounded soldiers from many countries but I have never met a soldier who showed such courage and willpower as Torsten Stålnacke did.\\" Stålnacke was awarded the Vasa Medal on 10 May 1962 for his bravery. Until spring 1963, Stålnacke had undergone 18 operations. All in all he underwent 33 operations for his injuries at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm. Though he was never fully recovered, he served in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus during the years 1965 to 1968.

Reactive materials are similar to insensitive high explosives, but are usually thermite-like pyrotechnic compositions of two or more nonexplosive solid materials, which stay inert and do not react with each other until subjected to a sufficiently strong mechanical, electrical or laser stimulus, after which they undergo fast burning or explosion with release of high amount of chemical energy in addition to their kinetic energy. Fragments or projectiles made of such materials have therefore greater damaging effect than inert ones, with expected lethality increase up to 500%. The material classes under investigation are thermites, intermetallic compounds, metal-polymer mixtures (e.g., magnesium/teflon/viton-like), metastable intermolecular composites (MIC), matrix materials, and hydrides. These materials must be strong enough to act as structural components, be sufficiently stable to survive handling and launch, to penetrate a target, and sufficiently unstable to reliably ignite on impact. The mixtures under investigation include one or more finely powdered (down to nanoparticle size) metalloids or metals like aluminium, magnesium, zirconium, titanium, tungsten, tantalum, uraniumPatents https://www.google.fr/patents/US7191709 and https://www.google.fr/patents/US7194961 make explicit reference to the use of uranium or hafnium, with one or more oxidizers like teflon or other fluoropolymer, pressed or sintered or bonded by other method to a compact, high-density mass. To achieve a suitable reaction rate and insensitivity to impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge, fuel particles have sizes usually between 1-250 μm. A standard composition is aluminium-teflon (Al- PTFE). Metals which can form intermetallic compounds by an exothermic reaction are another class of candidate materials. An example is a laminate of thin alternating layers of aluminum and nickel, commercially available as NanoFoil. The RM weapons under development include an active protection system defensive grenade for intercepting incoming missiles or grenades and detonating them at a safe distance, and the BattleAxe warhead that covers a wide area with RM fragments with devastating results to soft targets, while the unexploded fragments left behind have very low lethality versus conventional cluster bomb remains. Under research are materials with high mechanical strength, high density, high energy density, and which can rapidly convert from a consolidated structural material to fine powder with large surface area, be dispersed and then ignited to produce a large thermobaric blast. A palladium- clad aluminum wire, known under trademark Pyrofuze, is used as a pyrotechnic initiator. Reactive materials also have non-weapon uses. Thin layers of reactive materials, clad with a solder, are used for reactive bonding, e.g., in electronics, or for brazing, such as in composite armor plates.

The Centre is now known as the Monash Bioethics Centre. It focusses on the branch of ethics known as bioethics, a field relating to biological science and medicine. It was founded in October 1980 by Professors Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse,http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/51/xhtml/chapter12a.html#chapter12sec16 as the first centre in Australia devoted to bioethics, and one of the first in the world. It became well known during the 1980s as one of the leading bodies studying the ethical implications of the rapid advances in science and technology, such as in-vitro fertilisation. The Centre's founder, Peter Singer, is probably the world's best-known bioethicist, and while Director of the Centre, he produced a number of ground-breaking publications in the field. This included The Reproduction Revolution, Should the Baby Live? and Practical Ethics. He also founded the journal Bioethics with Helga Kuhse, and established the International Association for Bioethics. Today, it continues its strong focus on research, but also provides undergraduate, postgraduate and industry-based education. It undertakes extensive teaching to health professionals. It is particularly well known for its Master of Bioethics degree, founded in 1989 as one of the first of its kind in the world. In June 2014, the length of this course was increased to become a two-year full-time course. The current Director of the Centre is Professor Catherine Mills. Previous to this, Professor Michael Selgelid was Director, also preceded by Associate Professor Justin Oakley, a virtue ethicist who was one of the first graduates of the Centre's Master of Bioethics program. In addition to their teaching and research commitments, staff from the Centre also carry out consultancy work for numerous government bodies and law reform agencies, including the World Health Organization. The Centre has been influential in shaping public debate on issues such as assisted reproduction, surrogate motherhood, and end-of-life decision-making. The Centre is also home to the Monash Bioethics Review, the only peer-reviewed bioethics journal in Australia. The Centre is part of an international network established by the University of Tokyo to promote collaborative research and teaching links between eight of the world's leading bioethics centres, including the Hastings Centre in New York and the Ethox Centre at Oxford University.

Description and Table of Contents. . are derived by aggregating microeconomic models allowing economists to test them with both macroeconomic and microeconomic data. The study of microfoundations is gaining popularity even outside the field of economics, recent development includes operation management and project studies. History Critics of the Keynesian theory of macroeconomics argued that some of Keynes' assumptions were inconsistent with standard microeconomics. For example, Milton Friedman's microeconomic theory of consumption over time (the 'permanent income hypothesis') suggested that the marginal propensity to consume (the increase of consumer spending with increased income) due to temporary income, which is crucial for the Keynesian multiplier, was likely to be much smaller than Keynesians assumed. For this reason, many empirical studies have attempted to measure the marginal propensity to consume, and macroeconomists have also studied alternative microeconomic models (such as models of credit market imperfections and precautionary saving) that might imply a greater marginal propensity to consume.Angus Deaton (1992), Understanding Consumption, Oxford University Press. Description and chapter-preview links. . One particularly influential endorsement of the study of microfoundations was Robert Lucas, Jr.'s critique of traditional macroeconometric forecasting models. After the apparent shift of the Phillips curve relationship during the 1970s, Lucas argued that the correlations between aggregate variables observed in macroeconomic data would tend to change whenever macroeconomic policy changed. This implied that microfounded models are more appropriate for predicting the effect of policy changes, using the assumption that changes of macroeconomic policy do not alter the microeconomics of the macroeconomy. 'The Smets-Wouters model': ECB webpage with discussion of advantages of microfounded macroeconomic models Controversy Some, such as Alan Kirman and S. Abu Turab Rizvi, argue on the basis of the Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem that the microfoundations project has failed. Jackson and Leelat (2017) show that representative agents do not exist for most commonly used demand functions. As a consequence, welfare implications based on representative agent models need not hold for individuals in an economy. This further implies that current macroeconomic models based on representative agents are not factually micro-founded. Much of the contemporary macroeconomic research, therefore, is not based on simple representative agents, but they often allow for rich heterogeneity of agents' behavior.

She inspired many of his poems and bore him nine children, three of whom survived into adulthood. Biography Born in Mauchline, Ayrshire in 1765, Jean Armour was second oldest of the eleven children of stonemason James Armour (died 1798) and Mary Smith Armour. She met Robert Burns on a drying green in Mauchline around 1784 when she chased his dog away from her laundry. According to Armour's testimony in 1827, she met Burns again at a local dance. By the time Burns's first illegitimate child, Elizabeth \\"Bess\\" Burns (1785 - 1817), was born to Elizabeth Paton (1760 - c. 1799) on 22 May 1785, he and Jean Armour were in a relationship, and by the end of the year she was pregnant with his child. Her announcement, in March 1786, that she was expecting Robert Burns's baby caused her father to faint. The certificate of an informal marriage agreement between Burns and Armour was probably mutilated by the lawyer Robert Aiken at James Armour behest and he removed his daughter to Paisley to prevent local scandal. However, word had spread and the Mauchline Kirk recalled her on 10 June 1786, to admit that she was unmarried and pregnant and to confirm the name of the baby's father. Burns was called on 25 June to also admit his part in the affair. His letters from this period indicate that he intended to marry Jean Armour as soon as they realised she was pregnant, but had been discouraged by her reluctance to disobey her father's disapproval of the union. Additionally, at this point, Burns was romantically involved with 'Highland' Mary Campbell (1763 - 1786), who was also allegedly pregnant by him, and was considering a move to Jamaica. The emigration fell through and Mary died in October 1786 before she could give birth. Believing he had been abandoned by Jean Armour, he set about having himself declared single again and transferred his property to his brother Gilbert Burns (1760 - 1827) in anticipation of a move. Believing that he was about to abscond, James Armour issued a warrant against him and Burns effectively went into hiding that summer - staying at the home of his aunt, the mother of his successful first cousin, Alexander Allan - when coincidentally his first volume of poetry, commonly called the \\"Kilmarnock Edition\\" was published. Jean remained with her parents in the village of Mauchline, and Robert in the farm at Mossgiel. The couple continued to live apart even after the birth of their twins Robert (1786 - 1857) and Jean on 3 September 1786 and following the success of The Kilmarnock Edition, Burns moved temporarily to Edinburgh. He returned intermittently to Mauchline, during which time Jean became pregnant by him again. When Burns returned permanently on 23 February 1788 he found Jean was destitute and had been expelled from the family home. They reconciled their relationship, and Burns found her a place to stay. On 3 March she went into labour and delivered a second set of twins, two girls, one of whom died on 10 March, the other on 22 March. In the light of Burns's new-found celebrity as a poet, James Armour relented and allowed his daughter to be married to him. Although their marriage was registered on 5 August 1788 in Mauchline, the parish records describe them as having been \\"irregularly married some years ago\\". She and Burns moved to Ellisland Farm where they stayed until 1791 when they moved to Dumfries, where both would live for the rest of their lives. Jean Armour and Robert Burns had nine children together (he had at least another four by other women), the last of whom was born on the day of his funeral in July 1796. Her widowhood and the straitened circumstances in which she found herself after Burns's death attracted national attention and a charitable fund was collected for her and the children. She outlived her husband by 38 years, and lived to see his name become celebrated throughout the world. Twenty years after his death, his fame had reached such a point that his remains were removed from their modest grave in St Michael's Kirkyard, Dumfries, and placed in a specially commissioned mausoleum. Here, Jean Armour was buried when she died in 1834. Statues of Jean were erected in Mauchline in 2002, and in Dumfries, opposite St Michael's Kirk, in 2004.

Licensed to Gorham, Maine, United States, it serves southern Maine, including Portland. Established in 1980 as WDCI, the station is owned by Robert Bittner through licensee Blue Jey Broadcasting Co., and is simulcast with WLAM (1470 AM). History The station went on the air March 3, 1980 as WDCI on 1590. In the intervening years, the station would change its call letters to WASY and then WJBQ, the latter after coming into common ownership with WLAM and WKZS (99.9 FM; now WTHT). WJBQ moved to the 870 frequency in 1988; on this position, the station became WKZN on November 28, 1989, and then swapped call letters with WLAM on December 26, 1990; the two stations eventually began simulcasting a standards format. Wireless Talking Machine Company sold WLAM, 1470 (by then WZOU), and WLAM-FM (106.7 FM, which had launched in 1996 as an FM simulcast of the stations; it is now WXTP), along with 99.9 (by then WMWX) and WTHT (107.5 FM; now WFNK) to Harron Communications, then-owner of WMTW-TV, in 1999. On May 7, 2001, Harron converted 870 and 106.7 to news/talk as WMTW. The WLAM call letters were then returned to 1470, which initially retained the standards format; on November 26, the station was switched to a simulcast of WMTW; shortly afterwards, talk programming was removed from the stations in favor of an all-news format, mainly from the Associated Press's All-News Radio service. After Harron sold its Maine radio stations to Nassau Broadcasting Partners in 2004, Newsradio WMTW was discontinued. Nassau also introduced three separate formats to the stations. with WMTW switching to progressive talk from Air America Radio under the call letters WLVP. Nassau first attempted to convert WLVP to ESPN Radio in September 2004; this sparked listener protest, prompting Nassau to initially postpone the format change to November 8 before canceling it entirely. However, after significant changes occurred at Air America (including the departure of Al Franken), the station began airing ESPN Radio on June 1, 2007, resulting in WLVP and WLAM once again airing the same programming. WLVP and WLAM dropped ESPN Radio on February 2, 2009 and switched to oldies. In conjunction with the change, the stations began to simulcast WCSH's morning and early evening newscasts, a move made to continue the newscasts' availability via radio even after the station's own 87.7 MHz audio is discontinued following the shutdown of analog television signals. Initially locally programmed, in early 2010 WLVP and WLAM became affiliates of The True Oldies Channel. Additionally, on August 2, the station added The Jeff Santos Show from WWZN in Boston (marking a partial return to progressive talk programming); this in effect took WLVP's morning drive programming back to a news/talk format, as Santos' program immediately follows the simulcast of WCSH's morning newscast. The stations' format was modified once more on August 6, 2011, when sports talk was readded to the weekend schedule via locally- produced shows from the Maine Sports Network (which previously provided some weekend programming to WJJB-FM). WLVP, along with 16 other Nassau stations in northern New England, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by WBIN Media Company, a company controlled by Bill Binnie, on May 22, 2012. Binnie already owned WBIN-TV in Derry, New Hampshire. The deal was completed on November 30, 2012. On December 9, 2015, Binnie agreed to sell WLAM and WLVP to Blue Jey Broadcasting Company, controlled by Bob Bittner, for $135,000; the deal made WLVP a sister station to WJTO in Bath. The sale to Blue Jey Broadcasting was consummated on February 17, 2016. Upon takeover of WLVP and WLAM, the simulcast of WCSH news programming was discontinued.

She was designed by Sir William Rule, and was the only ship built to her draught. Purportedly as originally built she was a near copy of the famed first rate , Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar. During the Napoleonic Wars, she was used as the flagship of the Admiral the Duke of Clarence (later King William IV). She took part in the bombardment of Algiers in 1816 under the command of Admiral David Milne where she was second in the order of battle. In the attack on Algiers, Impregnable, isolated from the other ships was a large and tempting target, attracting attention from the Algerian gunners who raked her fore and aft, she was severely damaged. 268 shots hit the hull, the main mast was damaged in 15 places. Impregnable lost Mr. John Hawkins, midshipman, 37 seamen, 10 marines and 2 boys killed and Mr. G. N. Wesley, Mr. Henry Quinn, 111 seamen, 21 marines, 9 sappers and miners and 17 boys wounded. The Impregnable saw little further action, apart from a short commission in the Mediterranean, and in 1819 she was placed in the Reserve Fleet at Devonport. From May 1839 to October 1841 she had relieved as the Commander-in-Chief's flagship moored at the entrance to the Hamoaze. She then saw service again in the Mediterranean until May 1843, when she was once again laid up with the reserve fleet at Devonport. Quarterdeck of HMS Impregnable circa 1853 Impregnable was rated as a training ship in 1862Ships of the Old Navy, Impregnable. and removed from the reserve fleet to begin service at Devonport training boy seamen for the Royal Navy. On 27 September 1886, Impregnable was replaced by HMS Howe which was renamed HMS Bulwark as she became a training ship. The old Impregnable ended her days first as a tender to HMS Indus and then on 9 November 1888 she was renamed HMS Kent to be used as a hulk in the event of an epidemic. On that date, her name, Impregnable, was given to HMS Bulwark (the former HMS Howe), still serving at Devonport. Three years later on 22 September 1891, she was once again re-named, this time HMS Caledonia, and became a Scottish boys training / school ship moored at Queensferry in the Firth of Forth. As HMS Caledonia, she was to spend the next 15 years at anchor in the Firth of Forth as a training ship for boys. The ship was divided up for training by decks: The Upper Deck was used exclusively for sail drill, gunnery and recreation. The Main and Middle decks were used for seamanship classes and instruction. The Lower and Orlop decks were devoted to living and sleeping spaces. The training ship accommodated 190 Officers and men as well as 800 boys. Instruction covered boat pulling, sailing & gunnery. It was hoped that this form of training would instil in the boys the qualities of resourcefulness, courage and self-reliance. Theoretical instruction was undertaken in the 'Schoolroom'. This room could accommodate 200 boys at once and often did. The 200 boys were broken down into classes of 15 - 20.HMS Caledonia - the Royal Naval Engineering School - a short history\\" by Lieutenants KP Hunter & RJ Rogers, RN: Commander the Hon.

Internet censorship Government-mandated Internet censorship is nonexistent due to the house of representatives speaking out against filtering on multiple occasions, although there have been proposals to filter child pornography and the Netherlands, like many countries, is grappling with how to prevent or control copyright infringement on the Internet. Internet filtering in the Netherlands is not classified by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI). =Child pornography= In 2008 Ernst Hirsch Ballin, then Minister of Justice, proposed a plan to regulate the blocking of websites known to contain child pornography. A blacklist would have been composed by the Meldpunt ter bestrijding van Kinderpornografie op Internet (hotline combating child pornography on the Internet)\\"The Dutch Hotline\\" , Hotline combating Child Pornography on the Internet and used by Internet service providers to redirect the websites to a stop page. The blacklist would contain websites hosted in nations where the Dutch authorities had no means of tracking and prosecution. Situations such as the blocking of Wikipedia would have been avoided, according to the working group behind the filter.(Dutch) Workgroup for blocking child pornography (English translation) Under the proposal, stop pages were to be hosted by individual providers, an example being UPC Netherlands. The pages would not log traffic since they were not being used as a tracking mechanism; rather, their use would be for private parties to contribute to combating the spreading of child pornography. This plan never gained traction and was only backed by UPC and an orthodox Protestant provider of filtered internet services, Kliksafe.(Dutch) \\"UPC en Kliksafe zijn daadwerkelijk overgegaan tot blokkeren (Click Safe and UPC have actually proceeded to block)\\", Adoption of the budget statement of the Ministry of Justice (VI) for the year 2008, Verheid.nl: The guide to all government information and services Providers would not be forced to use it since that would be unconstitutional according to a research done by the governmental Scientific Research and Documentation Center (WODC) commissioned by the Ministry of Security and Justice.(Dutch) \\"KLPD: Child pornography filter inept and unconstitutional\\" (English translation), Andreas Udo de Haes, WebWereld (IDG Netherlands), 16 September 2008\\"Filtering and blocking of child pornographic material on the Internet: Technical and legal possibilities in the Netherlands and other countries\\", Stol, W. Ph., Kaspersen, H.W.K., Kerstens, J., Leukfeldt, E.R., Lodder, A.R., WODC, Research and Documentation Centre, Ministry of Security and Justice In 2010 a report was released by the Werkgroep Blokkeren Kinderporno (working group for blocking child pornography).(Dutch) \\"Progress blocking child pornography\\", Working group for blocking child pornography, 18 November 2010 It compared the filter in its last form with information from the Internet Watch Foundation. While they had \\"much wider criteria\\", the number of websites on the block list went from 2000 in previous years to less than 400 in 2010. The report stated that in the Dutch situation this would mean an \\"almost complete lack of websites to block\\" because the sharing of the material was no longer done by conventional websites, but by other services. In 2011 the plan was pulled by Ivo Opstelten for this reason.(Dutch) \\"Dutch internet filtering off track\\" (English translation), Rene Schoemaker, WebWereld (IDG Netherlands), 7 March 2011 The House of Representatives reaffirmed this by voting against the filter later that year, effectively killing any plans for government censorship.(Dutch) \\"Politiek zegt 'nee' tegen internetfilter\\" (\\"Politics says no to internet filter\\") (English translation), Joost Schellevis, Tweakers.net, 18 May 2011 =Copyright infringement= In January 2012, the internet providers Ziggo and XS4ALL were required by a court order in a case brought by the Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland (BREIN) to block the website of The Pirate Bay due to copyright infringement.(Dutch) Ziggo en XS4ALL moeten toegang The Pirate Bay blokkeren\\" (Ziggo and XS4all required to block The Pirate Bay) (English translation), NU.nl, Netherlands Sanoma media group, 11 January 2012 This blocking raised questions within the government, customers, and the internet providers themselves, not only because of the blocking, but also about its randomness and the role of BREIN, an industry trade association that can change the blacklist.(Dutch) \\"Brein speelt voor eigen rechter\\" (BREIN plays for itself) (English translation), NU.nl, Netherlands Sanoma media group, 24 January 2012 The Pirate Bay called BREIN a corrupt organization,(Dutch) \\"The Pirate Bay noemt Brein corrupte organisatie\\" (Pirate Bay calls BREIN a corrupt organization) (English translation), NU.nl, Netherlands Sanoma media group, 12 January 2012 while the government is mostly concerned about freedom of speech and privacy.(Dutch) \\"Kamer eist opheldering over Pirate Bay-blokkades\\" (House requires explanation about Pirate Bay blockades) (English translation), NU.nl, Netherlands Sanoma media group, 18 January 2012 In May 2012, the Internet providers KPN, UPC, T-Mobile, and Tele2 were also required to block The Pirate Bay.(Dutch) \\"Ook andere providers moeten The Pirate Bay blokkeren\\" (English translation: \\"Other providers must block The Pirate Bay\\"), Joost Schellevis, Tweakers.net, 10 May 2012 However, in January 2014, a court overturned the initial verdict and ruled that Ziggo and XS4ALL no longer have to block The Pirate Bay.(Dutch) \\"Ziggo en Xs4all hoeven The Pirate Bay niet langer te blokkeren\\", Joost Schellevis, Tweakers.net, 28 January 2014 BREIN has since moved to an appeal with the Hoge Raad, the highest court in the Netherlands, arguing that the ruling is in violation of European law.(Dutch) \\"BREIN stelt cassatie in bij de Hoge Raad tegen de afwijzing van blokkering The Pirate Bay\\", BREIN website, 21 February 2014 A month later, UPC unblocked access to the site following an agreement with BREIN.(Dutch) \\"UPC heft blokkade The Pirate Bay op\\", Joost Schellevis, Tweakers.net, 19 February 2014 As of September 2017, Ziggo and XS4All are once again ordered to block The Pirate Bay, this time by the Dutch Court. Other providers now also need to block the Pirate Bay. Network neutrality In June 2011 the Dutch House of Representatives voted for network neutrality enforced by law. The revised Telecommunicatiewet (\\"Telecommunications Act\\") was formally ratified by the Senate in May 2012. Among other things the law prohibits the blocking of Internet content.(Dutch) \\"Netneutraliteit opgenomen in Telecomwet\\" (Net neutrality included in new Telecommunications Act) (English translation), NU.nl, Sanoma Media Netherlands Group, 22 June 2011 Data retention In accordance with European Union directive 2006/24/EC providers had to store information about internet traffic.

He was selected to represent Australia and Queensland during his career, which he spent playing for the Gold Coast Seagulls, St. George Dragons and the St. George Illawarra Dragons in Australia and the Castleford Tigers in England. Bartrim primarily played his club career as a , but played his representative career as a . Background Born in Hat Head, New South Wales on 9 October 1971, Bartrim played his junior football in Kempsey, New South Wales. Playing career =1990s= Bartrim was graded with the Gold Coast Seagulls in 1992 and made 76 appearances for the club. By 1994 he'd become the club's highest point scorer with 224 points, and in a match that season against the Eastern Suburbs Roosters scored a club record of 20 points. He joined the St George Dragons in 1995 and in his seven-year career with the club was the Dragons' highest point scorer in seasons 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. He was one of the senior players at the time of the merger with the Illawarra Steelers and captained the club on a number of occasions. Bartrim made his début for Queensland as a hooker in the Paul Vautin-coached 1995 State of Origin series side full of inexperienced unknowns, due to many Queensland regulars being declared unavailable due to the Super League war. His eligibility for Queensland was later questioned, though, with his only link to the state seemingly being his tenure at the Gold Coast Seagulls, who were at that time based in Tweed Heads, New South Wales anyway. Nonetheless, Bartrim kicked a penalty goal in Game I, which turned out to be the only points scored in Queensland's upset 2-0 victory. He stayed on as hooker and goal-kicker in all matches of Queensland shock 3-0 whitewash of that Origin series. Bartrim debuted for Australia in the first Test of the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium, and appeared in two Tests of that series (won 3-0 by the Australians), scoring a try in the second game at the Sydney Football Stadium. Injury forced him to miss the final game of the series and he was replaced by 1994 Kangaroos backup hooker Jim Serdaris. At the end of the 1995 ARL season Bartrim was in Australia's squad for the 1995 Rugby League World Cup played in England and made two appearances in games against England (at the famous Wembley Stadium in the opening game of the tournament, won 20-16 by the host nation). He also played in the Kangaroos 86-6 win over South Africa in Gateshead. Bartrim was again Queensland's starting hooker in Game I of the 1996 State of Origin series but was kept out of the rest of that year's series by Steve Walters in the hooking role. He played in the Dragons' 1996 Grand Final loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles where he kicked two goals. Bartrim's 176 points scored in 1996 with St George are the most ever scored by a lock in a New South Wales Rugby League season. Following the 1996 Grand Final, he also played from the bench in a Test against Papua New Guinea at the Lloyd Robson Oval in Port Moresby, scoring two tries. He returned for all three games of the 1997 series (when Super League-aligned players were again unavailable) and Games I and II of the 1998 series playing at Lock, Hooker, the , or off the interchange bench. In total, he played nine games and kicked eleven goals in his Origin career. He played at lock forward for the Dragons in their 1999 NRL Grand Final loss to the Melbourne Storm. =2000s= Bartrim left St George at the end of the 2001 season to play two years in England with the Castleford Tigers. He set the Castleford club's record for most goals in a season with 115 scored in 2002. Whilst at Castleford Tigers Bartrim proved an excellent signing. In 2002 he scored a vital try in a game against Salford to get the tigers into the play offs. In 2003 Bartrim was injured for most of the season, ]. Bartrim left the club at the end of the 2003 season.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 () At the end of 2003, Bartrim returned to Australia to settle in Hat Head and was the Macleay Valley Mustangs' captain-coach in the NSW Group 2 competition in 2004 and 2005. In 2006 he moved to Brisbane and played with the Noosa Pirates in the Sunshine Coast Rugby League competition in 2006 and 2007. He is married and has 4 children.

He appeared in more than 60 films between 1926 and 1962, as well as directing 20 films between 1933 and 1962. Life and career Haas was born in Brno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), and died in Vienna, Austria from complications of asthma. He and his brother, Pavel Haas, studied voice at the Brno Conservatory under composer Leoš Janáček. Pavel Haas went on to become a noted composer himself before he was killed in Auschwitz in 1944. =Czechoslovak theater and film= After graduating from the conservatory in 1920, Hugo Haas began acting at the National Theater in Brno, in Ostrava and in Olomouc. In 1924 he moved to Prague and regularly appeared at the Vinohrady Theatre,Z. Sílová, R. Hrdinová, A. Kožíková, V. Mohylová : Divadlo na Vinohradech 1907–2007 – Vinohradský ansámbl, published by Vinohrady Theatre, Prague, 2007, p. 192, where he remained until 1929. In 1930,Kolektiv autorů: Národní divadlo a jeho předchůdci, Academia, Prague, 1988, p. 128 Karel Hugo Hilar made Hugo Haas a member of the Prague National Theatre drama company, where he remained until his emigration in 1939. One of his most highly acclaimed roles was as Doctor Galén in The White Disease, which Karel Čapek had written especially for him. His final role at the National Theater was as Director Busman in Čapek's R.U.R. Hugo Haas made his film debut as Notary Voborský in the silent film Jedenácté přikázání (The Eleventh Commandment) in 1923. (Twelve years later he played the same role again in Jedenácté přikázání directed by Martin Frič.) With the advent of sound film, Haas was able to apply his comedic talent in Svatopluk Innemann's Muži v offsidu in 1931. By 1938 Haas had acted in some thirty films. In 1936 he directed his first film, Camel Through the Eye of a Needle (co-directed with Otakar Vávra). He later directed Kvočna (the film score was composed by his brother Pavel), The White Disease and Co se šeptá. His final comedy in Czechoslovakia was Miroslav Cikán's Andula Won, which appeared in cinemas in 1938. =Emigration= Following the 1938 Munich Agreement and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in early 1939, Hugo Haas was dismissed from the National Theater due to his Jewish origin. In April he and his wife, Maria von Bibikoff (\\"Bibi\\"), fled via Paris, Spain, and then from the port of Lisbon, Portugal, to the port of New York in October-November 1940. Their son, Ivan, was taken in by his brother Pavel. Hugo Haas' father Lipmann (Zikmund) Haas and brother Pavel died at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. =United States= By the mid-1940s, Hugo Haas had become a character actor in American films. In 1951 he launched a successful if unacclaimed career as a film director in Hollywood with a string of B movie melodramas, usually starring blonde actresses in the role of a predatory mantrap. Haas usually cast himself as the male lead in the films although the female role almost always dominated the storyline and was usually exclusively promoted on film posters. His work also includes a touching human drama, The Girl on the Bridge (1951) – which he co-wrote, directed and starred in – about a kindly watchmaker who after having lost his wife and family in the Holocaust, befriends, marries, and raises a second family with a young woman he saves from suicide. Cleo Moore starred in six films for Haas, becoming a well-known film star in that era. Other actresses who starred in Haas' films were Beverly Michaels and Carol Morris. The Haas pictures generally received poor reviews but were for the most part commercially successful, and on occasion featured such well-known names as Eleanor Parker, John Agar, Vince Edwards, Joan Blondell, Agnes Moorehead, Julie London, Corinne Griffith, and Marie Windsor. Haas' final film, Paradise Alley, was rejected by the major studios and sat unreleased for over three years, finally surfacing in a limited run in 1962. =Return to Europe= In the late 1950s Hugo Haas returned to Europe. After a brief stay in Italy, he settled in Vienna in 1961, where he made occasional appearances on television. Except for a brief visit during the centennial celebrations for the National Theater in Prague in 1963, he never returned to his homeland.

His best season was , when he batted .321 in 22 games for the Cubs, the team with which he played nearly his entire career. In Game 6 of the 1945 World Series against the Tigers, with the game tied 7-7, he had a pinch-hit single with one out in the 12th inning; a pinch runner, Bill Schuster, later scored on a walk-off double off the bat of Stan Hack to give the Cubs an 8–7 win, sending the Series to a seventh game. Early life Secory was born in Mason City, Iowa, and moved in his youth to Michigan; he graduated from Western Michigan College with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1936. After making his debut with the Tigers, having one at bat in 1940, he was waived by the team and selected by the Reds. His career was sidetracked, however, when he fractured his leg sliding into home on May 10 of the following year while with the Syracuse Chiefs, as he had been expected to shortly be promoted to the Reds. Despite missing three months, he ended the season with a .329 batting average and 15 runs batted in in 31 games.1942 National League Green Book, p. 44. After his major league career ended with the Cubs in 1946, he became an umpire in the West Texas–New Mexico League in 1948 and the Texas League from 1949 to 1951.1970 National League Green Book, p. 30. Career Secory became a National League (NL) umpire from 1952 to 1970, and worked in the World Series in 1957, 1959, 1964 and 1969, serving as crew chief in 1964. He also officiated in the All-Star Game in 1955, 1958, 1961 (second game), 1964, 1967 and 1970. He was the second base umpire on May 26, 1959, when Harvey Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates pitched a perfect game for 12 innings before allowing a baserunner and losing in the 13th; he was again at second base on June 21, 1964, when Jim Bunning pitched a perfect game for the Philadelphia Phillies, the first official regular-season perfect game since 1922.Coberly, p. 127. In all, Secory umpired in nine official no-hitters in his career, which set an NL record for umpires and was then one short of the major league record held by Silk O'Loughlin. Secory tied Bob Emslie's NL record of eight no-hitters on May 1, 1969 when he worked second base in Don Wilson's 4-0 gem;Coberly, p. 146. after Augie Donatelli also tied the record later that year, Secory broke it by working in his ninth no-hitter on June 12, 1970, officiating at first base in Dock Ellis' 2-0 win.Coberly, p. 151. After Secory's retirement, Donatelli tied his record in 1972, and Tom Gorman tied it in 1976 before Paul Pryor broke it upon working in his 10th no-hitter in 1978. Secory was also behind the plate on May 26, 1956, when three Cincinnati Reds pitchers held the Milwaukee Braves hitless for nine innings before losing in the 10th; it was the first time in major league history that multiple pitchers combined to throw nine innings without allowing a hit.Coberly, p. 103. He was again at second base for the second game of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium on May 31, 1964, between the New York Mets and the San Francisco Giants, when the two teams battled for 23 innings before the Giants won 8-6, setting a record for the longest game ever at 7 hours 23 minutes.

In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History Synagogue in Hashmonaim According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from several Palestinian villages/towns nearby in order to construct Hashmonaim: *945 dunams from Ni'lin,Ni’lin Town Profile, ARIJ, p. 17 *186 dunams from Al-Midya,Al Midya Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 *5 dunams from Saffa.Saffa village profile, ARIJ, p. 17 Under Israeli legal rulings, this territory was claimed as unoccupied state land by the prior sovereign entity, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and thus passed to the subsequent sovereign entity in occupation, the state of Israel. Construction of the first homes began in December 1983. A dedication ceremony on June 12, 1984, was attended by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the Sephardi chief rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu. The first families moved in on August 1987. The name derives from the location of Hashmonaim in a region where the Hasmoneans lived in antiquity.Ayalon Valley - On the Maccabee trail Hashmonaim originally consisted of two neighborhoods: Ramat Modi'in was established in 1983 and Ganei Modi'in in 1985. In 1996, Ganei Modi'in became part of Modi'in Illit. In May 2010, three homes in Hashmonaim were demolished by Israeli security forces. The buildings were deemed to be violating a 10-month construction freeze in the West Bank. Demographics In 2010, there were 545 families living in Hashmonaim. Around 50% of the residents are native English speakers. Most are members of the religious Zionist community. Many residents commute to jobs in the United States or work for American companies. Status under international law Like all Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, the international community considers Hashmonaim to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory and are as such illegal under customary international law. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories.

The community also has a clubhouse for young people, a separate Bnei Akiva branch, two basketball courts, a baseball field, playgrounds, a library and a fitness center.

In 1825, the ship returned with the bodies of King Kamehameha II and the Queen Kamāmalu, who had died on a trip to London. Ship's artist Robert Dampier painted a portrait of the ten-year-old princess, dressed in a red feather cloak for the state funeral. Nāhiʻenaʻena was in love with her brother Kamehameha IIIHaley, James L., Captive Paradise: A History of Hawaii p. 78, 2014, and the chiefs strongly encouraged their marriage, but the missionaries were opposed to the union, calling it incest and therefore a sin. The practice of marriage between siblings in the royal family was considered a way of keeping the bloodlines pure in ancient Hawaii. Nāhiʻenaʻena's own maternal grandparents were half sister and brother. The missionary culture at the time meant that many people, including Nāhiʻenaʻena, practiced both Hawaiian and Christian beliefs. She practiced cultural traditions such as hula, but also drank rum just as the missionaries did. However, she showed rebellion and distaste for many Christian tasks. She would interrupt church services and openly defy missionary teachings. Although she and many others were fragmented on beliefs, she never fully converted. On her death bed, missionary wives tried to urge her to repent for her sins. She was eventually betrothed to William Pitt Leleiohoku I, the son of William Pitt Kalanimoku, Prime Minister of Hawaii. Kamehameha III tried to delay the wedding by insisting Leleiohoku be educated first. Leleiohoku and Nāhiʻenaʻena were married November 25, 1835 by William Richards at Waineʻe Church.  Death  On September 17, 1836 Nāhiʻenaʻena gave birth to a child. Kamehameha III announced that the child would be the heir to the throne because he believed it to be his, but the child lived for only a few hours. Nāhiʻenaʻena never recovered physically or emotionally from the birth of her child. British physician Thomas Charles Byde Rooke, the husband of High Chiefess Grace Kamaʻikuʻi, examined her but was unable to determine the cause of the illness. He called upon Dr. Ruschenberger, a visiting surgeon, to assist him. Nāhiʻenaʻena died three and half months after giving birth, near Hale Uluhe, the home of her brother, Kamehameha III. Although tradition holds that Nāhiʻenaʻena died on , the actual date of her death is described in the notes of the visiting American naturalist John Kirk Townsend as having been . Townsend wrote on January 3, 1837 that he met with the King and found him \\"suffering great distress of mind on account of the extreme illness of his favorite and only sister, the princess Harieta Nahienaena\\" and \\"While we were yet conversing with the king, a messenger came to say that she was worse, and desired to see him.\\" A few days later, on January 6, 1837, he wrote \\"Yesterday the Princess Harieta died. Scarcely was the circumstance known in the town, when it was announced to all by the most terrific and distressing crying and wailing amongst all ranks and classes of people.\\" Later that month, on January 27, 1837, Townsend paid his respects at the princess's casket and described the plaque upon it as saying \\"Harieta Nahienaena, aged 22 years, died on the 30th of December, in the year of our Lord, 1836\\" and then goes on to say \\"This appears like a contradiction. It is stated on the coffin plate, that the princess died on the 30th of December, when it did not actually occur until the 5th of January. This is accounted for, by the peculiar, and in some measure, reasonable doctrine of the Sandwich Islanders, that a person experiences two deaths; one of the mind, and another of the body. Now the mind of the princess died, i.e., became deranged, on the 30th of December, although her body did not die until the 5th of January.\\"Townsend, John Kirk. Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains, to the Columbia River, and a Visit to the Sandwich Islands, Chili, &c.; Perkins & Marvin Publishers, Merrihew & Thompson Printers 1839 After nearly five weeks of intense grieving, the princess's body was brought in procession to Kawaiahaʻo Church for funeral services. The procession was led by traditional warriors and kāhuna laʻau lapaʻau (healers).Ke Kumu. 15 February 1837. Honolulu On April 12, 1837 her body was brought aboard the ship Don Qixote (purchased and renamed Kai Keōpūolani by her brother), to the sacred resting place called Mokuʻula in Lāhainā, Maui to be buried next to her mother Keōpūolani.

Broadband Internet access via VDSL is widespread. However, Internet censorship and surveillance was severe under the rule of Hosni Mubarak, culminating in a total shutdown of the Internet in Egypt during the 2011 Revolution. Though Internet access was restored following Mubarak's ouster, government censorship and surveillance have increased since the 2013 coup d'état, leading U.S. NGO Freedom House to downgrade Egypt's Internet freedom ranking from \\"partly free\\" in 2011 to \\"not free\\" in 2015. Penetration Egypt's Internet penetration rate grew from less than one percent in 2000, to 5% in 2004, 24% in 2009,\\"Estimated Internet Users 2000 to 2009\\" , International Telecommunications Union (ITU), spreadsheet, accessed 12 June 2011 and 54.6% in 2014. As the information and communications technology (ICT) sector continues to grow, Egypt's spending on ICT reached $9.8 billion in 2008 and was expected to increase to $13.5 billion by 2011. This article incorporates text from this source, which is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license. As part of the Egyptian government's ambitious program to expand access to ICT, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (NTRA), Egyptian National Post Organization (ENPO) and Computer and Software Department at the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce signed an agreement to spread personal computers for every home in August 2008. The agreement is the second phase of a 2002 initiative and is part of the MCIT's strategy of increasing ICT use throughout Egypt, focusing on socio- economically disadvantaged communities. The initiative includes offering discounts on computers and 512 kbit/s ADSL subscriptions for three years. Telecommunications companies also work to enable users to access Internet content. For example, Vodafone Egypt, which has 15 million subscribers, announced in August 2008 that it will buy a majority share in Sarmady Communications (Sarcom), an online and mobile content provider. The move was widely seen as part of a wider strategy to dominate Egypt's Internet market by providing both Internet service and content to customers. Telecom Egypt (now rebranded to WE), which has a monopoly in the fixed-line telephone sector, owns a 45 percent stake in Vodafone Egypt and had 11.3 million fixed-line subscribers at the end of June 2008. Telecom Egypt leases parts of its network to other Egyptian mobile operators, who use it to provide calls between mobile to fixed-line phones, as well as international calls. In 2008 the government announced it would sell a second fixed-line license, ending Telecom Egypt's monopoly, but plans to do so have repeatedly been delayed. Almost a million Egyptian households have access to broadband due to sharing of VDSL lines. Of these, 63.4 percent share the connection with their neighbors; 81.9 percent of households that share lines share them with more than three other households. Egypt had more than 400,000 ADSL lines by the end of 2007, 75 percent of which are residential. More than one fourth of Egyptian Internet users visit Internet cafés to get online.  Broadband access  Broadband Internet access was introduced commercially to Egypt in 2000 as ADSL. The service was offered in select central offices in big cities such as Cairo and Alexandria and gradually spread to cover more Governorates of Egypt. There are numerous (220 according to regulatory authority numbers) Internet service providers (ISPs) in Egypt offering an ADSL service. Seven companies own the infrastructure and they are called class A ISPs: (Egynet, LINKdotNET, TE Data,TE Data 2011 - The Fastest Internet Network in Egypt (ISP) NOL, Vodafone data, Noor communication and Yalla). Etisalat Egypt has bought both NileOnline and Egynet to expand their Internet presence. They sell to class B ISPs which, in turn, sell to the rest of the 208 ISPs. Broadband connections in Egypt vary in quality. The quality depends on the distance from the central loop office, the presence of the ISP in that local loop, and the quality of the copper telephone line on which the broadband connection is carried. Internationally, Egypt is currently served with three international submarine cables. namely, FLAG, SEA-ME-WE 3 and SEA-ME-WE 4. but after the mass information blackout of early 2008, with the announcement of Telecom Egypt owned cable TE North and Orascom telecom owned MENA. several other projects are planned to improve the resilience of the international broadband.  Internet exchange points  Egypt has two Internet exchange points: Cairo Regional Internet Exchange (CR-IX) and Middle East Internet Exchange (MEIX), the former carrying international, as well as domestic, services. Reports related to the 2011 Internet shutdown in Egypt refer to the \\"Ramses Exchange\\" as the location where the shut down was effected. The Ramses Exchange, located on Ramses Street near the center of Cairo is the main \\"wire center\\" for Telecom Egypt, carrying not only municipal telecommunications traffic, but also serving as the main point of entry for international submarine fiber-optic circuits, back-hauled from landing stations near Alexandria. The Ramses Exchange is also the location of the CR- IX, the largest Internet exchange in North Africa or the Middle East. Fair usage policy debate =Ministerial statement= The Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Tarek Kamel, said in the July 2007 news that the ADSL would be turned from Unlimited to Limited with a Quota at a starting price of 45 LE (Egyptian pounds) for the 256k/64k and a 2GB limit for the download and so on. Due to the widespread use of local line sharing that limited ISPs' subscribers and increased the burden of traffic upon the network. However, almost all the ADSL users, especially the students and users of unlimited ADSL, refused the offer. Most users had come to the conclusion that, if this plan were to be imposed, they would cancel their subscriptions because they wanted the Internet to be unlimited as is. The plan was to start the limited ADSL Packages on 1 September 2007. It turned out that Tarek Kamel was to aim specific offerings at different price ranges for different individuals unable to subscribe to an unlimited package. As such, the unlimited packages remained as is, and available through all major ISPs with no changes in price, while the limited ADSL price ranges are now offered at a discounted price, with the existing unlimited policies having no fair usage policy, except for ADSL2+ =Introduction of ADSL2+= In April 2008, ADSL2+ was introduced in Egypt at speeds up to 24mbit. Now most ISPs have capped all the unlimited ADSL offerings to a quota of between 100GB and 200GB per month, calling it a Fair usage policy. All speeds from 1mbit/256k up to 24mbit are capped to up to 200GB per month. ISPs stated that the 200GB quota was huge and users could download up to 60 large movies, 10,000 large songs, browse endlessly and send up to 2 million e-mails a month. Most users are divided upon this capping especially those who are heavy P2P users. Going above the monthly quota would result in throttling speed of 512kbit/s for the rest of the month. =Introduction of VDSL2= On May 21, 2015 it introduced VDSL service with speeds of up to 100 Mbps. This has been applied in the area of \\"Madinaty\\" as a first step to experience this new technology, which intends to popularize the country =Alternative offer= There is an alternative offer from 512k to 24mbit ranging from 2GB a month to 200GB a month as a fair usage coverage with reduced prices to encourage low range users to the uptake of broadband. =Confusion about capping= Most ISPs, even though are capped to 40-150GB a month, still claim the offers as unlimited. Also, companies use vague and inconclusive responses about the Fair Usage Policy and its implementation of different packages. The ISP's websites got the FUP in English and placed in hard-to-navigate places plus most of the technical support and representatives are denying that any FUP is in place, which is felt by the end user to be in place, possibly in fear of customers canceling their subscriptions at the thought of being capped. Performance improvement The service has improved dramatically as of late, in terms of performance, during the whole of 2007 till now due to the investment of all parties involved in the providing of Internet in infrastructure heavily. according to NTRA the total international bandwidth at the end of 2009 is 90458Mb and number of ports 970557. which is seeing a dramatic increase from the first quarter of 2009 of only 16,995 Mb. 2008 marine cable damage On 30 January 2008 the Internet service in Egypt and the Middle East was affected by a breakage of the two marine cables, FLAG and SMW4, connecting Egypt to the world. TE Data users were not totally disconnected from the Internet, as the company had a third international gateway to the Internet, SMW3. However, they suffered from reduced bandwidth until the issue was resolved. The local National Telecom Authority issued a decision for all ISPs to offer a free of charge month to all clients as a compensation for the reduced quality of service during the outage. Censorship While the Internet in Egypt was not directly censored under the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, his regime kept watch on the most critical bloggers and regularly arrested them. Censorship at a technological level during that time was largely in the form of optional filters offered by Egyptian ISPs to block pornography; TE Data offers Internet services with content controls which eliminate \\"all of the Internet's indecent content that might affect your children\\".\\"Family Internet\\" , TE Data, accessed 12 June 2011 In August 2009 the OpenNet Initiative reported finding no evidence of Internet filtering in Egypt in any of the four areas it monitors (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools).ONI Country Profile: Egypt , OpenNet Initiative, 6 August 2009 Using data and information gathered during 2010, the status of Internet freedom in Egypt was classified as \\"Partly Free\\" in Freedom on the Net 2011 by Freedom House.\\"Country Report: Egypt\\" , Freedom on the Net 2011, Freedom House, 15 April 2011 The outcome of the 2011 Egyptian revolution was initially interpreted as a chance to establish greater freedom of expression in Egypt, especially online. Reflecting these dramatic changes and opportunities in Egypt, in March 2011 Reporters Without Borders moved Egypt from its \\"Internet Enemies\\" list to its countries \\"under surveillance\\" list.\\"Countries under surveillance: Egypt\\" , Reporters Without Borders, March 2011 In March 2012 Reporters Without Borders reported: > The first anniversary of Egypt’s revolution was celebrated in a climate of > uncertainty and tension between a contested military power, a protest > movement attempting to get its second wind, and triumphant Islamists. > Bloggers and netizens critical of the army have been harassed, threatened, > and sometimes arrested. > > The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), which has been leading the > country since February 2011, has not only perpetuated Hosni Mubarak’s ways > of controlling information, but has strengthened them. Numerous journalists > and bloggers seeking to expose the abuses committed during the pro- > democratic uprising by certain elements of the Army or the military police > have been prosecuted before military courts, and sometimes jailed for > several months. = Censorship prior to 2011 = In 2005 Egyptian authorities continued to both encourage and place restrictions on the use of the Internet. For example, in February, Egypt's Ministry of Interior ordered Internet café managers and owners to record their customers' names and ID numbers and threatened to close the cafés if they refused to comply. This action was condemned by the Cairo- based Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, which described it as \\"a gross violation to the right to privacy\\".“Egypt: Increasing Curb over Internet Usage Harassments against Net Cafés Should Immediately End” , Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, 23 February 2005 In August 2008, authorities increased the level of surveillance by demanding that Internet café customers provide their names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers in order to receive a text message on their cell phones containing a PIN that they can use to access the Internet.\\"Egypt demanding data from cyber cafés users: NGO\\" , Agence France-Presse (AFP), Cairo, 9 August 2008 As the Egyptian blogosphere continued to grow, so did the government's crackdown on bloggers and Internet users. For example, blogger Abdel Kareem Nabil Suleiman Amer (\\"Kareem Amer\\") was sentenced in February 2007 to four years in prison for \\"incitement to hatred of Islam\\" on his blog and for insulting the president. He has since become the symbol of online repression for the country's bloggers. Other Egyptian bloggers have also been arrested for their online activities, and some have been sentenced to prison. One example is Mohamed Refaat, editor of the blog Matabbat (matabbat.blogspot.com), who was arrested in August 2008 under the state emergency law. He was charged with \\"offending the state institutions, destabilizing public security, and inciting others to demonstrate and strike via the Internet\\". In a landmark 2007 legal case, an administrative court rejected a lawsuit brought by a judge calling for the banning of 49 Web sites in Egypt. The court emphasized the support for freedom of expression as long as such Web sites do not harm the beliefs or public order.“Weekly Update #192\\" , Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, 28 December 2007 However, in May 2009, a Cairo court ruled that the Egyptian government must ban access to pornographic Web sites, because they are deemed offensive to religion and society's values.\\"Cairo court rules to block porn sites\\", Agence France-Presse (AFP), 12 May 12, 2009 The suit was filed by a lawyer who pointed to an Egyptian man and his wife who were sentenced to prison for starting a swingers club via the Internet as an example of \\"the dangers posed by such offensive Web sites\\". It remains to be seen whether the authorities will enforce this court order. Egypt has witnessed an increase in the use of Facebook for social activism, which alerted the government to the potential force of the site.\\"In Egypt, a Thirst for Technology and Progress\\" , Noam Cohen, New York Times, 21 July 2008 As a result, there were rumors that it might be blocked, especially after a group of activists managed to recruit supporters using Facebook for the 2008 Egyptian general strike protesting against rising food prices and President Hosni Mubarak's government.\\"Rumors of a Facebook block persist in Egypt\\" , APN, Menassat, Arab Images Foundation, 29 August 2008 On 28 March 2011, military officers arrested the 25-year-old blogger, Maikel Nabil, at his home in Cairo. The military prosecutor charged him with \\"insulting the military establishment\\" and \\"spreading false information\\" for blogs that criticized the army's role during anti-government protests. On 10 April a military court sentenced Nabil to three years in prison, in what Human Rights Watch called a serious setback to freedom of expression in post-Mubarak Egypt. Not only was the sentence severe, but it was imposed on a civilian by a military tribunal after an unfair trial.\\"Egypt: Blogger’s 3-Year Sentence a Blow to Free Speech\\", Human Rights Watch, 11 April 2011\\"Egypt blogger Maikel Nabil jailed by military court\\" , BBC News, 11 April 2011 Along with close to 2,000 other detainees, he was granted a pardon and released on 24 January 2012 after spending ten months behind bars. Immediately after his release, he once more began to challenge the legitimacy of the armed forces and criticizing their record on the eve of the first anniversary of Egypt's revolution.\\"Egypt Profile\\" , Reporters Without Borders\\", March 2012 Another online activist who continued to challenge Egypt's censorship policies was Khaled Said, a young Alexandrian man who was beaten to death by police in June 2010 for posting a video on the Internet that exposed police corruption. His death inspired the creation of the Facebook page \\"We are All Khaled Said,\\" which became a mobilizing and organizing online space. Other online activists were arrested and unjustly detained - including Wael Ghoneim, the founder and moderator of the \\"We are All Khaled Said\\" Facebook page. =Foreign assistance in surveillance= American company Narus, a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation, sold the Mubarak government surveillance equipment that helped identify dissidents during the 2011 revolution. = 2011 Internet shutdown = Diagram to illustrate sequence of communications shutdown Egyptians went through from 25 January to 06 February 2011. Times mentioned are according to Egypt local time. Numbers in the diagram are approximate. Last update of the diagram October 2011. The 2011 Egyptian protests began on 25 January 2011. As a result, on January 25 and 26, the government blocked Twitter in Egypt and later Facebook was blocked as well.Wall Street Journal, Egypt Communications Cut Ahead Of Further Protests On January 27, various reports claimed that access to the Internet in the entire country had been shut down. The authorities responsible achieved this by shutting down the country's official Domain Name System, in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests. Later reports stated that almost all BGP announcements out of the country had been withdrawn, almost completely disconnecting the country from the global Internet, with only a single major provider, Noor Data Networks, remained up. And while Noor continued to operate for several days, its routes started to be withdrawn at 20:46 UTC on 31 January. It was later reported that the five major Egyptian service providers—Telecom Egypt, Vodafone Egypt/Raya, Link Egypt, Etisalat Misr, and Internet Egypt—all went dark one after the other between 22:12 and 22:25 UTC (12:12–12:25 am. Friday 28 January Cairo time). As a result, approximately 93% of all Egyptian networks were unreachable by late afternoon. The shutdown happened within the space of a few tens of minutes, not instantaneously, which was interpreted as companies receiving phone calls one at a time, ordering them to shut down access, rather than an automated system taking all providers down at once. Analysis by BGPMon showed that only 26 BGP routes of the 2903 registered routes to Egyptian networks remained active after the blackout was first noticed; thus an estimated 88% of the whole Egyptian network was disconnected. RIPE NCC has two graphs of routing activity from Egypt, announcements/withdrawals and available prefixes, including a snapshot of activity during the shutdown. Shortly after the Internet shutdown, engineers at Google, Twitter, and SayNow, a voice- messaging startup company acquired by Google in January, announced the Speak To Tweet service. Google stated in its official blog that the goal of the service was to assist Egyptian protesters in staying connected during the Internet shutdown. Users could phone in a tweet by leaving a voicemail and use the Twitter hashtag #Egypt. These tweets can be accessed without an Internet connection by dialing the same designated phone numbers. Those with Internet access can listen to the tweets by visiting twitter.com/speak2tweet. Internet service providers such as the French Data Network (FDN) provided free (zero- cost) dial-up access to Egyptians with landline (analogue) international telephone access. FDN provided the service as a matter of principle, to \\"contribute to the freedom of expression of the Egyptian people and allow them to keep a connection with the rest of the world.\\" After the shutdown of the Internet in Egypt, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, released the following statement calling for an end to the Internet ban: > The people of Egypt have rights that are universal. That includes the right > to peaceful assembly and association, the right to free speech and the > ability to determine their own destiny. These are human rights and the > United States will stand up for them everywhere. I also call upon the > Egyptian government to reverse the actions that they've taken to interfere > with access to the internet, to cellphone service and to social networks > that do so much to connect people in the 21st century. On February 2, connectivity was re-established by the four main Egyptian service providers. A week later, the heavy filtering that occurred at the height of the revolution had ended and bloggers and online activists who had been arrested were released. =Increased censorship and surveillance after the July 3 coup d'état= The Egyptian government has intensified efforts after the overthrow of Morsi to bolster its ability to intercept and monitor messages and data sent over the internet, affecting with the digital security tools that facilitate secure communication channels. In many cases, these disturbances have completely or partially disabled the encryption services widely used by commercial and civil services and individuals to secure the flow of their data. Awareness of the interference did not gain traction among the wider public until December 2016, when users suddenly discovered that Signal, the messaging and voice calling application supported by Open Whisper Systems' encryption protocol, had stopped working in Egypt. Digital security experts contend that they had faced similar problems months before, a fact that led some information security companies to halt the collection of monthly fees pending a resolution. Indications that the Egyptian government has made attempts to acquire technology that would allow it greater surveillance of communication networks have surfaced several times. The most notable revelation came about as result of a July 2015 data breach when an unknown individual hacked the Milan-based information technology company HackingTeam's computer system. Around 400 gigabytes of data – including emails, contracts, bills and budgets involving the company and Egyptian security and intelligence authorities – were made accessible to the public. In concert with other evidence, the leaked documents show that Egyptian authorities were attempting to acquire technology that would allow them to collect information on specific users of interest through directed surveillance. The first problem that companies and specialists faced that indicated Egyptian security agencies may be targeting the infrastructure of the entire network arose in August 2016. Technicians noted that access to Secure Shell (SSH) – a protocol to provide secure communication channels across unsecured public networks and provided by different online services providers – had been obstructed. SSH protocol provided by US company DigitalOcean is used daily in the management of millions of communication processes that occur over the internet. In response to the obstruction, DigitialOcean's users and clients began to contact the company. In a response to a client's inquiry, which was obtained by Mada Masr, DigitalOcean wrote that the interrupted service was not the result of a technical error but had been deliberately caused: > Since you're physically in Egypt, there's not much we would be able to do to > prevent them from messing with your traffic... Your government is performing > DPI [Deep packet inspection] and is messing somehow with these secure > connections. Data is most often transferred over the internet in small network packets that are \\"repackaged\\" and made legible on the recipient's side. Deep packet inspection intercepts the data and examines the identity of communicators, as well as the content of this communication at an inspection point between the sender and recipient. The U.S. company added that they contacted both Egyptian service provider TEData and the Egyptian government to inquire about the interruption. Days after the interruption in the SSH protocol was detected, access to HTTPS was temporarily blocked. HTTPS is a protocol to securely transfer hypertexts, which constitute the core units of all web pages. The protocol continued to operate without interruption for internet giants like Facebook and Google but was completely blocked for all other websites. The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) – an international network operating under the Tor Project that monitors internet censorship, traffic manipulation and signs of surveillance – decided to launch a thorough investigation in August into what was happening in Egypt at the request of technical experts in the country. In October 2016, OONI published a report that confirmed much of what the independent tests had pointed to, as well as DigitalOcean's assessment. The report indicates that the Tor anonymity network appeared to be interfered with in Egypt, while HTTPS connections to DigitalOcean's Frankfurt data center were throttled. The OONI report also asserted that the access to pornography websites appeared to be interfered with via in-band TCP packet injections of advertisement and malware content, and that the temporary blocking of The New Arabs website led to the blocking of specific content (such as images) of other sites that are hosted on the same content distribution network (CDN) as The New Arab. Freedom House has reported that other VPN and proxy services intended to circumvent censorship, including TunnelBear, CyberGhost, Hotspot Shield, TigerVPN, and ZenVPN have been blocked as well. In June 2017, Egypt banned at least 62 websites in a crackdown, including Daily Sabah, Medium, Al Jazeera, The Huffington Post, and Mada Masr along with opposition websites, like El-Badil, for containing material that \\"support terrorism and extremism as well as publish lies\\". The crackdown was condemned by the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Mada Masr and by the Index on Censorship. The ATFE stated that \\"the blocking of websites violates the Egyptian Constitution\\". By October, that figure had climbed to 434 banned websites, including the sites of many opposition organizations and activists. Similarly, social media pages have been shut down or had content removed or their administrators arrested by the Egyptian government. While Facebook, Google, and Twitter have not reported receiving formal takedown requests from the government, government supporters have reported dozens of satirical anti-government Facebook pages for violating the site's community standards. President Sisi's statement that \\"with the assistance of two web brigades, I can shut down thepages, take them over and make them my own.” led many Egyptian commentators to believe that the takedowns had official support. In December 2016, the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior claimed to have shut down 163 Facebook pages and arrested 14 administrators. Voice-over-IP (VoIP) service—including WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Facetime, and Facebook Messenger—have been intermittently blocked on mobile networks by the NTRA since 2013, though disruptions to VoIP have been reported as early as 2010. The NTRA initially claimed that it was blocking VoIP services for economic reasons but became more explicit about the political and security purpose of its blocking in 2015. The government has shut down Internet and phone networks in the Sinai on multiple occasions since 2014, ostensibly as part of its conflict against the ongoing Islamist Sinai insurgency. These localized shutdowns are timed to coincide with military operations, although their counterinsurgency effectiveness is limited because of insurgents' widespread usage of workarounds such as walkie talkies and portable Broadband Global Area Network terminals. However, the shutdowns block emergency calls, preventing civilians from obtaining treatment for combat wounds and in several cases preventing women who went into labor from reaching the hospital. =Persecutions of Egyptians for online activities= A number of Egyptians have been arrested, detained, or imprisoned for their posts on social media. Reasons given for these detentions and prosecutions include spreading fake news, inciting violence, insulting the president, and \\"contempt of religion,\\" and sentences have been as severe as five years in prison. Though arrests initially only targeted known activists and members of opposition groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2017 the government began going after unaffiliated Egyptians who criticized the government. Anti- government bloggers are also often intimidated or harassed by pro-government individuals and news sites. April 6 Movement founder and activist Esraa Abdel Fattah had personal photos, emails, and recordings of phone calls posted on social media without her consent in 2017, for example. As of 2018, independent media editors can be arrested for maintaining a news site without a license. LGBT Egyptians became the target of a particularly fierce crackdown in 2017, after several Egyptians were arrested for sharing images of a rainbow flag flying at a Mashrou’ Leila concert in Cairo. Though homosexuality is legal in Egypt, LGBT Egyptians are charged with \\"debauchery and immorality.\\" Fifty seven LGBT Egyptians were arrested by October 2017, with ten of them being sentenced to between one and six years in prison. This crackdown follows similar efforts by Egyptian police to use Grindr, a dating app for gay men, to entrap gay Egyptians. This practice began in 2014 but is still occurring as of 2017. =2019 Egyptian protests= In the week following the 20/21 September 2019 protests, Egyptian authorities blocked, restricted or temporarily disrupted online communication services including BBC News, WhatsApp, Signal.  Social media usage  A major use of social media in Egypt in recent years has been for political activism and revolutions, and the two most-used websites in Egypt in 2010 were Google and Facebook. Social media sites like Facebook allowed liberal, minority, and religious groups to make communication networks and mobilize protests, as can be seen with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. After the government began restricting Internet use, protesters still used social media to stay connected. Recently, Egyptian police have been using social media, such as Grindr, to find and arrest homosexual men.  Internet Revolution Egypt  Internet Revolution Egypt (IRE) is a cyber-protest against the Internet services provided in Egypt for which Telecom Egypt has a monopoly, which occurred in early 2014. The protest mainly took place on Facebook through a page created by young Egyptians; some activity was also seen on Twitter as well. Users within the group were mainly within the 18 to 24 age group. The main Facebook page,\\"ثورة الانترنت - Internet Revolution Egypt\\" , Facebook. Retrieved 14 March 2014. has reached more than one million followers and continues to expand. This significant expansion resulted in a wide media attention at the time. In response to some accusations by certain media outlets, the protest stated that it does not have any relation to politics. The slogan used by the protests is \\"الأنترنت عندنا في مصر; غالي جدا , بطئ ببشاعة .. خدمة عملاء زي الزفت\\", which means \\"The internet services in Egypt; are very expensive, terribly slow .. The customer service is terrible.\\" in Arabic.\\" 'Down with slow internet': A new Egyptian revolution?\\" , Shounaz Meky, Al Arabiya News, 18 February 2014. Retrieved 14 March 2014.

Life and career  Howland was born in Denver, Colorado, to Joby A. Howland, one of the youngest enlisted participants in the Civil War, and Mary C. Bunting. His older sister was the famous stage actress Jobyna Howland.Olin Howland at Internet Broadway Database From 1909 to 1927, Howland appeared on Broadway in musicals, occasionally performing in silent films. The musicals include Leave It to Jane (1917), Two Little Girls in Blue (1921) and Wildflower (1923). He was in the film Janice Meredith (1924) with Marion Davies. With the advent of sound films, his theatre background proved an asset, and he concentrated mostly on films thereafter, appearing in nearly two hundred movies between 1918 and 1958. Howland often played eccentric and rural roles in Hollywood. His parts were often small and uncredited, and he never got a leading role. He was a personal favorite of David O. Selznick, who cast him in his movies Nothing Sacred (1937) as a strange luggage man, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938, as the teacher Mr. Dobbins) and Gone with the Wind (1939) as a carpetbagger businessman. He also played in numerous westerns from Republic Pictures, including the John Wayne films In Old California (1942) and Angel and the Badman (1947). As a young man, Howland learned to fly at the Wright Flying School and soloed on a Wright Model B. This lent special sentiment in his scenes with James Stewart in the film The Spirit of St. Louis (1957), as Stewart was also a pilot in real life. The Spirit of St. Louis and Them (1954),where he played a drunken old man, and The Blob (1958) were his last films. He also played in television shows during the 1950s. One of Olin's memorable television appearances was in an episode of \\"I Love Lucy.\\" Entitled \\"First Stop\\", air date January 17, 1955 Olin played the humorous role of a cafe and motel proprietor offering dubious accommodations to the road-weary Ricardos and Mertzes as they traveled by car en-route from New York to California. In 1958 and 1959, he was cast as Charley Perkins in five episodes of ABC's sitcom The Real McCoys, starring Walter Brennan. Howland was also a dancer, a dancing teacher, and a headliner in vaudeville shows. He toured Europe performing dancing exhibitions. Howland never married and had no children. He worked until his death in Hollywood, California, at the age of 73.

The area is designed to be like a village, with features such as: a village green, a main street, focal points, gateways, water features and recreational and community facilities. The responsibility for the development of the area passed from the CDC to North Lanarkshire Council in 1996. The area was known as Auchinbee, and was built on the lands of the Auchinbee Farm. The farm house has been developed into a nursery. The name Craigmarloch, was taken from an area to the north close to Kilsyth and adjacent to the Forth and Clyde Canal, approximately away. The older site was a stop on the canal. Around the main residential area is the Dullatur Golf Course with two main courses. The area also has Roman links as an ancient Roman Path runs between the Joint Schools Campus and the Craighalbert Centre. The area is very well connected to the rest of Scotland and the UK by being only a short drive from all of the major motorway networks. Croy train station only a short walk or drive away, allows a very speedy and direct commute into Glasgow, Edinburgh, Falkirk and Stirling as well as many other destinations.

The south end is an at-grade intersection with the former route of MS 304 near Tunica Resorts, where Mississippi Highway 713 continues west to U.S. Highway 61, and the route continues north to the Mississippi state line. Much of the route overlaps Mississippi Highway 304, which intersects US 61 farther north than MS 713. MS 304 continues east from I-55, connecting to State Route 385 in Tennessee, forming part of the Interstate 269 Memphis outer beltway. Route description A portion of I-69 cosigned with MS Route 304 I-69 has been divided into a number of sections of independent utility (SIUs). =SIU 9 (Mississippi portion)= At the Mississippi-Tennessee state line, I-69 enters Mississippi from the north concurrently with Interstate 55, and follows the previously constructed route of I-55 south to Hernando, Mississippi for approximately , where it meets Interstate 269. On January 18, 2008, the Federal Highway Administration authorized the states of Mississippi and Tennessee to extend I-69 from the I-40/TN 300 interchange in north Memphis to the I-55/I-69 interchange in Hernando; in late May 2008, Mississippi began posting signs reflecting the extension of the route.Capka, J. Richard (FHWA Administrator), Letter to Harry Lee James (MDOT) dated January 18, 2008, retrieved May 28, 2008.Lawrence, Christopher N. Photograph taken May 27, 2008. Tennessee signed I-69 along I-55 north to I-240 for a few months and then removed the I-69 shields. =SIU 10= Segment 10 of the I-69 extension was originally planned and built as part of the MS-304 relocation project to link the Tunica County casinos to Interstate 55. Planning of the MS-304 Bypass predates I-69 planning in Mississippi, and federal and state officials opted to route I-69 over this segment in 2000, since it was nearing the start of construction. It also eliminated the need for constructing a new highway while still accomplishing the intended goals for the I-69 corridor. In Hernando, I-69 diverges from I-55 at the interchange with Interstate 269 and turns west for approximately to the area around the Tunica County casinos. A ribbon-cutting ceremony took place at 2:00 p.m. CST on October 3, 2006, at which point the road was opened to traffic. This segment's opening also coincided with Mississippi's Statewide Transportation Conference, held in Tunica. The state's HELP program, with funding raised from Tunica County's casino gaming revenues, enabled this segment to be completed three years ahead of schedule. This portion of I-69 mostly coincides with the relocated route of MS 304; both routes are co-signed between I-55 and the MS 713 spur, where the two routes split: MS 304 continues due west to U.S. 61, while I-69 (co-signed with MS 713) turns south to connect to the old routing of MS 304 near Banks, Mississippi. The MS 713 portion of the route opened to traffic December 18, 2006. I-55 and I-69 meet at a cloverleaf interchange near Hernando; with I-269 and MS-304 continuing to the east. To accommodate the volume of traffic anticipated to pass through this interchange and meet current Federal Highway Administration standards for cloverleaf interchanges, collector/distributor roads were added to the I-55 mainline in the vicinity of the interchange. As of December 18, 2006, all work on SIU 10 is complete and the entire segment is open to traffic. Because Interstate 69 is still incomplete through the remainder of Mississippi (SIUs 11 and 12), exits are unnumbered on the Hernando-Tunica segment. The two control cities used on the SIU 10 segment are Memphis and Tunica, although the route does not yet reach the Town of Tunica. The additional control city of Southaven is used at the interchange with I-55 and I-269 along the northern duplex. Future =SIU 11= Continuing south from its present (temporary) terminus at Mississippi Route 3 near Banks, I-69 will bypass the Town of Tunica to the east (serving Tunica Municipal Airport), then veer to the west and merge with U.S. 61 route to Clarksdale, also merging with U.S. Route 49 near Rich. In 2006 MDOT decided to incorporate the recently completed Clarksdale Bypass into the future I-69 alignment through the Clarksdale vicinity, since the bypass is already at Interstate standards. In Clarksdale, I-69 will merge with U.S. Route 278 and continue south, serving Shelby, following the existing U.S. 61 route. I-69 and U.S. 278 will diverge from U.S. 61 near Merigold, bypassing Cleveland to the west, and continue south to near Shaw, then west to Benoit where it will intersect Mississippi Highway 1. The Final Environmental Impact Statement for SIU 11 was approved in August 2010, and the Record of Decision was issued in September 2010.I-69 Project Page, Mississippi Department of Transportation, Accessed November 1, 2010 Due to funding issues, no major construction on this section of I-69 is expected through at least 2019, although some spot upgrades are planned on sections of US-61 that I-69 will eventually overlap. The 2016–2020 Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan (STIP) published by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) anticipates construction to begin in 2020 to upgrade a 6-mile (10 km) section of US-61 to I-69 from the north end of the Clarksdale Bypass to near Swan Lake. The 2017–2020 STIP released by MDOT in December 2016 includes $3 million in FY-2017 for engineering and design work on the northernmost section of SIU-11 from the south end of the existing I-69 freeway at MS-3 and MS-713 to Arkabutla Dam Road. =SIU 12 (Mississippi portion)= From Benoit, I-69 and U.S. 278 will cross the Charles W. Dean Bridge (sometimes referred to as the Great River Bridge) over the Mississippi River into Arkansas. Mississippi's portion of SIU 12 consists of the eastern end of the Dean Bridge; Arkansas' portion will continue from the Dean Bridge to U.S. 65 near McGehee. Environmental studies for this segment, including the Dean Bridge, have been completed and the FHWA issued a Record of Decision approving the route through SIU 12 in 2004. SIU-12 and the Dean Bridge are considered \\"shovel ready,\\" pending the availability of funding and completion of right- of-way acquisition for the Mississippi approach to the bridge.

The Brooklyn native stood tall and weighed . Chipman's career began in 1939 in the minor leagues, and after winning 14, 17 and 17 games in successive campaigns, he was recalled by the Dodgers in September 1941, appearing in one game (and winning it) with five scoreless innings pitched in relief against the cellar-dwelling Philadelphia Phillies on the last day of the season, September 28. The Dodgers had clinched the National League pennant three days earlier; Chipman's victory was Brooklyn's 100th of 1941. But he was not eligible to appear in the 1941 World Series, and spent most of the wartime 1942 and 1943 campaigns with the Dodgers' Montreal Royals farm club. Then, after only 11 games with Brooklyn in 1944, he was swapped to the Cubs for second baseman Eddie Stanky on June 6. Chipman spent the next 5 seasons in a Chicago uniform, working in 189 games, 72 as a starting pitcher. As a member of the 1945 National League champions, he appeared as a relief pitcher in Game 5 of the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, and faced two left-handed batters: he walked Eddie Mayo and retired Doc Cramer on a ground ball. All told, Chipman won 51 and lost 46 in 293 games pitched, 87 as a starter. He notched 29 complete games and seven shutouts and, as a reliever, 14 saves. In 880 innings pitched, he allowed 889 hits and 386 walks, with 322 strikeouts. Chipman died November 8, 1973, in Huntington, New York. He was inducted posthumously into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Baseball Category with the Class of 2006.

In 1827, Quaker John Jackson bought the mill from Richard Curtis, a paper manufacturer and farmer who had gone bankrupt. Jackson built and lived in the adjacent house, known as Calder Bank, where his descendants continued to live for well over a hundred years.

Oakerthorpe is a small village near Alfreton. It was known in ancient times as Ulkerthorpe. It lies in the parish of South Wingfield, eleven miles south of Chesterfield in the county of Derbyshire. The local church is dedicated to All Saints, and is found about half a mile from the village. In the centre of the village is the Peacock Inn; there is also the Anchor pub and the Butchers Arm. Recently houses have been built at 'Hillside Park'. Oakerthorpe was originally a mining village. In the nineteenth century, within Oakerthorpe and near the Peacock Inn lay the ruins of Ufton Manor. In the middle of the sixteenth century the chapel of Limbury adjoined the old manor house. Some ruins of the chapel could still be seen as late as 1800. The Peacock Inn, situated near the Alfreton- South Wingfield crossroads, dates back into the eleventh century and is reputed to be the oldest inn in the county of Derbyshire. The inn is mentioned in the Domesday Book, when it was known as Ufton Barnsand. It was rebuilt in 1613 and has a most interesting history; legend has it that Dick Turpin, one of the most famous highwaymen in English history, stopped off at the inn on his ride to York. An underground passage in the bottom of the cellar in the Peacock Inn is reported to lead to nearby South Wingfield Manor. Exploration through the tunnel leads to a large cave where there is a deep pool of water over thick mud. The tunnel is around five feet high and about four feet wide, with parts bricked up - most of it is excavated through living rock. It was at Wingfield Manor where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned in 1569 then again in 1584 when her attempted rescue by Anthony Babington ended in disaster. His plan was to lead her down through the tunnel to the cellar at the inn, where horses were waiting to take her to safety. Babington went down through the tunnel from Oakerthorpe, but he got caught. For his crime he was beheaded at Lincoln's Inn in 1586. Mary was taken to Fotheringay and beheaded the same year. Another legend associated with the Peacock tells that in the eighteenth century, a respected churchwarden at the chapel and the landlord of the Peacock Inn was Peter Kendall. He had a beautiful daughter named Ann, who wore such fashionable wide hooped dresses that she had to enter the church doorway sideways. The local church, which figures quite largely in the following tale, is called South Wingfield, although it is on the Oakerthorpe side of the River Amber. Ann Kendall was courted by a young local farmer, who seems to have remained anonymous in the records. The farmer seduced Ann and she fell pregnant. The farmer then deserted Ann and left her to give birth to a daughter. The disgrace so weighed upon poor Miss Kendall’s mind that she died on fourteenth of May 1745 of a broken heart. Just before she died she asked for Psalm 109 to be read at her funeral. Since that time, at churches within the district Psalm 109 is known as “Miss Kendall’s Psalm.” Shortly after the funeral, the man who had betrayed the maid was riding past South Wingfield church; suddenly the bells crashed out, the horse reared, and the rider was thrown to the ground, breaking his neck. It was an old custom in several Derbyshire churches to carry a special garland at the funeral procession of a young man or maiden. These garlands were made of wooden hoops decorated with rosettes, ornaments of white paper and ribbons, and sometimes a pair of white gloves. They were hung up in the church after the funeral, many lingering for centuries. Such a garland was carried at Ann Kendall’s funeral and was still hanging in South Wingfield in the 1870s, in spite of previous offers to purchase the curio. References South Wingfield, which includes Oakerthorpe, was held by Alnoth at the time of the Norman Conquest. He also held extensive land in Dorset, Devon and Tolgullow in Cornwall.

Historically part of the St Helens parish, it was absorbed into Ryde Borough in 1933 and in turn into Medina Borough in 1974. Oakfield largely consists of light industrial units and various developments of social housing. The area bounded by High Street, School Street and Reed Street was re-developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with Victorian stone-built cottages demolished to make way for local authority flats and houses. Also demolished was the Oakfield Junior School, in High Park Square, built to a design by Thomas Hellyer. Earlier local authority housing (pre and post war) exists in Harding Road, and later council-built properties can be found in Slade Road. The most recent development is OakVale, whose metal-clad walls dominate views from many other parts of Ryde. Victorian properties remain in parts of High Street, St John's Hill, Wood Street and Meaders Road as well as in Upper and Lower Highland Roads. In the 1960s Oakfield had its own butcher, a barbers shop, several pubs and the well-patronised Renown Fish Bar. June's greengrocer shop on the corner of Meaders Road and St Johns Hill was used as a location in the 1973 film That'll be the Day, featuring Ringo Starr and Rosemary Leach.

It is in the jurisdiction of Vrgorac, southeast of Split. It lies just below Sveti Mihovil mountain, which is high. History Kozica was first mentioned in documents of the Kreševskoj era in 1434. = Prehistory = Around Kozica there are more than sixteen archeological sites with ancient burials, dated since 1900 B.C. to the late medieval period. In the near area, there are gomile and stećci, evidence of the ancient cattle breeders and warriors. =Ottoman Empire= When Vrgorac capitulated to the Ottoman Empire, Kozica probably fell with the rest of the area. The spread of Islam into the region that came with the arrival of the Ottoman army concerned the occupants of the monastery in Makarska, who began to worry about the residents in Kozica and the surrounding region, fearing that many would convert to Islam. =Post- Ottoman occupation= After the liberation of inner Dalmatia from the Ottoman Empire, most of Kozica and the surrounding villages had been deserted because of the exodus of the populace to the northern regions of Croatia. The Venetian Republic repopulated the area with Herzegovinian people from the east. The withdrawal of the Ottomans saw the region come under the jurisdiction of the Venetian Republic, then under the rule of Napoleon. A short and prosperous period followed, which included the construction of the \\"napoleonsku cestu\\" (Napoleon's road), encouraging travel to the area. With the failure of Napoleon's campaign in Dalmatia, Kozica fell under the rule of Austria- Hungary, and remained so until the end of the First World War. =Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918–1941) and World War II= Many of Kozica's population bought land near Vrgorac, where they grew their own produce, including olives and grapes; the area acquired a reputation for good wine. The Second World War changed this for the worse. In World War II, all houses in the village were burnt down, and 20% of the villagers were killed by either Chetnik or Italian units, or in combat, fighting for the Partisans. Climate Kozica has a Sub-Mediterranean climate, but due to its elevation Kozica has its own microclimate which differs from the Dalmatian Coast. Kozica is situated on a plateau in between two mountains, Biokovo and Sveti Mihovil. Tourism and the economy Tourism has started in Kozica and it is becoming common for cyclists to tour the region and its rocky landscape. Kozica's natural environment is also an attraction in the summer. Kozica is a small Mediterranean mountain village which is 20 minutes by car from the nearest beach. Kozica is also home to various palm trees and many other types of flora. Tourism in Kozica is expected to increase with the construction of the A1 highway from Zagreb via Split to Dubrovnik.

The confluence with Little Robe Creek is downstream to the left. The Battle of Little Robe Creek, also called the Battle of Antelope Hills, took place on May 12, 1858. It actually was a series of three distinct encounters that took place on a single day, between the Comanches on the one side, and Texas Rangers, militia, and allied Tonkawas attacking them. It was undertaken against the laws of the United States at the time, which strictly forbade such an incursion into the Indian Territories of Oklahoma, and marked a significant escalation of the Indian Wars. It also marked the first time American or Texas Ranger forces had penetrated the Comancheria as far as the Wichita Mountains, and Canadian River, and it marked a decisive defeat for the Comanches.Fehrenbach, T.R. \\"Comanches, The Destruction of a People Military historians distinguish between the Antelope Hills Expedition by the Texas Rangers and the Battle of Little Robe Creek with the former being the entire campaign against the Comanche conducted from January to May, 1858, starting in Texas above the Edwards Plateau, and continuing on to the Indian Territories in what is now Oklahoma. The latter is the specific battle at Little Robe Creek, with all three encounters counting as one sustained, day-long battle. Since federal troops would not attack the Comanche and Kiowa in that portion of the Comancheria, the Texas Rangers launched the incursion into the Antelope Hills. Prelude The years 1856 to 1858 were particularly vicious and bloody on the Texas frontier as settlers continued to expand their settlements into the Comanche homeland, the Comancheria. Valuable Indian hunting grounds were plowed under, and grazing range for the Comanche horse herds lost. The Comanche realized their homeland of the Comancheria was increasingly encroached on by Anglo-Texas settlers and they struck back with a series of ferocious and bloody raids into Texas.The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. The United States Army proved wholly unable to stem the violence. Federal units were being transferred out of the area for reasons that seemed driven more by political than military considerations. At the same time, federal law and numerous treaties forbade incursion by state forces into the federally protected Indian Territories. The U.S. Army was likewise instructed not to attack Indians in the Indian Territories or to permit such attacks. The reasoning behind the order was that many native tribes, such as the Cherokee, were engaged in farming, and living as peaceful settlers. While other tribes, such as the Comanche and Kiowa, continued to use that part of the Indian Territories that was the Comancheria to live in while raiding white settlements in Texas.The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. The relationship between the federal government, Texas and the native tribes was further complicated by a unique situation which arose as a result of Texas' annexation. The federal government is charged by the U.S. Constitution to be in charge of Indian affairs and took over that role in Texas after it became a state in 1846. But under the terms of Texas' accession to the Union, the new state retained control of its public lands. In all other new states, Washington controlled both public lands and Indian affairs and so could make treaties guaranteeing reservations for various groups. In Texas, however, the federal government could not do this. Texas adamantly refused to contribute public land for Indian reservations within the boundaries of Texas, meanwhile expecting the federal government to be responsible for the cost and details of Indian affairs. Since federal Indian agents in Texas knew that Indian land rights were the key to peace on the frontier, no peace could be possible with the uncooperative attitude of Texas officials on the question of Indian homelands.Handbook of Texas Online. Texas State Historical Association As the Civil War loomed, federal forces were moved off the frontier with greater frequency. These troop movements, including the transfer without replacement of the 2nd Cavalry in Texas, left much of the frontier of the Great Plains without protection from Indian Attacks. The loss of the 2nd Cavalry in Texas was a particularly bitter blow to settlers. Texas Governor Hardin Runnels had campaigned for office in 1856 on a platform to put an end to the raids. He publicly expressed astonishment and rage when the 2nd Cavalry was transferred to Utah, and ultimately disbanded altogether. Governor Runnels determined to reestablish disbanded Ranger battalions which were reduced after Texas' annexation by the United States. The end result was that on January 27, 1858, Governor Runnels appointed John Salmon \\"Rip\\" Ford, a veteran Ranger of the Mexican–American War and frontier Indian fighter, as captain and commander of the Texas Ranger, Militia, and Allied Indian Forces, and ordered him to carry the battle to the Comanches in the heart of their homeland on the Comancheria. John \\"Rip\\" Ford was made captain and commander of the Texas Ranger, Militia, and Allied Indian Forces Ford, whose habit of signing the casualty reports with the initials \\"RIP\\" for \\"Rest In Peace,\\" was known as a ferocious and no- nonsense Indian fighter. Commonly missing from the history books was his proclivity for ordering the wholesale slaughter of any Indian, man or woman, he could find. Ford's reason for this was simple: Comanche raids were brutal in their treatment of settlers. The Comanche, at that time, generally made no distinction between age and race of victims, except that men old enough to fight were expected to fight to the death as most Native Americans would, never allowing themselves to be captured alive by the fierce Comanche, who regarded surrender as cowardice. Girls, (females below puberty), and young boys, (generally up to a year or two below puberty), were generally tested, and if found to be strong, healthy, and intelligent, were adopted into the band. Women over puberty were raped and used as slaves. The Comanche as a people had originated as a branch of the Shoshone people living along the upper Platte River in Wyoming. The Comanche emerged as a distinct group shortly before 1700, when they broke off from the Shoshone as they migrated south. This coincided with their acquisition of the horse, from the Spaniards, which allowed them greater mobility in their quest for better hunting grounds. Their population explosion as a distinct tribe of their own came in part from the huge numbers of women and children adopted into the tribe. As the original Comanche moved southward into a swath of territory extending from the Arkansas River to the area of central Texas north of the Edwards Plateau, their population increased dramatically due to the abundance of buffalo as an easy food supply, an influx of Shoshone migrants, and the adoption of significant numbers of women and children taken captive from rival groups. The Comanche made no distinction between those born into the tribe, and those adopted into the tribe. Military Historians believe the Comanche's relatively recent acquisition of their domain made them all the more determined to fight to keep it.Exley, J.A. Frontier Blood: The Saga of the Parker Family Their success against the Spanish, Mexicans, and early Texans led them to believe the tactics which had enabled them to win, including unrelenting raids and thefts against settlements, would continue to be successful.Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains. University of Nebraska Press. 1953. This violence towards settlers cost approximately 17 settler lives per mile for settlement of the Comancheria. Thus, Ford determined to meet brutality with brutality. Governor Runnels issued very explicit orders to Ford, \\"I impress upon you the necessity of action and energy. Follow any trail and all trails of hostile or suspected hostile Indians you may discover and if possible, overtake and chastise them if unfriendly. The Governor's instructions were simple, and Ford intended to follow them. He then raised a force of approximately 100 Texas Rangers and State Militia. Realizing that even with repeating rifles, Buffalo Guns, and modern colt revolvers, he needed additional men, Ford set out to recruit ones he did not have to pay, as he did his Rangers and Militia.http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ok/county/ellis/littlerobe.html Recruiting \\"friendly\\" Indians Among the traditional enemies of the Comanche were the Tonkawa Indians, then on a reservation on the Brazos River, in Texas. Immortalized and praised in Texas history as friends and allies of the Texas settlers, these histories generally downplay the fact the Tonkawa were cannibals, and were despised by virtually every other Indian tribe.Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association Ford, who himself had witnessed Tonkawa brutality to other Indians, had no reservations about using cannibals to help him, as long as they were eating Comanches, not Rangers. On March 19, 1858, Ford went to the Brazos Reservation, near what today is the city of Fort Worth, Texas, and recruited the Tonkawa into his forces. An Indian Agent, Captain L. S. Ross, (father of the future Governor of Texas, L.S. Ross) called Chief Placido of the Tonkawa to a war council where he used rhetoric to stir Placido's anger against their mutual traditional enemies, the Comanches. At least 120 warriors volunteered, 111 of them Tonkawa, led by Placido, and scouts were sent to locate Comanche camps north of the Red River in the Comancheria in the Oklahoma Indian Territories. Thus, Tonkawa Indians, the latter commanded by their \\"celebrated\\" chief, Placido, hailed as the \\"faithful and implicitly trusted friend of the whites\\" (with limited mention of their cannibalism)http://www.forttours.com/pages/antelope.asp undertook a campaign with approximately an equal number of Texas Rangers against the Comanches. Ford and Placido were determined to follow the Comanche and Kiowa up to their strongholds amid the hills of the Canadian river, and into the Wichita Mountains, and if possible, \\"kill their warriors, decimate their food supply, strike at their homes and families and generally destroy their ability to make war.\\" The Campaign in the Comancheria: The Antelope Hills Campaign Map of the Comancheria in 1858. In February 1858, Ford established Camp Runnells near what used to be the town of Belknap.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, Ford, still operating under Governor Runnell's explicits orders to \\"follow any and all trails of hostile and suspected hostile Indians, inflict the most severe and summary punishment,\\" and to \\"allow no interference from any source.\\" (That source was interpreted to mean the United States, whose Army and Indian Agents might try to enforce federal treaties and federal statutory law against trespassing on the Indian territories in Oklahoma). On April 29, Ford's Rangers, accompanied by Tonkawa warriors, Caddo, Anadarko, Shawnee and other allied Indian scouts from the Brazos Indian Reservation in Texas, crossed the Red River into Indian Territory.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, The force then advanced into the portion of the Comancheria in the Indian Territories in Oklahoma. Ford led his men across the Red River, into the Indian Territory, violating federal laws and numerous treaties, but stating later that his job was to \\"find and fight Indians, not to learn geography.\\" The Battle of Little Robe Creek =The First Encounter of the Battle of Little Robe Creek= The first of three distinct encounters between the invading Texas forces, and the Comanche, occurred at sunrise on May 12, 1858. Ford considered his attack, and the entire campaign, a just response to the Comanche raids on settlers. Neither side observed rules concerning not harming non-combatants. Thus, at the break of dawn at Antelope Hills on Little Robe Creek in the heart of the Comancheria, Ford's men attacked the first Comanche camp they found. The Tonkawa asked, and were granted, permission to attack the sleeping Comanche lodges, which were less than a dozen in number. What Comanche women and children were able to get out of the lodges without being killed or captured by the Tonkawa fled for their lives while the few men who survived the original attack tried desperately to cover their flight. Ford's Ranger forces attacked the fleeing Comanche, effectively using their pistols, killing every warrior during their retreat and numerous women and children, Ford reporting \\"it was not an easy matter to distinguish Indian warriors from squaws\\".Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas.

Austin: University of Texas Press, Historian Jerry Denson, noted that Ford joked about the deaths of \\"squaws and such.\\" However, Ford's own memories captured in, Rip Ford's Texas, edited by Stephen B. Oates, makes clear that he considered the Indian Wars a ruthless struggle for the very survival of Texas, in which the only rule was to protect the settlers, by \\"whatever means were necessary.\\" =The Second Encounter of the Battle of Little Robe Creek= The second encounter in the Battle of Little Robe Creek was not as easy as the first, though Ford's official reports made clear the Texans had every intention of doing to the second encampment what they had done to the first. The mixed force under Ford proceeded on, and attacked a moderately large encampment of approximately 70-100 lodges further upriver. Fortunately for the Comanche, a warrior saw the Texan forces advancing upriver after the original dawn attack on the solitary encampment, and had ridden hastily to warn the second, and larger, group. Thus, the Comanche were able to mount a defensive action, protecting their women and children, at the cost of many warriors' lives. Most devastating to the Comanche, their legendary Chief, Phohebits Quasho, Iron Jacket, \\"professed to blow arrows aside from their aim\\",Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, was killed in the fighting. He had worn a Spanish coat of mail in battle which had earned him a reputation of invincibility as it evidently protected him from some light weapons fire. However, Jim Pockmark, a Tonkawa sharpshooter, managed to hit him with a Sharps Buffalo Rifle, something no mail could protect him from, although Ford reports he was taken down when \\"six rifle shots rang on the air\\".Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, Iron Jacket, an older man, probably in his 60s at the time, had rallied his men after warning had arrived of the attack on the first small group of lodges a short distance from his encampment, and had ridden directly in front of the attacking Rangers and Indians challenging them to individual combat. While this had worked in his battles with previous foes, who lacked the powerful weapons able to penetrate the Armour he wore, it got him killed at Little Robe Creek. His warriors were badly distressed by his death, as Iron Jacket had explained his breath could blow bullets away. The Comanche second in command was killed by a shot from Chul-le-quah, the Shawnee captain.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, Had reinforcements not speedily arrived, his followers might have been killed in the chaos after his death. =The Third Encounter of the Battle of Little Robe Creek= After Iron Jacket was killed, Ford's Lieutenant's expected him to immediately attack his outnumbered warriors. They believed they could kill them, kill or capture the fleeing women and children, and continue on upriver. Ford's Lieutenant's, and Placido, were surprised when he ordered the force to hold fast. Ford had seen movement in the hills above Little Robe Creek, and believed a large force of Indians was coming. His feeling may have saved his forces from disaster. Iron Jacket had sent messengers to warn and summon help, especially the nearest encampment, led by his son Peta Nocona. The husband of Cynthia Ann Parker, arrived on the scene with at least 100, and perhaps more, Comanche reinforcements. (Ford claimed in his report to the Governor that Peta Nocono commanded at least 500 warriors, but this is highly unlikely, as he rarely had more than 100 men under his command, and additional warriors would have taken more time arriving from more distant encampments.) Realizing that his warriors, with their bows and lances, could not fight at close quarters with the Rangers and their six shooters, and not intending to repeat the mistake of his father, Peta Nocona attempted to lure them into the woods surrounding Little Robe Creek, where the Comanches' legendary skill on horseback and with bows and lances could be brought into play, with the woods negating some of the advantages of the Texan superior firepower. But Ford was having nothing to do with that. Despite the attempts of the Comanche to lure their traditional enemies, the Tonkawa to single combat, and repeated challenges to the Rangers to do the same, Ford ordered the Tonkawa to cease accepting after a number were killed in single combat by Comanche warriors. Ford later reported of the Comanche challenges to single combat: > In these combats the mind of the spectator was vividly carried back to the > days of chivalry; the jousts and tournaments of knights; and to the > concomitants of those scenic exhibitions of gallantry. The feats of > horsemanship were splendid, the lances and shields were used with great > dexterity, and the whole performance was a novel show to civilized man. However much he admired the show, Ford had no intention of either engaging a Comanche in single combat, allowing any of his troops to do so, (nor did any express any desire to go out and meet a Comanche challenge to single combat). Ford put an end to his Indian allies accepting these challenges when they lost most of the combats. Ford, already irritated by his allies losing many fights to the Comanche, absolutely forbid any further single combats. After the end of the single battles between Tonkawa and Comanche, he first ordered the Tonkawa to attack the Comanches in mass, hoping that this would lure Peta Nocona to commit his forces wholesale to battle, at which point Ford would order in his Rangers, with their far superior firepower. But the strategy failed when he realized that the Tonkawa had removed the white bands he had ordered them to put on their heads so he could differentiate between Indian allied and enemy warriors in the heat of battle. (Ford and the most experienced Indian fighters probably could tell the difference, as the Comanche used distinctive dress, headdress, (Buffalo horns), and paint, but most of his men could not tell one from the other. Seeing the Tonkawa apparently getting far the worse of the fighting, he signaled them with bugles to retreat. As the Tonkawa withdrew, Ford then ordered a wholesale charge by his Rangers and Militia. Peta Noncona and his warriors, responded by retreating from the massed deadly six gun fire. Noncona already knew this weaponry was far different from the single shot weapons they had mastered facing. They had, before the advent of repeating weapons, allowed the gunmen to fire their single shot weapons, while the Comanche swirled about. Then the average Comanche warrior could fire as many as six arrows in the space of a minute, long before their opponent could reload, usually killing their opponent. Peta Nocona had no intention of allowing his men to be caught in the open facing massed repeating weapons. Therefore, in response to the charge from Ford's forces, the Comanche retreated instead of standing to fight. At that point the entire battle turned into a chaotic running fight over several miles, which negated much of the massed firepower of the Texans. In the end, the vast bulk of the Comanche force under Peta Nocona safely retreated, having bought time for Iron Jacket's people, and their own families up the Canadian to flee. Nocona's band was able to even pack up their lodges, food supplies, and possessions, and move them as well. Warriors from more distant encampments of Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, and Comanche were now arriving. The odds increasing against him, and with ammunition limited, Ford chose to end the Battle, and Campaign in Antelope Hills. At twilight, Ford began an orderly withdrawal, and retreated back to Texas, Before he left, however, he burned the lodges of Iron Jacket's people, and destroyed their food stores and possessions. reaching Camp Runnells on the 21st May.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, Reasons for the Texas Rangers' success at Little Robe Creek As Frank Secoy and John C. Ewers emphasized in their military history book Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains the Comanche, and other plains Indians, had combined mastery of horsemanship while incorporating first, their native weapons of bow and lance, then single shot firearms, with the horse. But two things combined to alter this battlefield dynamic: first, adoption by the Rangers, then the cavalry, of the nomad tactics of cold camp and relentless pursuit to the Indian encampments. Second, the introduction of rapid fire pistols and rifles. Thus, the Texans had surprised the Comanche in the heart of their homeland. Subsequently, the nomad's advantage of not having a fixed home to defend was negated at Little Robe Creek. Secondly, the invention and deployment of rapid rate firearms destroyed the tactics the plains Indians had developed and used with such success against the Spanish, Mexicans, and early Americans. Comanches of West Texas in war regalia, c. 1830. In this battle, the two factors combined to give a glimpse of what would end the Plains Indians way of life since horses had made them true nomads. Although the \\"Comanche\\" had always been a nomadic people, it was the horse that transformed them into a true nomad culture, and a very warlike one. In the Journal of American History Pekka Hämäläinen estimates, as do most military historians and cultural anthropologists, that it was around 1700 that the Comanche got access to a sufficient number of Spanish horses that they were able to make the leap from dog and human assisted nomadic hunter-gatherer to a true nomad culture. The effects of this transformation were radical. Because they were the first Plains tribe to fully incorporate the horse into their way of life, and into their way of making war, they were far and away the best at it . Though it was rare, the only successes the Spanish ever had in battle with the Comanche were on occasions that they were able to take them by surprise. However, since the Comanche became classic horse nomads, this was never easy to do. It was only when the Rangers had adopted classic Comanche tactics of cold camps, forced marches, and use of scouts were they able to alter the dynamic of nomad cavalry attacking fixed settlements. At Little Robe Creek, they in large part succeeded in surprising the Comanche. Secondly, technology had changed weapons vastly in favor of the settlers. Certainly the Spanish, then the Mexicans, and later the Texans had learned that single-shot weapons were not enough to defeat the deadly Comanche light horse, whose mastery of cavalry tactics and mounted bowmanship were renowned. The Comanche's constant movement caused many of their opponent's older single shot weapons to miss their target in the chaos of battle. The Comanche could then easily kill their enemies before they had a chance to reload. And though it was understated, the Comanche learned to use single shot firearms quite well, though they found bows superior in terms of fire rate. The Comanche put an end to Spanish expansion in North America. They did what no other indigenous peoples had managed, defending their homeland – even expanding their homelands, in the face of the best military forces the Spanish could bring against them. In the late 18th century, the Comanche were said to have stolen every horse in New Mexico. Their raids into Mexico were so devastating, that one primary goal of the Mexican government after the Mexican–American War was a treaty that would compel the United States to end the Comanche raids into Mexico. In addition, the United States promised compensation for those raids which made it to Mexico. In the years between 1848 and 1853, Mexico filed 366 separate claims for Comanches and Apache raids originating from North of the border. The third factor was not as much a change of tactics, as an ability to inflict peripheral damage as a consequence of the changed battlefield dynamic, which resulted in the destruction of Comanche lodges, food supplies, and horse herds. This left the survivors without even the most limited means to survive. The killing of women and children had occurred before, on both sides, but this marked a watershed in terms of open use as of attacks on non-combatants as a tactic of war. The Texans had had limited success against the Comanche until repeating firearms ended their battlefield domination, and new Ranger fighting tactics took the battle to the Comanche heartland. In the face of the attack on their homeland, the Comanche were defeated and forced to retreat. Only Peta Nocona's leadership saved the day as he was able to retire skillfully enough that the entire battle disintegrated into a running individual gun battle over several miles. Aftermath The Tonkawa warriors with the Rangers celebrated the victory by decorating their horses with the bloody hands and feet of their Comanche victims as trophies. They also had containers with various other body parts which they cut off and ate in a \\"dreadful feast.\\" \\"The Rangers noted most of their dead foes were missing various body parts, and the Tonkawa had bloody containers, portending a dreadful victory feast that evening.\\"\\" The coat of mail worn by old Iron Jacket covered his dead body \\"like shingles on a roof.\\" The Rangers cut up the mail and divided the pieces as trophies. Ford triumphantly returned to Texas claiming he had killed 76 Indians, and captured 16, though Ford states 60.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, Ford requested that the Governor immediately empower him to raise additional levies of Rangers, and return north at once to continue the campaign in the heart of the Comancheria. However, Runnels had exhausted half the budget for defense for the year, and disbanded the Rangers at the end of six months.Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas. Austin: University of Texas Press, The long-term impact of this battle, and campaign, however, was dramatic. For the first time, Texan or American forces had penetrated to the heart of the Comancheria, attacked Comanche villages, with impunity, and successfully made it home. The U.S. Army would adopt many of Ford's tactics – including his attacking women and children as well as warriors, and destroying their food supply, the Buffalo. in their campaigns against the plains tribes after the Civil War. In the immediate future, this battle would represent the shape of things to come in the Civil War: it marked the first time that a state openly defied the federal government, raised its own military, and marched into federal territory in specific and open defiance of federal law and treaties.

All of this happens during a time of political tension between the United States and Russia. Disaster is eventually averted by the detonation of nuclear missiles at the poles, releasing vapor that extinguishes the burning methane caused by the CMEs.\\"'Solar Strike (Solar Attack) (2005)'.\\" Rotten tomatoes. Retrieved: April 23, 2015. Plot While a solar probe operated by the fictional Solar and Near Earth Laboratory (SNEL) is obtaining data, a large CME or solar flare destroys the probe. A manned spacecraft, Galileo, is caught in the CME and destroyed; the tragedy is blamed on defective Russian equipment. CMEs knock satellites out of orbit, turning them into deadly meteors, and a CME hits New Zealand, destroying it and turning it into a huge mass of molten rock. After a multi-millionaire, Lucas Foster (Mark Dacascos), funds a program to fight global warming, it is discovered that the Earth's atmosphere is now 5 percent methane. Multiple CMEs are bound to hit the Earth, ignite the methane, and suffocate every living thing on Earth. Foster, who is also a scientist, tries to convince his skeptical colleagues. The government officials and fellow scientist Joanna Parks (Joanne Kelly), his ex-wife, do not believe Foster either. As the CMEs strike, it is determined that 25-megaton nuclear missiles fired at the North Pole will release vapor that will extinguish the methane flares. Fortunately, Foster knows a Russian Navy submarine captain who reluctantly lets him board his submarine. Foster explains that although satellite communication has been disabled, the submarine can communicate via a transatlantic telegraph cable located at a depth of 800m. The sub is designed to dive to 700m, but the captain tells his reluctant lieutenant to dive to 800m anyway. The submarine survives the dive with minor damage. Communication between the captain and the Russian President results in the latter, who has been informed of the situation by U.S. President Ryan Gordon (Louis Gossett Jr.), telling the captain to go ahead with the plan. Meanwhile, the Russian submarine has detected a U.S. Navy submarine. Before the Russian missiles can be launched, a lieutenant threatens the captain at gunpoint, but Foster wrestles the gun away. The Russian submarine is detected by the Americans, who threaten to attack if the it does not surrender. The Russian captain launches the missiles anyway, and the American submarine fires two torpedoes. The Russian submarine releases countermeasures that destroy the torpedoes, but it still suffers damage. Foster manages to contact the American sub over short-wave radio and convince them to stand down in exchange for the Russians surrender, though Foster states that the surrender is a simple formality. The missiles arrive at the North Pole and the Earth is saved. Foster is returned to the US aboard the American sub where he reunites with Joanna and his friend Jim.

The former state owned telephone company TDC owns the entire last mile infrastructure in terms of copper telephone lines and the vast majority of the coaxial cable infrastructure as well. Even though the Danish telecommunications infrastructure is very heavily dominated by one company, Danish internet customers still enjoy fair prices and a wide availability of different next generation access internet connections in comparison with most other EU countries. Furthermore, TDCs de facto monopoly on last mile infrastructure has come under attack. In the last decade regional power companies have formed national business alliances aimed at implementing FTTH for private and business end users. In 2012, Denmark was ranked third by OECD in terms of wired broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants (see the bar chart below). The same year 99,9 % of all households and companies were able to connect to the internet via a broadband connection of at least 2 Mbit/s. As of 2015, 1.3 million Danish households are connected to the internet via TDC's coax and fiber, all of whom will soon have the opportunity to receive one gigabit per second connection. In 2012, Denmark performed poorly in terms of next generation access in rural areas compared to several other countries in the EU and the US.  History  In May 1985, The Nordic Council of Ministers granted 9.2 million NOK (roughly the equivalent of £1 million) to a Nordic university network, named NORDUnet. At the same time, the Nordic telecommunication companies created a joint company providing one-stop shopping for inter-Nordic lines called Scantele, running on a 64 kbit/s line which made it easy to create NORDUnet. In 1988 NORDUnet became operational and connected to the American National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) via a 56 kbit/s satellite line to the John von Neumann Center at Princeton University, New Jersey, and then on to the NSFnet which itself had only initiated operations in 1986 using the TCP/IP standard. Besides the US's NSFnet (which was the immediate forerunner of the Internet), the NORDUnet was also connected to a similar European network such as the European Academic and Research Network (EARN) which again connected to different National research and education networks. Around the same time as the establishing of NORDUnet, Denmark established its own national research and education network called Danish Network for Research and Education (also known as DeIC), which became operational in 1987, thus connecting the research departments of several Danish universities with one another and the world via NORDUnet. In 1994, the Danish Internet Exchange Point (DIX) was set up to facilitate easy communication between different Internet service providers (ISPs). Denmark's first broadband connections for households were offered as Internet over cable television by the country's second-largest cable TV provider Stofa in 1996, to a single town – three years before the first ADSL products were offered (see xDSL section below). In 1998 Stofa started a general roll-out to other cities and towns. At the end of 2000, Denmark's largest cable TV provider TDC launched a similar product.  xDSL  ADSL was introduced commercially to Denmark in 1999 by the then 4-year-old company Cybercity. TDC launched its own ADSL products the following year and quickly became the dominant ADSL company In 2005 a new company Fullrate established itself as a low cost ISP and managed to obtain a market share of 4,1 percent between 2005 and 2009. Fullrate concentrated its broadband products on urban areas of more than 12.000 inhabitants and ADSL2+ technology. Fullrate was bought by TDC in 2008. TDC launched its first VDSL2 products in June 2007 but until 2011 the countrywide VDSL2 coverage was nonetheless no greater than 2% only achieving 21% by the year 2012. As of the end of 2012, TDC controlled 74% of the Danish xDSL market and roughly about half of all internet connections were based on xDSL technology. As of 2013 98% of all house holds and companies were able to access a xDSL connection of at least 2 Mbit/s downstream.  Mobile broadband  A Danish chimney with 3G and 4G (LTE) antennas attached to it In stark contrast to the infrastructure of cable based internet connections the Danish mobile broadband infrastructure is owned by four different telephone companies (3, Telenor, Telia and TDC) and divided into 3 independent networks (Telia and Telenor share a joint mobile network) each with countrywide 2G coverage and close to countrywide 3G coverage. Competition is fierce and best described as an all out price war which commentators (such as ComputerWorld.dk) and the industry itself alike has characterized as unsustainable in the long run. 4G has as of 2012 only achieved 65% coverage. Per terms of several government public spectrum auctionings of 4G licenses more than 99% of the Danish population must be covered by at least a 10 Mbit/s 4G service by 2015.  FTTP  OECD countries fixed (wired) broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by technology, December 2013. Notice Denmark's third place and the mix of different technologies The traditional telephone companies have historically shown little to no interest in implementing fiber to the premises (FTTP). In 2005 this led 14 local and regional power companies to invest around 1 billion pounds between 2005 and 2013 in building a FTTP infrastructure from scratch. The power companies usually roll out fiber optic cables when they need to dig in an area due to works on subterranean power cables. = Sale of DONG Energy's FTTH network = The biggest of these power companies – the state- owned DONG Energy – did, however, sell its entire consumer-facing fiber optic network to TDC in 2009 and exited the ISP market. This left the capital city of Copenhagen and a vast area north of Copenhagen without any power company to coordinate a roll-out of FTTH with works on subterranean power cables. Since the purchase of DONG Energy's fiber optic network, the roll-out of FTTH in the Copenhagen area has practically been ignored by TDC and left to a few small companies focusing on a small number of clients. Even though the fiber optic cables were in the ground TDC emphasized the marketing of fiber optic products to the extent of not mentioning it as a product on its own webpage. Furthermore, fiber optic connections were downgraded to asymmetric speeds resembling that of VDSL2. In 2012 TDC responded to the criticism by stating that \\"the Danes don't care about fiber optics\\". TDC also emphasized that the company did use the fiber optics network it had purchased from DONG Energy, but usually as a backbone for its VDSL2 products. In the meantime the remaining 13 local and regional power companies have managed to build up a customer base of more than 250.000 house holds and as of 2013 43% of all Danish households had access to FTTH. The biggest FTTP player is FIBIA.  DOCSIS  As of 2013, DOCSIS 3 (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) contributed more than any other technology to Denmark's next generation access (NGA) coverage, 63% of all households are able to access a DOCSIS connection and 62% of all households are able to access a DOCSIS 3 connection. While DOCSIS 3 has the same availability as xDSL in the major cities it is close to nonexistent in the rural areas. TDC controls 66% of the market for DOCSIS connections via its subsidiary company YouSee while the second-largest market share of around 10% is controlled by Stofa, which was purchased in 2014 by the biggest FTTH company S.E (abbreviation for Southern Energy). S.E has referred to the purchase of Stofa as a direct attempt to challenge TDC's dominant position in the cable TV and DOCSIS market. Due to TDC's very dominant position, The Danish Business Authority has ordered TDC to open its coaxial network to other competitors since 2009. This has however not brought any new competitors to compete with TDC on DOCSIS 3 connections; this is because TDC has set up its system in such a way that any customer has to buy regular cable TV from TDC before the customer can purchase any DOCSIS 3 connection from a competitor. In 2014, The Danish Business Authority started taking steps towards new regulation demanding that TDC should open its coaxial network in terms of both cable TV and DOCSIS 3 to arbitrage competitors.  WiMAX  Until 2009, Clearwire operated a somewhat countrywide WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network with about 10,000 customers. After the bankruptcy of Clearewire's Danish subsidiary its customers were taken over by the WiMAX ISP Skyline which already had its own customer base of around 10.000 - mostly situated in Jutland and Funen. From 2009-2012 Skyline's customer base grew to about 40,000 subscribers, however Skyline filed for bankruptcy on 10 May 2012 saying that the development of 4G services along with falling market prices had made it unsustainable for the company to continue its enterprise. As of 2014, the small 10-man company AirNet operated a scattered but growing WiMAX network focusing on rural areas with poor or no broadband access and offering speeds of up to 20/2 Mbit/s down- and upstream, respectively.  Internet censorship  According to the OpenNet Initiative there is \\"no evidence\\" that Denmark is censoring its citizens internet access in terms of political content, social content, conflict and security content or web sites that provide internet tools (such as e-mail, internet hosting, search, translation etc.) A high court did however order the Danish ISPs to block the sites The Pirate Bay and AllOfMP3 in a 2008 civil lawsuit on the grounds of copyrights infringements.

The events are set in motion by beings who appear to be ancient Greek gods. Like Simmons' earlier series, the Hyperion Cantos, it is a form of \\"literary science fiction\\"; it relies heavily on intertextuality, in this case with Homer and Shakespeare as well as references to Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu (or In Search of Lost Time) and Vladimir Nabokov's novel Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. As with most of his science fiction and in particular with Hyperion, Ilium demonstrates that Simmons writes in the soft science fiction tradition of Ray Bradbury and Ursula K. Le Guin. Ilium is based on a literary approach similar to most of Bradbury's work, but describes larger segments of society and broader historical events. As in Le Guin's Hainish series, Simmons places the action of Ilium in a vast and complex universe made of relatively plausible technological and scientific elements. Yet Ilium is different from any of the works of Bradbury and Le Guin in its exploration of the very far future of humanity, and in the extra human or post-human themes associated with this. It deals with the concept of technological singularity where technological change starts to occur beyond the ability of humanity to presently predict or comprehend. The first book, Ilium, received the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction novel in 2004. Plot introduction The series centers on three main character groups: that of the scholic Hockenberry, Helen and Greek and Trojan warriors from the Iliad; Daeman, Harman, Ada and the other humans of Earth; and the moravecs, specifically Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io. The novels are written in first-person, present-tense when centered on Hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons' Hyperion where the characters' stories are told over the course of the novels and the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novels and their stories do not begin to converge until the end. Characters in Ilium/Olympos =Old-style humans= The \\"old-style\\" humans of Earth exist at what the post- humans claimed would be a stable, minimum herd population of one million. In reality, their numbers are much smaller than that, around 300,000, because each woman is allowed to have only one child. Their DNA incorporates moth genetics which allows sperm-storage and the choice of father-sperm years after sexual intercourse has actually occurred. This reproductive method causes many children not to know their father, as well as helps to break incest taboos in that the firmary, which controls the fertilization, protects against a child of close relatives being born. The old style human never appear any older than about 40 since every twenty years they are physically rejuvenated. * Ada: the owner of Ardis Hall and Harman's lover. She is just past her first twenty. She hosts Odysseus/Noman for his time on Earth. * Daeman: a pudgy man approaching his second Twenty. Both a ladies' man and a lepidopterist. Also terrified of dinosaurs. At the start of Ilium he is a pudgy, immature man-child who wishes to have sex with his cousin (as incest taboos have all but ceased to exist in his society), Ada (whom he had a brief relationship with when she was a teenager), but by the end of the tale he is a mature leader who is very fit and strong. Mother's name is Marina. * Hannah: Ada's younger friend. Both inventor and artist. Develops a romantic interest in Odysseus. * Harman: Ada's lover. 99 years old. Only human with the ability to read, other than Savi. * Savi: the Wandering Jew. The only old-style human not gathered up in the final fax 1,400 years earlier. She has survived the years by spending most of them sleeping in cryo crèches and spending only a few months awake at a time every few decades. =Moravecs= Named after the roboticist Hans Moravec, they are autonomous, sentient, self-evolving biomechanical organisms that dwell on the Jovian moons. They were seeded throughout the outer Solar System by humans during the Lost Age. Most moravecs are self-described humanists and study Lost Age culture, including literature, television programs and movies. * Mahnmut the Europan: explorer of Europa's oceans and skipper of the submersible, The Dark Lady. An amateur Shakespearean scholar. * Orphu of Io: a heavily armored, 1,200-year-old hard-vac moravec that is shaped not unlike a crab. Weighing eight tons and measuring six meters in length, Orphu works in the sulfur-torus of Io, and is a Proust enthusiast. * rockvecs: a subgroup of the moravecs, the rockvecs live on the Asteroid Belt and are more adapted for combat and hostile environments than the moravecs. =Scholics= Dead scholars from previous centuries that were rebuilt by the Olympian gods from their DNA. Their duties are to observe the Trojan War and report the discrepancies that occur between it and Homer's Iliad. * Dr. Thomas Hockenberry: Ph.D. in classical studies and a Homeric scholar. Died of cancer in 2006 and is resurrected by the Olympian Gods as a scholic. Lover of Helen of Troy. * Dr. Keith Nightenhelser: Hockenberry's oldest friend and a fellow scholic. (The real Nightenhelser was Simmons' roommate at Wabash College and is currently a professor at DePauw University.) =Others= * Achaeans and Trojans: the heroes and minor characters are drawn from Homer's epics, as well as the works of Virgil, Proclus, Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides, and classical Greek mythology. * Ariel: a character from The Tempest and the avatar of the evolved, self-aware biosphere. Using locks of Harman's hair, Daeman's hair, and her own hair, Savi makes a deal with Ariel in order that they might pass without being attacked by the calibani. * Caliban: a monster, son of Sycorax and servant of Prospero, whom one reviewer describes as \\"a cross between Gollum and the alien of Alien. He is cloned to create the calibani, weaker clones of himself. Caliban speaks in strange speech patterns, with much of his dialogue taken from the dramatic monologue \\"Caliban upon Setebos\\" by Robert Browning. Simmons chooses not to portray Caliban as the \\"oppressed but noble native soul straining under the yoke of capitalist-colonial-imperialism\\" that current interpretations employ to portray him, which he views as \\"a weak, pale, politically correct shadow of the slithery monstrosity that made audiences shiver in Shakespeare's day ... Shakespeare and his audiences understood that Caliban was a monsterand a really monstrous monster, ready to rape and impregnate Prospero's lovely daughter at the slightest opportunity.\\" * Odysseus: Odysseus after his Odyssey, ten years older than the Odysseus who fights in the Trojan War. In Olympos, he adopts the name Noman, which is a reference to the name Odysseus gives to Polyphemus the Cyclops on their encounter, in Greek, Outis (), meaning \\"no man\\" or \\"nobody\\". * Olympian Gods: former post-humans who were transformed into gods by Prospero's technology. They do not remember the science behind their technology, save for Zeus and Hephaestus, and they are described both as preliterate and post-literate, for which reason they enlist the services of Thomas Hockenberry and other scholics. They dwell on Olympus Mons on Mars and use quantum teleportation in order to get to the recreation of Troy on an alternate Earth. Though the events of the Trojan War are being recreated with the knowledge of Homer's Iliad, the only ones who know its outcome are the scholics and Zeus as Zeus has forbade the other gods from knowing. * post-humans: former humans who enhanced themselves far beyond the normal bounds of humanity and dwelt in orbital rings above the Earth until Prospero turned some into Olympian gods. The others were slaughtered by Caliban. They had no need of bodies, but when they took on human form they only took on the shape of women. * Prospero: a character from The Tempest who is the avatar of the self-aware, post-Internet logosphere, a reference to Vladimir Vernadsky's idea of the noosphere. * Setebos: Sycorax and Caliban's god. The god is described as \\"many-handed as a cuttlefish\\" in reference to \\"Caliban upon Setebos\\" by Robert Browning and is described by Prospero as being an \\"arbitrary god of great power, a September eleven god, an Auschwitz god.\\" * Sycorax: a witch and Caliban's mother. Also known as Circe or Demyx or Calypso. * The Quiet: an unknown entity (presumably, God, from the Demogorgon's speeches and the words of Prospero) said to incarnate himself in different forms all across the universe. He is Setebos' nemesis, which could create a kind of God-Against-the Devil picture as Setebos is the background antagonist and Prospero and Ariel, servants of The Quiet, are the background protagonists. * zeks: the Little Green Men of Mars. A chlorophyll-based lifeform that comes from the Earth of an alternate universe. Their name comes from a slang term related to the Russian word sharashka, which is a scientific or technical institute staffed with prisoners. The prisoners of these Soviet labor camps were called zeks. (This description of the origin of the term is a mistake of the author. Not only sharashka prizoners were called zeks, it is a common term for all Gulag camp prisoners, derived from the word zaklyuchennyi, inmate. The camp described in the A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is a regular labor camp, not a sharashka.) Solzhenitsyn, Aleksandr. A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. Science of Ilium/Olympos As much of the action derives from fiction involving gods and wizards, Simmons rationalises most of this through his use of far-future technology and science, including: * String theory: interdimensional transport is conducted via Brane Holes. * Nanotechnology provides the gods' immortality and powers, and many of the cybernetic functions possessed by some of the humans. * Reference to Vladimir Vernadsky's idea of the noosphere is made to explain the origins of powerful entities such as Ariel and Prospero, the former arising from a network of datalogging mote machines, and the latter of whom derives from a post-Internet logosphere. * Quantum theory and Quantum Gravity are also used to account for a number of other things, from Achilles' immortality (his mother, Thetis, set the quantum probability for his death to zero for all means of death other than by Paris' bow) to teleportation and shapeshifting powers. * ARNists use recombinant DNA techniques to resurrect long-dead and prehistoric animals. * Pantheistic solipsism is used to explain how 'mythical' characters have entered the \\"real\\" world. =Weapons= * Old style humansOther than flechette rifles scavenged from caches, crossbows are the main form of weapon as old style humans have forgotten almost everything and can only build crossbows. * GodsTasers, energy shields and titanium lances. * MoravecsWeapons of mass destruction including the Device, ship-based weapons, kinetic missiles. Miscellaneous What follows is a definition of terms that are either used within Ilium or are related to its science, technology and fictional history: * ARNists: short for \\"recombinant RNA artists\\". ARNists use recombinant DNA techniques to resurrect long-dead and prehistoric animals. Simmons borrows this term from his Hyperion Cantos. * E-ring/P-ring: short for \\"equatorial ring\\" or \\"polar ring\\" respectively. The rings described are not solid, but rather similar to the rings around Jupiter or Saturn: hundreds of thousands of large individual solid elements, built and occupied by the post-humans before Caliban and Prospero were stranded there and Caliban began murdering the post- humans. The rings are visible from the Earth's surface, but the old-style humans do not know exactly what they are. * Faxnodes: much as the transporter of Star Trek works, the faxnode system takes a living organism, maps out its structure, breaks down its atoms and assembles a copy at the faxport at the intended destination. This copy is a facsimile, or fax, of the original. (Unlike most science-fiction transporter technology, it is revealed late in the story that the matter is not \\"changed into energy\\" or \\"sent\\" anywhere; a traveler's body is completely destroyed, and re-created from scratch at the destination.) * Final fax: the 9,113 Jews of Savi's time to live through the Rubicon virus are suspended in a fax beam by Prospero and Ariel with the understanding that once the two get the Earth back into order, they will be released. * Firmary: short for \\"infirmary\\". A room in the e-ring that the humans of Earth fax to every Twenty (every twentieth birthday) for physical rejuvenation, or when hurt or killed in order to be healed. If they were killed, the firmary removes all memory of their death in order to lessen the psychological impact of the event. * Global Caliphate: an empire that, among other things, attempts to destroy the Jewish population of Earth. They released the Rubicon virus to kill all Jews on Earth as well as programmed the voynix to kill any remaining Jews who escaped the infection. * Quantum theory and quantum gravity: used to account for a number of other things, including Achilles' immortality, (in that Thetis set the quantum probability for his death to zero for all other means of death other than by Paris' bow), teleportation, and shapeshifting powers. * Rubicon virus: created by the Global Caliphate and released with the intention of exterminating those of Jewish descent. It had the reverse effect, killing eleven billion people (ninety-seven percent of the world's population), but Israeli scientists were able to develop an inoculation against the virus and inoculate their own people's DNA, but did not have the time to save the rest of humanity.Simmons, Dan. Olympos, p. 626. * Turin cloth: a cloth used by the people of Earth that, when draped over the eyes, allows them to view the events of the Trojan War, which they believe is just a drama being created for their entertainment. Named after the Shroud of Turin * Voynix: named after the Voynich manuscript. The voynix are biomechanical, self-replicating, programmable robots. They originated in an alternate universe, and were brought into the Ilium universe before 3000 A.D. The Global Caliphate somehow gained access to these proto- voynix and after replicating three million of them, battled the New European Union around 3000 A.D. In 3200 A.D., the Global Caliphate upgraded the voynix and programmed them to kill Jews. Using time travel technology acquired from the French (previously used to investigate the Voynich Manuscript and which resulted in the destruction of Paris), the Global Caliphate sent the voynix forward in time to 4600 A.D. Upon their arrival they begin to replicate rapidly in the Mediterranean Basin. As the post-human operations there were put at risk, Prospero and Sycorax created the calibani to fend off the voynix, and eventually Prospero reprogrammed them into inactivation. After the final fax, they were reprogrammed to serve the new old-style humans. Literary and cultural influences Simmons references such historical figures, fictional characters and works as Christopher Marlowe, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Plato, Gollum, the Disney character Pluto, Samuel Beckett, and William Butler Yeats' \\"The Second Coming\\", among others. As well as referencing these works and figures, he uses others more extensively, shaping his novel by the examples he chooses, such as 9/11 and its effects on the Earth and its nations. Ilium is thematically influenced by extropianism, peopled as it is with post-humans of the far future. It therefore continues to explore the theme pioneered by H. G. Wells in The Time Machine, a work which is also referenced several times in Simmons' work. One of the most notable references is when the old woman Savi calls the current people of Earth eloi, using the word as an expression of her disgust of their self-indulgent society, lack of culture and ignorance of their past. Ilium also includes allusions to the work of Nabokov. The most apparent of these are the inclusion of Ardis Hall and the names of Ada, Daeman and Marina, all borrowed from Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle. The society that the old-style humans live in also resembles that of Antiterra, a parallel of our Earth circa 19th century, which features a society in which there exists a lack of repression and Christian morality, shown by Daeman's intent to seduce his cousin. Simmons also includes references to Nabokov's fondness for butterflies, such as the butterfly genetics incorporated in the old-style humans and Daeman's enthusiasm as a lepidopterist. Mahnmut of Europa is identified as a Shakespearean scholar as in the first chapter he is introduced where he analyzes Sonnet 116 in order to send it to his correspondent, Orphu of Io, and it is here that Shakespeare's influence on Ilium begins. Mahnmut's submersible is named The Dark Lady, an allusion to a figure in Shakespeare's sonnets. There is also, of course, The Tempests presence in the characters of Prospero, Ariel and Caliban. There are also multiple references to other Shakespeare works and characters such as Falstaff, Henry IV, Part I and Twelfth Night. Shakespeare himself even makes an appearance in a dream to Mahnmut and quotes from Sonnet 31. Proustian memory investigations had a heavy hand in the novel's making, which helps explain why Simmons chose Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle over something more well-understood of Nabokov's, such as Pale Fire. Ada or Ardor was written in such a structure as to mimic someone recalling their own memories, a subject which Proust explores in his work À la recherche du temps perdu. Orphu of Io is more interested in Proust than Mahnmut's Shakespeare, as he considers Proust \\"perhaps the ultimate explorer of time, memory, and perception.\\" Simmons' portrayal of Odysseus speaking to the old-style humans at Ardis Hall is also reminiscent of the Bibles Jesus teaching his disciples. Odysseus is even addressed as \\"Teacher\\" by one of his listeners in a way reminiscent of Jesus being addressed as \\"Rabbi,\\" which is commonly translated as \\"Teacher\\". Movie adaptation In January 2004, it was announced that the screenplay he wrote for his novels Ilium and Olympos would be made into a film by Digital Domain and Barnet Bain Films, with Simmons acting as executive producer. Ilium is described as an \\"epic tale that spans 5,000 years and sweeps across the entire solar system, including themes and characters from Homer's The Iliad and Shakespeare's The Tempest.\\" Awards and recognition IliumLocus Award winner, Hugo Award nominee, 2004 OlymposLocus Award shortlist, 2006 References Science fiction book series Works by Dan Simmons Science fantasy novels Novels set on Mars Greco- Roman mythology in popular culture Greek and Roman deities in fiction Nanotechnology in fiction Quantum fiction Resurrection in fiction Teleportation in fiction Biological weapons in popular culture Self-replicating machines in fiction Novels about time travel Novels based on the Iliad Novels based on the Odyssey Modern adaptations of the Odyssey Modern adaptations of the Iliad ","title":"Ilium/Olympos"},{"id":"12837458","text":"Kalka is a town in Haryana, India Kalka may also refer to: * Kalka, South Australia * Kalka River (or Kalchik River), a river in modern Ukraine * Kalka, Pomeranian Voivodeship, a village in Kartuzy County, Poland * Kałka, a village in Człuchów County, Poland * Kalka Mandir, Delhi, an ancient Kali temple in Kalkaji, New Delhi * Kalka Dass, Indian politician * Kalka (1989 film), a 1989 Pakistani action film See also * Battle of the Kalka River ","title":"Kalka (disambiguation)"},{"id":"12837464","text":"Oakhanger is a village in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. Its nearest town is Bordon, which lies east, of the B3004 road. The village is part of the parish of Selborne, which covers an area of . The nearest railway station is Alton, which is northwest of the village, although Oakhanger formerly had its own military railway station, Oakhanger Halt railway station on the Longmoor Military Railway, until its closure. A Roman road passed through Oakhanger although no traces of it remain today. The first mention of the village came from a charter dating to the early 10th century, and the lands of Oakhanger were passed on by numerous families up until the early 20th century. The village contains four Grade II listed buildings, including Oakhanger Farmhouse and its three outbuildings. Oakhanger also has one pub, The Red Lion. St Mary Magdalene's Church was built in 1873. The former Royal Air Force station, RAF Oakhanger, still retains its satellite domes, although the station is now privately run. History A Roman road passed through the village although there are no visible signs of its existence. Both Roman and Mesolithic remains have been found in nearby Shortheath Common, including a large Roman hoard of 11,000 silver pieces. The village name has been spelled in various ways, including Acangre (10th century), Hohangra (early 12th century), Ochangra, Achangre, and Hachangre (late 12th century). Although the area has been settled since the Iron Age, the first mention of Oakhanger itself was in a charter from the early 10th century, which stated the boundaries of lands granted by Edward of Wessex to Frithestan, the Bishop of Winchester. In the reign of Edward the Confessor the lands of Oakhanger were assessed to be worth 40 shillings. At the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086, Oakhanger was held by Edwin, who had purchased it from Richard I. The identity of Edwin is unclear, however during the 12th century the manor was evidently held by a family that took the surname of Oakhanger – thus William de Oakhanger was in possession of the village in 1167. In 1250 James de Oakhanger, the grandson of William de Oakhanger, was inheritated the lands of the village until ownership was passed down to his son in 1279. William who died without children in 1317, leaving his brother John Paynel as his heir. Paynel died two years later, leaving his daughter Maud, the wife of Nicholas de Upton, heir to two parts of Oakhanger. In 1476, Oakhanger was held by Richard West, who then died and left the lands to his son and heir Thomas West, who died in 1525 leaving it to his son, also named Thomas. The latter died without children in 1554 and the manor of Oakhanger was passed to Lady Jane Dudley, Duchess of Northumberland; although it was described as \\"one acre in Oakhanger held in chief for the hundredth part of a knight's fee\\". On her death, the lands of Oakhanger were transferred to Ambrose Dudley, however it was reverted to the crown along with the rest of his property when he died without heirs in 1589. In the late 16th century, Richard Pescod was forced to sell his lease of Oakhanger Ponds to Richard Springham, a mercer of London, as he knew that Pescod was in debt. Pescod promised to lend him £100 or more for a \\"reasonable time\\", as well as a yearly rent of forty carps from the ponds. The lease lasted for around forty years until Pescod's death. Edward Wilcox gave the manor of Oakhanger to his only daughter and heir Margaret in 1724, who seven years later, sold the lands to John Conduit. By the will of Conduit, Oakhanger was passed on to his only daughter and heir Catherine, who married Lord Viscount Lymington in 1736. By an Act of Parliament of 1748–9 for selling the settled estates of Catherine Lymington, Oakhanger was then sold to Henry Bilson Legge. In 1750, Henry Bilson Legge married Mary, and created the title of Baroness Stawell in 1760. Their son, Henry Bilson-Legge, Lord Stawell, married the daughter of Viscount Curzon, who died without male heirs in 1820. Their only daughter Mary married John Dutton, the only son and heir of James Sherborne, from whom the manor of Oakhanger was passed by inheritance to Henry John Dutton, the last owner as of 1908. Space receiver at RAF Oakhanger. In 1905, the War Department decided to commission the Longmoor Military Railway, which ran from the Longmoor Camp near Liphook to Bordon. It was extended south to Liss in 1933, and around this time Oakhanger Halt railway station was built as the main station for the Bordon Garrison, until the line's closure in 1969. RAF Oakhanger was built in 1954 for the use of experimental space communications, when it bounced a voice signal off the moon and received it back. The station was bought out by a private company in 2003 and is now privately run. Geography and demographics Oakhanger is located in the eastern central part of Hampshire, in South East England, west of Bordon, its nearest town. The village is within the civil parish of Selborne, which covers an area of , of which is covered by water. The landscape is dominated by farms and heathland such as Shortheath Common, Oakhanger Farm and parts of the Woolmer Forest, which surrounds Bordon. The soil is described as is a wet, sandy loam \\"remarkable for trees, but infamous for roads\\". Selborne's parish contains another village, Blackmoor, which lies to the south. The Oakhanger Stream is a tributary of the River Wey and starts at Shortheath Common where it runs down to Selborne, making the overall length approximately . The village also has a small shop and cafe known as the Chocolate Frog Company, which is situated on the outskirts of Oakhanger Farm. =Climate= Due to its location in south central England and its proximity to the sea, Oakhanger receives winds with a southerly component, higher humidity and lower cloud bases than settlements further inland. At nearby Odiham the average maximum temperature in January is with the average minimum being and the average maximum temperature in July is , with the average minimum being . The village gets around of rain a year, with a minimum of of rain reported on 103 days a year. Notable landmarks The following are the listed buildings in Oakhanger. The listings are graded: *Stable north of Oakhanger Farmhouse (II) *Barn east of Oakhanger Farmhouse (II) *Oakhanger Farmhouse (II) *Stable east of Oakhanger Farmhouse(II) Oakhanger contains four Grade II listed buildings. Oakhanger Farmhouse is a two-storey house which dates from 1811 with late 19th century extensions. It consists of walls made of Flemish bond with blue headers, flat arches, and stone cills. The farmhouse became a Grade II listed building 18 July 1986. Two stables which lie both east and north are also Grade II listed buildings: the stable to the east dates from 1814 and has yellow carstone walls, whereas the stable to the north was built in 1820 and has a hipped tiled roof. The final listed building is a barn which lies east of Oakhanger Farmhouse. It dates from the 18th century and consists of timber framed walls with sections of boarding, brickwork, and ironstone. St Mary Magdalene's Church was built in 1873 by architect Moreton Glover. It is part of the Diocese of Winchester and has since never been restored nor is it a listed building. On the fifth Sunday every month the church hosts a Benefice Holy Communion.

This particular computer, owned by Ken Stone, featured on the cover of issue 11. This is the first prototype of the Talking Electronics Computer to work without corrections to the PCB trackwork. The one before had track- work errors. After debugging that, this one was made. Once it was verified to be correct, the five blue versions were made. This was then modified to fit in a rack case with a touch pad keyboard and external display for the purpose of controlling a traffic light related display at trade shows. The first of five TEC 1 Prototypes made with silk screened PCBs, on its original baseboard. This unit was featured on the cover of Talking Electronics Issue 10, and has undergone modification since then. Of particular note are the replacement keys. The TEC-1 is a single-board kit computer first produced by the Australian hobbyist electronics magazine Talking Electronics in the early 1980s. The design by John Hardy and Ken Stone was based on the Zilog Z80 CPU, had 2K of RAM and 2K of ROM in a default configuration. Later versions used a 4k ROM with two different versions of the monitor software selectable via a switch. This allowed the early software presented in the magazine to be used with the later version of the TEC-1.

This was made to test new display latches. Further modifications were made to the design before the TEC-1A PCBs were mass produced. Base configuration The base configuration had 20 keys for the main input (16 hexadecimal keys for numeric input and keys labelled AD (for address), GO (to execute a program), + and -. There was also a reset key in the standard configuration and an optional upgrade had a function key. Construction articles It was featured in 1983, in Volume 1, Issue 10 of the Talking Electronics magazine, pages 57 to 75, with relevant chip data presented on the rear cover. The series continued in early 1984 with Volume 1, Issue 11, pages 11 to 36, and pages 50 to 55. Included in this page count were two peripherals designed by Ken Stone for the TEC-1 -an 8x8 matrix display, and a relay driver board, allowing the TEC-1 to be interfaced to other equipment. Volume 1, Issue 12, pages 13 to 38, had the third instalment, including an interface for a simple plotter that was available cheaply on the market at that time, and a RAM expansion. TEC-1A was introduced in this issue with the PCB artwork presented on the inside rear cover. Volume 1, Issue 13, pages 9 to 26, had the fourth instalment, including a power supply designed specifically for it, and a non-volatile RAM module to allow data to be retained, even after the TEC-1 was powered off. This was crucial, as, up to this point, there had been no way to save anything programmed into the TEC-1, short of leaving it connected to power indefinitely. An EPROM burner was also presented, as another way to preserve your data. TEC-1B was introduced in this issue. Volume 1, Issue 14, pages 9 to 26, had the fifth instalment. The later monitor software (MON 2) was introduced, as were a crystal oscillator/clock and an interface board to allow the TEC-1 to be connected to external devices. Volume 1, Issue 15 contained further changes and additions by new staff members, as the original design team of John Hardy and Ken Stone were no longer involved. Jim Robertson released JMON to replace the MON1 (by John Hardy) and MON2 (by Ken Stone) versions of the software as well as the DAT (Display And Tape) board. A speech synthesizer using the SPO256-AL2 was presented by Craig Hart. Versions The first prototype. This was not actually called a TEC-1, and was unlike any that are shown in the photos.

More modifications were made to the layout before the TEC-1A was released. Productions runs: Runs were done in batches of 100 PCBs. Silk screen colors varied for each run of 100. The solder mask was green in most cases. Colin says an estimated 1200 were produced during an interview by Dave Jones on eevblog.. This figure is suspect. The editorial of Issue 11 states that nearly 1000 boards had been sold, and that is just after a single issue. Boards were always produced in batches of 100, so even if there was only a single run of each successive variation, TEC-1A, TEC-1B, TEC-1B CAD, TEC-1C and TEC-1D, that would bring the total to at least 1500, and that does not take into account boards that were produced by PCB houses in other countries. TEC-1. This version was identical to the five blue prototypes, with the exception of the colors used for the solder mask and overlays. The production boards from TE used a green solder mask, with varying colors used on the overlay. Colors used by second-source manufacturers varied from those used by TE.

Sitting just south of the River Stour it borders the suburb of Merley and the village of Canford Magna to the East and South and the Town of Wimborne 2 km to the North. The B3073, which links Wimborne and Poole, runs through the community. Oakley has four major roads; Oakley Hill, Oakley Lane, Oakley Road and Merley Ways and approximately 800 individual dwellings. Smaller roads include Ullswater Road, Silverwood Close and Harrier Drive.  Buildings and architecture A conservation area covers Oakley and its attractive Lady Wimborne Cottages. Oakley Hill, Oakley Lane and Cruxton Farm are all listed as containing Buildings of Local Importance by the Borough of Poole.The official website of the Borough of Poole Local Plan The Cottages date back to the late 19th Century when they were built by Lord Wimborne to house specialist workers from his Estate. The cottages were beautifully designed and so were given the title 'Lady Wimborne' cottages. Nowadays many of them have been extended, though keeping to the original style and building materials. Most of the houses in Merley Ways and Oakley Hill were added in the 1930s and 1940s. They range from large, detached, villa-style houses, to more modest bungalow residences for the more elderly residents. The houses at the bottom of Merley Ways have access to the River Stour and many families own rowing boats and canoes. Most houses have large gardens, private garages and some have swimming pools. Silverwood Close, Cruxton Farm and Harrier Drive are the newest roads in the community. The houses are large, detached and modern with those at the bottom of Silverwood Close looking out onto farming fields and the River Stour at the bottom of the hill. =The Willett Arms pub= The largest landmark in Oakley, The Willett Arms is situated on the top of Oakley Hill. Originally a private Public House, the Willett as it is referred to by locals, served travellers on the Wimborne to Poole road, as well as the Southampton and Dorchester Railway. Once the Railway line was closed the pub became less popular until the community in Merley was built and Oakley and Canford Magna began to grow. The railway line was converted into the Castleman Trailway and the Pub now serves the community, tourists, cyclists and walkers. = The Merley Community Centre = The centre serves the residence of Oakley, Merley and Canford Magna. Built in the 1960s It has two main halls and a large community lounge. The small hall is home to the Footlight Dance Academy, and the Oakley Art Club.Community centre The Val Jones Memorial Hall is home to the Merley Karate Academy, part of the Dorset Goju Ryu Karate Association and led by Sensei Penny Hughes.UK Goju karate dojo directory The community lounge is home to the Merley Social Club and tends to serve the residents of Merley. Many Oakley residents are members of Canford Magna Golf Club instead. = The old Post Office = There used to be a post office/newsagents and a small supermarket at the cross roads between Merley Lane and the A341. These closed down in the late 1970s after the shopping centre on the new Merley housing estate was opened. The old supermarket was a restaurant for many years, but is now a solicitors office. = Merley House = Merley House is an ancient manor house which belonged to Canford estate and housed Merley Bird Gardens, a collection of exotic birds in a picturesque walled garden, on its estate. It is now a holiday caravan park. = Oakley House = A small, mental health hospital for older people, Oakley House sits surrounded by fields used by a local dairy herd. The hospital was constructed in the 1850s and is staffed by the Wimborne & Purbeck Mental Health Team. It also provides support for carers. The hospital has a large garden of its own and a small wood in the grounds.  Demographics and education The community is home to mainly middle- and upper-middle-class families with a proportion of the adults being employed by Cobham plc in the field of Defence, Avionics and Surveillance Systems, and in occupations such as teaching. Many of the other adults work in Bournemouth and Poole, with some commuting to London. The Independent Canford School is situated nearby and serves the community alongside Poole Grammar School for boys, Parkstone Grammar School for girls and the mixed Corfe Hills School. Merley First School sits on the border between Merley and Oakley and many of the community's children are in attendance.  Relationship with Merley Merley, a large suburb and housing estate was built alongside Oakley and Canford Magna in the 1970s. Originally the developers wanted to call is 'Oakley Garden Village' but this met with protests from the residents of Oakley and the name Merley was chosen. There is no defined border between Oakley, Merley and Canford Magna and only the latter is signposted. Furthering to the confusion, the Oakley Shopping Centre is in Merley, whilst the Merley Community Centre is technically in Oakley. A simple way of dividing the communities is to take the bottom of Oakley Straight, pronouncing everything south and east of Harrier Drive, Merley, and everything north and west, Oakley. The residents of Oakley frequently use the amenities in Merley, which include a quality butchers, post office, doctors surgery, pharmacy, Chinese take away and a convenience store.

Life Lushington was the third son of the Reverend Henry Lushington, vicar of Eastbourne. From 1782 he was a director of the East India Company, and supported the reforms of the company being proposed by Charles James Fox; these would have brought the company under the control of a board of commissioners appointed by Parliament, and it was intended that Lushington should be one of the assistant commissioners. In 1783, as Fox prepared to introduce his India Bill in the House of Commons, Christopher Atkinson, one of the MPs for Hedon in Yorkshire, was convicted of fraud and would therefore be expelled from the House. Hedon was a rotten borough where the Foxites could expect their candidate to be elected, and Lushington's name was put forward by Prime Minister Portland to fill the vacancy. Atkinson was formally expelled from the Commons on 4 December 1783, and a writ for the by-election was issued. However, the following day the Commons amended the East India Bill to make the assistant commissioners ineligible to sit in Parliament. This forced Lushington to choose between an assistant commissionership and a seat in Parliament and, knowing that the majority of the East India directors opposed Fox's bill he decided the latter was preferable. On 15 December he was elected unopposed for Hedon, but on the same day the House of Lords unexpectedly defeated Fox's India bill and the government fell. Lushington spoke in opposition to the East India bill proposed by the new government under Pitt the Younger, which placed control of the Company in the hands of a board appointed by the Crown rather than by Parliament. In the general election of 1784 he was a candidate at Hastings, rather than defending his seat at Hedon, but was defeated. He was deputy chairman of the East India Company in 1789–1790, and its chairman for three terms - 1790–1791, 1795–1796 and 1799–1800. He was created a baronet on 26 April 1791. He returned to Parliament in 1790 as member for Helston, and was an MP for the rest of his life, subsequently also representing Mitchell, Penryn and Plympton Erle. Family Hester Lushington with her young son Stephen In 1771 Lushington married Hester Boldero (d. 1830), whose father John settled the manors of Aspenden and Berkesdon in Hertfordshire on the couple. The family were based at South Hill Park near Bracknell in Berkshire from 1787–1807. Their children included: * Sir Henry Lushington (1775–1863), who succeeded to the baronetcy * Sophia Lushington m.

Over 60% of the consumers use this type of access because of the high speeds and good service. The biggest Internet service providers (ISPs) offer fiber optic access, called fiber-to-the- building (FTTB). This type of Internet access supports a variety of services, which are offered by most ISPs: IPTV, VoIP, and Video on demand (VOD).

Since then, availability has greatly increased and as of February 2006 it was offered in 140 towns and villages around the country. With the liberalisation of the telecommunications market, it is expected that other companies currently offering broadband Internet by other means will begin offering ADSL. At the end of 2006 the service was available to customers in 208 towns and villages.

The ironworks, which ceased production many years ago, had six furnaces, with stacks high, and the engine-house was built with walls to comprise of stone below the surface of the ground. Subsequent to their use in the ironworks, the buildings were used as a sawmill producing rough timber for railway sleepers, fence posts and the like.

In 1997, a group called the Oakridge Central Regeneration group was set up with the intention of having the estate redeveloped. HTA Architects were appointed and planning permission was granted in 2000. The redevelopment was built in phases: Phase 1 consisted of mostly terraced housing, Phase 2 consisted of three-storey apartments and Phase 3 was built by a different contractor. 149 homes were replaced with 299, increasing the density of the area, but also green space. As part of the original planning, a 13-storey tower block, Oakridge Tower, was planned for demolition. After local pressure, it has been retained.

Career Rogers, who was born in Sparta, Tennessee, and grew up in Gallatin, Tennessee, began his professional career with the Nashville Vols of the Southern Association in 1914. In two seasons with the Vols, Rogers' had a career win–loss record of 17–20 in 46 games, having allowed 149 runs on 305 hits. The St. Louis Browns were close to signing Rogers to a major league contract in 1915, but they felt he was not yet ready and, instead, he continued with Nashville in 1916. On June 19, 1916, Rogers was involved in an incident in which he accidentally killed an opposing batter. Playing against the Mobile Sea Gulls, Rogers hit longtime friend and former teammate Johnny Dodge in the temple with a pitch, knocking him unconscious. Dodge was helped to stand and led to the showers where he shortly died of a brain hemorrhage. On July 11, 1916, on only two- days' rest, Rogers pitched a perfect game against the Chattanooga Lookouts at Sulphur Dell ballpark in Nashville. The Lookouts nearly recorded a hit in the second inning when Joe Harris lead off with a sharply hit line drive to right- center field. Center fielder Billy Lee made a diving catch at the base of the notorious Sulphur Dell right field incline, saving the perfect game bid in its early stages. A second great defensive play was made by Vols left fielder Gus Williams in the top of the seventh when he crashed into the left field bleacher fence in the act of catching Jake Pitler's sharply-hit ball to left. With two outs in the top of the ninth inning, John Peters came in to pinch hit for pitcher James Allen. He hit a soft fly ball to second base which was fielded by Thomas Sheehan for the final out. In all, Rogers struck out 4 of the 27 batters he faced. The game lasted just 1 hour and 25 minutes. Rogers finished the season with a 24–12 record and having allowed only 75 runs on 243 hits. His 24 wins put him in a three-way-tie for the most wins in the Southern Association in 1916. Having signed with the American League's St. Louis Browns for 1917, Rogers made his major league debut on April 14 against the Chicago White Sox at Sportsman's Park. Coming into the game in relief, Rogers pitched 7 innings allowing 4 runs (3 earned) while striking out 3 and walking 4 of the 25 batters he faced without figuring in the decision. He appeared in 24 games that year, including 8 starts, ending with a 3.89 earned run average (ERA) with 27 strikeouts and a 3–6 record over innings. He improved in 1918, pitching 154 innings across 29 games with 16 starts. His ERA lowered to 3.27 as he struck out 29 hitters and acquired an 8–10 record. Rogers pitched just 1 inning across 2 games for the 1919 Browns before his contract was sold in May to the Philadelphia Athletics for US$2,000. With the Athletics, he posted a 4.31 ERA with 37 strikeouts and a 4–12 record over 140 innings. He played the 1920 season with the International League's Buffalo Bisons. Though playing most of the 1921 season with Buffalo, Rogers, pitched five games for the New York Yankees that September. In 5 games out of the bullpen, he had an ERA of 7.36 and an 0–1 record in 11 innings of work. His final appearance came on October 7 in Game 3 of the 1921 World Series, pitching the last innings in a 13–5 loss to the New York Giants. Rogers continued to play for various minor league teams in each succeeding year, before playing his final professional season with the Quincy Indians of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in 1930. His career minor league record was 154–117, while his major league record was 15–30 with a 3.95 ERA. Suffering from emotional problems as a result of the 1916 death of friend Johnny Dodge, Rogers died prematurely in Nashville in 1936 at the age of 44.
