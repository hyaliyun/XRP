Before the Justesen error correction code was discovered, no error correction code was known that had all of these three parameters as a constant. Subsequently, other ECC codes with this property have been discovered, for example expander codes. These codes have important applications in computer science such as in the construction of small-bias sample spaces. Justesen codes are derived as the code concatenation of a Reed‚ÄìSolomon code and the Wozencraft ensemble. The Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes used achieve constant rate and constant relative distance at the expense of an alphabet size that is linear in the message length. The Wozencraft ensemble is a family of codes that achieve constant rate and constant alphabet size, but the relative distance is only constant for most of the codes in the family. The concatenation of the two codes first encodes the message using the Reed‚ÄìSolomon code, and then encodes each symbol of the codeword further using a code from the Wozencraft ensemble ‚Äì using a different code of the ensemble at each position of the codeword. This is different from usual code concatenation where the inner codes are the same for each position. The Justesen code can be constructed very efficiently using only logarithmic space. Definition The Justesen code is the concatenation of an (N,K,D)_{q^k} outer code C_{out} and different (n,k,d)_q inner codes C_{in}^i, for1 \\\\le i \\\\le N. More precisely, the concatenation of these codes, denoted by C_{out} \\\\circ (C_{in}^1 ,...,C_{in}^N ), is defined as follows. Given a message m \\\\in [q^k]^K, we compute the codeword produced by an outer code C_{out}: C_{out}(m) = (c_1,c_2,..,c_N). Then we apply each code of N linear inner codes to each coordinate of that codeword to produce the final codeword; that is, C_{out} \\\\circ (C_{in}^1,..,C_{in}^N)(m) = (C_{in}^1(c_1),C_{in}^2(c_2),..,C_{in}^N(c_N)). Look back to the definition of the outer code and linear inner codes, this definition of the Justesen code makes sense because the codeword of the outer code is a vector with N elements, and we have N linear inner codes to apply for those N elements. Here for the Justesen code, the outer code C_{out} is chosen to be Reed Solomon code over a field \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k} evaluated over \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k}-\\\\\\\\{ 0 \\\\\\\\} of rate R, 0 < R < 1. The outer code C_{out} have the relative distance \\\\delta_{out} = 1 - R and block length of N = q^k-1. The set of inner codes is the Wozencraft ensemble \\\\\\\\{ C_{in}^\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\} _{\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k }^* }. Property of Justesen code As the linear codes in the Wonzencraft ensemble have the rate \\\\frac{1}{2}, Justesen code is the concatenated code C^* = C_{out} \\\\circ (C_{in}^1,C_{in}^2,..,C_{in}^N) with the rate \\\\frac{R}{2}. We have the following theorem that estimates the distance of the concatenated code C^*. Theorem Let \\\\varepsilon > 0. Then C^* has relative distance of at least (1-R-\\\\varepsilon)H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right). =Proof= In order to prove a lower bound for the distance of a code C^* we prove that the Hamming distance of an arbitrary but distinct pair of codewords has a lower bound. So let \\\\Delta(c^1,c^2) be the Hamming distance of two codewords c^1 and c^2. For any given :m_1 eq m_2 \\\\in \\\\left (\\\\mathbb{F}_{q^k} \\\\right )^K, we want a lower bound for \\\\Delta(C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2)). Notice that if C_{out}(m) = (c_1,\\\\cdots,c_N), then C^*(m) = (C_{in}^1(c_1),\\\\cdots,C_{in}^N(c_N)). So for the lower bound \\\\Delta(C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2)), we need to take into account the distance of C_{in}^1, \\\\cdots, C_{in}^N. Suppose :\\\\begin{align} C_{out}(m_1) &= \\\\left (c_1^1,\\\\cdots,c_N^1 \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ C_{out}(m_2) &= \\\\left (c_1^2,\\\\cdots,c_N^2 \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} Recall that \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ C_{in}^1, \\\\cdots, C_{in}^N \\\\right \\\\\\\\} is a Wozencraft ensemble. Due to \\"Wonzencraft ensemble theorem\\", there are at least (1-\\\\varepsilon) N linear codes C_{in}^i that have distance H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right ) \\\\cdot 2k. So if for some 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant N, c_i^1 e c_i^2 and the code C_{in}^i has distance \\\\geqslant H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right) \\\\cdot 2k, then :\\\\Delta \\\\left (C_{in}^i \\\\left (c_i^1 \\\\right), C_{in}^i \\\\left (c_i^2 \\\\right ) \\\\right ) \\\\geqslant H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right ) \\\\cdot 2k. Further, if we have T numbers 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant N such that c_i^1 e c_i^2 and the code C_{in}^i has distance \\\\geqslant H_q^{-1}(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon) \\\\cdot 2k, then :\\\\Delta \\\\left (C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2) \\\\right ) \\\\geqslant H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right ) \\\\cdot 2k \\\\cdot T. So now the final task is to find a lower bound for T. Define: : S = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ i \\\\ : \\\\ 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant N, c_i^1 e c_i^2 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Then T is the number of linear codes C_{in}^i, i \\\\in S having the distance H_q^{-1}\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right) \\\\cdot 2k. Now we want to estimate S. Obviously S= \\\\Delta(C_{out}(m_1),C_{out}(m_2)) \\\\geqslant (1-R)N. Due to the Wozencraft Ensemble Theorem, there are at most \\\\varepsilon N linear codes having distance less than H_q^{-1}(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon) \\\\cdot 2k, so :T \\\\geqslant S - \\\\varepsilon N \\\\geqslant (1-R)N - \\\\varepsilon N = (1-R-\\\\varepsilon)N. Finally, we have :\\\\Delta(C^*(m_1),C^*(m_2)) \\\\geqslant H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right ) \\\\cdot 2k \\\\cdot T \\\\geqslant H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right ) \\\\cdot 2k \\\\cdot (1-R-\\\\varepsilon) \\\\cdot N. This is true for any arbitrary m_1 e m_2. So C^* has the relative distance at least (1-R-\\\\varepsilon)H_q^{-1} \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\\\varepsilon \\\\right ), which completes the proof. Comments We want to consider the \\"strongly explicit code\\". So the question is what the \\"strongly explicit code\\" is. Loosely speaking, for linear code, the \\"explicit\\" property is related to the complexity of constructing its generator matrix G. That in effect means that we can compute the matrix in logarithmic space without using the brute force algorithm to verify that a code has a given satisfied distance. For the other codes that are not linear, we can consider the complexity of the encoding algorithm. So by far, we can see that the Wonzencraft ensemble and Reed-Solomon codes are strongly explicit. Therefore, we have the following result: Corollary: The concatenated code C^* is an asymptotically good code(that is, rate R > 0 and relative distance \\\\delta > 0 for small q) and has a strongly explicit construction. An example of a Justesen code The following slightly different code is referred to as the Justesen code in MacWilliams/MacWilliams. It is the particular case of the above-considered Justesen code for a very particular Wonzencraft ensemble: Let R be a Reed-Solomon code of length N = 2m ‚àí 1, rank K and minimum weight N ‚àí K + 1\\\\. The symbols of R are elements of F = GF(2m) and the codewords are obtained by taking every polynomial ∆í over F of degree less than K and listing the values of ∆í on the non-zero elements of F in some predetermined order. Let Œ± be a primitive element of F. For a codeword a = (a1, ..., aN) from R, let b be the vector of length 2N over F given by : \\\\mathbf{b} = \\\\left( a_1, a_1, a_2, \\\\alpha^1 a_2, \\\\ldots, a_N, \\\\alpha^{N-1} a_N \\\\right) and let c be the vector of length 2N m obtained from b by expressing each element of F as a binary vector of length m. The Justesen code is the linear code containing all such c. The parameters of this code are length 2m N, dimension m K and minimum distance at least : \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\ell i \\\\binom{2m}{i} , where \\\\ell is the greatest integer satisfying \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\ell \\\\binom{2m}{i}\\\\leq N-K+1.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on June 21, 1952, and stars Sylvester and Tweety Bird. The title is a play on the song \\"Ain't She Sweet.\\" Plot Sylvester stands outside a pet store window, watching Tweety (singing \\"Fiddle- De-Di\\") in the display area. Tweety angers Sylvester who throws a brick at the window, after the bird goes over to a mouse and they laugh at him. However, upon seeing a cop walk up behind Sylvester, the would-be feline vandal runs in front of the brick and absorbs the blow. As Sylvester is planning to cut through the glass window with a glass cutter, a deliveryman takes Tweety away, to be delivered to Granny's house. Sylvester follows the deliveryman and rushes into the yard, only to discover a whole army of bulldogs. The rest of the cartoon contains Sylvester's attempts (all unsuccessful) to get at Tweety: *Sylvester uses a stick with an imitation cat on it, but the bulldogs clobber it. Then he paces to think up another plan. * Walking across a tree branch that extends from the outside to the house. Tweety saws the branch off and Sylvester waves goodbye and falls from the tree and Tweety starts laughing. (Tweety: \\"That puddy tat's got a pink skin under his fur coat!\\"). And Sylvester closed the gate, bruised, battered and lost most of his fur from the attack. * Using stilts to walk harmlessly above the dogs. Tweety gives the dogs some tools to cut the stilts down to size; Sylvester tries a hasty retreat but ends up just short of the gate. (This attempt was used again in Roman Legion Hare with Sam, Bugs, and the lions.) * Building a rocket, which simply sets the cat's fur on fire. * Riding a bucket attached to a wire that he connected from a telephone pole to the edge of Granny's house. Unfortunately, Sylvester's weight is too heavy for the bucket's support, and the added weight lowers the bucket down to the horde of dogs, where they wait to beat Sylvester up. * Waiting until the yard is empty and then walking unannounced to the house. The dogs run outside and tackle the cat. This time, Sylvester gets away, but before he can catch his breath, a kindly old man - thinking the puddy had simply wandered outside his home - throws him back into the yard (seemingly oblivious to the \\"Beware of Dogs\\" sign), where the dogs beat the cat up some more. * Hiding in a package intended for Granny. The original contents are dog food, which has the dogs so eager. Granny does not take the package in to unwrap (as Sylvester had expected), instead she throws it to the dogs. As she watches the dogs tear open the package to get at their \\"food,\\" Granny compliments on how hungry they were that she didn't have the chance to unwrap the package. Finally, Sylvester decides to wait until the early morning to tip-toe silently through the yard. The alarm clock goes off at 4 a.m., awakening the dogs and pummeling the cat one last time. Tweety who wakes up from the noise innocently comments: \\"Now who do you suppowse would want to distwurb dose doggies so eawly in da morning?\\" before winking his eyes at the audience and goes back to sleep as the cartoon irises out.

A member of the Dominican Order, around 1250 he moved to Montpellier, where he taught in the Dominican school. Around 1270, he returned to Silesia and entered the Dominican convent at Krak√≥w (Cracow), where he provided medical as well as spiritual care to the people. A popular and charismatic healer, Nicholas was the focus of an ‚Äòalternative‚Äô medical movement that flourished in Upper Silesia in the late-thirteenth century. He was also a favorite in the court of Leszek the Black (Lestko Nigritius), the duke of Sieradz. Nicholas‚Äôs methods were extremely unorthodox. Urging a return to ‚Äònatural‚Äô methods of healing, he attributed extraordinary virtues to toads, scorpions, and lizards. His favorite remedy was serpents‚Äô flesh prepared according to detailed instructions contained in his treatise, Experimenta magistri Nicolai (Master Nicholas‚Äôs Experiments), a compilation of his medicaments. He urged all people, \\"of whatever station, to eat serpents whenever it is possible to get them.\\" \\"Les 'Experimenta magistri Nicolai,\\" ed. John W. S. Johnsson, Bulletin de la soci√©t√© fran√ßais d‚Äôhistoire de la medicine 10 (1911):269-90. Evidently impressed by Nicholas‚Äôs doctrine, Leszek ordered that serpents, lizards, and frogs be served at his court. Nicholas was educated at Montpellier during a period when Scholastic medicine was highly developed. However, Nicholas appears to have rejected the academic medical tradition, opting instead for an 'empirical' medical system. His drugs were based upon the principle that God had conferred 'marvelous' virtues on common things like serpents and toads.W. Eamon and G. Keil, \\"Plebs amat empirica: Nicholas of Poland and His Critique of the Medieval Medical Establishment,\\" Sudhoffs Archiv 71 (1987):180-96. In fact, he believed, the more common the object, the more precious were its medicinal virtues.Brata Miko≈Çaja z Polski Pisma Lekarskie, ed. Ryszard Ganszyniec (Posen, 1920). Hence, remedies made of contemptible creatures contained greater medicinal virtues than such ‚Äòprecious' drugs like theriac (which to Nicholas was just snake meat). Nicholas invoked the authority of ‚Äòmaster Albert‚Äô to confirm his doctrine, a reference to the popular De mirabilibus mundi (On the Miracles of the World) attributed to Albertus Magnus.

Freddy, who is unemployed with learning difficulties and epilepsy, drives around on a motorbike and experiences his first sexual encounters in the rather depressing fields of the countryside of northern France. When the handsome immigrant Kader flirts with Freddy's girlfriend cashier Marie, Freddy plans to take revenge. Controversy Dumont included extreme close-ups of penetration in The Life of Jesus to emphasize the animal nature of the sex act, which takes place outdoors in a field. In order to keep a natural feel and atmosphere, the director deliberately used non-professional actors. Freddy and the other boys' sexual assault on a girl, also made for uncomfortable viewing. Dumont seemed to portray general pack behaviour as predatory, territorial and base, particularly among the younger males - with the elders of the village acting as a communal control but only as a last resort. Dumont's main aim was to maintain a gritty sense of realism, about both the subject matter and questioning the social fabric in a modern context.

Alexander Globoƒçnik-Vojka died on 16 May 1974. =Globoƒçnik-Vojka vs Austria= Following the collapse of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian bank was put into liquidation. Rights of the bondholders where settled in 1939 extra-juridical settlement. Liquidators undertook to pay $210,000 to the bondholders out of monies then on deposit with the United States Treasury. Problem was that money was confiscated by the United States Government as enemy property during The First World War. Finally, the United States Office of Alien Property transferred a sum of just over $45,000 to the liquidators and authorized them to transfer it to the Austrian Government. Rest of the money was transferred to the governments of Italy and Yugoslavia. The plaintiff, representing the bondholders claimed that the Austrian Government would be unjustly enriched if it decides not to repay bondholders. The Provincial Court for Civil Law Matters in Vienna by decree of 28 September 1951, appointed as curator and guardian of the rights of all the bondholders in the Austro-Hungarian bank in Vienna, Dr. Alexander Globoƒçnik-Vojka. By the judgment of Austria Supreme Court from 14 May 1958, the appeal was dismissed. Bondholders didn't succeed to retain money.

The delegation included fifteen people; of the delegation, four athletes participated under the Caymanian flag. In the track and field events was Ronald Forbes, who also served as the Cayman Islands' flag-bearer during the Opening Ceremony and reached quarterfinals in the 110m hurdles, and Cydonie Mothersille, who reached finals and ranked eighth in the 200m dash. Brothers Shaune and Brett Fraser, both swimmers, participated in the 100 and 200m freestyle and in the 200m backstroke, respectively. The Cayman Islands' appearance at the Beijing Olympics marked its ninth appearance since its debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. The Cayman Islands, up to and including Beijing, have yet to medal. Background The Cayman Islands first participated in the Olympics when they sent two male athletes to compete in the Montre√°l 1976 Summer Olympic Games. Between then and Beijing, the Cayman Islands participated in eight Olympic games, including every summer Olympic competition excluding the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics. The number of Caymanian athletes participating in Olympic events peaked at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona with ten athletes, but has since fallen. In the Beijing Olympics, the Cayman Islands sent four athletes--three men and a woman--to participate in two distinct sports. Two athletes progressed to post-preliminary rounds (Ronald Forbes and Cydonie Mothersille) in their events, and Mothersille, ranked eighth in the final round of her event. However, as of and including its participation in Beijing, the Cayman Islands had yet to medal. Ronald Forbes carried the Caymanian flag at ceremonies. The Cayman Islands Olympic Committee financed the participation of Brett Fraser in swim meets to prepare for the Beijing Olympics. Runner Cydonie Mothersill and swimmer Shaune Fraser were recipients of the Beijing Olympic Scholarship, which was awarded by the International Olympic Committee and paid for their training expenses. The Caymanian Olympic delegation received donations from the Cayman Islands Post Office, Atlantic Star, Ltd, and its director, Fahad Al Rashid, in addition to sponsorships that the athletes garnered. In addition to the athletes, the delegation to Beijing included eleven people. Among the rest of the delegation was CIOC president Donald McLean, athletics coach Kendrick Williams, swimming coaches Dominic Ross and Mark Block, and past president Jerris Miller. In addition to the actual Olympic delegation, the Cayman Islands sent two 17-year-old athletes--Courtney Stafford, a squash player, and Joseph Jackson, a sailor--to attend the Olympic Youth Camp in Beijing and witness the opening ceremony, torch relay, and various Olympic events. Athletics ;Men Former Florida International University athlete Ronald Forbes participated in the men's 110 meters hurdles event on behalf of the Cayman Islands.

Its appearance in Beijing marked the fourth time a delegation from Dominica participated in an Olympic games since its debut at the 1996 Olympic games, one of its smallest delegations in its history and the first Dominican delegation that did not include female athletes. Chris Lloyd ran for Dominica in the men's 200 meters and Erison Hurtault participated in the men's 400 meters. Neither advanced past the qualification rounds. Lloyd was also supposed to compete in the men's 400 meters, but did not participate in it. Track coach J√©r√¥me Romain was the country's flag bearer at the Olympics. Background Dominica is an island nation located in the far eastern rim of the Caribbean Sea that lis between the French colonies of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique to the south. The country's debut in the Olympics was in Atlanta during the 1996 Summer Olympics, and it has participated in every summer Olympics between then and the Beijing Olympics in 2008-numbering four in total. The largest delegation sent by Dominica was in 1996, and the size of its delegation decreased to four in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, then to two in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Dominica's Beijing delegation also only included two athletes, although its appearance at the Olympics marked the first Dominican delegation that included no women. As of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, Dominican athletes had not won any medals. Jerome Romain, the coach accompanying the Dominican delegation, was the nation's flagbearer at the ceremonies. The delegation of Dominica in Beijing totaled eight people. Other than the two athletes, Chris Lloyd and Erison Hurtault, Dominican Olympic Committee president Rosanne Pringle, Chef de Mission Hubert \\"Mickey\\" Joseph, Dominican Olympic Committee secretary-general Lesley Ann Green, and Youth Olympians Attainea Toulon and William Moise were also included in the delegation, along with coach Jerome Romain. Lloyd qualified for both the men's 200 meters and men's 400 meter, ranking in the top ten in the world in the men's 200 meters at the time.

During the 17 August qualification round, Lloyd was placed in the third heat. He completed the race in fifth place, finishing with a time of 20.90 seconds. In doing so, Lloyd defeated Uruguay's Heber Viera (20.93 seconds) but fell behind Slovenia's Matic Osovnikar (20.89 seconds). The leaders of Lloyd's heat included Great Britain's Marlon Devonish (20.49 seconds) and Saint Kitts and Nevis' Kim Collins (20.55 seconds). Overall, 62 athletes finished their races in the qualification round of the event. Lloyd placed 32nd. He did not advance to later rounds. Erison Hurtault competed for Dominica in the men's 400 meters dash. In Beijing, Hurtault was the only Dominican participating in the event. Born in Matawan, a New Jersey suburb of New York, and attending Columbia University, Hurtault initially tried out for the United States Olympic team, but failed to qualify, before taking the berth offered to him by his parents' homeland. Hurtault was 23 at the time of his competition in Beijing, and had not previously competed in any Olympic games.

The United States Constitution does not specify whether ownership of these lands rests with the federal government or with individual states. Originally little commercial value was attached to tidelands, so ownership was never firmly established, but the coastal states generally proceeded as if they were the owners. Some states, such as Mississippi, directly administer these lands under the public trust doctrine. The question arose for federal nations whether the tidelands for formerly independent coastal states had been ceded to the federal union on admission, or retained. The admission of the former Republic of Texas as a state in the United States in 1845 stipulated that its tidelands remained the territory of Texas. This has been an issue for oil and natural gas leases and federally funded development that affects such tidelands. For other states that were formerly independent, such as the Thirteen Colonies, there was no explicit retention of state sovereignty and the federal government had long asserted its own sovereignty over their tidelands. 20th century incidentals The value of tidelands increased when it became known that vast oil and natural gas deposits lay within their limits and that modern technology made retrieval of these minerals commercially profitable. The first offshore oil well in the Gulf of Mexico began production in 1938 in shallow water one mile (1.6 km) off the Louisiana coast; in 1947, a second well began to operate off the coast of Terrebonne Parish, also in Louisiana. United States v. California was filed by the Federal government against California in 1946. On 23 June 1947, the Supreme Court of the United States decided against California. The decision meant the loss of untold millions of dollars in taxes and leasing fees by the states. The states whose tidelands were thought to contain minerals objected strongly to the decision. The issue became important in the 1952 presidential campaign. The Republican candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower, pledged legislation that would restore the tidelands to the states. Eisenhower won the election, and, in 1953, Congress passed two acts that fulfilled his campaign promise. The Submerged Lands Act extended state ownership to three geographical miles (almost exactly ) from their actual coastline, or further if a state could establish the existence of a boundary in judicial proceedings. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act gave the United States paramount rights from the point where state ownership leaves off to the point where international waters begin. The 1953 acts did not end all controversy, however. The Submerged Lands Act, in particular, was so badly drawn up that state taxes and leasing fees had to be put in escrow, pending final resolution of the numerous lawsuits that emerged. The Supreme Court finally decided the issue on 31 May 1960, when it ruled that Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana owned the rights to the offshore lands for a distance of three geographical miles (), and Texas and Florida owned rights to tidelands within three marine leagues (), from their coastline boundaries.; In the case of Texas, the claim to special boundary limits had been recognized by Congress in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The ruling for Florida was based on congressional approval of Florida's claims when the state re-entered the Union after the American Civil War. Although the other Gulf states objected to what they considered preferential treatment for Florida and Texas, no new legislation resulted. In 1963, the United States Department of Justice settled the last of the tidelands controversies by ruling that the 1953 act gave control to the states of islands near the shore that were created after the states had been admitted to the Union.

The 2008 Saint Lucian team included four athletes that competed in two sports: swimming and athletics. Of these four athletes, Danielle Beaubrun, at age 18, was the youngest of the competitors. Dominic Johnson, at age 32, was the oldest, and was the only man sent as part of the 2008 delegation; additionally, Johnson was the only Saint Lucian athlete in the 2008 delegation who had previously participated in the Olympics. None of the four athletes advanced past the qualifying stages, and thus did not win any medals. Evans ranked thirtieth overall in the qualifying round for javelin; Johnson also ranked thirtieth overall in the pole vault qualifying round; and Spencer ranked twenty-seventh in the qualifying round for high jump. Additionally, Beaubrun ranked forty-second in the swimming qualifying stages. Background The Saint Lucia Olympic Committee sent President Richard Peterkin, Minister of Youth and Sports Lenard Montoute, Chief de Mission Alfred Emmanuel, Coach Henry Bailey, and Coach Karen Beaubrun to Beijing alongside the four-person athletic delegation. Saint Lucia was the 67th nation in line at the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which high jumper Levern Spencer was the flagbearer. Saint Lucians were unable to view the 7:00 am opening ceremony because of issues with the local cable provider. Athletics Three of Saint Lucia's four athletes competed in athletics: Dominic Johnson, Lavern Spencer, and Erma-Gene Evans. Johnson, at age 32, was the oldest of Saint Lucia's athletes to participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Erma-Gene Evans participated in athletics as a javelin thrower. The 2008 Summer Olympics was her Olympic debut. Evans moved forward through two rounds after qualifying under the B standard during her event on 18 August 2008, but did not rank in the third qualifying round. With a best mark distance of 56.27, Evans ranked thirtieth overall. She did not advance. The Beijing National Stadium, where track and field (athletics) events took place. Dominic Johnson participated in athletics as a pole vaulter, returning to the Olympics for his third time; Johnson had previously participated as a pole vaulter (and, at one time, a relay runner) on behalf of Saint Lucia in the 2000 Summer Olympics and 1996 Summer Olympics. Johnson flew to San Diego days before the competition cutoff and made the qualifying preliminary height for the Olympics shortly after winning a silver medal at the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Cali, Colombia. Johnson's event took place on 20 August 2008. With a height of 5.30 metres, Johnson did not qualify, although he tied for seventeenth place in his qualifying group. As such, he did not advance. Johnson tied with the Czech pole vaulter ≈†tƒõp√°n Jan√°ƒçek for thirtieth place overall. Levern Spencer participated in athletics as a high jumper, making her first appearance in the Olympics. Spencer trained with Coach Wayne Norton of the University of Georgia to hone her skills in the time preceding her performance in the Olympics. Levern Spencer's personal best time has been compared to medal winners in the event from the 2004 Summer Olympics. Spencer's best height cleared was 1.85, placing fourteenth in Qualifying Group B. However, during her event on 20 August 2008, Spencer placed twenty-seventh overall, and did not advance. ;Men {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Qualification !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position -align=center align=leftDominic Johnson align=leftPole vault 5.30 30 colspan=2Did not advance } ;Women {class=wikitable style=\\"font- size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=\\"2\\"Qualification !colspan=\\"2\\"Final -style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position -align=center align=leftErma-Gene Evans align=leftJavelin throw 56.27 30 colspan=2Did not advance -align=center align=leftLevern Spencer align=leftHigh jump 1.85 27 colspan=2Did not advance } ;Key *Note‚ÄìRanks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only *Q = Qualified for the next round *q = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target *NR = National record *N/A = Round not applicable for the event *Bye = Athlete not required to compete in round Swimming Danielle Beaubrun was the only Saint Lucian swimmer to participate in the Beijing Olympics. She was the youngest member of the Saint Lucian delegation, at age 18. The 2008 Summer Olympics served as Beaubrun's Olympic debut. Beaubrun did not initially qualify for Olympic standards. However, because Saint Lucia had no naturally qualifying swimmers, the country was invited by FINA to send two swimmers to the Olympics, granted the swimmer had participated in the 2007 World Championships. Beaubrun met this criterion, and was selected for this reason. At the time, Beaubrun was enrolled at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida and trained with coach Sergio Lopez. The event in which Beaubrun participated was the 100 meter breaststroke. This event took place on 10 August 2008. In the second heat of the qualifying round, Beaubrun scored third, with a time of 1:12.85.

The appearance of Suriname at Beijing marked its tenth Olympic appearance, which included every Olympic games since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City and excluded the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Its four athletes did not advance past the first round in each of their events. The Surinamese flag bearer in Beijing was not an athlete, but Anthony Nesty, the only medalist in Surinamese history (as of the Beijing Olympics) and the nation's Olympic swimming coach. Background Up to and including its participation in the Beijing Games, Surinamese athletes participated in ten Olympic games, all of which were summer Games. The first case of a Surinamese athlete's participation was at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, when it sent a single male athlete. Since then, Suriname's athletes have participated in every Olympic games except the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. As of Beijing, the country had not sent more than seven athletes to any one Games. Prior to and including 2008, one Surinamese athlete had won the two medals ever claimed by Surinamese athletes- Anthony Nesty, who won a gold medal in 1988, and a bronze medal in 1992, both in swimming events. No medals were won in Beijing. Although Nesty did not participate in any event at the Beijing Olympics, he was Suriname's flag bearer at the ceremonies. He also served as the head coach for the Surinamese Olympic swim team, having served previously as associate head coach for the University of Florida swim team and, during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the assistant coach for the Surinamese team. Athletics Then 22-year old Jurgen Themen appeared at the Olympics for the first time when he participated in the 100 meters dash in Beijing. He was the sole male Surinamese participant in track and field during the 2008 Olympics. Themen participated in the first heat during the August 14 qualification round, completing the event in 10.61 seconds and ranking seventh of eight athletes. The leaders of Themen's heat included Usain Bolt of Jamaica (10.20 seconds) and Daniel Bailey of Antigua and Barbuda (10.24 seconds). Themen himself scored directly ahead of Vanuatu's Moses Kamut (10.81 seconds) and directly behind Italy's Fabio Cerutti (10.49 seconds). All heats combined, Themen ranked 54 out of the 80 athletes who participated in the qualification round. He did not progress to quarterfinals. Then 16-year-old student of Florida's St. Thomas Aquinas High School Kirsten Nieuwendam participated in the Beijing Olympics on behalf of Suriname as its only female track and field athlete that year. Nieuwendam had not previously participated in any Olympic games. Nieuwendam participated in the first heat of the qualification round, which took place on August 18. She completed her event in 24.46 seconds, placing seventh out of the eight athletes in her heat, finishing behind Liberia's Kia Davis (24.31 seconds). Vida Anim of Ghana, the eighth competitor in the heat, never started her event. The leaders of Nieuwendam's heat were Allyson Felix of the United States (23.02 seconds) and Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka (23.04 seconds). Out of the 48 athletes who competed in the qualification round, Nieuwendam ranked 44th.

His participation in Beijing marked his second Olympic appearance, as he had participated previously in men's 100 meters butterfly at the Athenian 2004 Summer Olympics. He was the only male Surinamese swimmer participating in the Beijing games. During the August 14 preliminary round, Tjouw participated in the second heat. He completed his event in 54.54 seconds, ranking third out of the seven athletes in the heat. Tjouw ranked directly behind Malaysia's Daniel Bego (54.38 seconds) and directly ahead of Kazakhstan's Rustam Khudiyev (54.62 seconds). The leaders of the heat were Shaune Fraser of the Cayman Islands (54.08 seconds) and Bego. Overall, Tjouw ranked 55 out of the 66 athletes who participated in the event. He did not advance to later rounds. Paramaribo-born swimmer Chinyere Pigot was the youngest athlete to participate in the Surinamese delegation at Beijing; she was fifteen years old at the time of her performance, and the only female Surinamese swimmer in the delegation. Pigot has not previously appeared at any Olympic games. The preliminary round for the women's 50 meters freestyle, the event in which she participated, took place on August 15. Pigot was placed in the fifth heat. She completed her event in 27.66 seconds, taking second in the heat; Pigot fell behind Honduran athlete Sharon Paola Fajardo Sierra (27.19 seconds) but scored ahead of Nicaraguan Dalia T√≥rrez Zamora (27.81 seconds).

It is associated with some forms of eumycetoma, maduromycosis and pseudallescheriasis. Typically found in stagnant and polluted water, it has been implicated in the infection of immunocompromised and near-drowned pneumonia patients. Its asexual (anamorphic) form is Scedosporium apiospermum. Treatment of infections with P. boydii is complicated by its resistance to many of the standard antifungal agents normally used to treat infections by filamentous fungi. Pseudallescheria boydii fungal infection was the cause of death in three athletes submerged in the Yarkon River after a bridge collapsed, during 1997 Maccabiah Games. Taxonomy The fungus was originally described by American mycologist Cornelius Lott Shear in 1922 as a species of Allescheria. Shear obtained cultures from a patient of the Medical Department of the University of Texas. The microbe was apparently associated with a penetrating thorn the patient had incurred in his ankle while running barefoot 12 years before. The diseased area was found to contain hyphae-containing granules that, when cultured, led to the growth of the organism. Shear considered the fungus most closely related to Eurotiopsis gayoni (now called Allescheria gayoni). The specific epithet boydii refers to Dr. Mark F. Boyd, who sent Lott the specimen. David Malloch moved the species to the newly created genus Petriellidium in 1970. The species was transferred to the genus Pseudallescheria in 1982 when examination of the type specimens of Petriellidium and Pseudallescheria revealed that they were the same genus. Ecology An ability to tolerate minimal aeration and high osmotic pressure enables P. boydii to grow on soil, polluted and stagnant water and manure. Although this fungus is commonly found in temperate climates, it is thermotolerant and can survive in tropical climates and in environments with low oxygen pressure. Growth of P. boydii can be seen in environments where nitrogen-containing compounds are common, usually due to human pollution. Its ability to use natural gas and other volatile organic compounds suggests a capacity for bioremediation. Growth and morphology Pseudallescheria boydii is a saprotrophic fungus with broad hyphae growing up to 2‚Äì5 Œºm in width. Colonies change in colour from white to pale brown and develop a cottony texture with maturity. After a 2‚Äì3 week incubation period, cleistothecia may form containing asci filled with eight fusiform, one-celled ascospores measuring 12‚Äì18 √ó 9‚Äì13 Œºm in diameter. This fungus grows on most standard media, maturing in 7 days. Its primary nutrients are the sugars xylose, arabinose, glucose, sucrose, ribitol, xylitol and L-arabinitol. It cannot assimilate maltose or lactose; however, it is able to assimilate urea, asparagine, potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. The optimal temperature for growth is and the fungus is generally considered to be mesophilic, although it can grow at higher temperatures (up to ) as well. Asexual reproduction manifests in one of two forms: the Scedosporium type (the most common type) and the Graphium type. Scedosporium apiospermum forms greyish- white colonies with a grey-black reverse. The conidia are single-celled, pale brown and oval in form. Their size ranges from 4‚Äì9 x 6‚Äì10 Œºm and their development is annellidic. Pathogenicity Pseudallescheria boydii is an emerging opportunist. Immune response is characterized by TLR2 recognition of P. boydii derived Œ±-glucans, while TLR4 mediates the recognition of P. boydii derived rhamnomannans. Human infection takes one of two forms: mycetoma (99% of infections), a chronic, subcutaneous disease, and pseudallescheriasis, which includes all other forms of the disease commonly presented in the central nervous system, lungs, joints and bone. The former can also be distinguished by the presence of sclerotia, or granules, which are typically absent in pseudallescheriasis-type infections. Infection is initiated via inhalation or traumatic implantation in the skin. Infection can lead to arthritis, otitis, endocarditis, sinusitis, and other manifestations. Masses of hyphae can form \\"fungus balls\\" in the lungs. While \\"fungus balls\\" can also form in other organs, they are commonly derived from host necrotic tissue resulting from nodular infarction and thrombosis of lung vessels following infection. This species is second in prevalence after Aspergillus fumigatus as a fungal pathogen in cystic fibrosis lung. It causes allergic bronchopulmonary disease and chronic lung lesions that resemble aspergillosis. Infections can also occur in immunocompetent individuals, usually in the lungs and upper respiratory tract. Infections in the CNS, which are rare, present as neutrophilic meningitis or multiple brain abscesses and have a mortality rate of up to 75%. Infections have also been observed in animals, notably corneal infection, abdominal mycetoma and disseminated infections in dogs and horses. Transient colonization is more likely than disease. However, invasive pseudoallescheriasis can be found in patients with prolonged neutropenia, high-dose corticosteroid therapy and allotransplantation of bone marrow. Pseudallescheria boydii has also been implicated in pneumonia subsequent to near-drowning events with infection developing anywhere between a few weeks to several months after exposure yielding high mortality. Dissemination of the organism to the central nervous system has been observed in some cases. This species is also known as a non-invasive colonist of the external ear and airways of patients with poor lung or sinus clearance, and the first documented case of human pseudallescheriasis involved the ear canal. It has also been implicated in infection of joints following traumatic injury, and these infections can progress to osteomyelitis. Infections of the skin and cornea have also been reported. Typical host-related risk factors for infection include lymphopenia, steroid treatment, serum albumin levels of < 3 mg/dL and neutropenia. Diagnosis Detection and diagnosis of S. apiospermum is possible through isolation of the fungus in culture or through cytology and histopathology in the tissues of diseased individuals. In mycetoma-type infections, a confluence of symptoms is necessary for diagnosis, including tumefaction, draining sinuses and extrusion of grains. Furthermore, P. boydii grains and hyphae should be cultured and observed microscopically after staining with H&E;, periodic acid‚ÄìSchiff stain, Tissue Gram or Grocott's methenamine silver stain. A radiological diagnosis may be helpful in elucidating the extent of the disease in terms of bone and soft tissue involvement. Scedosporium-caused eumycetomas have been found to have thick- walled cavities and grains appearing as hyperreflective echoes on scans, while actinomycetomas show fine echoes at the bottom of cavities. Direct detection is possible in samples histochemically stained in 20% KOH followed by fluorescence microscopy with antibody. The characteristic shape, texture and colour of tissues can help identify S. apiospermum grains, which are often surrounded by an eosinophilic zone. Histopathologically, hyalohyphomycotic fungi like Scedosporium spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp. and Petriella spp. are similar in that they show septation of hyphae at regular intervals, have dichotomous branching and invade blood vessels. However, Scedosporium presents more irregular branching, sometimes with terminal or intercalary chlamydospores. In serum, Scedosporium infections can be detected by counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Molecular diagnostics appear to be promising in complementing current conventional diagnostic methods. Culture detection is accomplished by rinsing \\"grains\\" in 70% ethanol and sterile saline solution to avoid bacterial contamination prior to inoculation on growth medium. Selection of Scedosporium growth can be achieved on Leonian's agar supplemented with 10 g/mL benomyl, or on media containing cycloheximide or amphotericin B. Optimal incubation is at a temperature of . Treatment Pseudallescheria boydii is resistant to amphotericin B and nearly all other antifungal drugs. Consequently, there is currently no consistently effective antifungal therapy for this agent. Miconazole has shown the best in vivo activity; however, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole have also been used in treatment, albeit with less success. In an in vitro environment, terbinafine has been found to work in synergy with azoles against P. boydii. Echinocandins, such as caspofungin and sordarins, have shown promise in in vitro assays. CMT-3, a chemically modified tetracycline, has also shown to be active in vitro against P. boydii. Epidemiology In the United States, P. boydii is the most common causal agent of eumycetoma, and tends to be more common in men than in women, particularly in the 20- to 45-year-old age group. In the United States, the incidence of infection by S. apiospermum between 1993 and 1998 was 0.82; this figure increased to 1.33 by 2005. Pseudallescheria boydii infection was implicated in the deaths of three athletes injured during the opening ceremony of the 1997 Maccabiah Games when the Maccabiah bridge collapsed in the Yarkon River.

The appearance of this delegation marked the tenth appearance of Chad at the Summer Olympics, the first been in 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and its seventh appearance since its Olympic hiatus between 1976 and 1980. Both S√©bergu√© and Ndikert ranked seventh in their respective heats and did not advance past the qualification round. As of the end of the 2012 London Olympics, there have been no medalists from Chad. __TOC__ Background Chad is a landlocked country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern reaches of the Sahara Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the Sahel. It borders Libya to the south, Niger to the east, Sudan to the west, and the Central African Republic to the north. Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960, when it declared independence. Some four years later, the former French colony made its d√©but at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. For the next three decades, Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and upheavals by Sudanese-backed rebels; the civil war ended in 1990, although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008. During Chad's greatest era of instability, athletes from the country did not attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montr√©al, Quebec, Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR, although delegations were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008. The largest Chadian delegation to reach the Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; each time, Chad's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes. During the 1992 games, the NOC sent the nation's first female Olympian. Since then (and up to the Beijing games), at least one woman has been a part of the Chadian delegation. The smallest contingency of Chadian Olympians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when only Kaltouma Nadjina competed on the country's behalf. The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes‚Äîone man (30-year-old Moumi S√©bergu√©) and one woman (15-year-old Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert), both participants in track events. Ndikert was Chad's flagbearer at the ceremonies. Up to and including the Beijing games, there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad. Athletics Competitors in athletics events could qualify for the next round of competition in two ways. Qualifying by right was posting a high result in their own heat, and qualifying by result was posting a high result in overall standings. Ranks shown are thus those within each heat, not in overall standings. Moumi S√©bergu√© represented Chad at the Beijing Olympics in the men's 100 meters dash. Born in 1977, S√©bergu√© first participated in the Olympics at age 22 when he raced in the men's 100 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, placing seventh in his qualification heat and not progressing to later rounds. He did not attend the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, but returned to the Olympics at Beijing at the age of 30. During the course of the August 14, 2008 races in his event, when the qualification round took place, S√©bergu√© competed in the tenth heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 11.14 seconds, placing seventh in the heat ahead of Tuvalu's Okinali Tinilau (11.48 seconds) and behind Gabon's Wilfried Bingangoye (10.87 seconds) in a heat led by the Netherlands Antilles' Churandy Martina (10.35 seconds) and Japan's Naoki Tsukahara (10.39 seconds). Of the 80 athletes who participated in the events, the Chadian sprinter ranked 70th. He did not advance to later rounds. Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert competed on Chad's behalf as the national delegation's only female athlete at the Beijing games. She participated in the women's 100 meters dash, and was 15 years old at the time of the competition. Ndikert had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 15, 2008, Ndikert competed in the eighth heat against seven other athletes. She finished the race in 12.55 seconds, placing seventh; she defeated the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Franka Magali (12.57 seconds) and fell behind Papua New Guinea's Mae Koime (11.68 seconds) in a heat led by Nigeria's Damola Osayomi (11.13 seconds) and the Bahamas' Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie (11.17 seconds). Of the event's 85 competitors, Ndikert finished in 64th place. Therefore, Ndikert did not advance to round two and beyond.

The Institute was founded on 6 September 1943 by a group of local businessmen led by Eugenio Garza Sada, a moneyed heir of a brewing conglomerate who was interested in creating an institution that could provide highly skilled personnel ‚Äî both university graduates and technicians‚Äî to the booming Monterrey corporations of the 1940s. The group was structured into a non- profit organization called Ense√±anza e Investigaci√≥n Superior A.C. (EISAC) and recruited several academicians led by Le√≥n √Åvalos y Vez, an MIT alumnus and then Director-General of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the National Polytechnic Institute, who designed its first academic programs and served as its first Director-General. In its early years the Institute operated at Abasolo 858 Oriente in a large, two-story house located a block and a half away from Zaragoza Square, behind the city's Metropolitan Cathedral. As its first facilities soon proved to be insufficient, it started renting out adjacent buildings and by 1945 it became apparent that a university campus was necessary. For that reason, a master plan was commissioned to Enrique de la Mora and on 3 February 1947 what would later be known as its Monterrey Campus was inaugurated by Mexican President Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s. Because the operations of the local companies were highly reliant on U.S. markets, investments, and technology; internationalization became one of its earliest priorities. In 1950 it became the first foreign university in history to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), one of the six regional accreditation agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education. Its foreign accreditation would end up being a decisive influence in its development, as it was forced to submit itself to external evaluation earlier than most Mexican universities (1961) and unlocked additional sources of revenue, such as tuition funds from foreign students interested in taking summer courses in Mexico for full- academic credit. Expansion Its growth outside the city of Monterrey began in the late-1960s, when both its rector and head of academics lobbied for expansion. A first attempt, funded a few years earlier by several businessmen from Mexicali, Baja California, was staffed and organized by the Institute but faced opposition from the Board of Trustees once the federal government refused any additional subsidy and members of the Board cast doubt on its ability to gets funds as an out-of-state university. At the end the project was renamed Centro de Ense√±anza T√©cnica y Superior (CETYS) and grew into a fully independent institution. Aside from the CETYS experiment and the 150 hectares bought in 1951 for the agricultural program's experimental facilities in nearby Apodaca, Nuevo Le√≥n, no other expansion outside Monterrey was attempted until 1967, when a school of maritime studies was built in the port of Guaymas, Sonora. Shortly thereafter, premises were built in Obreg√≥n and courses began to be offered in Mexico City. Those premises and the ones that followed, then called external units, were fully dependent of the Monterrey Campus until 1984, when they were restructured as semi-independent campuses and reorganized in regional rectorates (see Organization). In 1987, when the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools demanded faculty members with doctorate degrees to lecture 25% of its undergraduate and 100% of its postgraduate courses, the Institute invested considerably in both distance learning and computer network technologies and training, effectively becoming, on 1 February 1989, the first university ever connected to the Internet in both Latin America and the Spanish-speaking world.

The short was released on July 29, 1961, and stars Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote. This is the final first-run Golden Age short in which Wile E. Coyote speaks, although he speaks again in the Adventures of the Road Runner featurette a year later. Plot Wile E. Coyote leaves a telephone at the hole of his neighbor, Bugs Bunny. He calls from his cave, asking to borrow a cup of diced carrots. Bugs' whiskers twitch as he sarcastically looks at the Coyote's mailbox (\\"Wile E. Coyote - Genius\\"), and realizes what he's up against. He then mocks him: \\"Are you in, genius? Are you in, capable? In, solent? In, describable? In, bearable?...\\" Wile E. grabs Bugs, ties him to a stake and prepares to complete his rabbit stew, but Bugs gets the upper hand by hopping on the floorboards, setting off a wine cork that, after it ricochets around the room, triggers Wile E.'s Murphy bed to open, crushing the Coyote into the floor, with only his head sticking out (ll to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse). Bugs makes his getaway and hops back to his hole. Wile E. then tries a vacuum cleaner to suck up the rabbit, getting a dynamite decoy instead (before the decoy explodes, he says, \\"Well, well, the boy has talent\\"), a cannon shot, which Bugs re-directs at the Coyote thanks to some underground pipes (Coyote: \\"But how? Well, even a genius can have an off-day\\"), and \\"Quick-Drying Cement\\". The cement dries into a cylindrical block. As Wile E. laughs, saying, \\"What a wonderful way to cement a friendship.\\", he runs right into the block, which tips over on top of him. Bugs then pops out and says, \\"Well, now he has concrete evidence that I'm a good neighbor\\". The final attempt is a 10 billion-volt electric magnet, which Wile E. Coyote turns on after leaving a metal carrot in Bugs' hole (hoping the bunny can eat the carrot and then be pulled by the magnet to his waiting predator). Bugs tricks him and sends the carrot right back at Wile E. Bugs' mailbox is also pulled towards the magnet, hitting Wile E. right in the face. To further batter the Coyote, Bugs throws out an iron, a frying pan, a garbage bin, and a mallet, as well as his bed and kitchen stove, all of which are attracted to the magnet. However, neither Bugs nor Wile E. expect the magnet to attract everything else with metal properties (including barbed wire, horse shoes, street lamps, kettles, cars, signs, bulldozers, iron fences, buses, an ocean liner, the Eiffel Tower, satellites, and, finally, the Mercury rocket trying to blast off into space) their way. The Mercury rocket lodges itself in Wile E's cave and explodes, along with everything else the magnet attracted, blasting Wile E. Coyote into oblivion as Bugs watches from his hole.

Jackson, The Inane Gospel of Tax Protest: Resist Rendering Unto Caesar - Whatever His Demands, 32 Gonzaga Law Review 291, at 301-303 (1996-97) (hereinafter \\"Jackson, Gospel of Tax Protest\\"). or that the amendment provides no power to tax income. Proper ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment is disputed by tax protesters who argue that the quoted text of the Amendment differed from the text proposed by Congress, or that Ohio was not a State during ratification.Jackson, Gospel of Tax Protest, at 305. Sixteenth Amendment ratification arguments have been rejected in every court case where they have been raised and have been identified as legally frivolous. Some protesters have argued that because the Sixteenth Amendment does not contain the words \\"repeal\\" or \\"repealed\\", the Amendment is ineffective to change the law. Others argue that due to language in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., the income tax is an unconstitutional direct tax that should be apportioned (divided equally amongst the population of the various states). Several tax protesters assert that the Congress has no constitutional power to tax labor or income from labor,Jackson, Gospel of Tax Protest, at 314. citing a variety of court cases. These arguments include claims that the word \\"income\\" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment cannot be interpreted as applying to wages; that wages are not income because labor is exchanged for them; that taxing wages violates individuals' right to property,Jackson, Gospel of Tax Protest, at 307. and several others. Another argument raised is that because the federal income tax is progressive, the discriminations and inequalities created by the tax should render the tax unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Such arguments have been ruled without merit under contemporary jurisprudence.  Sixteenth Amendment ratification  National Archives of the United States of America. It provides that: \\"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\\" Many tax protesters contend that the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was never properly ratified (see, e.g., Devvy Kidd).From \\"Tax Cuts, Fair Tax Schemes Keep People Herded in the Wrong Direction\\", by Devvy Kidd: \\"The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution were clearly never ratified by the required number of states; fraud was committed when they were announced ratified.\\" May 14, 2007.Christopher S. Jackson, \\"The Inane Gospel of Tax Protest: Resist Rendering Unto Caesar - Whatever His Demands\\", 32 Gonzaga Law Review 291‚Äì329 (1996‚Äì97). The \\"non-ratification\\" argument was presented by defendant James Walter Scott in the 1975 case of United States v. Scott, some sixty-two years after the ratification. In Scott, the defendant ‚Äì who called himself a \\"national tax resistance leader\\" ‚Äì had been convicted of willful failure to file federal income tax returns for the years 1969 through 1972, and the conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.United States v. Scott, 521 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1975). In the 1977 case of Ex parte Tammen, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted testimony in the case to the effect that taxpayer Bob Tammen had become involved with a group called \\"United Tax Action Patriots\\", a group that took the position \\"that the Sixteenth Amendment was improperly passed and therefore invalid\\". The specific issue of the validity of the ratification of the Amendment was neither presented to nor decided by the court in the Tammen case.See Ex parte Tammen, 438 F. Supp. 349, 78-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9302 (N.D. Tex. 1977). After the Scott and Tammen decisions, two lines of court cases eventually developed. The first group of cases deals with the claims of William J. Benson, co-author of the book The Law That Never Was (1985). The second line of cases involves the contention that Ohio was not a state in 1913 at the time of the ratification. =Benson contentions= The William J. Benson contention is essentially that the legislatures of various states passed ratifying resolutions in which the quoted text of the Amendment differed from the text proposed by Congress in terms of capitalization, spelling of words, or punctuation marks (e.g. semi-colons instead of commas), and that these differences made the ratification invalid. Benson makes other assertions including claims that one or more states rejected the Amendment and that the state or states were falsely reported as having ratified the Amendment. As explained below, the Benson arguments have been rejected in every court case where they have been raised, and were explicitly ruled to be fraudulent in 2007. Benson contended that in Kentucky, the legislature acted on the amendment without having received it from the governor, and that the governor of the state was to transmit the proposed amendment to the state legislature. Benson also contended that the version of the amendment that the Kentucky legislature made up and acted upon omitted the words \\"on income\\" from the text, and that the legislature therefore was not even voting on an income tax. Benson asserted that once this error was corrected, the Kentucky senate rejected the amendment, although Philander Knox counted Kentucky as having approved it. Benson also contended that in Oklahoma, the legislature changed the wording of the amendment so that its meaning was virtually the opposite of what was intended by Congress, and that this was the version they sent back to Knox. Benson alleged that Knox counted Oklahoma as having approved it, despite a memo from his chief legal counsel, Reuben Clark, that states were not allowed to change the proposal in any way. Benson argued that attorneys who studied the subject had agreed that Kentucky and Oklahoma should not have been counted as approvals by Philander Knox, and that if any state could be shown to have violated its own state constitution or laws in its approval process, then that state's approval would have to be thrown out. The earliest reported court cases where Benson's arguments were actually raised appear to be United States v. Wojtas611 F. Supp. 118 (N.D. Ill. 1985), at . and United States v. House.617 F. Supp. 237, 87-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9562 (W.D. Mich. 1985), at . Benson testified in the House case to no avail. The Benson contention was comprehensively addressed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Thomas:788 F.2d 1250 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. den. 107 S.Ct. 187 (1986). Benson was unsuccessful with his Sixteenth Amendment argument when he had his own legal problems. He was prosecuted for tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns. The court rejected his Sixteenth Amendment \\"non- ratification\\" argument in United States v. Benson.941 F.2d 598, 91-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 50,437 (7th Cir. 1991). William J. Benson was convicted of tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns in connection with over $100,000 of unreported income, and his conviction was upheld on appeal. He was sentenced to four years in prison and five years of probation.67 F.3d 641, 95-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 50,540 (7th Cir. 1995). On December 17, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that Benson's non-ratification argument constituted a \\"fraud perpetrated by Benson\\" that had \\"caused needless confusion and a waste of the customers' and the IRS' time and resources\\".Memorandum Opinion, p. 14, December 17, 2007, docket entry 106, United States v. Benson, case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The court stated: \\"Benson has failed to point to evidence that would create a genuinely disputed fact regarding whether the Sixteenth Amendment was properly ratified or whether United States Citizens are legally obligated to pay federal taxes.\\"Memorandum Opinion, p. 9, December 17, 2007, docket entry 106, United States v. Benson, case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.

Benson, case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The court granted an injunction under prohibiting Benson from promoting the theories in Benson's \\"Reliance Defense Package\\" (containing the non-ratification argument), which the court referred to as \\"false and fraudulent advice concerning the payment of federal taxes\\".Memorandum Opinion, p. 9 & 20, December 17, 2007, docket entry 106, United States v. Benson, case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.Permanent Injunction, Jan. 10, 2008, docket entry 116, United States v. Benson, case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. Benson appealed that decision, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit also ruled against Benson. The Court of Appeals stated: The Court of Appeals also ruled that the government could obtain a ruling ordering Benson to turn his customer list over to the government.Entry 58, p. 18, April 6, 2009, case no. 08-1312 and case no. 08-1586, United States v. Benson, 561 F.3d 718 (7th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, no. 09-464 (Nov. 30, 2009). Benson petitioned the United States Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court rejected his petition on November 30, 2009.Cert. denied, no. 09-464 (Nov. 30, 2009). In Stubbs v. Commissioner, Charles Stubbs argued that he had no Federal income tax liability because the Sixteenth Amendment had not been ratified properly. The Court rejected that argument, stating: \\"we find Stubbs' argument without merit. Notification by a state that it has ratified an amendment is binding upon the Secretary of State, and his official certification of ratification is conclusive upon the courts. ... Stubbs' assertion of fraudulent behavior on the part of the Secretary of State in certifying ratification does not remove the Secretary's determination from this conclusive effect.\\"Stubbs v. Commissioner, 797 F.2d 936 (11th Cir. 1986), at . Similar Sixteenth Amendment arguments have been uniformly rejected by other United States Circuit courts in other cases including Sisk v. Commissioner;791 F.2d 58, 86-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9433 (6th Cir. 1986), at . United States v. Sitka;845 F.2d 43, 88-1 U.S. Tax Cas.

The non-ratification argument has been specifically deemed legally frivolous in Brown v. Commissioner;53 T.C.M. (CCH) 94, T.C. Memo 1987-78, CCH Dec. 43,696(M) (1987). Lysiak v. Commissioner;816 F.2d 311, 87-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9296 (7th Cir. 1987), at . and Miller v. United States.868 F.2d 236, 89-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9184 (7th Cir. 1989). =Ohio's statehood= Another argument made by some tax protesters is that because the United States Congress did not pass an official proclamation (Pub. L. 204) recognizing the date of Ohio's 1803 admission to statehood until 1953 (see Ohio ¬ß Statehood and settlement), Ohio was not a state until 1953 and therefore the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified. The earliest reported court case where this argument was raised appears to be Ivey v. United States,76-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9682, 38 Amer. Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 76-5909 (E.D. Wisc. 1976). some sixty-three years after the ratification and 173 years after Ohio's admission as a state. This argument was rejected in the Ivey case, and has been uniformly rejected by the courts. See also McMullen v. United States,77-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9142, 39 Amer. Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 77-628 (W.D. Tenn. 1976). McCoy v. Alexander,77-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9504, 40 Amer. Fed.

Ga. 1979). In this case, the court stated: \\"The court takes note that Ohio was admitted to the union on March 1, 1803, has participated in all presidential elections and ratification procedures since that time, and has been generally afforded all rights and privileges to which a state is entitled. At such a late date this court will not entertain an action seeking to void the actions of and benefits accruing to the state of Ohio when it has been receiving those benefits and exercising those rights unfettered for over 175 years.\\" and Knoblauch v. Commissioner.749 F.2d 200, 85-1 U.S. Tax. Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9109 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 830 (1985). Further, even if Ohio's ratification was not valid, the Amendment was ratified by 41 other states, well in excess of the 36 needed for it to be properly ratified. In Baker v. Commissioner, the court stated: The argument that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified and variations of this argument have been officially identified as legally frivolous federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a)., as amended by section 407 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922 (Dec. 20, 2006). See Notice 2008-14, I.R.B. 2008-4 (Jan. 14, 2008), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (superseding Notice 2007-30); see also Notice 2010-33, I.R.B. 2010-17 (April 26, 2010). The United States continues to recognize 1803 as the date when Ohio became a state, President Thomas Jefferson having signed, on February 19, 1803, an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and proposed state constitution.An act to provide for the due execution of the laws of the United States, within the state of Ohio, ch. 7, (Feb. 19, 1803). The resolution regarding this admission signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 recognizes March 1, 1803, as the date of Ohio's admittance into the Union.Joint Resolution for admitting the State of Ohio into the Union, ().Clearing up the Confusion surrounding Ohio's Admission to Statehood  Sixteenth Amendment effectiveness = Repeal clause = Some protesters have argued that because the Sixteenth Amendment does not contain the words \\"repeal\\" or \\"repealed\\", the Amendment is ineffective to change the law.Public Judicial Notice #3, Hour of the Time, December 16, 1999 According to legal commentator Daniel B. Evans: In Buchbinder v. Commissioner, the taxpayers cited the case of Eisner v. Macomber and argued that \\"the Sixteenth Amendment must be interpreted so as not to 'repeal or modify' the original Articles of the Constitution\\".67 T.C.M. (CCH) 1934, T.C. Memo. 1994-7, CCH Dec. 49,608(M) (1994). The United States Tax Court rejected that and all other arguments by Bruce and Elaine Buchbinder (the taxpayer-petitioners), stating: \\"We will not dress petitioners' frivolous tax-protester ramblings with a cloak of respectability. ... We find that petitioners in this case have pursued a frivolous cause of action. We find that they are liable for a penalty in the amount of $250.00 under the provisions of [Internal Revenue Code] section 6673.\\"Id. The actual statement by the United States Supreme Court in Eisner v. Macomber is that the Sixteenth Amendment \\"shall not be extended by loose construction, so as to repeal or modify, except as applied to income, those provisions of the Constitution that require an apportionment according to population for direct taxes upon property, real and personal ... In order, therefore, that the clauses cited from Article I of the Constitution may have proper force and effect, save only as modified by the Amendment ... it becomes essential to distinguish between what is and what is not 'income'.\\", 1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 32 (italics added). = Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co. = In Parker v. Commissioner, tax protester Alton M. Parker, Sr.,In its decision, the Court of Appeals specifically referred to Parker's tax returns as being \\"protest\\" returns. Parker v. Commissioner, 724 F.2d 469, 84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9209 (5th Cir. 1984). challenged the levying of tax upon individual income, based on language in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.,. to the effect that the Sixteenth Amendment \\"conferred no new power of taxation, but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged\\".Parker v. Commissioner, 724 F.2d 469, 84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9209 (5th Cir. 1984). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected Parker's argument, and stated that Parker's proposition is \\"only partially correct, and in its critical aspect, is incorrect\\". The Court of Appeals re-affirmed that the Congress has the power to impose the income tax, and stated that the Sixteenth Amendment \\"merely eliminates the requirement that the direct income tax be apportioned among the states\\". The court ruled that Parker had raised a \\"frivolous\\" appeal. Tax protesters argue that in light of this language, the income tax is unconstitutional in that it is a direct tax and that the tax should be apportioned (divided equally amongst the population of the various states).The purpose of inserting the phrase \\"divided equally amongst the population of the various states\\" is unclear. By definition, an apportionment of a tax among the states according to the population of each state in a nation where no two states have exactly the same population mathematically results in the total dollar amount of tax being unequal on a state-by-state basis. The purpose of this language may, however, be to signify that although the tax would necessarily vary on a state-by-state basis, the dollar amount of tax would theoretically be equal for each person. The above quoted language in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co. is not a holding of law in the case. (Compare Ratio decidendi, Precedent, Stare decisis and Obiter dictum for a fuller explanation.) The quoted language regarding the \\"complete and plenary power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning\\" is a reference to the power granted to Congress by the original text of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The reference to \\"being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it [the income tax] belonged\\" is a reference to the effect of the 1895 Court decision in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,, affirmed on rehearing, . where taxes on income from property (such as interest income and dividend income) ‚Äì which, like taxes on income from labor, had always been considered indirect taxes (and therefore not subject to the apportionment rule) ‚Äì were, beginning in 1895, treated as direct taxes. The Sixteenth Amendment overruled the effect of Pollock,Boris I. Bittker, Constitutional Limits on the Taxing Power of the Federal Government, The Tax Lawyer, Fall 1987, Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 3 (American Bar Ass'n) (Pollock case \\"was in effect reversed by the sixteenth amendment\\").William D. Andrews, Basic Federal Income Taxation, p. 2, Little, Brown and Company (3d ed. 1985) (\\"In 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was adopted, overrruling Pollock.\\").Sheldon D. Pollack, \\"Origins of the Modern Income Tax, 1894-1913,\\" 66 Tax Lawyer 295, 323-324, Winter 2013 (Amer. Bar Ass'n). making the source of the income irrelevant with respect to the apportionment rule, and thereby placing taxes on income from property back into the category of indirect taxes such as income from labor (the Sixteenth Amendment expressly stating that Congress has power to impose income taxes regardless of the source of the income, without apportionment among the states, and without regard to any census or enumeration). The Court noted that the case \\"was commenced by the appellant [John R. Stanton] as a stockholder of the Baltic Mining Company, the appellee, to enjoin [i.e., prevent] the voluntary payment by the corporation and its officers of the tax assessed against it under the income tax section of the tariff act of October 3, 1913\\". On a direct appeal from the trial court, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, which had dismissed Stanton's motion (i.e., had rejected Stanton's request) for a court order to prevent Baltic Mining Company from paying the income tax. Stanton argued that the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied \\"to mining companies and their stockholders equal protection of the laws and deprive[d] them of their property without due process of law\\". The Court rejected that argument. Stanton also argued that the Sixteenth Amendment \\"authorizes only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform\\" and that therefore the income tax was \\"not within the authority of that Amendment\\". The Court also rejected this argument. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Act, contradicts those tax protesters' arguments that the income tax is unconstitutional under either the Fifth Amendment or the Sixteenth Amendment. =Summary= According to the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress, a total of forty-two states have ratified the amendment.Senate Document # 108-17, 108th Congress, Second Session, The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002, at pp. 33-34, footnote 8, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, U.S. Gov't Printing Office (2004), at . Tax lawyer Alan O. Dixler wrote: In Abrams v. Commissioner, the United States Tax Court stated: \\"Since the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, it is immaterial with respect to income taxes, whether the tax is a direct or indirect tax. The whole purpose of the Sixteenth Amendment was to relieve all income taxes when imposed from [the requirement of] apportionment and from [the requirement of] a consideration of the source whence the income was derived.\\"82 T.C. 403, CCH Dec. 41,031 (1984).

Two athletes from Djibouti were selected to compete in the Beijing games; Mahamoud Farah in the track and field 1500 meters and Fathia Ali Bouraleh in the track and field 100 m. Athletics Djibouti was represented by one male athlete at the 2008 Olympics in athletics: Mahamoud Farah, a 1500 meters runner. It was Farah's Olympic debut but he had previously competed in the 2007 IAAF World Championships. He competed on 15 August in Beijing, and finished 8th out of 12 in heat four in a time of 3minutes and 43.62seconds. He was 8.83seconds behind the winner of his heat, Mohamed Moustaoui. Overall he finished 42nd out of 53 athletes, and he was 1.32seconds slower than the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-final round and, therefore, that was the end of his competition.

He was an important influence to the poet Sreƒçko Kosovel. He was one of the participants of the artistic activity known as the Novo Mesto Spring (Novome≈°ka pomlad) in 1920, which marked the beginning of Slovenian modernism. The poet Miran Jarc portrayed him in the semi- autobiographical novel Novo mesto in the character of Andrej Vrezec.  Biography  Podbev≈°ek was born at Grm manor near the Lower Carniolan village of Kandija, today part of the town of Novo Mesto. The region was then part of the Duchy of Carniola in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is now in Slovenia. The manor was owned by a noble family of Czech origin who had donated it to the Carniolan Agricultural Association, which ran an agricultural school in the building. Anton Podbev≈°ek's father, who originally came from Upper Carniola, worked in the school as a janitor, and the family lived in the manor until 1911. Between 1909 and 1917, Podbev≈°ek attended the Novo Mesto Grammar School, where he was a schoolmate of the poet Miran Jarc and the gymnast Leon ≈†tukelj. During his school years, he also established a friendship with the painter Bo≈æidar Jakac, author Fran Albreht, and composer Marij Kogoj, who lived and studied in Novo Mesto. Podbev≈°ek started writing poetry in high school: he was initially influenced by the aesthetic modernism of Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, but soon fell under the influence of avant-garde movements, especially Italian ones. He first attempted to enter literature with the poem cycle ≈Ωolta pisma (Yellow Letters), which he wrote at age 16. This work shows that he was initially influenced by Italian Futurism.Europa! Europa?: The Avant-Garde, Modernism and the Fate of a Continent by Sascha Bru, Jan Baetens, Peter Nicholls, Benedikt Hjarta; p. 40 In 1917, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and sent to the Italian front. He was wounded and spent the last months of the war in a military hospital in Tolmezzo in Friuli. Upon his return, he re-established the contact with his artist friends from Novo Mesto with the intention to establish an avant-garde artistic community, based on the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk: a total work of art that would incorporate literature, music and visual arts. In 1920, he helped organize a modernist artistic event known as the Novo Mesto Spring (Novome≈°ka pomlad), together with the composer Marij Kogoj, poet Miran Jarc, and painter Bo≈æidar Jakac. He went on to become a founder of the journal Trije labodje (Three Swans), but later broke with its co-editor Josip Vidmar: Podbev≈°ek wanted a more revolutionary and socialist orientation of the journal, while Vidmar rejected political activism and avant-garde orientations in the name of the classicist notion of \\"pure art.\\" This led Podbev≈°ek to leave the Trije labodje circle and to create Rdeƒçi pilot (The Red Pilot), which only lasted for two issues. In the journal, he also published the essay \\"Political Art\\" (Politiƒçna umetnost) was one of the first avant-garde manifestos in Slovene.Impossible Histories, pp. 43‚Äì48 and 78 In 1925, he published his only collection of poems, ƒålovek z bombami (\\"Man with Bombs\\"). After the 1920s, he became less active, but in 1939 he made notable translations of Walt Whitman to celebrate the poet's 120th birthday.Walt Whitman & the world by Gay Wilson Allen and Ed Folsom, p. 291 In the mid-1960s, he became active again, influenced by the emergence of new Slovene avant-gardism (especially the OHO group, and the poetry of Toma≈æ ≈†alamun). However, his intention of republishing the Man with Bombs was never realized.  Work  Anton Podbev≈°ek was the beginner and main representative of the first, radical phase of the Slovenian historical avant-gardes. He deviated from the established poetic forms: in his poems, he used free verse, a nominal or telegraphic style and unusual imagery. He gradually moved from relatively simple poems to longer, graphical hymns in lyrical prose. The themes of his poetry were existential experiences, war, as well as romantic themes. His poems are characterized by the so-called titanic lyric subject, resulting from the neo-romantic lyrical subject, with the features of Nietzschean superman and Whitman's pantheism. In addition, many poems reveal a strong expressionist influence. Podbev≈°ek's initial enthusiasm for futurism was later attenuated: what remained from the futurist influences was the celebration of art and some stylistical elements, but even those can actually be attributed to the emerging expressionism. Differently from the futurists, Podbev≈°ek had a highly ambivalent attitude to the war.  Legacy  Podbev≈°ek's work was highly influential for the Slovene constructivists, who mostly came from the Slovenian Littoral (including Trieste and Gorizia): particularly the poet Sreƒçko Kosovel, but also the painters Avgust ƒåernigoj and Ivan ƒåargo, and theater director Ferdo Delak, who later consciously distanced themselves from Podbev≈°ek. In the 1960s, the Slovenian neo-avant- garde re-discovered Podbev≈°ek's work, although few of them were directly influenced by him. In 2006 the Anton Podbev≈°ek Theater was founded in Novo Mesto and named after him.

Though the floor of the nose and inferior turbinate are the most common sites, the lesions may appear elsewhere too. Traumatic inoculation from one site to others is common.

The NAFCU hosts conferences,\\"NAFCU Conference to Provide New Ideas for Growth,\\" Credit Union Times, July 9, 2008 publishes original research on issues relating to the credit union industry, \\"Will Only The Big Dogs Survive?,\\" Credit Union Journal, July 18, 2007 and provides testimony before the United States Congress on issues relating to credit unions and the financial services industry. The organization was founded in 1967 and is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. Advocacy The NAFCU supported the CFPB Rural Designation Petition and Correction Act (H.R. 2672; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to establish an application process that would allow a person to get their county designated as \\"rural\\" for purposes of a federal consumer financial law. One practical effect of having a county designated \\"rural\\" is that people can qualify for some types of mortgages by getting them exempted from the CFPB's qualified mortgage rule. The NAFCU argued that the bill \\"would be helpful to small creditors, including credit unions, offering mortgages with balloon-payment features in underserved areas, because it would allow them to satisfy the rule‚Äôs 'ability to repay' requirements.\\" The NAFCU thought that the application process described by this bill would make \\"the process for obtaining a rural designation fairer and more transparent.\\" The NAFCU supported the Credit Union Share Insurance Fund Parity Act (H.R. 3468; 113th Congress), a bill that would expand federal deposit insurance to include Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts (IOLTAs) and similar escrow accounts housed within credit unions. Vice President of Legislative Affairs Brad Thaler said that \\"we applaud the committee for taking the steps today to advance regulatory relief for community institutions and hope that this will be the start of an ongoing effort.\\" The NAFCU said that the bill \\"would advance parity for accounts in credit unions and banks protected by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and FDIC Bank Insurance Fund\\" which \\"reflects a key element of NAFCU's five-point plan for credit union regulatory relief.\\" The NAFCU supported the Mortgage Choice Act of 2013 (H.R. 3211; 113 Congress), a bill that would direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to amend its regulations related to qualified mortgages to reflect new exclusions made by this bill. The NAFCU called the bill \\"bipartisan commonsense legislation.\\" According to the NAFCU, the bill would make changes to a \\"troublesome definition\\" found in the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that currently results in many affiliated loans not qualifying as Qualified Mortgages. According to the NAFCU, this leads to credit unions not offering such loans which causes consumers to \\"lose the ability to choose to take advantage of the convenience and market efficiencies offered by one-stop shopping.\\" See also *Credit Union National Association *National Credit Union Administration  References  External links  *NAFCU web site Trade associations based in the United States Credit unions of the United States Banking organizations ","title":"National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions"},{"id":"18557740","text":"Carey Burtt is a filmmaker and musician based in New York City, mainly working in the underground genre.

The track first opened in the late '60s. It hosted what was to become a popular annual event in the '70s: The Gold Cup...the track boasts the longest shutdown area on the East Coast, at . It was owned and operated by Bob and Donna Metcalfe, who bought it in 1986 and had an abbreviated opening season beginning in August of that year. The first full season in 1987 had sanctioning from NHRA (National Hot Rod Association). In anticipation of hosting National Events, a change of sanctioning bodies was made to IHRA International Hot Rod Association in 1989 and held its first IHRA Empire Nationals the following year. Many schedule changes and facility improvements were made under Metcalfe's ownership. It once ran \\"test and tune\\" and bracket racing for trophies on Wednesday nights. Friday night the track was open to everyone for test and tune. Once a month the track held a \\"MOMS events usually on a Friday night. MOMS stands for Mustang on Mustang Shootout, and has been running pro-tree & heads-up at NYIRP since 1994. Typically fifty to one hundred plus Mustangs regularly show up to each of these events.

Human colonization and disease Geotrichum candidum is also a frequent member of the human microbiome, notably associated with skin, sputum and feces where it occurs in 25-30% of specimens. The fungus can cause an infection known as geotrichosis, affecting the oral, bronchial, skin and bronchopulmonary epithelia. The inoculum may arise from endogenous or exogenous sources. In 1847 Bennett described Geotrichum candidum causing a superinfection in the tuberculous cavity. Bennett was able to differentiate infection by Geotrichum candidum from candidiasis, and diagnose the first case of geotrichosis. Other early medical case reports in 1916 and 1928 also described lung infections. Most cases affect the bronchopulmonary tree, although other sites can be involved, such as oral mucosa and vagina. Skin and gut infections are also known. Reported cases of geotrichosis have been characterized with symptoms of chronic or acute bronchitis. Exogenous geotrichosis may arise from contact with contaminated soil, fruits or dairy products. *Pulmonary geotrichosis is the most frequent form of geotrichosis. The symptoms appear to be secondary symptoms of tuberculosis. This includes symptoms such as light, thick, grey sputum, which in some cases may be blood-tinged. Patients often have a cough that produces clear or yellow sputum. Another symptom of pulmonary geotrichosis includes fine to medium rales. Patients may develop fever, rapid pulse and leukocytosis. The condition appears chronic with the presence of a little debilitation and fever. There is no chest pain and occasional wheezing can occur. *Bronchial geotrichosis does not involve the lung instead the disease persists within the bronchial. Geotrichum candidum grows in the lumen of the bronchi. The disease is characterized as an endobronchial infection. Bronchial geotrichosis is similar to the allergic reaction of aspergillosis. Symptoms include prominent chronic cough, gelatinous sputum, lack of fever and medium to coarse rales. Patients with the bronchial condition their pulse and respiration are rarely elevated. Fine mottling may be present in the middle or basilar pulmonary region. Colonization of the bronchi can be associated with Candida albicans and usually occur with patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. *Oral and vaginal geotrichosis is similar to thrush in its appearances and was often confused with this infection. The difference between oral and vaginal geotrichosis can be determined using microscope analysis. The infected area forms a white plaque and patients usually report burning sensation in the affected areas. The vaginal geotrichosis is more common in pregnant women and is often associated with vaginitis. *Gastrointestinal geotrichosis is enterocolitis associated with glutamic therapy. The symptoms usually stop once the glutamic therapy is discontinued. Establishment of the etiology of the fungi is difficult since G. candidum is found within the gut normal flora. The difference between normal gut flora form and the disease causing form is the production of toxins. *Cutaneous geotrichosis has two different types of variants which include superficial and deep infection. The superficial form the infection occurs on skin folds including submammary, inguinal, perianal and interdigital folds. The deep form develops nodules, tumours and ulcers on legs, face and hands. Geotrichosis can cause a cystic lesion appears as soft tissue on the skin. Diagnosis=Laboratory culture= The diagnoses of geotrichosis cannot be determined without using culture or microscopic measurements. The laboratory diagnosis of geotrichosis involves collected fungi samples areas of infections without contamination. Scraping of the mouth lesions and the ulcers can provide a sample of G. candidum. Samples can also be collected from pus and mucus can be obtained from the feces. Sputum can be searched for the mucoid-like white flakes for further examination. Culturing the cylindrical barrel-shaped or elliptical fungi in considerable numbers in oral lesions is an indicator that a patient may have geotrichosis. Under the microscope the fungi appears yeast-like and septate branching hyphae that can be broken down into chains or individual arthrospores. Arthrospores appear rectangular with flat or rounded ends. Under the microscope the arthroconidia size range from 6-12Œºm x 3-6Œºm. Arthroconidia and coarse true hyphae can be observed can be observed under the microscope. Another identification method for G. candidum is selective isolation method. A selection isolation method based on the fungi tolerance to novobiocin and carbon dioxide can determine if G. candidum is the cause of illness. =Diagnostic imaging= X-rays can be used to examine the lung tissue, however it can not be used to positively diagnose geotrichosis. X-rays may show cavitation that is located the walls of the lungs tissues. The lung tissue resemble the early signs of tuberculosis. The results of an x-ray examination of pulmonary geotrichosis presents smooth, dense patchy infiltrations and some cavities. Bronchial geotrichosis shows peribronchial thickening with fine mottling may be present on middle or basilar pulmonary fields. Bronchial geotrichosis usually present itself as non-specific diffuse peribronchical infiltration. Treatment Geotrichosis generally has a good prognosis and patients generally have successful recovery. However, there is not a standard treatment for geotrichosis. There are several types of antimicrobial or antifungal compounds that can be used for geotrichosis treatment. Another method of treatment involves symptomatic care, bed rest, iodine therapy, aerosol nystatin and amphotericin B. Azole drugs including isoconazole and clotrimazole are used for geotrichosis treatment. Associated treatment for pulmonary geotrichosis includes the use of potassium iodide, sulfonamides or colistin. The associated asthma can be treated with desensitization and prednisolone. Amphotericin B, clotrimazole and S-fluorocytosine have become more susceptible to G. candidum.

The group were graduates of the Hanoar Haoved Movement and the first to form a unit in the Palmach. They initially settled on a hill around two kilometres south of modern Ami'ad, naming their settlement Jubb Yosef after the nearby ruins.

They constituted one of the most popular genres in early modern scientific publishing. The books of secrets contained hundreds of medical recipes, household hints, and technical recipes on metallurgy, alchemy, dyeing, making perfume, oil, incense, and cosmetics. The books of secrets supplied a great deal of practical information to an emerging new, middle-class readership, leading some historians to link them with the emerging secularistic values of the early modern period and to see them as contributing to the making of an ‚Äòage of how-to.‚Äô Some books of secrets, such as Alessio Piemontese's famous Secreti (1555), contained mainly practical and technological information in the form of useful recipes. Others, such as Giambattista Della Porta's Magia Naturalis (Natural Magic, 1558) deployed practical recipes in an effort to demonstrate the principles of natural magic. Other books of secrets, such as Isabella Cortese's Secreti (1564), disseminated alchemical information to a wide readership. Recent research has suggested that the books of secrets may have played an important role in the emergence of experimental science by bringing practical technical information to the attention of experimental scientists.W.

It was established in 1939 in the area today known as Lehavot HaBashan, and moved to its current location in 1942.See early 1940s Survey of Palestine map at: :File:Historical map series for the area of al-Hamra' (1940s with modern overlay).jpg History Kibbutz Amir was established on 29 October 1939 on land purchased by the Jewish National Fund from the Arab village of Khiyam al- Walid. It was the last of the tower and stockade settlements, and the only one to be established during World War II. Its founders were Jewish immigrants and refugees from Lithuania and Poland, later joined by German and Yugoslav settlers. Initially they suffered from outbreaks of malaria, but managed to establish an intensively cultivated farm. According to a 1949 report from the Jewish National Fund, a clinic was opened at Amir for the treatment of malaria and eye diseases by a professor from Hebrew University. Until the beginning of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war treatment there for neighboring Arab villagers was free. A photo in the June 1940 edition of Life Magazine shows a kibbutz member ploughing the heavy soil with a primitive plough pulled by two water buffalo. Due to its location, the kibbutz was affected by floods every winter, and in 1942 was moved to its present location on land bought from another Arab village, al-Dawwara.

They are designed to provide hamsters with exercise. Balls produce an audible rumble across most surfaces, making them easier to locate even when out of sight. Hamster balls have been manufactured and sold since at least the 1970s. Most are made of durable transparent plastic with air holes and a small door or lid to allow the owner to insert or remove the hamster from the ball. Although hamster balls are designed to protect hamsters, there are hazards such as stairs and other high places from which hamsters can fall, resulting in injury or even death. To protect hamsters, owners may place hamster balls on the lower level of their house, away from any stairs. Some owners also create a simple barrier near the stairs, so that they will not roll down the stairs. Although hamster balls have air holes, hamsters should be allowed to take breaks and leave the ball regularly due to a lack of water that could induce heatstroke or exhaustion. It is important to keep watch over the hamster ball at all times while the pet is inside. The ball can pick up too much speed, causing the hamster to somersault inside and potentially be injured. Hamster balls are recommended by the manufacturers for use with hamsters, gerbils, mice, degus and small rats only; they should not be used for chinchillas or guinea pigs, as their size and body structures are different from small rodents, posing a serious hazard to them if placed inside.  Criticism  TVT (Tier√§rztliche Vereinigung f√ºr Tierschutz) warn that hamster balls pose a risk of injury. The hamster can not free itself from the ball and can not control the speed or direction of the ball. While in a hamster ball, especially in a transparent one, they cannot meet their natural instinct to take cover. There is a high risk for injury when the ball hits a wall or rolls down from raised surfaces. The small ventilation slots do not give a sufficient air supply for the hamster. TVT considers hamster balls to be anti animal welfare and do not recommend their use for any small mammal.Tier√§rztliche Vereinigung f√ºr Tierschutz e.V., Merkblatt Nr. 62 - Heimtierhaltung, Tierschutzwidriges Zubeh√∂r (Stand: Jan. 2010), II.

With the development of the Class 80, a relatively economical and simple locomotive class, it was hoped that the cost of shunting duties would come down.

Stencils are the basis for many algorithms to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDE). Two examples of stencils are the five- point stencil and the Crank‚ÄìNicolson method stencil. Stencils are classified into two categories: compact and non-compact, the difference being the layers from the point of interest that are also used for calculation. In the notation used for one-dimensional stencils n-1, n, n+1 indicate the time steps where timestep n and n-1 have known solutions and time step n+1 is to be calculated. The spatial location of finite volumes used in the calculation are indicated by j-1, j and j+1.  Etymology  Graphical representations of node arrangements and their coefficients arose early in the study of PDEs. Authors continue to use varying terms for these such as \\"relaxation patterns\\", \\"operating instructions\\", \\"lozenges\\", or \\"point patterns\\". The term \\"stencil\\" was coined for such patterns to reflect the concept of laying out a stencil in the usual sense over a computational grid to reveal just the numbers needed at a particular step.  Calculation of coefficients  The finite difference coefficients for a given stencil are fixed by the choice of node points. The coefficients may be calculated by taking the derivative of the Lagrange polynomial interpolating between the node points, by computing the Taylor expansion around each node point and solving a linear system, or by enforcing that the stencil is exact for monomials up to the degree of the stencil. For equi-spaced nodes, they may be calculated efficiently as the Pad√© approximant of x^s \\\\cdot (\\\\log x)^m, where m is the order of the stencil and s is the ratio of the distance between the leftmost derivative and the left function entries divided by the grid spacing.

He arrived in Plymouth Colony on an unknown ship sometime between 1628 and 1632. During his long life he is considered a person of note in Plymouth Colony serving in many government capacities associated with the colony government, such as government committees and deputy for Plymouth as well as Assistant Governor in 1632/33. He left government service for a time in the 1630s to serve as deacon in the Plymouth Church.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 282 Memorial erected in 1907 by descendants of John Doane.  English Origins  John Doane stated he was born in England and in his 1678 will he stated he was age about eighty-eight years of age making his birth year being about 1590. Nothing else is known of his English ancestry. There is no record of John Doane being in Leiden, Holland, although he was a Plymouth church deacon.  In Plymouth Colony  In 1632/33 he was Assistant Governor.Robert Charles Anderson, Pilgrim Village Family Sketch: John Doane (a collaboration between American Ancestors and New England Historic Genealogical Society) Records show that on January 2, 1632/33 Governor Bradford, Captain Standish, John Alden, John Howland, Stephen Hopkins, Samuel Fuller, Sr., and John Doane and other notables were ordered by the court to assess taxes on the colonists payable in grain or the equivalent. 1633 was the first year that the records show all seven governmental Assistants. Edward Winslow as governor and the Assistants were William Bradford, Myles Standish, John Howland, John Alden, John Doane, Stephen Hopkins and William Gilson. On April 8, 1633 John Doane sold the indenture of Walter Harris - who had bound himself to serve Mr. Atwood of London under command of Mr. John Doane of New Plymouth - to Henry Howland. On January 2, 1633/34 tax rates were again assessed by the new governor, Thomas Prence, and William Bradford, Captain Standish, John Howland, Stephen Hopkins, John Doane and others associated with colony government. Eighty individuals to be taxed were listed.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 49 Nathaniel Morton wrote that John Cooke, Mr. John Doane and Mr. William Paddy were deacons under Reverend John Reyner, and John Dunham became a deacon later. John Doane was at least a deacon as early as January 2, 1633/34 when he resigned his office as Assistant (governor) because of his deaconship.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 98 In January 1633/34 he was \\"freed from office\\" so that he could devote his full- time to church functions. Per records of the time, Martha Harding died before October 28, 1633 with John Doane presenting her inventory and also was administrator on behalf of her son. She died without a will, leaving one son in the custody of Mr. John Doane and it has been thought she may have Doane's sister.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 297 As early as January 5, 1635/36, John Doane, John Winslow, his brother Kenelm Winslow and others were chosen to assist the governor and council to set rates on goods to be sold and wages to be paid to laborers. The court not only regulated prices, but sometimes quality.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 215 In 1636 Eleanor Billington was fined and sentenced to sit in the stocks and be whipped for slandering John Doane. The Billingtons were Mayflower passengers and had been a troublesome family in the colony since 1620, with her husband John Billington being hanged for murder in 1630.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 245 In October 1636 the General Court appointed William Brewster, John Doane and others as a special committee to join with the governor and Assistants in reviewing all laws and to make commendations for changes at the next court meeting. This committee was one of various committees upon which John Doane served.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 145, 282 On December 30, 1636, John Atwood, late of London, bought John Doane's half-interest in a house and land near Plain Dealing that they had jointly owned.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 236, 237, 283 Per the records of the time, John Doane had a business connection with Mr. John Atwood, who was an Assistant in 1638. John Doane, who became a deacon in the Plymouth Church, was probably a Separatist, for church membership and Separatism went hand in hand.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 147 In the 1640s (undated) records list freemen residing in the area of Nauset on Cape Cod planning to establish a town separate from the control of Plymouth. These freemen included Governor Thomas Prence, Edward Bangs and John Doane, among other notables. John Doane was one of the men appointed to buy land at Nauset from the Indians and later became one of the first settlers there. On March 3, 1644/45 the General Court granted to the Plymouth Church \\"or those that goe to dwell at Nosett,\\" all the land between sea and sea \\"from the Purchasors bounds at Naumskeckett to the Hering Brooke at Billingsgate.\\" The court on June 2, 1646 ordered that \\"Nawsett\\" be made a township and Samuel Hicks was appointed as constable. (Samuel Hicks was married to John Doane's daughter Lydia.) On June 7, 1651 the court ordered the name of the town of Nauset to be changed to Eastham.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 76, 77, 283 John Doane was very active in colonial government, serving on numerous committees and as a deputy to the Court for Eastham. Doane was usually given the honoric title of \\"Mr.\\", a mark of the gentry, and in one document he referred to himself as \\"Gent., Tayler\\".Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 283 In other documents John Doane commonly identified himself as \\"husbandman\\" or \\"Yeoman\\", but in a 1681 deed of land to his daughter Abigail, he listed himself as a \\"tailor\\".Doane Family Association  Family  John Doane's earliest known wife was called Ann in a 1648 deed, but in a later deed (of 1659) his wife was Lydia. :John Doane married: # Ann (poss. Perkins) by 1625 and had five children. She died on June 1, 1654 and was buried in Cove Burying Ground, Eastham. # Lydia ___ by April 1, 1659 and died between May 18, 1678 and December 23, 1681.

On February 5, 1667/8 and had eight children. # Mary (Smalley) Snow as her second husband after April 1692 but had no children. She died in 1703.  The will of John Doane  In his will dated May 18, 1678, inventory taken May 21, 1686 and sworn by Abigail Doane May 29, 1686, he named his \\"loving wife,\\" daughter Abigail, sons John, Daniel and Ephraim, and granddaughter Margaret Hicks, and left the remainder of his estate to \\"all my sons and daughters\\". He described himself in the will as \\"aged eighty and eight or there about\\" and in the inventory he was said to have died February 21, 1685/86, \\"aged about a hundred years\\" - a typical overstatement of age which occurred in those times.  Death and burial of John Doane  John Doane died in Eastham, Massachusetts on February 21, 1685/6. He was buried in Cove Burying Ground in Eastham where his tombstone is existent as well as memorials in his honor.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 282  Memorial  In 1869 the Doanes erected a memorial stone on the site of Deacon John's house in Eastham, Massachusetts. That site, overlooking Nauset Bay, is now a part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. In 1906, a perpetual lot in the Old Town Cove burial ground, including the grave site of Deacon Daniel Doane, a son, was set aside. The following year a memorial stone with a bronze tablet honoring Deacon John Doane was erected. In 1994 a granite stone and bronze marker commemorating the 350th anniversary of the founding of Nauset was dedicated at the homesite.

She was built in 1893, in Sunderland, England by the William Doxford & Sons shipyard; she was built under license from Scottish-American Captain Alexander McDougall (1845‚Äì1923). History=Construction= Whalebacks had a rather unique design. They had an unusual cylindrical, cigar shaped hull that when fully loaded resembled the back of the whale, hence the name. Their hulls were built of heavy steel plates double-riveted to steel angle frames. They were the predecessors of the Doxford turret deck ships of the late 19th and early 20th century, just like whalebacks they had a rounded hull, but unlike whalebacks they had a conventional bow, stern and superstructure. A total of 44 whaleback vessels were constructed from 1888 to 1898, with most of them (except for two) operating in the Great Lakes. =Service= The Sagamore underway The Sagamore was refused entry to England because of her unusual design. She was owned by the Belgian American Maritime Co (which was restyled the Belgian Maritime Trading Co SA). In 1896 she was sold again to Cogneti Schiaffino of Genoa, Italy and renamed Solideo in 1911. She was renamed again as Ilva in 1916 and finally purchased by A Piaggio of Genoa in 1916. She was sailing between Genoa and Barry Roads when she was torpedoed and sunk in the Atlantic off the coast of Spain on 4 May 1917 by UC-69. There were no casualties.

The site is associated with the Hopewell Mills, one of the earliest textile mills in the city, established in 1818 (mill now demolished). The historic district contains a number of early 19th century brick mill worker tenement homes and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The village was established in 1818 by a group of industrialists led by Charles Richmond, in association with Samuel Crocker and Silas Shepard. The site previously contained a nail- cutting mill owned by Samuel Leonard, built in the 1780s. Crocker and Richmond first built a cotton mill, one hundred feet in length. The basement included a machine shop and nail factory. A second cotton mill was added in 1821. In 1823, the mills were merged into the stock of the Taunton Manufacturing Company, which operated the mills until 1843.History of Bristol County, Massachusetts After the bankruptcy of Taunton Manufacturing Company, the mills were acquired by Cyrus Lothrop who controlled the site until his accidental death in 1854. The property then passed to Charles Albro, who had been superintendent of the mills. Much of the village that exists today dates from the period of Albro's ownership (1854-1888). In 1888, Albro sold the mill to the investment firm of L. Beebe & Co. of Boston, who operated it until 1904, when the mill was destroyed by fire.http://mhc- macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=TAU.L The ruins remained in place for many years.

Set in a dystopian future, it features \\"the hybrid that results when the brain-patterns and memory of a dying girl are transferred into the brain of a chimpanzee.\\" Dickinson researched chimp behavior for the book and he dedicated it to Jane Goodall. Eva was highly commended for the annual British Carnegie Medal and in 2008 it won the retrospective Phoenix Award. It is one of Dickinson's best known works and by far his most popular in the U.S. Plot introduction When 13-year-old Eva is badly injured in a car accident, her consciousness is transplanted into the body of a chimpanzee. The novel concerns her efforts to adjust to her unique situation. The setting is a future when urban civilization has spread across the globe, with disastrous effects on other species. Plot summary The novel opens as Eva wakes up in a hospital bed, paralyzed. Her mother assures her she will be fine, that the doctors will gradually reduce the paralysis. Eva guesses that her face has been badly scarred, but when she looks in a mirror, she sees the face of a chimpanzee. An experimental procedure has been used to transplant Eva's \\"neuron memory\\" into Kelly, a young chimp from her father's research facility. Eva learns to adapt to her new body, using a keyboard to simulate her voice. She has dreams of a forest she has never seen - that Kelly has never seen either - and imagines it comes from the chimpanzee unconscious. She realizes that she must accept the chimpanzee part of herself, which is easier for her as she has grown up with her father's chimps. The cost of the procedure has been met by a media company in return for broadcast rights. Eva is a big hit with the public and her family has to cope with massive media interest. The power of the 'shaper' companies is immense in a world where many people spend all day at home. 'Shaper' technology is a cross between television and virtual reality. Eva spends most of her time with humans, even going to school, but also spends time in the Reserve, where she learns to adapt to the chimpanzee social group. Her human understanding helps her to manipulate some of the situations and she becomes accepted by the others. One particularly intelligent chimp, Sniff, is intrigued by her. With the introduction of enthusiastic animal rights advocate Grog Kennedy the novel takes another turn. He convinces Eva that for the sake of the species the chimpanzees must return to the wild. Not only do they belong there, but Grog believes the human race is running out of steam and will before long no longer bother to care for animals in captivity. At this stage there are only small pockets of wilderness left, and most species have died out. Grog and Eva devise an ingenious plan to get the chimps to the island of St. Hilaire near Madagascar where Eva and Sniff lead the others in an escape. Her human knowledge is necessary to help the chimps learn the skills necessary to survive, which means that she must cut herself off from other humans. The novel ends twenty-four years later when Eva is near death, the human race is in decline and Eva imagines a future in which the descendants of her band of chimpanzees become the new dominant race. Relation to Dickinson's other works The novel returns to the ecological themes of the Changes trilogy (1968‚Äì70) and Emma Tupper's Diary (1970). The former imagines a psychological change in the human race, the latter deals with the survival of a species. In one of his mystery novels, The Poison Oracle (1974), a chimpanzee who has learned to communicate becomes a witness in a murder case. Dickinson wrote City of Gold and other stories from the Old Testament (1980) for a series of retellings and classics illustrated by Michael Foreman. His editor then asked him to tackle Arthurian legends for the same series; he was intrigued but found the material on King Arthur too thin to work with. That generated Merlin Dreams (1988), which features \\"Merlin drowsing the centuries away under his rock, waking from time to time and recalling some item from the mythic Celtic past, and then dreaming a story about it.\\" But they are Dickinson's stories, not existing Arthurian stories. Next he decided to \\"do something with the various First Women that people have imagined at different times ‚Äî Eve of course, and the shadowy figures of classical myth, and as many of the other cultural traditions I could find and work in.\\" Rather than time-travel, or dreams, his heroine would somehow meet the Eve myth while in a coma ‚Äî in a future where \\"the Eve myth [had] dwindled to a cheap TV cartoon.\\" Dickinson originally conceived Eva as a woman making contact with an early ancestress while in a coma. The book was much changed from the original concept, but the Adam and Eve cartoon which Eva watches is a remnant of it, and Eva herself becomes an ancestress of sorts. Dickinson has since returned to our remote ancestors in A Bone from a Dry Sea (1992) and The Kin (1998). Awards When it was new, Eva was a highly commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the British Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject, and an honor book for the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in the US. In 1992 it won the Senior Division Young Reader's Choice Award from the Pacific Northwest Library Association (US and Canada), which annually recognises one three-year-old book.\\"YRCA\\" (Young Reader's Choice Award index). Pacific Northwest Library Association. Retrieved 2012-12-19. Eva won the 2008 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English- language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. That is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity. In his acceptance speech Dickinson noted that after years of speaking to and corresponding with readers, primarily Americans, \\"I was astonished to find ... that it was eligible. I was convinced it must have won something important enough to disqualify it.\\" Reception Eva is one of Peter Dickinson's best- known books. The author says: \\"80% of my mail, almost all of it from the USA, is about this one book. This baffles me.\\" The novel is used in classroom study to stimulate discussion of medical ethics, animal rights and other issues.Maine School Libraries worksheet. Neil Philip in the Times Literary Supplement called Eva \\"one of the better books of a first-rate writer. It is highly provocative, it has tenderness, humour and passion. It involves the reader from the very first page and will not quickly leave the mind.\\"Biography of the author, quoting the Times Literary Supplement, March 3-9, 1988, Neil Philip, \\"Working with Nature,\\" p. 232 Ethel Heins in a Horn Book review called it \\"a work of passion and eloquence, and its sobering significance increases in proportion to the reader's maturity.\\"Biography of the author, quoting Horn Book, July-August, 1989, Ethel L.

Graham, \\"Exodus from the City: Peter Dickinson's Eva\\", The Lion and the Unicorn 23.1 (January 1999), pp. 79-85. Betty Carter took a \\"Second Look\\" at Eva in the September/October 2001 issue of The Horn Book Magazine. She cites Eva as a good illustration of Dickinson's place as a thought-provoking author for young adults. \\"The topics raised in Eva transcend the fleeting concerns of adolescence. Dickinson shows tremendous respect for his readers and their ability to grapple with hard issues that range from euthanasia to the influence of the media.\\" Dickinson professes \\"mixed feelings about his books being studied in schools\\" and he currently publishes a reply to Professor Carter, with 2001 copyright date, \\"A Letter in Response to an Article About Teaching Eva\\". He contrasts with \\"Professor Carter\\" and others \\"the naive reader ... [who] is doing no more than experiencing the book by re-imagining my invention, in something like the manner in which I imagined it.\\" For him, he says, \\"it's enough if the naive one simply takes it aboard as part of his/her subconscious awareness.\\" Publication history Delacorte Press published the first U.S. edition early in 1989.

The part of the village on Locust Street from Oak Street to Hortonville Rd. makes up the Hortonville Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History and description Hortonville is located in northern Swansea, near its border with Rehoboth. Locust Street is the principal roadway through the area, running roughly east‚Äìwest. The area was first settled in the 18th century by the Hale, Martin, and Eddy families. These families built homes on farmland they owned in the western end of the village. The eastern end of the village, along the Cole River, became the site of several gristmills, lending the village the name \\"Swansea Factory.\\" In the 1830s, a school, church, and Universalist hall were built in the village. Nathaniel Horton settled in the area in 1856 and helped the village gain its own post office, which was named Hortonville in his honor. After 1900, industrial development in the area stalled, and the village became a residential and agricultural area. As a result of this development pattern, the area has a well-preserved concentration of late 18th to late 19th-century housing. Its oldest house, 397 Locust Street, was built in 1736, and is a typical Georgian house. Other examples of mid-18th century housing exist, but most have been updated, typically in the 19th century with Greek Revival styling. A small cluster of Federal period houses stand at the eastern end of Locust Street and on Maiden Lane. The only major non-residential building is the former Hortonville School (Greek Revival, c. 1838).

World War II service=Pacific Ocean operations= After fitting-out, Torchwood cleared San Francisco on 3 June 1944 and arrived in San Pedro, California, two days later to begin a month of training. On 3 July, she put to sea, bound for Hawaii, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 11th. After almost a fortnight in the Hawaiian Islands, she got underway on 23 July and shaped a course for the southwestern Pacific Ocean. She made a brief stop at Funafuti in the Ellice Islands on 7 August and, 10 days later, reached Milne Bay, New Guinea, where she reported for duty with the U.S. 7th Fleet. Torchwood served in the anchorage at Milne Bay through mid-September and then moved forward to support the landings in the Netherlands East Indies at Morotai. By early December, she was at Manus in the Admiralty Islands, but she got underway again on the 4th and returned to Milne Bay on the 6th. Three days later, she moved on to Hollandia, where she operated for a month from 14 December 1944 to 15 January 1945. After a short tour of duty at Woendi‚Äîbetween 18 and 25 January‚Äîshe returned to Hollandia, where she served until late June.

It is an upmarket variant of the Crown and serve as Toyota's flagship model in various countries. The Crown Majesta appeared after the international introduction of the Celsior/Lexus LS in late 1989; the Celsior was exclusive to Toyopet Store locations on a newer platform. The Crown Majesta, positioned as a modern limousine alternative to the already existing Century and shares the flagship role, was exclusive to Toyota Japanese dealerships called Toyota Store. The Crown Majesta appeared before the Aristo/Lexus GS, which was assigned to Toyota Vista Store locations and shared the Crown and Crown Majesta platform. The Crown Majesta shares a stretched variant of the smaller Crown platform series which is also used in the Aristo/GS, however, it is not just an upper trim level of the Crown sedan, the Majesta is a separate car with unique styling and interior treatment. The Crown Majesta was later released in other countries in Asia such as China. __TOC__  First generation (S140; 1991)  The first-generation Crown Majesta was introduced in Japan as a 4-door sedan in October 1991. It looked very similar to its smaller sibling, the Crown. It also bore a resemblance to the larger Celsior, which was a sedan that appeared in 1989. At first, the Crown Majesta was a trim-level variant of the Crown series, called the Crown Royal Saloon G. The Majesta was a more luxurious variant of the Crown and was slightly wider and heavier, necessitating two engine choices: the 3.0 L 2JZ-GE inline-six, which produced and the 4.0 L 1UZ- FE V8, which produced . The two engine choices gave Japanese buyers the option as to which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. In 1992, four-wheel steering was offered in compliance with the four-wheel drive system, called 4WDi-Four. This boosted handling capabilities and gave increased traction. Advanced for this time, the Crown Majesta had an optional GPS navigation system, electronic instrument cluster, electric power steering, heated front and rear electric seats, a head-up display that projected key information on the inside windshield surface above the instrument cluster, and an i-Four comprehensive vehicle control system. Toyota crownmajesta uzs141 ctype 1 r.jpgRear view  Second generation (S150; 1995)  The Crown Majesta underwent its first redesign in 1995. Notable enhancements were made to the taillamps to distinguish the model from the lower-spec Crown. The redesign made the vehicle similar to the XF20 series Celsior/LS 400, which debuted in 1994. Changes were also made to the engine lineup. The 3.0 L engine stayed the same, but the 4.0 L-powered one received a power increase to . Due to cost-cutting efforts within Toyota, the list of optional equipment offered was simplified. The second-generation Majesta is the first Toyota model to be equipped with vehicle stability control in 1995. At its introduction in 1996, it won the Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year award in Japan which it shared with the 1996 Crown. In August 1997, the front grille was restyled and HID headlamps were introduced. VVT-i technology was offered on the V8 engine, improving the horsepower to . A 5-speed automatic transmission was also introduced. Four-wheel steering was no longer offered. In addition, a new two-tone paint scheme offered an upmarket image for the Crown Majesta. Toyota Crown Majesta S150 rear.jpgRear view  Third generation (S170; 1999)  This version was released in September 1999 and received a complete redesign, further incorporating styling elements of the popular Celsior/LS. Wider vertical taillamps were incorporated as well as redesigned headlamps, grille and minor aesthetic updates. Four-wheel steering was again offered. The previous two-tone paint scheme options remained as well as Toyota's other top of the line features for this model. DVD-based GPS navigation was also introduced, as well as an \\"Ottoman\\" footrest for the rear passenger seats. This was achieved by enabling part of the seat cushion of the front passenger seat back to tilt rearward towards the rear seat passengers. The model came in a C-type or an A-type option, the A-type having less standard options with conventional spring and shock suspension as standard, while the C-type had more options as standard such as height adjustable air suspension, TEMS, dual zone climate control, rear wheel steering and power rear seat as standard with leather as optional. Both the 3.0 L and 4.0 L variants also had the option for 4WDi-Four four-wheel drive system. The S170 series Crown Majesta received an updated version of the 4.0 L engine with VVT-i, now rated at , while the 3.0 L option was unchanged. The trend among automakers towards large-diameter wheels with low-profile tires was ignored in favour of a more comfortable ride and better handling with smaller wheels. This model also made available with a 5-speed Super ECT automatic transmission. The S170 series Crown Majesta was made the official company car for senior-level Toyota management. This model of Crown Majesta also had a 10th Anniversary special edition run which was a fully optioned C-type specification model with leather and a sunroof as standard. Toyota Crown Majesta S170 rear.jpgRear view  Fourth generation (S180; 2004)  The fourth-generation Crown Majesta received a complete redesign when it was introduced on 6 July 2004. In August 2006, the Celsior was no longer offered in Japan, due to the introduction of the Lexus brand there. The Crown Majesta replaced the Celsior, despite objections from Japanese customers. It introduced the first Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) integrated vehicle handling and software control system and radar adaptive cruise control with low-speed tracking function. The engine was upgraded to the 4.3 L 3UZ-FE V8, shared with the US-spec LS. The transmission was upgraded to a 6-speed automatic, the four-wheel drive system was improved, and the air suspension was introduced. Intelligent adaptive front lighting and rear curtain airbags were added to improve safety. Enhancements were made to the interior of the vehicle, including a rear-view camera and parking assistance technology. A supercharger option was also offered with a 6-speed transmission, allowing the engine to produce . In July 2004, the Crown Majesta introduced both a lane keeping assist and a radar pre-collision system with a single camera to improve the accuracy of collision forecast and warning and control levels. For 2006, G-Book was added to the list of standard features, along with a rear- view camera. A departure from previous models, the two-tone paint scheme was removed to target a younger audience. = Hongqi HQ300/HQ430 = In China, this generation of the Crown Majesta was rebadged and has been sold as the Hongqi HQ300/HQ430 from 2006 to 2010, using the same engines as the Crown.

Although it was initially reported that the name \\"Crown\\" would be removed, establishing the Majesta as an independent car, this did not happen and the car remained the Crown Majesta. The body size expanded from the previous generation, now comparable to the LS. As with the GS and LS, the 4.6 L 1UR-FSE V8 engine is standard, however, four-wheel drive system employed the 4.3 L 3UZ-FE one. The larger engine incurs a higher road tax liability than the smaller 4.3 L engine. In China, FAW Toyota assembled a limited number of left-hand-drive S200 series Crown Majesta, which is called Crown Royal Saloon VIP. Another car based on the Crown was called the Hongqi H7 and has been in production since 2013.

The elimination of the V8 engines reduced the annual road tax liability for large engine displacement. The Crown Majesta was given an all- new appearance after the reintroduction of the Y51 series Nissan Cima in April 2012. Fuel economy is improved to under the JC08 test cycle. The wheelbase is longer than the corresponding Crown Royal and Athlete, but shorter than the Century, and incorporates advanced safety and convenience equipment such as blind spot monitoring and a collision avoidance system.

The farm location is important for a variety of reasons. Its earliest historical association is with the Wampanoag people, who are known to have used the area, particularly around Sachem Rock, a granite outcrop that is the property's high point, prior to European contact. Sachem Rock itself is historically significant as the site of a meeting in 1649 between English settlers from the Plymouth Colony, including Myles Standish, with the Wampanoag sachem Massasoit. In this meeting the colonists purchased rights to a large tract of land, including East and West Bridgewater, Bridgewater, and Brockton. The land around Sachem Rock was settled by 1665, with a farm and gristmill nearby on the Satucket River, and has seen agricultural uses ever since. The oldest buildings to survive are a complex of barns and other outbuildings built c. 1870 by Thomas Hewitt. The Hewitt farmhouse, built in 1869, burned down in 1926, and was replaced by the present two-story Colonial Revival wood frame house by Henry Moorhouse. The property was purchased by the Town of East Bridgewater in 1998, and is now open to the public. Around 2012, the town renovated the two-story Colonial Revival wood frame house, and replaced and connected a nearby barn, creating The Center at Sachem Rock which houses the town's Council on Aging. The facility is rented out as a function hall. Also on the property, during the planting months, residents maintain small gardening plots used for the East Bridgewater Community Gardens. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It is expected to yield archaeologically significant finds concerning its pre-contact uses, as well as the sites of houses, outbuildings, and industrial mills from the colonial period through the 19th century.

Established in 1721, the town center includes the town hall, library, and church, as well as its first cemetery and the c. 1700 Stetson House, one of its oldest buildings. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The area that is now Hanover was settled around 1700, originally as part of Scituate. Much of its land had been awarded to Cornet Robert Stetson in 1634, and it was his son Benjamin who probably built the house c. 1700 standing on the south side of the town center. Enlarged about 1716, it was here that early meetings were held that led to the town's incorporation in 1727. In that year, the town cemetery was laid out, and its first meeting house was built, where the present First Congregational Church (built 1863) stands. Over the 19th and early 20th centuries, the center acquired the trappings of a modest New England town center, including its town hall and library. The historic district includes seven properties located around the junction of Hanover Street (Massachusetts Route 139) with Main and Silver Streets, near the geographic center of the town. On the south side of Hanover Street stand (from east to west), the Stetson House, now a museum of the local historical society, the Curtis Free Library (1907, Federal Revival), and the Italianate town hall (1863). The First Congregational Church occupies a prominent location on what is now an island surrounded by the three roadways, and the cemetery is located to its north. East of the church is the Colonial Revival Sylvester School, built in 1927 as the town's first public high school. West of the church stands its parsonage house, built about 1855.

The 2-1/2 story frame house was built c. 1716 by Samuel \\"Drummer\\" Stetson and was occupied by the Stetson family until at least the 1860s. During the 19th century the family opened the house for religious services after the church burned down.  Description and history  In the Common room there is a large fireplace (one of six in the house) and a Yule log that was lit for good luck on Christmas but was never allowed to burn all the way. At the church, if you fell asleep a person would tickle you with a feather attached to a tithing rod. It was above the fireplace. A grandfather clock made by John Bailey and given to the Stetson house was too big to fit in the house so they had to cut a depression in the floor. The mother Stetson sometimes baked pies in the deep oven and at about 4:00pm called the children to supper. People donated furniture for the Music Room. Also in the Music room there is a portrait of John Barstow and his wife Betsy Ellen. Four front windows have special glass, each with 24 panes. The dining room is not used often, only on special occasions like Christmas or Thanksgiving. The doors between the rooms were made crooked on purpose so that they would close by themselves and not let the heat out. Most of the rooms were not heated and foot warmers were used in the winter. The Stetson House now acts as a museum for the town of Hanover, with its rooms being dedicated to the towns agricultural, manufacturing, maritime, and military histories.

The home is a -story rear saltbox, and has traces of both 17th- century English style as well as later 18th-century Georgian. The two rooms that originally made up the house look much today as they likely did before the house was later enlarged. The house was built in 1678 by town clerk and magistrate Daniel Cushing of Bachelor's Row for his son Peter Cushing, born in 1646. Peter Cushing later operated a mill on land across from the home. The home is one of Hingham's oldest and was added to the National Historic Register in 1973. It has also been designated a Massachusetts Historic Landmark. The house sits on a ten-acre lot. The white clapboard structure centers on a five-bay facade that faces south. Inside, the house has sponge painting believed to have been done applied before 1700, as well as an enormous original working fireplace. The property of the Cushing Homestead includes a barn, corncrib and a forge. Also on the property are the ancient mill site and dam, a former Native American fishing hole, old stone walls and markers, and a large hayfield - all speaking to Hingham's early agricultural beginnings. \\"It is probably one of the most important homesteads in Hingham, beautifully maintained inside and out,‚Äô‚Äô says Hingham-based architectural historian Monique Lehner. The property's barn, said to be the oldest in the United States, is constructed of timber that originally was part of Hingham's first meeting house, replaced by the Old Ship Church in 1681. The barn is a shingle-covered structure in a pitched roof style, and has ornamental red trim. The house has been occupied for over three centuries by descendants in the male line of the original builder, the son of Puritan Matthew Cushing, who arrived in Hingham from Norfolk, England, in 1638. Among the Cushing family members who have occupied the home since it was built was Capt. Peter Cushing (1741-1783), grandson and namesake of the first owner. A selectman and constable of Hingham, Capt. Cushing commanded a company of troops during the Revolutionary War under fellow townsman General Benjamin Lincoln. An elm tree on the property, a local landmark for years, was famous as the place where pastor John Brown preached to a group of Minutemen from Cohasset in 1775.

After being told off briefly by Ben Ergha, Vivian Davis is revealed to be the student archaeologist studying with the team. Gillian has a cold, snubbing attitude towards Viv in the beginning, telling her to simply get on with some cataloguing. But after further inspection of the computerised earth scanner, Viv notices that there is more to the dig site. Gillian and the rest of the team proceed to excavate the second place, now distinctly forming a crucifix shape when looked at from above. Before long, a skeleton is found, with more dirhems scattered around. This leads to much speculation, as the crusades happened in the Holy Land, not in England. Before long, however, Gillian and Ben have to leave to go to the launching of a book written by the head of the archaeology department, Daniel Mastiff, entitled Sex Rites of the Ancients. After a few witty remarks on Gillian's part, the two head back to the dig site. Meanwhile, however, Viv has been looking through the earth, when she finds a 13th-century sandal, and proceeds to show it to the hospice nurse that she has been talking to. The nurse quickly points out another mound, and after inspection, they both proceed to pull a cut of wood out. A splinter from the wood gets stuck in the nurse's finger, as Viv takes the wood back to the lab. After Gregory \\"Dolly\\" Parton completes a test on a scrap of material, the body found is revealed to be a Knight Templar, due to the distinct red cross revealed by the UV light. This raises further questions about Templars in England, with the only explanation being the exile of the Knights by King Philip I of France. Viv gives Gillian the piece of wood that she found, and after sending Ben to do a dendrochronology test on it, the rest of the team discuss what could have happened. Before serious speculation took place, however, the dendrochronology test was complete, with the wood dating back to 32AD, and with blood soaked into it with metallic traces. Thoughts arise here about whether the wood could be part of the True Cross.

A wholly owned subsidiary of Independent Bank Corp., by October 2016, Rockland Trust had $7.5 billion in assets and employed around 1,000 people. History=1907-2000= The Rockland Trust Company was organized in September of 1907 in the Boston suburb of Rockland, Massachusetts. As of September 30, 1907, bank resources were recorded by the Massachusetts Bank Commissioner at $317,852.52, and by December 3, 1907, were at $484,907.48. By September 23, 1908, resources were at $553,430.25. By June 23, 1909, they were at $645,430.87. At the last election, Rockland Trust Company's executive committee chairman, Horace T. Fogg, was elected \\"almost without opposition\\" to the office of Treasurer of Plymouth County. In 1910, Rockland Trust began offering \\"Automobile Banking\\" ‚Äî an innovative program that offered banking services to nearby towns (including Hull, Massachusetts) from the window of a special adapted car. The program was well received and continued through 1955. Rockland Trust's 1927 petition to open a branch in Hull, Massachusetts sparked a state-level debate on whether to allow \\"kangaroo banking,\\" where banks opened branches in non-adjacent towns. The proposal was opposed by Alvan T. Fuller, then Governor of Massachusetts, and Hingham Trust, a bank based closer to Hull. The petition was finally granted by the Massachusetts legislature. =2001-2018= The bank instigated a \\"buying spree\\" of other financial companies in 2008, acquiring Slades Ferry Bank that year. In 2009, its acquisition of Benjamin Franklin Bank brought Rockland into the western suburbs of Boston for the first time. The Central Bank purchase in 2012 brought Rockland to have branches north of Boston. The bank was planning further expansion in 2012. In 2015, the bank was named the No. 1 largest company by the Boston Globe in its \\"2015 Top Places To Work\\" feature. In 2015, it was reported that Rockland Trust had secured its first branches in Boston, with the $131 million acquisition of Peoples Federal Savings Bank's holding company. Although Rockland already had a commercial lending and wealth management office in Boston, it had no retail locations prior, with 8 branches added to Rockland's 78 branch network. Between 2005 and October 2016, the bank grew to have 85 branches in eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and acquired Slades Ferry Bancorp, Benjamin Franklin Bank, Central Bank, Mayflower Bank and Peoples Federal Savings Bank. The largest of those acquisitions was Benjamin Franklin, which had near $1 billion in assets. By October 2016, Rockland Trust was wholly owned by Independent Bank Corp and had $7.5 billion in assets. It also employed around 1,000 people, and had a loan limit of $100 million. That month, the company acquired the Bank of Cape Cod. It had plans to begin offering wealth management services through its wealth management division. On October 20, 2016, it was reported that Rockland Trust Company would acquire Edgartown National Bank, with the merger expected to be complete by May 2017. The transaction was valued at about $24.5 million, according to the Vineyard Gazette. After the merger was finalized, it was reported the name of the Edgartown National Bank would change to Rockland Trust. In 2017, CEO Chris Oddleifson was quoted saying that they would consider acquiring banks with as much as $3 billion to $4 billion assets. At the time, Rockland Trust had about $7.7 billion in assets. As of February 2018, Chris Oddleifson was CEO of Rockland Trust. Services and branches The company continues to operate as a subsidiary of Independent Bank Corp, and remains based in Rockland, Massachusetts with branches in the state and Rhode Island. Corporate headquarters are in Hanover, Massachusetts. It has retail branches, commercial lending offices, investment management offices, and residential lending centers located in Eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Designed to replace the M 61 series of siege guns the M 80 family of siege guns offered greater range and armor penetration than the older guns. The proven steel-bronze was used for the barrel and the iron carriage lacked any system to absorb recoil other than the traditional recoil wedges placed underneath and behind the wheels of the carriage. These wedges helped to absorb the recoil force and encouraged the wheels to run forward to bring the gun back into battery. Generally a wooden firing platform was constructed for these guns in action to provide a level and smooth surface. For transport the barrel was removed from the carriage by a crane and carried separately. These siege guns were no longer useful against modern armored fortresses by the outbreak of World War I and many saw action in the field to fill the need for heavy howitzers.

For this purpose, a nitrocellulose slide is generally considered to be superior to glass, because it binds a great deal more protein, and protects the tertiary structure of the protein (and other biological material, i.e.: cells). Typically, nitrocellulose slides have a thin, opaque film of nitrocellulose on a standard 25mm √ó 75 mm glass microscope slide. The film is extremely sensitive to contact, and to foreign material; contact causes deformation and deposition of material, especially liquids. A nitrocellulose slide is different from a nitrocellulose membrane, which usually filters protein from solution (i.e.: physician's office pregnancy tests), but that it serves a similar goal: to detect the presence and/or concentration level of certain biological material. Microarrays Nitrocellulose slides are used mainly in proteomics to do protein microarrays with automated systems that print the slides and record results. Microarrays of cell analytes, arrays of cell lysate, antibody microarrays, tissue printing, immunoarrays, etc. are also possible with the slide. Nitrocellulose fluorescence Due to their high surface roughness, conventional white nitrocellulose films scatter and reflect large amounts of excitation and emission light during the fluorescence detection in the microarray scanner. In addition, nitrocellulose exhibits a natural autofluorescence at the detection wavelengths commonly used. Both these factors lead to a high background fluorescent signal from these membrane slides. To overcome this problem, a new process has been developed to generate black membranes that absorb the scattered light, significantly reducing the background auto-fluorescence and thus offering a very low and homogenous auto- fluorescence to achieve a significantly improved dynamic range. These slides are commercially available through Schott AG. Nevertheless, conventional white nitrocellulose films continue to be the dominant surface for many protein microarray applications because the claims above have not proved relevant to end user requirements. Regardless, nitrocellulose slide manufacturers like Grace Bio-Labs continue to develop new nitrocellulose surfaces to further optimize their use in protein microarrays. A method for protein quantitation on nitrocellulose coated glass slides uses near-IR fluorescent detection with quantum dots. Traditional porous nitrocellulose signal to noise is limited by auto-fluorescence of the nitrocellulose at the respective required wavelengths of excitation and emission for standard organic fluorescent detection probes. Near IR detection probes are excited and read at emission wavelengths outside the range of nitrocellulose fluorescence.Marie‚ÄêLaure Schneider, Adriana Marquez‚Äê Lagraulet, Richard Pasquesi, Michael Shultz - (2014), \\"Infrared detection decreases nitrocellulose auto-fluorescence and improves RPPA assays signal‚Äêto‚Äênoise ratio over visible wavelength detection\\", Innopsys Inc.

Aurora Feint The Beginning was released in the first wave of App Store applications in July 2008 and was a free single-player game which combines the geometric shape manipulation of Tetris Attack with the character- building aspects of a role-playing game. Aurora Feint II: The Beginning was released in December 2008 and added graphical and community features. Aurora Feint II: The Arena was released in November 2008, adding multiplayer features and was billed by the developers as the first casual asynchronous massively multiplayer online game. Aurora Feint II: Tower Puzzles was released in December 2008 and provided dozens of visual brain teasers based on the \\"tower\\" locations in the other titles. All versions of Aurora Feint have been removed from AppStore since July 14, 2012. Gameplay The game mechanics were based on Nintendo's Panel de Pon, and the games in the series shared some similarities including the following components: the Mine, the Store, the Smith, and the Tower. In the Mine, players manipulated blocks into combinations of three or more to collects crystals and resources. In the Store, players spent resources and crystals to acquire blueprints and magicbooks. In the Smith, players completed blueprints by collecting a certain amount of resources within an allotted time, gaining access to new types of weapons. In the Tower, player completed magic books by solving puzzles within an allotted number of moves, gaining improved mining efficiency. Aurora Feint II: The Arena added a range of additional capabilities including online player v. player dueling, chat capabilities in its \\"tavern,\\" news feeds, additional character classes, and leaderboards. Characters developed in Aurora Feint The Beginning could be transferred into Aurora Feint II: The Arena. Plot Details of the plot and story are limited but text in the game's opening trailer provides some hints: > \\"What is it that separates reality from fantasy? For one little girl, the > only way to survive our reality is to live in her fantasy.\\" Development The developers wrote in a forum post and discussed in an interview that the initial release of Aurora Feint The Beginning was created over the course of 10 weeks. Soon after its initial release, reports circulated of privacy concerns regarding the game's community features. According to a forum post by the game's developers, on July 22 Apple removed the game from the iTunes App Store. The developers responded by explaining that the contact list was not actually stored on their server, asking for user feedback on alternatives, and asking for support on bringing the game back to the App Store. On July 24, the iTunes App Store began carrying version 1.0.0.1 of the game. According to the developers, the new version addressed the privacy concerns. Reception Aurora Feint The Beginning was met with acclaim compared to other free games in the App Store. One reviewer described it as \\"the most fun and addictive of the early iPhone games.\\" Aurora Feint II: The Arena was praised in a preview release for its \\"Lord of the Rings aesthetic\\" and for standing apart from other match-three games.

Hull Street and Nantasket Avenue are designated Massachusetts Route 228, and the road forms the town line between Hingham and Cohasset until it crosses Straits Pond Dam into Hull just north of the junction. It proceeds generally north, passing through Hull's hilly southern section before reaching its peninsular portion. It is flanked on its eastern side by Nantasket Beach until it reaches a junction with Hull Shore Drive, marking the end of Route 228. At that point George Washington Boulevard runs southwest, and Hull Shore Drive and Nantasket Avenue begin a stretch where Hull Shore Drive is one-way heading north and Nantasket Avenue is one-way heading south, with Hull Shore Drive to the east.

Adams Public Library is a historic library building at 33 Summer Street in Kingston, Massachusetts. Designed by Joseph Everett Chandler (1864‚Äì1945), a major proponent of the Colonial Revival style, the library was built in 1898 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. The building ceased operation as a public library in December 1994, when the town opened the new Kingston Public Library at 6 Green Street. Description and history The Adams Library building is located in Kingston's village center, on the east side of Summer Street (Massachusetts Route 3A) at its junction with Green Street. It is a 1-1/2 story masonry structure, with a gabled roof and walls of brick with stone trim. The main facade is five bays wide, with a dentillated cornice and a stringcourse of stone at the top of the windows and entry. The entrance is framed by wide sidelight windows and sheltered by a four-column Corinthian portico. Windows are set in recessed panels with splayed keystone lintels and a half-round blind arch above. The Kingston Public Library's organizational history dates to 1871, when the Kingston Library Association was founded. Its collection was held in a local retail establishment, and in 1890 fundraising began for the construction of a dedicated facility. Frederic C. Adams was a native of Kingston, who owned a local stockyard and slaughterhouse. On his death in 1874 he left $5,000 to the town for the construction of a library. The library was completed in 1898 to a design by Joseph Chandler of Plymouth. An addition was made to the rear in 1965, but the library continued to grow, and moved into new quarters across the street in 1994. The building was restored, and rededicated as the Adams Center in November 2012. On March 12, 2013, the Kingston Board of Selectmen created the Adams Center Board of Trustees \\"to secure optimal use of the Adams Center for the benefit of the Citizens of Kingston.\\" Restoration allowed the building to be used as a venue for multiple cultural events. From 2012 to 2019, the building was available for rental for group events, small conferences, corporate meetings, seminars and private functions. In the spring 2019, the Adams Center was placed under the control of the Director of the Kingston Public Library. The Adams Center Board of Trustees subsequently resigned as a group. In the summer of 2019, the Library moved its Local History Collections to the Adams where they are available to the public. The main hall upstairs and a small meeting room downstairs are available to the public for programs, events and meetings through the Kingston Recreation Department's reservation system.

Designed to replace the M 61 series of siege guns the M 80 family of siege guns offered greater range and armor penetration than the older guns. The proven steel-bronze was used for the barrel and the iron carriage lacked any system to absorb recoil other than the traditional recoil wedges placed underneath and behind the wheels of the carriage. These wedges helped to absorb the recoil force and encouraged the wheels to run forward to bring the gun back into battery. Generally a wooden firing platform was constructed for these guns in action to provide a level and smooth surface. Shortly after these guns were adopted a hydraulic recoil cylinder was adapted to absorb the recoil forces. It was attached to the underside of the carriage and the firing platform. For transport the barrel was removed from the carriage by a crane and carried separately. While designed to penetrate the walls of fortifications the 12 cm siege gun was no longer useful against modern armored fortresses by the outbreak of World War I and its combination of long-range and light weight saw many in the field to fill the need for long-range artillery.

Built in 1928 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, it is one of the state's only surviving four-wide carousels, and is the only surviving element of the Paragon Park amusement park. The carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Paragon Park Carousel is located in southern Hull, on a parcel bounded by Nantasket Avenue, George Washington Boulevard, and Wharf Avenue. Across Nantasket Avenue is Nantasket Beach, a recreation area that has been a well-known summer getaway destination since the 19th century. The carousel is in a stucco-walled single-story twelve-sided building, with a broad bellcast roof. The roof has deep eaves, with exposed rafters. Each face of the building has a garage-style lifting door, above which is a band of four windows. The shape of the building's roof was custom-designed to house the carousel, which has an unusual scalloped top with barrel vaults. The interior of these vaults is painted with a cloud-dotted sky, with the rim decorated with cherubs, cartouches, and international scenery. The carousel consists of a series of wooden sweeps, braced by brackets. All of the horses mounted on the outside rank are stationary, while there are a combination of fixed and moving horses on the inner ranks. There are two Roman-style chariots, each \\"pulled\\" by two horses. There are a total of 66 horses, of which 42 move. The first carousel at Paragon Park was built in 1920 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company (PTC). The present carousel was also built by the PTC, in 1928. It is believed to contain elements manufactured by the Dentzel Carousel Company, whose assets were purchased by PTC in 1928. It is one of 18 four-wide carousels manufactured by the company, and one of only two four-wide pre-1950 carousels in the state. A Wurlitzer #146-B Band Organ with a Wurlitzer #153 facade provides the carousel‚Äôs music and it is owned by Bill Luca. Of the Paragon Park rides, it is the only still on what were the park grounds; the Giant Coaster still survives as The Wild One at Six Flags America in Maryland. The carousel was operated as part of Paragon Park until the park closed in 1984. Its parts were auctioned off, but most were purchased by a locally organized preservation committee. In 1986 it was moved a short distance to its present location. It is now operated by the Friends of the Paragon Carousel.

Cover art by Jack Gaughan. The Silkie is a fix-up science fiction novel by Canadian-American writer A. E. van Vogt, first published in complete form in 1969. The component stories had previously been published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. Plot introduction Taking its inspiration from the Celtic legend of the Selkie, the novel describes a race of apparent humans with the ability to change into other forms. One, like the Selkie of legend, can live underwater. Another can survive and travel unprotected in outer space. In all three forms the Silkies can wield mental powers over energy to some degree. After a prologue which purports to explain the origin of the Silkies as an experiment in genetic manipulation, the action moves forward over a hundred years to a future in which the Silkies are numerous and live on Earth. Humanity has assimilated them by means of the Special People, who can establish telepathic rapport with the Silkies. All Silkies are male, and most are married to women of the Special People. They are employed as police in space, and most are comfortable with that role. One dedicated Silkie, Nat Cemp, encounters three different alien races, and with each encounter he gains more powers and learns more about the true nature of the Silkies, and of the Universe. As with other Van Vogt works, the novel introduces a psychological element similar to general semantics. Here the Silkies use the so-called \\"Logic of Levels\\". Instead of the symbol/reality dichotomy of General Semantics, the Logic of Levels substitutes the concept of behaviors and instincts as complex neurological structures and feedback loops, simpler levels being built on more complex ones. By manipulating these complexes with their powers the Silkies can defeat adversaries, who find themselves caught in self-amplifying feedback from their own instincts and desires. Plot summary The novel has four sections. The prologue was created specifically for the book; each of the remaining sections consists of a story previously published as part of a series. =Prologue to the Silkie= A young woman, eking out an existence with her father on a boat moored somewhere in Haiti, learns of a medical man with a possible secret of eternal youth. Suspecting a swindle, but keen to get close to any source of money, she joins the various elderly expatriates in a trek to Echo Island, where the supposed genius, Dr. Sawyer, is living. Instead she is confronted with a young man who emerges from swimming underwater, transforming from a fish-like form to human as he does so. He identifies himself as the product of Sawyer's work, and tells her that he and Sawyer need women to bear his children. The story concludes with him saying, \\"I'm a Silkie. The first Silkie.\\" =The Silkie= Nat Cemp, a Silkie travelling through space under his own power, is hailed by a ship full of Variants. These are the result of further experimentation on the Silkie genome. Each has Silkie abilities to some degree. This particular ship consists mostly of aquatic Variants. Cemp is conducted into the ship, shifting from his hard, bony, space-travelling form into his aquatic shape as he does so. Cemp meets a powerful boy aged about 10 who claims to be his son. Since Silkies have to return to water to breed every 9.5 years, and are not allowed to meet their children afterwards, the boy's claim is credible. He tells Cemp that he wishes to return to Earth to learn how to tame his unusual powers. Cemp agrees to this, even though it means he himself will not be allowed to return to Earth as he needs to, in order to complete another breeding cycle. However, after Cemp contacts Earth and then leaves the ship, the boy reveals himself to be a malevolent shape-shifting alien. Cemp returns to Earth clandestinely in order to see his wife Joanne, but finds that the alien has taken on her form and is waiting in his house. The alien, known as the Kibmadine, displays Silkie-like control over energy during the fight which occurs after Cemp discovers the deception. The alien flees. With the aid of the main computer at Silkie Authority, Cemp analyzes his own sense-impressions of the Kibmadine. The result is a picture of a race which enters into an erotic-cannibalistic relationship with its victims, taking on their shapes and then consuming them. Armed with this, Cemp meets the Kibmadine and uses Logic of Levels to send it into an amplified memory of the previous victims. Taking on the shape of the former race, the alien then consumes itself. =Silkies in Space= Silkies all across Earth are confronted by apparent doubles of themselves, who then flee as space- travelling Silkies. Cemp traces them to an asteroid making a close approach to the Sun, inside which is a mysterious power which both controls these new Silkies and also gives them abilities that Cemp and the Earth Silkies cannot match. On the asteroid is a complete population of Silkies, both male and female, who can take on any shape, unlike Earth Silkies. This discovery threatens the relationship between Silkies and humans, especially between Silkies and their wives. Apparently the story of Dr. Sawyer was a fraud, intended to allow Silkies to live on Earth after the asteroid first approached the Sun. On subsequent returns the space Silkies had to deal with the discovery of the Special People and the creation of Variants. The latest return is part of a long-term plan. However, just as the Earth authorities come to an agreement with the space Silkies and the unknown power behind them, a new force encloses the Earth and drags it from orbit. Cemp manages to escape, only to find the Earth now reduced in size and mounted as a trophy inside the asteroid. The being in the asteroid, known as the Glis, seems to come from an ancient time when the laws of nature were different. The Glis openly threatens to destroy all Silkies if Cemp moves against it, as the asteroid moves many light-years from the Sun. Cemp, however, finds the Logic of Levels key to the Glis's true nature and trips a feedback which forces it out of its state of retarded development, into the next phase. The Glis becomes a huge pink star, liberating thousands of planets from its collection to orbit around it. Many are dead, having been in storage for too long, but on the liberated Earth mere seconds have passed and all are well. Now humanity and the space Silkies must learn to co-exist on an Earth which is part of a huge new Solar System. =Enemy of the Silkies= While exploring the new planets, one of the Earth Silkies is killed by an unknown force. Cemp tries to investigate, but meets hostility from the other space Silkies. It is possible the victim recognized the nature of the attacker before dying, out of some ancient racial memory. Cemp eventually confronts a powerful alien called a Nijjan, which seems to be able to manipulate time and space itself. Using one of the Glis's weapons, he survives the encounter, but Nijjans begin kidnapping Silkies and Special People from Earth. Alarmingly, this means they learn the Logic of Levels, one of the few weapons which might work against them. Cemp learns that each Nijjan lives alone on a planet, ruling its people like a god. Like the Glis, the Nijjans seem to come from an ancient time, when time and space were plastic and could be ruled by Will. Pushing his shape-shifting abilities, Cemp is able to take on the form of the Nijjans. Using Logic of Levels, he starts a sequence of reactions in them which infects each one and passes to another Nijjan along the communications links they maintain. The self-destruction caused by this collapses reality itself, until Cemp's awareness is the only thing left in existence. Cemp realizes that, while in the form of a Nijjan, he can imagine any kind of Universe and bring it into being. He decides to imagine one without the Nijjans, the Glis or the Kibmadine. He restores the Earth to its place in orbit around the Sun, also decides to make all humans into Silkies, abolishing the divisions threatening to tear the Earth apart. He then enters this universe and re-joins his people, and especially his wife. External links * 1969 Canadian novels 1969 science fiction novels Novels by A.

Built in 1816, it is the town's oldest surviving public building, and the one in which the meeting leading to its separation from Rochester took place. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history Historic drawing of the Third Meetinghouse The Third Meetinghouse occupies a prominent place in Mattapoisett's town center, at the northwest corner of Main and Fairhaven Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It has a projecting gabled section at the center of its front facade, with entrances flanking it on either side. Rising above the main roof and this section is an octagonal tower, whose second stage features round-arch louvers, and whose top is in a bellcast shape. The building corners have paneled pilasters, and the gables and eaves are adorned with modillion blocks. Many of the windows are topped by rounded arches in the Italianate style. The Third Meetinghouse was built in 1816 for the Second Parish of Rochester (established 1736), after its second meetinghouse had its roof blown off by a hurricane. In 1837 the parish population held a meeting in which it was decided to seek separation from Rochester, resulting in Mattapoisett's eventual incorporation in 1857. The building was at first used for both civic and religious purposes, with the congregation moving out after 28 years because it outgrew the space. In 1854, the building was adapted for use as a secondary school, which operated until 1862. After 1870 the meeting house became the Barstow School.Mary Hall Leonard, Mattapoisett and Old Rochester, Massachusetts (The Grafton press, 1907) https://books.google.com/books?id=gPwcAAAAMAAJ The building was acquired by the local Grange chapter in 1915.

It tells the story of Margaret Thorne Brent, a Connecticut psychiatrist and potential cold-blooded killer who may have committed \\"the perfect crime.\\" When her wealthy husband, W. Harrison Brent, turns up dead, she gets caught in the middle of a terrifying game of cat and mouse with her deranged patient, Lionel McAuley, and Inspector Ascher, the handsome but duplicitous investigator assigned to the case. Perfect Crime is the longest-running play in New York City history, with over 12,000 performances.Off-Broadway's Perfect Crime to Mark 12,000th Performance This Weekend\\", BroadwayWorld, July 14, 2016 Background The play has been called \\"an urban legend\\" by The New York Times critic Jason ZinomanNew York Times preview because of its long and storied history. Perfect Crime was originally optioned for Broadway in 1980, just after author Manzi graduated from the Yale School of Drama. At age 25, Manzi, then starring as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Amadeus on Broadway, was the youngest American author ever to have a play optioned for Broadway. After producer Morton Gottlieb wanted to change the play's title to Guilty Hands, Manzi lost interest and went to Hollywood to write screenplays, including one of the many versions of the film Clue. The play ultimately began its life several years later in 1987, in Greenwich Village at the Courtyard Playhouse on Grove Street, produced by the Actors Collective, a not-for-profit theater company whose artistic director was Warren Manzi. Commercial producer Armand Hyatt moved the show immediately after its four-week limited run to an Off- Broadway venue.Official website of Perfect Crime Since opening on April 18, 1987, Perfect Crime has played for more than 12,000 performances, starring Catherine Russell. It is directed by Jeffrey Hyatt. It played in several New York theaters during its early years: * the 47th Street Theater * the Harold Clurman Theater * Theatre Four (now the Julia Miles Theater) * the McGinn/Cazale Theater * INTAR Theatre The show settled into a long run at the Duffy Theater at 46th Street and Broadway, in a renovated burlesque house above the former Times Square landmark, the Howard Johnson's. After that property was sold in 2005, Perfect Crime found a home at The Theater Center located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway in Times Square, where it remains.Perfect Crime, Playbill In November 2016, Gary Busey spent two weeks in the role of Lionel.\\"Gary Busey on His Off-Broadway Debut\\" by Steven Zeitchik, Los Angeles Times, December 7, 2016\\"Gary Busey to Make Off-Broadway Debut\\", BroadwayWorld, October 13, 2016 Catherine Russell The play's leading lady, Catherine Russell, has performed the role of Margaret Thorne Brent since the beginning of the play's run in 1987. She has missed only four performances (to attend her siblings' weddings). She has never taken a sick day or a vacation day. The subject of Russell's longevity has been covered by People, Playbill, Today, and Entertainment Tonight. Russell holds the world record for the most performances as a character in a play. The play had its 12,000th performance on July 16, 2016. Characters *Margaret Thorne Brent, a psychiatrist *Philip Reynolds, posing as W. Harrison Brent, Margaret's husband, also a psychiatrist *Inspector James Ascher *Lionel McAuley, a patient of Margaret's *David Breuer, host of a local cable television show (appears on videotape) Plot One Sunday night, at the home of the wealthy Brents, psychiatrists living in a swanky Connecticut community, a woman shoots a man. By the time handsome detective James Ascher arrives, the body is gone. Ascher suspects the wife, Margaret Thorne Brent, a smart and sharp-tongued psychiatrist and novelist, although her patients are also suspect. One of her patients, Lionel McAuley, seeks fame as the \\"Baseball Bat Killer\\": he had previously killed his wife's lovers. During the course of his week-long investigation, more people are murdered (with a baseball bat), and Ascher finally learns the following: Margaret and her husband Harrison had been rehearsing a nightmare, for some time, with her patient Carlotta Donovan involving Carlotta's pretending to shoot and kill a man. Six months ago, Harrison, during one of these role playing therapy sessions, committed suicide by putting real bullets in the gun he gave to Carlotta. Realizing that she had just killed Harrison, Carlotta also committed suicide. When Margaret returned home to find the dead bodies, she hid Harrison's body the fireplace brickwork and, after disfiguring Carlotta's dead body to disguise its identity, sank it in Scotty's Pond. Knowing that Harrison's huge fortune would revert to his family in England upon his death, she quickly arranged for a former lover, Phillip Reynolds, to impersonate Harrison until she could transfer all of his accounts. During Ascher's investigation, Reynolds kills Mrs. Johaneston, the cook, when she realizes that he is an imposter. Margaret's patient McAuley takes credit for the murders of Harrison and Carlotta and then Mrs. Johaneston. Nevertheless, Reynolds also kills McAuley, because McAuley witnessed Phillip and Margaret enter Mrs. Johaneston's apartment on the night of her murder. Believing that Margaret was falling in love with Ascher, the insanely jealous Reynolds, after beating McAuley to death, flees to England, leaving Margaret in the house with the dead body lying in her office as the police arrive. Ascher also finds, to everyone's surprise, that Margaret was Carlotta's birth mother, that Carlotta had tracked down Margaret and become Harrison's lover. It is not clear whether her birth father was Harrison or Reynolds. Carlotta had hoped to work her way into the Brents' lives, angry at her English upbringing by a sexually abusive adoptive father rather than by the wealthy Brents. When Margaret finds out that Carlotta was her daughter and that she will be arrested as an accessory to the murders of Mrs. Johaneston and McAuley, she tries to commit suicide, but Ascher has filled her gun with blanks. A key clue to Ascher's finding Harrison's body in the fireplace is a painting on the fireplace brickwork that Ascher realizes was altered when the bricks were replaced in the wrong order. Nevertheless, Ascher and Margaret seem to be falling in love. Because of the complexity, a two-page Perfect Crime answer sheetSpoilers is available at the end of the performance.

The Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke of Lithuania himself or his second-in-command. History After the demise of Gediminas in December 1337, the Duchy of Lithuania was divided into two parts: Grand Duke Algirdas ruled Vilnius and the Eastern Auk≈°taitija while his brother Kƒôstutis received the Duchy of Trakai. In 1382, during the Lithuanian Civil War, Kƒôstutis was imprisoned at the Kreva Castle and died. His nephew Skirgaila was named the new Duke of Trakai by his brother Grand Duke Jogaila. Vytautas, son of Kƒôstutis, then waged a new Lithuanian Civil War to regain his patrimony in Trakai and seize power in Lithuania. The war was ended by the Ostr√≥w Agreement on August 4, 1392. The agreement transferred the Duchy from Skirgaila to Vytautas. On October 2, 1413, Vilnius and Trakai Voivodeships were created by the Union of Horod≈Ço from the Duchy of Trakai. The voivodeships were ruled by an appointed official and not by the dukes. Geography One could delineate the boundaries of the Duchy of Trakai by referring to the donative writ of Grand Duke Jogaila: from the Livonian border (Upyt–ª) to Kobrynin (Masuria), and eastward from Podlesie to Pinsk.

Biography  Nitza Ben-Dov was born in Tel Aviv to parents who were Holocaust survivors. Her father, Dov (Bernard) Fruchtman, was a teacher of literature and wrote a series of research studies on the oeuvre of S.Y. Agnon. Ben-Dov completed her secondary studies at the New High School (Tichon Hadash) in Tel Aviv in 1968. She served in the Israel Defense Forces (1968‚Äì1970) in the Nahal Brigade, at Nahal Golan. Ben-Dov studied Hebrew Literature and Biblical Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem from 1970 to 1973 and received a teaching certificate in 1974. In 1974-1983, she did a master's degree and doctorate at the University of California in Berkeley. Her doctoral dissertation was on dreams and psychology in the work of Agnon and Franz Kafka. She was an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1986 to 1989. In 1989, she began to teach Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of Haifa, becoming a full professor in 1999. She has served as Editor-in-Chief of Haifa University Press/Zmora-Bitan (1996‚Äì2000) and as chair of the Academic TV channel (2001‚Äì2005). Ben-Dov is married to Yosi Ben-Dov, the principal and Managing Director of the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, and they have three children.Agnon's Art of Indirection: Uncovering Latent Content in the Fiction of S.Y. Agnon. Brill's Series in Jewish Studies, Leiden and New York, 1993.  Research  Ben-Dov has published books, articles, and essays on S. Y. Agnon, Abraham B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, S. Yizhar, Yehuda Amichai, Yehoshua Kenaz, Yehudit Handel, Haim Be'er, Sami Michael, Zeruya Shalev, Yehudit Rotem, and Dahlia Ravikovitch. Her research combines structuralist, feminist, psychoanalytical, and biographical elements in the work of these authors, along with intra-textual and inter-textual scrutiny. Her book Agnon's Art of Indirection: Uncovering Latent Content in the Fiction of S.Y Agnon, published in 1993, revealed the possibility of analyzing Agnon's work (characterized by \\"the art of indirection\\", a term coined by Ben-Dov) even when translated into English. Ben-Dov has introduced Agnon to scholars of literature outside Israel and proved that it is possible to analyze word by word, through close reading, the unique nature of Agnon's work. Although the nuanced relations of the 'latent' and the 'uncovered' layers are attached through the essence of the Hebrew language, Ben-Dov illustrates that the greatness of a writer must withstand translation. The book surveys the methods, themes, and materials in Agnon's art, and deals extensively with dreams and their interpretation. It presents intersections of meaning in Agnon's writings, in which various layers are brought to light: psychoanalytical and cultural; a discussion is conducted on Biblical infrastructures, which the English reader may find in the translations of the works, in contrast to the Talmudic infrastructures. The Hebrew book Unhappy/unapproved Loves: Erotic Frustration, Art and Death in the Work of Agnon (1997) enlarges the discussion of the Agnonian corpus and contains psychoanalytical discussions in the spirit of Freud and Jung; along with these are inter-textual discussions, both literary ‚Äì as to the affinities between Agnon and Mann, Kafka, Voltaire, and Flaubert ‚Äì and artistic- anthropological, on the affinity of the writings to the works of Rembrandt and Arnold B√∂cklin. The combination of methods constructs an autonomous cultural interpretation, which deciphers the Agnonian character, as well as the society out of which it arises. Common to the corpus under consideration is the theme of unfulfilled love and frustration that this invites. In this book Ben-Dov holds a dialogue with Agnon scholars and critics, and offers an original interpretation of his writing. Her Hebrew book And It Is Your Praise: Studies in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon, A. B. Yehoshua and Amos Oz (2006) concerns particular, intra-textual research, mapping repetitive primary themes and literary formats in Agnon, Yehoshua, and Oz. It also conducts inter-textual research, singling out the tangential points of Yehoshua (to whom is devoted Ben-Dov's Hebrew book In the Opposite Direction, 1995, about the novel Mr. Mani) and Oz on the one hand, and Agnon and the other: Agnon is a 'father figure' and the creator of literary models on which Oz and Yehoshua draw. In addition, the book indicates the unique elements in the works of Oz and Yehoshua after they lay down a mature fictional mode. The writings that Ben- Dov chose to discuss are timeless. Her Hebrew-language book Written Lives: On Israeli Literary Autobiographies (Hayyim Ktuvim, 2011) is a scholarly response to the wave of autobiographic and biographic prose that has flooded Hebrew literature (and literature generally) since the early 1990s. Ben-Dov assigns Preliminaris by S. Yizhar, published in 1992, as the starting point of this salient trend in Israeli literature. In its wake came self-declared autobiographic novels: The Pure Element of Time (Havalim) by Haim Be'er (1998), A Tale of Love and Darkness (Sippur al ahava vehoshekh) by Amos Oz (2002), My Russian Grandmother and Her American Vacuum Cleaner (Ha-davar haya kakha) by Meir Shalev (2009), and Spanish Charity (Hessed sefaradi) by A.B. Yehoshua (2011). In Ben-Dov's discussion of Preliminaris and these others, she substantiates the two faces of this genre: a factual or semi-factual account tied in with a well designed written work. Ben-Dov likewise scrutinizes that dialectics of the later self-declared autobiographic work with earlier writings by these authors. Ben-Dov studies autobiographic writings that preceded the torrent of late 20th and early 21st century: Agnon's story \\"The Mark\\" (Hasiman), the full version of which was published in 1962, the two semi-autobiographic novels by Sami Michael Refuge (Hasut) and A Handful of Fog (Hofen shel arafel), published in the late 1970s, and the complex of Dahlia Ravikovitch's prose and poetry, from which the experience of orphanhood erupts. Written Lives also contains scholarly discussions of writings that are not purely literary, such as the Baghdad Yesterday: The Making of an Arab Jew (Bebagdad etmol), which is the memoirs of the literature scholar Sasson Somekh (2004); Yosef Haim Brenner: A Biography (Yosef Hayyim Brenner: Sippur hayyim) by the historian Anita Shapira (2008); and Home (Habayta), a novel of the kibbutz by Assaf Inbari (2009). Written Lives has a three-part Introduction and an Epilogue.  Published books * Agnon's Art of Indirection: Uncovering Latent Content in the Fiction of S.Y.

He is mostly recognized for his work on fertilizers, fume damage of plants and his book Die Schule der Chemie (School of Chemistry), which was translated into 14 languages. His 500 lectures and over 500 publications helped to establish agricultural chemistry in Germany. Life St√∂ckhardt was born in R√∂hrsdorf near Mei√üen on 4 January 1809 as son of a preacher. He was apprentice in a pharmacy from 1824 to 1828, studied at the University of Berlin, and obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig in 1837. He worked at a mineral water factory from 1835 till he received a position at the K√∂niglichen Gewerbeschule in Chemnitz (Royal Saxon Industrial School) in 1838. In 1846 he became a member of Dresden's scientific society ISIS, led by Ludwig Reichenbach. Building in Tharandt named after St√∂ckhardt From 1847 to 1883, St√∂ckhardt worked at the K√∂nigliche Forstakademie (Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry) in Tharandt, where a building was named after him. In 1866, he was elected Fellow of the Leopoldina.List of deceased Leopoldina members (pdf, 1 MB) He died in Tharandt on 1 June 1886 three years after he retired from the Forstakademie. One of his sons, Carl Georg St√∂ckhardt, emigrated to the United States and taught exegesis at the Concordia Seminary of the Lutheran Church St. Louis.Christian Cyclopedia Work After the book of Justus von Liebig, Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology was published in 1840, St√∂ckhardt recognized the importance of fertilization for farmers and invested most of his time in popularizing scientific knowledge. In 1843 he started to give chemical lectures for farmers. In 1850 he and Hugo Schober started to publish the Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsche Landwirthe (Journal for German farmers). One year later, Germany's first large agricultural experiment station opened in Leipzig-M√∂ckern, initiated by St√∂ckhardt. His research on fertilizers was influenced by the work of Liebig, but St√∂ckhardt included nitrogen compounds into his fertilizers. Liebig denied the need to include nitrogen because it was available as gas from air. This conflict escalated into an academic fight between him and the nitrogen advocates which also ended the friendship between St√∂ckhardt and Liebig. Eventually, nitrogen containing fertilizers became a great success. His research in fume damage on plants especially by industrial exhaust was ground breaking. He fumigated plants with known amount of several chemical compounds, for example sulfur dioxide, to detect the minimal concentration at which damages occurs. A Commission for the detection of the damage caused by smelters was introduced and the state parliament of Saxony also dealt with damage caused by smelters after his results were published.

He managed David Bowie's career during his elevation to global stardom, but later fell out with him in a contract dispute. He established a rights management organisation called MainMan and helped launch the careers of Iggy Pop, Mick Ronson, Mott the Hoople, Dana Gillespie and John Cougar Mellencamp. Defries and MainMan have received multiple awards for their achievements in the music industry. Early life One of four children born to Edward and Lily Defries, the family had a second- hand and antique business close to Shepherd's Bush Market. In 1944, children were being evacuated from London to escape the V-1 flying bombs. Defries was too young to be evacuated as his mother had two young children and was expecting another, he was placed into foster care and only returned to the family after the War. He suffered from severe asthma and attended a school for children with special needs. Career=Early Career and GEM Music Group= Defries started his career at the age of 16 in a number of junior positions at firms of solicitors. Whilst he was at of Martin Boston & Co. in Wigmore Street, London he acted for Mickie Most in a dispute involving The Animals in 1964. For some years after that he worked with Most, advising him and later working with Allen Klein on his behalf. Defries learnt about bargaining techniques, the intricacies of master recording ownership and how to squeeze the best from every deal from Klein. Because of his dealings with Most and his problem-solving abilities, he was approached by his future business partner, Laurence Myers, whose accounting firm were handling Most's accounts at the time. Myers said \\"He was a visionary. I remember him telling me many, many, many years ago that one day everyone at home will have a laptop computer\\". Defries later worked with photographers to resolve their copyright and other issues, starting with Don Silverstein, an American photographer living and working in London, who had taken photographs of Jimi Hendrix. These images were being used without his permission and Defries helped him retain the rights to his images and the related revenue. Through Silverstein, Defries was approached by other photographers such as Brian Duffy, David Bailey, Terence Donovan and Antony Armstrong-Jones. In order to best assist them, and future photographers, he 1968 he helped found the Association of Fashion and Advertising Photographers (AFAP), later to become the Association of Photographers (AOP). Defries would later commission Brian Duffy to design the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane, and Terry O'Neill to shoot the Diamond Dogs album. Defries and Myers worked with songwriters, composers, performers and producers, including Mike Leander, Geoff Stephens, Peter Eden, Barry Mason, Roger Cook, Mike D'abo, Donovan, Roger Greenaway, Lionel Bart, Ossie Byrne and Tony Macaulay. Defries was instigated legal proceedings for Tony Macaulay in the landmark case against his publishers, Schroeder Music. The case of Schroeder Music Publishing vs Macaulay was resolved in Macaulay's favour in the House of Lords, setting a precedent used by many other songwriters to gain better terms. In 1969 Defries and Myers formed the GEM Music Group, an independent music label, music publisher, rights management and personal management company. GEM's first release, on Bell Records, was \\"Love Grows (Where my Rosemary Goes)\\" performed by Edison Lighthouse, and written and produced by Tony McCauley. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in 1970. In 1970, David Bowie was recommended to Defries by Olav Wyper, the head of Philips UK, his record company. Bowie was dissatisfied with his manager Ken Pitt and needed help. Defries realised David's potential and Myers said Tony had \\"the vision. His great ability was, far more than I did, he knew what a star David was going to be\\". Defries had a reputation for renegotiating contracts and proceeded to extract Bowie from all his existing contracts: management, recording (Mercury) and publishing (Essex Music). GEM signed an exclusive contract with Bowie in 1970 and when the Mercury contract was terminated in 1971, Defries was free to sign a record deal with RCA. Defries would go on to sign Iggy Pop, Dana Gillespie and Mick Ronson with GEM. In 1971, Defries had decided that breaking Bowie in the US would require a permanent corporate presence and suggested to Myers that they open offices in New York. By that time, GEM had established a significant position in the UK industry and Myers was uncomfortable about risking that base in a new US venture. As a result, Defries and Myers discussed a division of the various talent GEM represented and reached a settlement which would allow Defries to keep certain artists while the rest remained with GEM. They signed an agreement where Defries would take David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Mott the Hoople, Dana Gillespie and Mick Ronson in return for a financial settlement. =MainMan Group of Companies= Defries formed the MainMan Group of Companies in 1972, with offices in New York, London and Tokyo. These companies had a management structure that combined ingredients of the movie studio with those of the independent producer, record label, music publisher and management. The original MainMan team was made up of members from Andy Warhol‚Äôs The Factory and his now-famous production of his play, Pork. The company‚Äôs management included Cherry Vanilla, Tony Zanetta and Jamie Andrews. Defries had a zero- tolerance drug policy and no unauthorised press access policy. As a strategy to control the narrative and create demand, all access public and press was denied. This was based on protocols used by the movie studios in the 1950s to make their stars famous. MainMan had their own in-house photographers, Mick Rock and Leee Black Childers, and forbade all other unauthorised photographers. A key part of Defries‚Äô strategy with MainMan was to control the creative process of Bowie's next album, Hunky Dory, by funding it independently, before approaching RCA. This gave Bowie creative freedom, without being forced to fit into any traditional record company genres and co- ownership of his music copyrights. Tony Zanetta (President of MainMan, USA) said \\"Tony threw the book out the window. He loved to take huge gambles‚Ä¶\\" After Lou Reed‚Äôs disastrous first solo album for RCA, Bowie and Defries decided to help Reed and arranged for Bowie and Mick Ronson to produce his follow-up, Transformer. They invited Reed to make his first UK appearance as a surprise guest at a 'Friends of the Earth, Save the Whale Benefit Concert' with Bowie and The Spiders from Mars at the Royal Festival Hall on July 8, 1972. This concert took place just two days after Bowie's performance of \\"Starman\\" on Top of the Pops - widely considered to be a turning point in his career. With Bowie on the brink of stardom (Ziggy Stardust hit #5 and Hunky Dory #3 on the UK charts and hundreds of Ziggy clones attended his concerts), Defries informed his staff \\"As far as RCA in America are concerned, the young man with red hair sitting at the end of this table is the biggest thing to come out of England since the Beatles. And if we get this right there‚Äôs every possibility we will be as big as the Beatles, if not bigger\\". Defries arranged to fly over American journalists to see Bowie live in preparation for his upcoming US tour. Defries instructed Tony Zanetta to set up the MainMan office in an Upper East Side New York apartment and he employed a cavalcade of exotic characters. The first North American concert date was September 22, in Cleveland for an audience of three thousand and the tour ended December 2 at Tower Theatre, Pennsylvania. After that first concert Defries had promised they would come back to play Cleveland in a bigger venue holding ten thousand people and that is exactly what they did. MainMan artists were among the best rock 'n rollers of their time, and the company's culture was to treat all their artists as equals and to ensure that all their needs were met. A lot of cash was spent as the artists had a high burn rate. Bowie was doing well, but \\"not selling anywhere near a Rolling Stones or Elton John-like level until 1975\\". Defries saw Mick Ronson as an extraordinary musical talent and believed he could have a solo career and together they devised a course to stardom, start with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre. According to Ronson \\"the question of whether those Rainbow concerts were good ones or bad is beside the point. The fact that I managed to sell the place out two nights running must mean that people thought I was worth seeing\\". Ronson's production and arrangements of notable albums such as Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane showed his skills in the studio and in live playing. \\"Ronson made David Bowie‚Äôs new music bigger, tougher and sexier. He was the muscle in the mix,\\" Bowie recalled, \\"Mick was the perfect foil for the Ziggy character, Ziggy and Mick were the personification of the rock & roll dualism\\". Ronson was a naturally gifted musician who wrote the string arrangements for both Bowie's \\"Life on Mars?\\" and Lou Reed's \\"Perfect Day\\". John Mellencamp also said that Ronson helped arrange \\"Jack & Diane\\". =Bowie / Defries= alt=At the start of their relationship, Bowie and Defries became very close friends. Bowie described their relationship as a \\"marriage-made-in-heaven\\" and said they were \\"very, very strong buddies\\", even though he understood that if they had no business together, they probably wouldn't see each other. Defries believed that David Bowie was going to be a superstar and should be marketed under a brand name \\"Bowie\\". Defries determination and talent for promotion were a major contribution to Bowie's success. Towards the end of 1973, and after a successful world tour, Bowie was living in London and Defries in New York. Bowie saw many musicians, producers and girlfriends come and go from his life, but Defries‚Äô oversight remained constant. \\"It could be anything: business, what people see, girlfriends, Tony would orchestrate it all,\\" said Ava Cherry. On top of the distance between them, their friendship began to deteriorate as Bowie developed a cocaine habit. Defries‚Äô no tolerance to drugs policy and Bowie's increase in drug use created strain and estrangement between them. Although MainMan, with Defries at the helm, was Bowie's employer, they were partners. The employment contract shared Bowie's royalties fifty-fifty, a split that Bowie later came to resent. The complex contract was unique for a time when most artists did not own their recordings or copyright. They would have more leverage with the record companies and Defries could negotiate better royalty rates. MainMan had licensed Bowie's recording services to RCA in 1971, which meant once the contract expired Bowie/Defries would get their masters back and could renegotiate with a new licensee. Defries took a risk on an unknown artist. He believed Bowie was going to be a star so helped create a \\"magical aura, a cocoon in which David could create\\". Bowie sacked Defries as his manager in 1975, and remained resentful of Defries share of his earnings and his control over his career. As Bowie and Defries co-owned the rights to everything they published and recorded together, Bowie would later require a large cash injection to buy Defries out. As a manageable way forward, David Pullman came up with the idea of securitising the intellectual property against future earnings. Resentment by Bowie against his former friend lingered, so Pullman dealt with Bowie and Defries separately. In an interview later Pullman said \\"It‚Äôs like a marriage. The flipside is Tony is very savvy. I didn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs an attorney, not just a manager. Tony didn‚Äôt have anything to say about David. They helped each other early on. Tony taught him some of the things he learned along the way about owning things.\\" In 1997 the Bowie Bonds began as a stock of $55 million and appeared on the cover of the Wall Street Journal. In 2011 Defries was sued by Capitol Records for copyright infringement over misuse of Bowie material. He lost the lawsuit with damages and costs against him exceeding US$9 million. Later career=Iota Inc.= In 1991, he founded IOTA Inc, a private technology research company which worked with major universities and government agencies on a range of communications and other technologies, securing a number of patents. Defries worked with Oxford University Communications Engineering Department and leading UK optical / photonic companies and research groups on the design and development of optical wireless technology. In 2000 he lost US$22 million in an offshore tax evasion scheme. =Matter Inc.= In 2005 Defries founded Matter Inc, a Caltech/Stanford startup for plasmonic research and development with scientists from Stanford, California Institute of Technology and New York University to work on materials science, nanophotonics and energy related projects.

Her production includes multi-platform media artworks, photography, paintings, short films, books and stage performances. Her works have been exhibited and performed in 50 countries and she has received numerous international awards.\\"Choosing My Religion\\", Neimenster.lu, 2012 Liulia first became interested in photography, painting, experimental film and cultural history while studying at Savonlinna Upper Secondary School of Art and Music. She continued her artistic studies at the University of Art and Design Helsinki, and broadened her horizons also by studying aesthetics, literature and political history at the University of Helsinki, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1986.

It was a moment in my life when I finished writing the concept of the Jackpot interactive installation in 1991. After discussing with technicians I suddenly realized there is no other way - I had to start to work with computers. I used computers in the 1980s already while making sound and light installations. By the early nineties I had started to direct a team of professionals. Production of large multimedia programs started.\\"\\"Playing Your Cards Right\\", Johanna Hyt√∂nen, Blue Wings, 2003 She further explained her choice of art form in 2005: \\"Interactive multimedia was a very welcome format for me, since I had most of the necessary skills for directing it. I thought the monitor is a small theatre where all magic can happen‚Ä¶ I also like to work in a team and I have always been curious about new technologies, especially the possibilities they offer me as an artist.

I'm a writer, a visual artist, but also a researcher and producer. In my versatile works I combine different art forms, research and technology.

Tero Saarinen's interpretation of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring in collaboration with multimedia artist Marita Liulia has been performed 174 times, in 82 cities and 32 countries in Asia, Africa, South and North America as well as in Europe. International critics praised HUNT for its deep intensity, imagination and technical expertise. \\"In ‚ÄùHUNT‚Äù, a mesmerizing solo he created for himself to Stravinsky's ‚ÄùRite of Spring,‚Äù he (Saarinen) is both the hunter and the hunted, assaulted by inner demons.

In Liulia's opinion it is also an apt description of Maire CD-ROM: \\"Maire presents a cheerful postmodern look at modernism, the movement which would become a dramatic influence in Finland. Maire follows the evolution of modernism from the 1930s to the present day.\\" It can also be perceived as \\"an art historic essay, with supplementary material added on the subject of Maire Gullichsen's life\\".\\"Expanding Practices in Audiovisual Narrative\\", edited by Raivo Kelomees and Chris Hales, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2014 -> website info Ambitious Bitch, 1996 An extensive multimedia piece published in interactive CD-ROM format. Ambitious Bitch explored views of femininity in the modern world. It was also Marita Liulia's international artistic breakthrough. According to Marita Liulia, \\"Ambitious Bitch is a contemporary Western woman: well-educated, witty, understanding but demanding, fighting against old role models but always ready to laugh ‚Äì even at herself. She may be a man-eater but definitely not a man-hater! Ambitious Bitch, distinctively combining art, research and technology, is a visual and intellectually playful outlook on Western femininity of our times. The many faces of femininity (and feminism) are revealed with sharp quotes by contemporary icons ranging from Mae West to Madonna, from Alexandra Kollontai to Vivienne Westwood. The playful sound design and excellent graphics add to the joy of discovery.\\" Ambitious Bitch also provoked questions about Liulia's feminism in her art, and she discussed the matter in 2000: \\"The field of the new media developed simultaneously with the high tide of feminism. Lots of (young) women got involved - expecting to avoid patriarchal hierarchies typical of the \\"old media\\" - like film. I considered studying film in the 1980s but quickly realized I will be 50 before the guys in power will allow me to make my first feature film - until that I would have also run out of ideas, I thought. None of my female film director friends ever made a feature film. In the multimedia nobody knew so much how to play boss. These days I think a female director is not a strange creature from outer space...but you have to be \\"a bulldozer\\", as you put it once. No mistakes allowed. Since this promising start the number of female students in technology has declined rapidly. (...) Me a cyber-feminist? Why not! It depends what you mean by this. Does it mean one is a feminist? For me it simply means a person who wants equality. Even in cyberspace.

SOB contemplated manhood and masculinity based on extensive research on Men's Studies. SOB's protagonist is Jacques L. Froid, a psychoanalyst of English-French origin. Marita Liulia about SOB in 1999: \\"After several years' immersion in women's issues I couldn't help but turn my gaze towards men. While women were fighting for their rights, exploring new areas and rewriting history into herstory, what was happening to men?‚Äù Liulia asks, and continues: ‚ÄúI lovingly named the CD-ROM Son of a Bitch. Our SOB man is a self-assured object of the viewer‚Äôs gaze. SOB is a (post)modern, urban, Western male. SOB‚Äôs problems may be new, but so are his possibilities. SOB turns his gaze toward the future rather than the past. Thus some old concepts like masculinity have to be reconsidered. What does the notion ‚Äòman‚Äô actually mean? Behind the obvious concepts we find constantly changing meanings.\\"\\"Welcome to the Bitch World\\", Kirsi V√§kiparta, NU - Nordic Art Review, 1999 \\"I spent three years delving into the man‚Äôs world,‚Äù says Liulia. \\"I began to realise that men‚Äôs roles are much narrower than those of women.\\"\\"Playing Your Cards Right\\", Johanna Hyt√∂nen, Blue Wings, 2003 -> website info Marita Liulia Tarot, 2003 Liulia's take on the traditional game of Tarot has been exhibited in many countries since its premi√®re show in Italy in 2003. \\"Multimedia artist Marita Liulia got her first deck of Tarot cards back in 1981.

She has frequently performed as a witch during Marita Liulia Tarot shows, for instance at Techfest in 2014, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India. Marita Liulia pondered on the question of why people are so interested in Tarot in 2014: \\"People are interested in themselves. Tarot hardly tells you anything you don't know or feel already.

Biography Heinrich Edmund Naumann was hired by the Meiji government in 1875 as a foreign advisor, with the task of introducing the science of geology to Japan through his teaching at the Kaisei Gakk≈ç, the forerunner to Tokyo Imperial University. Naumann arrived in Japan just one month before his twenty-fifth birthday, receiving a yearly salary of 3600 yen.Tanaka, New Times in Modern Japan. page 63 Overall, he spent ten years in Japan, and wrote numerous scientific papers, most of which remain untranslated from the original German. During his early years in Japan, he both cooperated with, and competed against, fellow geologist John Milne. Both were part of the European scientific community interested in exploring the origins of the earth and the fledgling science of vulcanology. In 1877, Naumann and Milne investigated a volcanic eruption on the island of Izu ≈åshima near Tokyo.Tanaka, New Times in Modern Japan. page 61 However, by the 1880s, Milne focused more on seismology, whereas Naumann concentrated on his attempts to complete a geological map of the Japanese archipelago. Naumann conducted numerous geological surveys, traveling over 10,000 kilometers within Japan, covering almost every province in Honsh≈´, Ky≈´sh≈´ and Shikoku. In 1879, Naumann began publishing his ideas of the geological origins of the Japanese archipelago, which he speculated was created from three major foldings of the Earth's crust, in the pre-Paleozoic, late Paleozoic and Miocene era, and that Japan was composed of two major mountain systems, in the southwest and the northeast. The divide between these mountain systems, a great fault zone which vertically divides the main Japanese island of Honsh≈´ from the Izu Peninsula in the southwest to Toyama in the northeast, he labeled the Fossa magna. Per Naumann's suggestions, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce established a Geology Department in 1878, which began the process of systematically mapping the Japanese archipelago. The foundation of the Geological Survey of Japan came a year before the foundation of the equivalent United States Geological Survey in the United States.Tanaka, New Times in Modern Japan. page 47 Naumann was also interested in paleontology. In 1881, he published a paper on his findings with regards to the findings of fossilized bones remains of elephants in Japan. Elephants were known from the Tokugawa period through Buddhism and as samples brought by Dutch embassies, but were not previously known to have been native to Japan, so his findings received widespread popular publicity. One of the fossils Naumann examined from modern-day Tokyo proved to be a previously unknown extinct species, which was named in his honor: Palaeoloxodon naumanni). Royal Museum of Natural History, Stockholm Other specimens were found at Lake Nojiri in Nagano Prefecture, and have later been discovered in Ky≈´sh≈´. Naumann did not actually excavate any fossils, but examined samples unearthed by Japanese and Western antiquarians, including samples excavated by Dr Edward S. Morse at the ≈åmori shell mounds several years previously. The main significance of Naumann's report was his placement of the fossils in the Pliocene era. Due to the quantity of fossils discovered (both of elephants and other animals as well as of plants), Naumann postulated that Japan was once connected to the Asian mainland via several land bridges through what is now the Korean Peninsula, the Kurile Islands and the Ryukyu islands, and that the climate at the time was tropical.Tanaka, New Times in Modern Japan. page 48 This discovery, based by scientific evidence, that the Japanese archipelago was geologically an appendage to the Asian mainland, had geo-political implications which were not lost on the Meiji government, and geographical offices with often overlapping or conflicting jurisdictions were soon created within the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Home Minister, and Ministry of War. Naumann's years in Japan were eventful. Known for his quick temper, Naumann was known occasionally beating his students, and also came to blows with a subordinate, fellow German topographer, Otto Schmidt, whom he accused of having an affair with his wife. The brawl, which occurred in 1882, was highly public and was sensationalized in the foreign language newspapers in Japan. It resulted in Naumann's arrest and trial before the German Consulate, at which he was fined 300 Marks (‚Ñ≥), but he was able to keep his position.Martin. Japan and Germany in the Modern World After his return to Germany, Naumann continued his work in geology, making important contributions to geological understanding of Anatolia and Mesopotamia. However, after his return to Germany, Naumann also made numerous public comments that were highly critical of Japanese modernization efforts, some of which were published in the Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. Naumann argued that Japan was a dirty, impoverished and backward country, plagued by infectious diseases and barbarous customs. He lambasted the Japanese government for importing western culture and technologies indiscriminately, without any true understanding. Naumann stated that while there were many aspects of Japanese traditional culture that were admirable, the modern Japanese themselves had only contempt for their own history and traditions, and that this lack of respect for their own culture was a serious weakness. These statements were read by Mori ≈ågai, who was studying western medicine in Berlin at the time, leading to a heated newspaper debate. While Mori could easily refute some of Naumann's statements regarding Japanese backwardness, he found it more difficult to refute Naumann's criticism on Japanese westernization. On his return to Japan, Mori himself began to question and oppose efforts at shallow modernization and mimicry of all things Western, and to push for more respect for Japanese traditions.Kat≈ç.

In medicine, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) can be measured in a breath test for asthma or other conditions characterized by airway inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule produced by certain cell types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FENO) is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma. The breath test has recently become available in many well-equipped hospitals in developed countries, although its exact role remains unclear. Biology Three-dimensional model of NO. In humans, nitric oxide is produced from L-arginine by three enzymes called nitric oxide synthases (NOS): inducible (iNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and neuronal (nNOS). The latter two are constantly active in endothelial cells and neurons respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by cytokines). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including eosinophils. As such, eNO (also known as FeNO \\"fractional exhaled nitric oxide\\") has been dubbed an inflammometer. Although iNOS is thought to be the main contributor to exhaled NO in asthmatics, studies in mice also point to a role for nNOS. It was initially thought that exhaled NO derived mostly from the sinuses, which contain high levels of NO. It has subsequently been shown that the lower airways contribute most of the exhaled NO, and that contamination from the sinuses is minimal. Medical use=Asthma= Patients with asthma have higher eNO levels than other people. Their levels also rise together with other clinical and laboratory parameters of asthma (for example, the amount of eosinophils in their sputum). In conditions that trigger inflammation such as upper respiratory tract infections or the inhalation of allergens or plicatic acid, eNO levels rise. The eNO levels also tend to vary according to the results of lung function test results such as the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, drugs used to treat asthma (such as inhaled glucocorticoids or leukotriene receptor antagonists) also reduce eNO levels. Clinical trials have looked at whether tailoring asthma therapy based on eNO values is better than conventional care, in which therapy is gauged by symptoms and the results of lung function tests. To date, the results in both adults and children have been modest and this technique can not be universally recommended. It has also been noted that factors other than inflammation can increase eNO levels, for example airway acidity. The fraction of eNO has been found to be a better test to identify asthmatics than basic lung function testing (for airway obstruction). Its specificity is comparable to bronchial challenge testing, although less sensitive. This means that a positive eNO test might be useful to rule in a diagnosis of asthma; however, a negative test might not be as useful to rule it out. Other conditions The role for eNO in other conditions is even less well established compared to asthma. Since asthma can be a cause of chronic coughing (it may even be the sole manifestation, such as in cough-variant asthma), studies have looked at whether eNO can be used in the diagnosis of chronic cough. Exhaled NO is minimally increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but levels may rise in sudden worsenings of the disease (acute exacerbations) or disease progression. Early findings indicate a possible role for eNO in predicting the response to inhaled glucocorticoids and the degree of airway obstruction reversibility. Children with cystic fibrosis have been found to have low eNO levels. In subjects with bronchiectasis (a state of localized, irreversible dilatation of part of the bronchial tree) not due to cystic fibrosis, high levels have been found. Sarcoidosis could also feature increased eNO. Low levels have been found in primary ciliary dyskinesia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the latter condition, inhaled NO is used as a diagnostic test of the response of the pulmonary arteries to vasodilators (agents that relax the blood vessels). eNO has also been associated with wheeze, rhinitis and nasal allergy in primary school children. Exposure to air pollution has been associated with decreased, and increased eNO levels. Measurement techniques An experimental setup used to measure the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath samples. The subject blows into the tube (1) after a mouthpiece (2) has been connected to it. The wires on the side are part of the system that measures parameters like breath velocity, while the exhaled gas is taken to a FeNO analyzer (3). The most widely used technique to measure eNO is with a chemical reaction that produces light; this is called a chemiluminescence reaction. The NO in the breath sample reacts with ozone to form nitrogen dioxide in an excited state. When this returns to its ground state, it emits light in quantities that are proportional to the amount of exhaled NO. NIOX VERO Medical device for measurement of exhaled nitric oxide The subject can exhale directly into a measurement device ('online' technique), or into a reservoir that can afterwards be connected to the analyser ('offline' technique). With the former technique, the early and later NO in the breath sample can be analysed separately. The test requires little coordination from the subject, and children older than 4 can be tested successfully. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK have published guidance on available measuring devices: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg12 Reference range The upper normal level of eNO in different studies ranges from 20 to 30 parts per billion. However, several major features influence the reference values. Men have higher eNO values than women. Smoking notoriously lowers eNO values, and even former smoking status can influence results. The levels are higher in people with an atopic constitution (a tendency towards allergies). The fraction of eNO is also flow-dependent (higher at lower flow rates and vice versa), so measurements are normally measured at 50 ml/s. Age or height could also considerably confound eNO values in children. The magnitude of these effects lies in the order of 10%, so even single cut-off values might be useful. History Until the 1980s, nitric oxide, a product of fossil fuel combustion, was thought only to play a role the detrimental effects of air pollution on the respiratory tract. In 1987, experiments with coronary arteries showed that nitric oxide was the long sought endothelium-derived relaxing factor. After scientists realised that NO played a biological role, its role as a cell signalling molecule and neurotransmitter became clear from abundant studies. NO was first detected in exhaled breath samples in 1991. In 1992, NO was voted molecule of the year by the scientific journal Science. In 1993, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden were the first to report increased eNO in asthmatics. Today, NO is not only used in breath tests but also as a therapeutic agent for conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and possibly for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Biography He was born in Wildwood, New Jersey and educated at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his A.B. in 1928. For the next two years he was a graduate student at Yale University. In 1932 he married Helen Freeman in Ensenada, Mexico. He served in World War II, and in 1944 married Jean Armstrong. His prolific writing career led to a final residence at Hope Ranch, Santa Barbara where he died on June 11, 1956. Writing His writing is noted for realistic portrayals of Native American life in the early 20th century. After a brief stint at writing for radio, Corle began writing numerous short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines. In 1934 his Mojave: A Book Of Stories was published. This was followed a year later by his first and most successful novel, Fig Tree John, based on a Cahuilla Indian from southern California. In addition to other novels, Corle also wrote non-fiction, including books on the Grand Canyon and the Gila River. His sophisticated interest in the arts is reflected in his works on Igor Stravinsky and the artist Merle Armitage. In the 1950s, Corle began what was to be his most important effort, a multi-volume novel called \\"The Californians\\". The work was left uncompleted upon his death and is included in his extensive papers, letters and manuscripts donated by Ralph B. Sipper of Santa Barbara to Indiana University in 1997. Another important collection of his papers, including correspondence with Lawrence Clark Powell, is in the Special Collections of UCLA.

It is widespread in North America, and was reported from Pakistan in 2006. The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with trees from several genera, including fir, spruce, Douglas-fir, and hemlock. Fruit bodies are white and large, with convex to funnel-shaped caps measuring wide set atop a thick stipe up to long. The gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and sometimes have a faint bluish tint. Spores are roughly spherical, and have a network-like surface dotted with warts. The mushrooms of Russula brevipes often develop under masses of conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees, and fruit from summer to autumn. Forms of the mushroom that develop a bluish band at the top of the stipe are sometimes referred to as variety acrior. Although edible, Russula brevipes mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor. They become more palatable once parasitized by the ascomycete fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum, a bright orange mold that covers the fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms. Taxonomy Russula brevipes was initially described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1890, from specimens collected in Quogue, New York. It is classified in the subsection Lactaroideae, a grouping of similar Russula species characterized by having whitish to pale yellow fruit bodies, compact and hard flesh, abundant lamellulae (short gills), and the absence of clamp connections. Other related Russula species with a similar range of spore ornamentation heights include Russula delica, R. romagnesiana, and R. pseudodelica. There has been considerable confusion in the literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists referred to it as Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of R. delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert K√ºhner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: > Russula delica is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the > evidence indicates that R. delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R. delica sensu > Singer (1938), which in turn is not R. delica sensu K√ºhner and Romagnesi > (1953)‚Ä¶ It is best to use R. brevipes for the North American collections > which most authors but not K√ºhner and Romagnesi (1953), call R. delica. The > name, R. brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably > explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a > species concept can be formed. Shaffer defined the Russula brevipes varieties acrior and megaspora in 1964 from Californian specimens. The former is characterized by a greenish-blue band that forms at the top of the stipe, while the latter variety has large spores. The nomenclatural database Index Fungorum does not consider these varieties to have independent taxonomical significance. In a 2012 publication, mycologist Mike Davis and colleagues suggest that western North American Russula brevipes comprise a complex of at least four distinct species. According to MycoBank, the European species Russula chloroides is synonymous with R. brevipes, although Index Fungorum and other sources consider them distinct species. The specific epithet brevipes is derived from the Latin words brevis \\"short\\" and pes \\"foot\\", hence \\"short-footed\\". Common names used to refer to the mushroom include short-stemmed russula, short-stalked white russula, and stubby brittlegill. Description alt=Closeup of a white mushroom, showing a bluish-green band of color at the intersection of the gills and stipe. Fully grown, the cap can range from in diameter, whitish to dull-yellow, and is funnel-shaped with a central depression. The gills are narrow and thin, decurrent in attachment, nearly white when young but becoming pale yellow to buff with age, and sometimes forked near the stipe. The stipe is 3‚Äì8 cm long and 2.5‚Äì4 cm thick. It is initially white but develops yellowish-brownish discolorations with age. The mushroom sometimes develops a pale green band at the top of the stipe. The spore print is white to light cream. Spores of R. brevipes are egg-shaped to more or less spherical, and measure 7.5‚Äì10 by 6.5‚Äì8.5 ¬µm; they have a partially reticulate (network-like) surface dotted with warts measuring up to 1 ¬µm high. The cap cuticle is arranged in the form of a cutis (characterized by hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) comprising interwoven hyphae with rounded tips. There are no cystidia on the cap (pileocystidia). The variant R. brevipes var. acrior Shaffer has a subtle green shading at the stipe apex and on the gills. R. brevipes var. megaspora has spores measuring 9‚Äì14 by 8‚Äì12 ¬µm. =Similar species= Russula delica is one of several R. brevipes look-alikes The subalpine waxy cap (Hygrophorus subalpinus) is somewhat similar in appearance to R. brevipes but lacks its brittle flesh, and it has a sticky, glutinous cap. The Pacific Northwest species Russula cascadensis also resembles R. brevipes, but has an acrid taste and smaller fruit bodies. Another lookalike, R. vesicatoria, has gills that often fork near the stipe attachment. R. angustispora is quite similar to R. brevipes, but has narrower spores measuring 6.5‚Äì8.5 by 4.5‚Äì5 ¬µm, and it does not have the pale greenish band that sometimes develops in the latter species. The European look-alike R. delica is widely distributed, although rarer in the northern regions of the continent. Similar to R. brevipes in overall morphology, it has somewhat larger spores (9‚Äì12 by 7‚Äì8.5 ¬µm) with a surface ornamentation featuring prominent warts interconnected by a zebra-like patterns of ridges. The milk- cap mushroom Lactifluus piperatus can be distinguished from R. brevipes by the production of latex when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured. Distribution and habitat It is a common ectomycorrhizal fungus associated with several hosts across temperate forest ecosystems. Typical hosts include trees in the genera Abies, Picea, Pseudotsuga, and Tsuga. The fungus has been reported in Pakistan's Himalayan moist temperate forests associated with Pinus wallichiana. Fruit bodies grow singly or in groups; fruiting season occurs from summer to autumn. In western North America, where the mushroom is quite common, it is encountered most frequently in late autumn. The mushrooms are usually found as \\"shrumps\\"‚Äîlow, partially emerged mounds on the forest floor, and have often been partially consumed by mammals such as rodents or deer. Studies have demonstrated that geographically separated R. brevipes populations (globally and continentally) develop significant genetic differentiation, suggesting that gene flow between these populations is small. In contrast, there was little genetic differentiation observed between populations sampled from a smaller area (less than approximately 1000 meters). R. brevipes is one of several Russula species that associates with the myco- heterotrophic orchid Limodorum abortivum. Edibility Russula brevipes is a non-descript edible species that tends to assume the flavors of meats and sauces it is cooked with. It is one of several Russula species harvested in the wild from Mexico's Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in local markets in nearby Ozumba. The mushrooms are suitable for pickling due to their crisp texture. Fruit bodies are commonly parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming them into an edible known as a lobster mushroom. In this form, the surface of the fruit body develops into a hard, thin crust dotted with minute pimples, and the gills are reduced to blunt ridges. The flesh of the mushroom‚Äînormally brittle and crumbly‚Äîbecomes compacted and less breakable. =Bioactive compounds= Sesquiterpene lactones are a diverse group of biologically active compounds that are being investigated for their antiinflammatory and antitumor activities. Some of these compounds have been isolated and chemically characterized from Russula brevipes: russulactarorufin, lactarorufin-A, and 24-ethyl- cholesta-7,22E-diene-3Œ≤,5Œ±,6Œ≤-triol.

The project was charged with developing methods to use in the looming Vietnam War, and also provided information for use by Thailand in counterinsurgency action against Communist rebels. Coverage Project AGILE covered a wide range of topics related to warfare under various conditions present in the Far East, from electronic surveillance, used to interdict Communist convoys in the Ho Chi Minh trail, to sociological research on troops likely to be subverted by Communist rebels. It was broken down into a number of subprojects.Project AGILE Semiannual Report, p. iii =Subproject I, II, and VIII= Subprojects II and VIII were merged into Subproject I, and the resulting subproject covered weapons, individual equipment, and rations.

Conducted by the United States Army Biological Center which was based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, one test program was conducted in Thailand in 1964 and 1965 to determine the effectiveness of aerial applications of Purple, Orange, and other candidate chemical agents in defoliation of upland jungle vegetation representative of Southeast Asia. Data provided by these techniques were used in comparative evaluation of defoliant chemicals in relation to rate, volume, season of application, canopy penetration, and vegetation response. There have been recurring allegations that similar tests have been conducted in Okinawa. Japan Times and Okinawa Times published accounts from an unnamed official claiming that \\"Pentagon had tested defoliants in the island‚Äôs northern jungles near Kunigami and Higashi villages.\\" Other corroborating evidence is that in 1962, the U.S. Army counterinsurgency school in Vietnam moved to Okinawa. The USNS Schuyler Otis Bland (T-AK-277) was known to have brought highly classified \\"agriculture products\\" under armed guard to southeast Asia, Okinawa, and Panama. The ship‚Äôs logbook was found by Michelle Gatz and shows the ship was carrying classified cargo that was offloaded under armed guard at White Beach a U.S. Navy port on Okinawa‚Äôs east coast on April 25, 1962. After departing Okinawa in spring 1962, the Bland sailed to the Panama Canal Zone where, the Panamanian government asserts, the U.S. tested herbicides in the early 1960s. In June 2013, the US DoD rejected the allegations that Agent Orange being present on Okinawa, saying they had no factual basis.As evidence of Agent Orange in Okinawa stacks up, U.S. sticks with blanket denial For example, according to the DoD report, the S.O. Bland was loaded with Agent Pink and Agent Purple, which it off loaded to Vietnam on 16‚Äì18 January 1962 before it stopped at Okinawa on 31 January 1962 on its way back. The late author Sheldon H. Harris in his book Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932-1945, and the American cover up wrote that field tests for wheat rust and rice blast were conducted throughout 1961 in Okinawa and at \\"several sites in the midwest and south\\", although these were probably part of Project 112.

Ian Ritchie retired from RFR at the end of the 1980s to focus his work on architecture from his studio in London. Martin Francis also resumed working for RFR quite soon. Peter Rice ran the office until his death in 1992. After that date, the company had to reorganize, but continued working on all scale projects in France and abroad. These projects include: the Passerelle Simone de Beauvoir, several TGV stations, the Fondation Louis Vuitton or the renovation of the Eiffel tower 1st floor. RFR was placed in judicial liquidation in late 2015 due to financial problems largely stemming from its subsidiary RFR Gros Oeuvre + (RFR GO+). The French court awarded the company to Artelia, a large French engineering conglomerate that had made an offer among others to purchase RFR. Since 2015, RFR has started a new part of its history as \\"RFR Structure et Enveloppe\\" an independent branch of Artelia Group. Several RFR employees joined back the office, and the team reaches now about 25 engineers and architects . The office is still based on the same location in the center of Paris, an pursues working on high quality structures and fa√ßade projects, as for example: La Samaritaine Department Store renovation with SANNA Architects, The Paris Court Law Courts with Renzo Piano Building Workshop or the Saint-Denis Pleyel station with Kengo Kuma Architects. Recognition RFR has won international laurels and awards including French/European steel awards, RIBA Awards, INGENIEURBAUPREIS 2006 for the AWD stadium in Hanover, Acad√©mie de l'Architecture Silver Medal for Research and Technique.

Ethidium homodimer is a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye which binds to DNA. After a cell sample has been stained with ethidium homodimer, the dead cells may be viewed and counted under a UV-light microscope. When cells die, the plasma membranes of those cells becomes disrupted. Because of this, ethidium homodimer may enter those cells and bind to DNA within those cells. Because live cells don't have a compromised membrane, the ethidium homodimer can't enter. One reason for doing an ethidium homodimer assay instead of using a TUNEL assay to measure cell death is that ethidium homodimer stains all of the dead or dying cells, while TUNEL only stains cells that have undergone programmed cell death.

Ksplice supports only the patches that do not make significant semantic changes to kernel's data structures. Ksplice has been implemented for Linux on the IA-32 and x86-64 architectures. It was developed by Ksplice, Inc. until 21 July 2011, when Oracle acquired Ksplice and then offered support for Oracle Linux. Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux was dropped and turned into a free 30-day trial for RHEL customers as an incentive to migrate to Oracle Linux Premier Support. At the same time, use of the Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) became a requirement for using Ksplice on production systems. , Ksplice is available for free on desktop Linux installations, with official support available for Fedora and Ubuntu Linux distributions.  Design  A high-level overview of the hot patches generation, which is based on changes in the kernel's source code. Ksplice takes as input a unified diff and the original kernel source code, and it updates the running kernel in memory. Using Ksplice does not require any preparation before the system is originally booted, (the running kernel needs no special prior compiling, for example). In order to generate an update, Ksplice must determine what code within the kernel has been changed by the source code patch. Ksplice performs this analysis at the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) object code layer, rather than at the C source code layer. To apply a patch, Ksplice first freezes execution of a computer so it is the only program running. The system verifies that no processors were in the middle of executing functions that will be modified by the patch. Ksplice modifies the beginning of changed functions so that they instead point to new, updated versions of those functions, and modifies data and structures in memory that need to be changed. Finally, Ksplice resumes each processor running where it left off. To be fully automatic, Ksplice's design was originally limited to patches that did not introduce semantic changes to data structures, since most Linux kernel security patches do not make these kinds of changes. An evaluation against Linux kernel security patches from May 2005 to May 2008 found that Ksplice was able to apply fixes for all the 64 significant kernel vulnerabilities discovered in that interval. In 2009, major Linux vendors asked their customers to install a kernel update more than once per month. For patches that do introduce semantic changes to data structures, Ksplice requires a programmer to write a short amount of additional code to help apply the patch. This was necessary for about 12% of the updates in that time period. History The Ksplice software was created by four MIT students based on Jeff Arnold's master's thesis, and they later created Ksplice, Inc. Around May 2009, the company won the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition and the Cyber Security Challenge of Global Security Challenge. Whereas the Ksplice software was provided under an open source license, Ksplice, Inc. provided a service to make it easier to use the software. Ksplice, Inc. provided prebuilt and tested updates for the Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora Linux distributions. The virtualization technologies OpenVZ and Virtuozzo were also supported. Updates for Ubuntu Desktop and Fedora systems were provided free of charge, whereas other platforms were offered on a subscription basis. On 21 July 2011, Oracle Corporation announced that they acquired Ksplice, Inc. At the time the company was acquired, Ksplice, Inc. claimed to have over 700 companies using the service to protect over 100,000 servers. While the service had been available for multiple Linux distributions, it was stated at the time of acquisition that \\"Oracle believes it will be the only enterprise Linux provider that can offer zero downtime updates.\\" More explicitly, \\"Oracle does not plan to support the use of Ksplice technology with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\\" Existing legacy customers continue to be supported by Ksplice, but no new customers are being accepted for other platforms. , Ksplice is available for free on Fedora and Ubuntu. In January 2016, Ksplice was integrated into Oracle's Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 4 for Oracle Linux 6 and 7, which is Oracle's redistribution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

From 1997 until 2012, he ran the independent record label Intransitive Recordings. Early years Stelzer began making music using cassette tapes and metal percussion while he was a teenager, living in Boca Raton, Florida. After attempting unsuccessfully to learn how to play conventional instruments, he decided instead to use cassette tapes as the source of his music. Beginning in 1996, all of Stelzer's music would be made with manipulated cassette tapes. > I think tapes are simply the language that I speak. When I think about music > ideas, I only and always think of them in terms of how they‚Äôd be articulated > via cassette tapes. ‚Äì 2016 interview with Tabs Out Podcast Stelzer explained how he first became \\"fascinated with (cassette tapes) as sound-producing objects: \\"When I was in high school (1989‚Äì1992) and banging on trash cans in my parents' garage with a boom box recording in the corner, I discovered how the sound captured on the cassette was different from the acoustic sound in the room while I was making the music. From then on, I experimented with making collages on tape-copying decks, furiously pressing the pause button on the record side while changing the source tape on the other.\\" His first widely-available album, \\"Stone Blind\\", was a CD self- released on Stelzer's own Intransitive Recordings label in 1997. The album consisted of three related pieces, each roughly 20 minutes long and made out of crudely spliced cassette tapes assembled with a two-cassette stereo component. Each track was recorded in a single take to one side of a 40-minute tape; a piece ended when the tape ran out.  First performances and recordings  In 1998, Stelzer moved to Boston, Massachusetts. His performances over the next several years were mainly improvised, either solo or with duos or groups. His most frequent collaborator from 1999 until 2003 was Jason Talbot, who played a turntable in a manner similar to that in which Stelzer played cassette tapes. Stelzer credits these years as having a lasting impact on his thinking: \\"Everything I thought about music for a long time was based on playing with Jason Talbot. The way I played before I started playing with him was pretty ignorant. I just had a whole lot of tape decks and would put tapes in and hit play, and hope that it would sound all right. But Jason got me thinking more about physicality and improvisation, and I started to think of myself more as a player. That really fundamentally changed what I did with the tape decks, and how my sounds fit in the space, and how they worked compositionally and as live performance.\\" Critics noted the energy of the duo's live performances, but reception to their recordings was mixed: > For Stelzer and Talbot, on the other hand, pause is a weapon, and subversion > is the norm, not a change from it. The goal of Songs is disorientation; play > it while you're doing something else, and you might think the volume's too > low, until an eardrum-bursting noise comes out of nowhere. Listening to it > loud in headphones can almost be painful. ‚Äì Dusted Magazine review of Songs Stelzer himself seemed to agree. He steadily began moving away from live improvisation and venturing more into studio-based composition. \\"At first, my published works were simply unvarnished recordings of live improvisations using tape players, but I was never 100% happy with those. As I listened to them, I'd notice that I was mentally filling in the gaps of what should have been fuller sound, more stereo separation, clearer dynamic range, tighter construction... By the time I made the \\"Mincing Perfect Words\\" 3\\"CDR for Chondritic Sound, I felt like I finally produced music that worked as a home listening experience, and not a performance document. Thus emboldened, I diced up my failed earlier recordings and transformed them into ‚ÄúBond Inlets‚Äù, which I consider my first artistically successful proper album after numerous false starts.  Compositions  Bond Inlets was released by Intransitive Recordings as a CD in 2008, and was the first to receive generally favorable notice from critics. > It would be unforgivable to overlook 1998's Bond Inlets, Stelzer‚Äôs crowning > achievement; an album where he was able to pick the inherent limitations of > consumer-grade tapes apart, laying out a foreboding work of rare emotional > power. ‚Äì Tiny Mix Tapes Subsequent albums included Brayton Point, released in 2014 by Dokuro, which was built out of recordings of the Brayton Point Power Station, the largest coal-fired power generation plant in Massachusetts.

It provides a wide range of educational and administrative services to the 23 school districts and more than 423,000 students in Riverside County. The office has three components: the elected County Superintendent of Schools, who serves a four-year term of office; the seven elected members of the County Board of Education, who also serve four-year terms; and the body of employees in the organization, all of whom are employed by the County Superintendent. RCOE has served Riverside County for nearly 125 years. With well over 420,000 students, RCOE is California‚Äôs fourth-largest county office of education. The county's 23 districts vary in size from Desert Center, with just over a handful of students, to Corona-Norco, with more than 50,000. County offices serve three legally mandated functions: * Meeting the needs of students outside of their local school district educational programs and services * Working with local school districts to ensure they are providing students with the best educational programs and services possible, and remaining financially solvent in the process * As the Board of Education, primarily a policy and appellate role. Two other significant roles played by county offices are: * Recognizing student achievement and educator excellence * Providing county- wide educational events focusing on the success of all students RCOE's six service divisions, and the Office of the Superintendent, employ approximately 1,900 people. The divisions are: * Administration and Business Services * Educational Leadership Services * Personnel Services * Student Programs and Services * Educational Services * Children and Family Services Because the county is so extensive, both of RCOE's regional offices in Murrieta and Indio include employees from a number of these divisions.  History  On March 11, 1893, California Governor Henry Markham signed a bill that took from San Diego and San Bernardino counties‚Äîwhich were in disagreement over many issues‚Äîto form the new County of Riverside. San Timoteo Canyon Schoolhouse, built as an adobe building in 1856, was the first school in the territory that became Riverside County. The original schoolhouse accommodated 25‚Äì40 students from grades one to eight, and served the pioneer families as well as the temporary students of work crews on the Southern Pacific Railroad. Well-documented history of Riverside County schools begins with the establishment of the county and consequent appointment of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools Lyman Gregory on May 9, 1893. Gregory‚Äôs office was in the original courthouse at Eighth and Lime Streets in downtown Riverside. During the time of Edward Hyatt (1903), a new county courthouse on Main Street was built. At that time, the superintendency remained an elected position, but the office was part of county government until it gained fiscal independence in 1975. The Riverside County Office of Education has grown to nearly 2,000 employees working at offices in Riverside, Murrieta and Indio, with a budget of $257 million. The current superintendent of schools is Kenneth M. Young. At the time of his appointment, Riverside County schools had more than 400,000 students at 434 sites, under the jurisdiction of 23 local school districts, with more than 36,000 teachers and other school employees.

Its Arabic name is Mar Jaras. The cliff-hanging complex, which emerged from a lavra established in the 420s and reorganised as a monastery around AD 500, with its ancient chapel and irrigated gardens, is active and inhabited by Greek Orthodox monks. It is reached by a pedestrian bridge across Wadi Qelt, which many believe to be Psalm 23's \\"valley of the shadow of death\\". The valley parallels the old Roman road to Jericho, the backdrop for the parable of the Good Samaritan (). The monastery is open to pilgrims and visitors.Dave Winter, Israel handbook: with the Palestinian Authority areas, Page 271, 1999. \\"St George's Monastery Clinging to the side of the Wadi Qelt ravine, this monastery takes its name from St George of Koziba; a monk born in Cyprus c 550, but who spent much of his life at various lauras in the Judean Desert\\" Established during the Byzantine period, it was destroyed by the Persians in AD 614, rebuilt in the 12th century during the Crusader period, abandoned after their defeat, and rebuilt again by Greek monks starting at the end of the 19th century. The site is associated with the lives of Elijah and that of the parents of the Virgin Mary, and holds the relics of three Eastern Orthodox saints, making it a site of intense pilgrimage. Visiting Reachable from the Highway 1 between the Dead Sea and Jerusalem, by turning off to Mitzpe Yericho and following signs for the monastery. There is a 3-hour long hiking path through the wadi and other paths above and along the wadi, or alternatively a parking lot across the wadi from the monastery with an adjacent lookout point. From the parking lot, it's a fairly short hike, about 1km, but very steep going down to the monastery. It gets very hot at times, and hiking back up in the heat could be very challenging for some people. There are young men with donkeys who will give you a ride down to the monastery, or back up to the parking lot, for a negotiable fee. One can also hike up the wadi from Jericho, via the ruins of the Herodian winter palaces at Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq. The monastery is open daily except on Sundays and certain holidays, between 9 am and 1 pm. There is a strict dress code. No shorts for men; no trousers of any sort for women, women must wear a long skirt, and a modest top. History St. George Monastery seen from across Wadi Qelt Corridor in front of the main church, leading to the Chapel of SS. John and George =Byzantine period= Monastic life at the future site of St. George's Monastery began around 420 CE as a lavra,Pringle, 1993, p. 183 with a few monks who sought the desert experience of the prophets, and settled around a cave where they believed Elijah was fed by ravens (). Hermits living in caves in nearby cliffs would meet in the monastery for a weekly mass and communal meal. Between 480 and 520/530 the lavra was reorganised as a monastery by John of Thebes, also known as Saint John of Choziba, who had moved to Syria Palaestina from Egypt.Sharon, 2004, p. 71 In his time it was dedicated to the Mother of God. The monastery became an important spiritual centre in the sixth-seventh century under Saint George of Choziba (died c. 620).Saint George the Chozebite, Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and South East Asia, 8 January 2013. Accessed 15 December 2019 The monastery was eventually renamed after him. At this time the monastery contained the original small chapel dedicated to Saint Stephen and a church of the Virgin Mary. Destroyed in 614 by the Persians, the monastery was more or less abandoned after the Persians swept through the valley and massacred the fourteen monks who dwelt there. =Early Muslim period= In the late eighth- century writings the monastery starts being associated with the parents of St Mary, Saints Joachim and Anne. A monk from that period mentions a \\"House of Joachim\\". =Crusader period= After the 614 destruction by the Persians, the monastery was rebuilt during the Crusader period. Manuel I Komnenos made some restoration in 1179, and, according to an inscription, Frederick II made further restorations in 1234.Sharon, 2004, p. 75 After the Crusaders were defeated and pushed out of the region, the monastery was again abandoned.Monastery of St George, on See the Holy Land website. Accessed 2018-11-12. =Modern period= The monastery was reestablished in 1878, and has since then been in the care of following monks or abbots: * Father Kalinikos (1830-1909) * Father Amphilochios (1913-1986) * Father Antonios Iosiphidis (died 1993) * Father Germanos (Georgios Tsibouktzakis; died 2001) * Father Constantinos (current abbot, as of 2019). In 1878, a Greek monk, Kalinikos, settled here and restored the monastery, finishing it in 1901 with the assistance of the Jerusalem Patriarchate.Sharon, 2004, p. 77 St John (Iacob) the Romanian Romanian monk-priest, Father Ioan (John), born Ilie Iacob in 1913, left the Romanian skete on the River Jordan he had been the abbott of since 1947, and moved in 1952 to St George Monastery together with his attendant and disciple, Ioanichie P√¢r√¢ialƒÉ. Following summer the two retreated to the nearby Cave of St Anne, which Father John never left again. Affected by illness, he died after seven years, in 1960. In 1992 he was declared a saint by the Romanian Orthodox Patriarchate and in 2016 he was officially recognised as such by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.Patriarchate of Jerusalem, The Feast of St. John the New Chozevite, 10 August 2017, accessed 15 December 2019A Spiritual Joy for Romanians: The Patriarchate of Jerusalem Will Officially Recognize the Sainthood of Venerable John Jacob of Neam≈£, Basilica News Agency via OrthoChristian.com, 26 January 2016, accessed 15 December 2019 His name was added to the official name of the monastery. His relics are in the chapel of main monastery's church, next to the relics of Saints John of Thebes and George the Chozevite. He is known as Saint John (Iacob) the New, the Romanian, or of Neam»õ, the Chozevite. Father Germanos (Tsibouktzakis) Father Germanos came to St George's in 1993 and lived there until he was killed by Arab terrorists during the Second Intifada in 2001. For many years he was the sole occupant of the monastery, of which he was named abbot in 2000. Emulating the Wadi Qelt monks of late antiquity, Father Germanos offered hospitality to visitors, improved the stone path used by pilgrims to climb up to the monastery, repaired the aqueducts, and improved the gardens of shade and olive trees. Religious traditions and relics The traditions attached to the monastery include a visit by Elijah en route to the Sinai Peninsula, and St. Joachim, whose wife Anne was infertile, weeping here when an angel announced to him the news of Mary's conception. Relics of the three saints closely associated with Choziba - John of Thebes, George the Chozevite and John the Romanian - are kept in the monastery's main church. The bones and skulls of the martyred monks killed by the Persians in 614 are kept today in a chapel outside the monastery walls.

National Geographic was a copyright lawsuit regarding image use and republication rights of National Geographic Society to their magazine in electronic form. Details After the National Geographic released a digital archive containing every monthly issue of National Geographic magazine in 1997, photographer Jerry Greenberg took the Society to court over the reproduction of photographs that National Geographic had licensed from him. National Geographic withdrew this archive from the market in 2004 until after litigation was finished. The archive, called \\"The Complete National Geographic on CD-ROM and DVD\\", contained image duplicates of the print magazines. The plaintiffs argued that the archive was a \\"revision\\", and thus National Geographic did not hold the license to republish. National Geographic argued that the archive, which included an introductory sequence set to music and a search feature, was a new work. Rulings Two federal appellate courts ruled in the various cases. One case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled against National Geographic in 2001 (Greenberg v. National Geographic), prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in a similar case later that same year involving the same statute of the U.S. Copyright law (New York Times Co. v. Tasini). On March 4, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Greenberg was inconsistent with the Supreme Court ruling in Tasini, and ruled in favor of National Geographic in a case involving the same Complete National Geographic product (Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises). On June 13, 2007, the Eleventh Circuit reversed its prior decision in Greenberg I and remanded the case back to the U.S. district court, agreeing with the Second Circuit ruling in Faulkner that Greenberg I was inconsistent with the later Tasini decision (Greenberg II). On August 30, 2007, the Eleventh Circuit issued an order vacating the panel decision in Greenberg II and said the Court would hear the appeal en banc, or by all the judges on the Court, which was heard February 26, 2008. On June 30, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit held (Greenberg III) that National Geographic's reproduction of its magazine electronically was privileged under the federal copyright statute. Results Since National Geographic's victory in the Second Circuit, several publications (including The New Yorker, Playboy, Atlantic Monthly, Mad Magazine, and Rolling Stone) have either produced or announced plans to produce complete reproductions of their prior paper magazines on DVD or a restricted website for subscribers. As a result of this ruling National Geographic announced it is releasing the full 120-year version of its magazine at the end of October 2009.

Biography Borja was born in 1441 in X√†tiva, Kingdom of Valencia, from the Aragonese family of √áa BorjaThe BORGIA Family, Art and Legacy, by Antonio Castej√≥n, Spain 1998  http://www.euskalnet.net/laviana/gen_hispanas/borja_borgia.htm stablished in Valencia since 1239 by land granted by the Aragon crown, he became a canon in the cathedral chapter of Valencia. After the election of Rodrigo Borja as Alexander VI, Francisco went to Rome, becoming the protonotary apostolic, and then the treasurer general on September 20, 1493. He was elected bishop of Teano on August 19, 1495, and retained the see until June 5, 1508, when he resigned in favor of his nephew of the same name. There is no evidence he was ever consecrated. Alexander VI elevated Francisco as a cardinal priest on September 28, 1500, in pectore and published his cardinalate on October 2, adding the title of S. Cecilia on October 5.Miranda 1998 He later accumulated a variety of additional benefices: first as Abbot commendatario of the monasteries of S. Vincenzo, Volturno, and of S. Stefano di Sermo, then the diocese of Terracina on August 19, 1495, and then the metropolitan see of Cosenza on November 6, 1499. He was made papal legate to Campagna in 1501, and left Rome on June 22 to retake Rocca di Papa and other estates of the Colonna for the papacy. In 1502, he followed Lucrezia Borgia to Ferrara for her marriage to Alfonso d'Este, and became tutor to Alexander VI's youngest son, Gioffre Borgia. From January 1503 to 1504, Borja held the title of Camerlengo, and during that time, on March 10, he attempted to recover some debts owed to the College of Cardinals. He participated in the papal conclaves of September and October 1503, before gaining the title of Ss. Nereo ed Achilleo on August 11, 1506. Along with other cardinals, Borja plotted against Pope Julius II, and from Ferrara published in opposition to the pontiff. His signature is also affixed to the document dated March 16, 1511, which attempted to bring the pope to a council in Pisa; Borja delegated his authority in absentia to the five other cardinals who attended the council. As a result, Borja was deprived of his cardinalate and excommunicated by Julius II on October 24, 1511. The other councilars‚ÄîCardinals Federico di Sanseverino, Bernardino L√≥pez de Carvajal, Guillaume Bri√ßonnet, Ren√© de Prie, and Amanieu d'Albret (another cardinal-nephew of Alexander VI)‚Äîwere also excommunicated, but unlike Borja they lived long enough to be pardoned and have their cardinalates reinstated in 1513 by Pope Leo X. Before death, Borja was briefly protoprete from January 1511, dying on November 4, 1511, in Reggio Emilia (where he is buried) before having had the opportunity to learn of his excommunication. Popular Culture Francisco appears in the 2010 video game Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and is killed in August 1503 by the game's protagonist Ezio Auditore Da Firenze inside St. Peter's Basilica.

Biography Knox was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, on 28 November 1900, the son of Scottish Congregationalist minister James Knox and his wife Isabella Marshall. He was educated at Bury Grammar School and the Liverpool Institute, and then at Pembroke College, Oxford where he obtained a first- class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1923. He then worked as secretary to Lord Leverhulme at Lever Brothers before running the business interests of Lever Brothers in West Africa. His first wife died in 1930 and in the following year he became Bursar-Fellow and lecturer in philosophy at Jesus College, Oxford, later becoming a Fellow and Tutor. His interests did not fit in with those then prevailing at Oxford and so he moved to St Andrews University as Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1936, serving also as deputy principal and head of department. He was thus the natural choice as acting principal in 1952 on the death of James Irvine, and was confirmed in position in 1953. Knox was widely known to philosophers for his translations and commentary of the works of Hegel and for editing the works of R.G. Collingwood. His scholarship was recognised with the award of an Hon. D. Litt. from the University of Glasgow. In 1955 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were David Jack, Edward Thomas Copson, David R. Dow and William Marshall Smart. He served as the Society's Vice President 1975 to 1978. Whilst Principal of St Andrews, his main task was to reconcile the interests of the section of the university based in St Andrews with those of the section based in Dundee, Queen's College. However, he later concluded that separation of the two could not be avoided and then decided that it would not be proper to continue in his position as his stated policy had changed. In 1967 Queen's College separated from St Andrews to become the University of Dundee. In retirement, he continued to write books, articles and reviews, including translations with commentary upon the writings of Hegel. Sir Malcolm was critical of the creation of new universities in Scotland in the 1960s, arguing that universities should have medieval roots and have faculties including divinity. While he reserved judgement on the proposed University of Dundee and University of Stirling, he was critical of the transforming of technical colleges into the University of Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt University. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1961. Some of his papers are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee. He died at 19 Victoria Terrace, Crieff, Perthshire, on 6 April 1980.

It was written by series creator and executive producer Tina Fey, and was directed by Don Scardino. It first aired on April 26, 2007 in the United States. Guest stars in the episode included Katrina Bowden, Kevin Brown, Owen Burke, Grizz Chapman, Matt Dickinson, Rachel Dratch, Brittany Felton, Hannah Flynn, Sean Hayes, Emily Mortimer, Chris Parnell, Portia, Lonny Ross, Justin Smith, Elaine Stritch, Jason Sudeikis and Nikki E. Walker. Lester Holt appeared as himself in this episode. The episode focuses on the imminent season finale of TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series which airs live on Friday nights. Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) is frantic because Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is still missing and Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) health threatens his marriage to Phoebe (Emily Mortimer). Plot After going on the run from the Black Crusaders, Tracy has traveled to Needmore, Pennsylvania (an actual town located in Belfast Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania) to stay with Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) cousin, Jesse Parcell (Sean Hayes). Liz is stressed as the season finale of TGS with Tracy Jordan is nearing, and Tracy cannot be found. Liz and Jack force Tracy's whereabouts from Kenneth, who they send to bring him back. Tracy realizes that he wants to go back to the city, but Jesse kidnaps him. Kenneth, accompanied by Dot-Com and Grizz, manages to rescue Tracy and get him back in time for the show's finale. Jack is livid when his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch), visits him when she is in town to attend his ex-wife Bianca's (Isabella Rossellini) wedding to Vincent Folley. Colleen takes an immediate dislike to Jack's fianc√©e, Phoebe, but takes a liking to Liz, whom she originally mistakes for Phoebe. The stress of his approaching wedding and the arrival of his mother prompt Jack to have a heart attack. While at the hospital, Colleen uses a heart monitor as a lie detector, on Jack, which leads him to revealing that he does not love Phoebe. They break off their engagement. Liz and Floyd (Jason Sudeikis) are struggling to maintain a long distance relationship, since Floyd's move to Cleveland. Liz later reveals to Jack that she and Floyd have separated. Production Rachel Dratch, longtime comedy partner and fellow Saturday Night Live alumna of Fey, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch played the role in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement. Executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that while Dratch would not be playing a series regular, she would appear in various episodes in a different role. In this episode, Dratch played Dr. Beauvoir, Liz's doctor. Jason Sudeikis, who played Floyd in this episode, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live, a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Tina Fey was the head writer on Saturday Night Live from 1999 until 2006. Various other cast members of Saturday Night Live have appeared on 30 Rock. These cast members include Rachel Dratch, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Chris Parnell and Molly Shannon. Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of Saturday Night Live. Alec Baldwin has also hosted Saturday Night Live thirteen times, the second highest number of episodes of any host of the series. The scenes set in Needmore, Pennsylvania were actually filmed in Douglaston, Queens. Similarly, the scenes in Cleveland from the previous episode were filmed in Battery Park City, Manhattan. The character Jesse Parcell taking in Tracy Jordan during his hard times, mirrors the Stephen King novel made movie, Misery (novel), in which an over-obsessed fan of an author takes in the author but ends up forcing them to stay with them, under the guise of \\"Being their biggest fan\\". Reception \\"Hiatus\\" brought in an average of 4.7 million viewers. The episode also achieved a 2.4/6 in the key 18‚Äì49-year-old demographic. The 2.4 refers to 2.4% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old in the U.S., and the 6 refers to 6% of all people of ages 18‚Äì49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast in the U.S. This episode was watched by 200,000 people upon its original broadcast in the United Kingdom. Robert Canning of IGN said that this episode left him feeling \\"a bit cheated.\\" He said that this was because \\"the storylines we've loved for weeks all failed to come to a satisfying end.\\" He added that \\"after a string of stellar episodes, it's not surprising 30 Rock eventually faltered.\\" Canning rated this episode with a \\"6.5 out of 10.\\" Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that he \\"didn't find this episode quite as manic as the previous few, but that's probably because it had actual story to progress and threads to tie up.\\" Elaine Stritch's appearance in this episode earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Stritch would later appear as Colleen in the episodes \\"Ludachristmas,\\" which was part of season two; \\"Christmas Special\\" and \\"The Natural Order\\" in season three; \\"The Moms\\" in season four; \\"Christmas Attack Zone\\" in season five; \\"Meet the Woggels!\\" in season six; and \\"My Whole Life Is Thunder\\" in the show's seventh and final season.

Species within this genus are widely distributed across Australia and to the north at Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.  Taxonomy  The genus was erected by Ellis Troughton in his 1943 volume on Australian mammals, having previously identified new taxa of \\"broad-nosed bats\\". The type species is Scoteinus orion, published by Troughton in 1937. The taxa have been allied to the genus Nycticeius, as given in Troughton's earlier descriptions, but recognised as a genus in other author's arrangements. Scotorepens has been allied to the Vespertilionini tribe of the subfamily Vespertilioninae, or grouped with Nycticeiini in earlier revisions. The authority Mammal Species of the World (2003), recognised the species and subspecies of the genus, which may be summarised as * Scotorepens :* Scotorepens balstoni the western or inland broad-nosed bat ::* Scotorepens bastoni bastoni ::* Scotorepens bastoni influatus :* Scotorepens greyii little broad-nosed :* Scotorepens orion eastern species :* Scotorepens sanborni northern species The systematics of the genus are suggested to be poorly resolved.

Built in 1856, it is an excellent example of a 19th-century Greek Revival town hall. The building originally housed town offices as well as hosting town meetings; it is now used primarily for the latter function. The hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history Lakeville's Old Town Hall is located in its main village, at the northwest corner of Precinct and Bedford Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its corners have paneled pilasters, which rise to an entablature that runs along the building sides, and to short gable returns on the front facade. The front is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances, each framed by pilasters and corniced entablatures. The second-floor windows are set directly above the entrances, and are topped by projecting caps. An original noticeboard is mounted on the wall between the two entrances. The interior of the ground floor is a single large chamber, with stairs leading up to the second floor. The second floor houses an enclosed area that historically housed town offices. The principal alteration to the interior is the installation of a dropped ceiling in the meeting hall. The building was erected in 1856, and was the town's principal civic building for nearly a century. In addition to hosting town meetings, it has also at times housed the local library, and the offices of the town selectmen. The non-meeting elements of town government were moved to new facilities in 1952. This building continues to serve as a community meeting space. The CURRENT, active Town Hall is located at 346 Bedford Street, Lakeville, MA 02347. This is a long BRICK building, which included the Fire Department.

Built in 1819, its tower is a well-preserved example of an early 19th-century masonry lighthouse. The tower and the island on which it stands were added to the National Register of Historic Places as Bird Island Light on September 28, 1987. Description and history Sippican Harbor is a deep inlet off Buzzards Bay on the south coast of Massachusetts, which is bracketed by Charles Neck Point on the west and Butler Point on the east, both part of the town of Marion. About south of Butler Point lies Bird Island, a point of land that mostly serves as a bird nesting site. The Bird Island lighthouse stands near the island's center. It is a circular masonry structure about , with its light at above sea level. The tower is topped by a cast iron lantern house, with an outside railing and conical roof with ventilator. The tower was built when the light was first established in 1819, and was accompanied by an attached stone keeper's dwelling. Three months after it was first lit, with William Moore as the keeper, it was badly damaged by a storm. It was again severely damaged on September 8, 1869 and, again, repaired. It was deactivated by the USCG in 1933. All of the buildings except the tower were destroyed in the New England Hurricane of 1938. In 1940 the island passed into private hands and was acquired by the Town of Marion in 1966. The light was briefly lit in 1976 after undergoing restoration by the local historical society. The Bird Island Preservation Society was formed in 1994 and on July 4, 1997, the light was relit as a private aid to navigation. The island, but not the tower, is open to visitors except during the May through August nesting season of the endangered roseate tern.

It is most notable for its association with the politician and statesman Daniel Webster, who owned a large (more than ) property in Marshfield, and is buried here along with other members of his family. The core of the estate was a farmstead Webster purchased from Nathaniel Thomas in 1832. Webster was known for his interest in agricultural science, and he made his farm one of the most productive in the area. Webster's house burned down in 1878, but a new house was built on its foundations. The property includes a number of landscape features designed by Webster, as well as the site where his small law office building stood during his lifetime. (The building, now a National Historic Landmark, was moved in 1966 to the property of the Isaac Winslow House, also a museum property.) A summer camp was run on the site, with the main house serving as its administrative office, from the 1950s until its closing in the summer of 1998. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. It is currently owned by the town of Marshfield and is open for tours during the summer.

As of 2008, muggings occur more often than previously, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and occasionally violence is associated with them. Crime associated with drugs and drug-use is also on the rise. Due to lack of lighting in many public areas and periodic blackouts, the U.S. government has advised travelers to carry small flashlights, travel with others, keep vehicle doors and windows locked, avoid dark and isolated places, and be especially vigilant in the evenings. Violent crime is also increasing in Cape Verde as of 2008. There were several murders and attempted murders between May 2007 and May 2008, mostly reported in the urban centers of Praia and Mindelo, although Sal and other islands have not been immune.

The lighthouse was built in 1838 at a cost of approximately $5,000, and named after Ned Dexter, a local farmer. Under the supervision of a local builder, Leonard Hammond, the lighthouse was constructed with a birdcage-style lantern similar to Bird Island Light found in Marion, Massachusetts. The stone used for the lighthouse was all locally sourced, with most of it originating from nearby beaches. Insider, there are 32 granite steps that are cantilevered to the outside wall without the use of mortar. The original lantern used 11 whale oil lamps, each with its own parabolic reflector. The lamps and reflectors were replaced by a fifth order Fresnel lens in 1857, along with a change to an octagonal lantern. The Great Blizzard of 1888 significantly damaged the keeper's stone house, resulting in it being demolished and the building of a wooden replacement. Following the lighthouse's automation in 1923, the keeper's house became unnecessary. The original stone keeper's house was loaded on a barge and taken to Wing's Neck Light in Bourne, Massachusetts. The lighthouse was deactivated from 1952, but remained under control of the US Coast Guard. Following modernization in 1961, the lighthouse was reactivated in 1961 with its current 6-second isophase. The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and approved in 1988.

With its oldest portion dating to 1834, it was the last surviving 19th-century mill building in Norwell prior to its destruction by fire in 1983. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. For most of its history it was used in the manufacture of horse tack equipment. Description and history The Tack Factory was set on the west side of Tiffany Road, just south of Tiffany Pond. At the southern end of the pond stands a dam, probably built in the early 20th century, which replaced an older 18th-century dam probably built for the grist mill that first stood at the site. The main building, which stood across Third Herring Brook, was a single-story post-and-beam structure with a broad gable roof. Its exterior had been covered with several layers of wood shingling, and a tall brick chimney rose from the north slope of the roof. Underneath the building was a granite sluiceway, in which the old waterwheel and related equipment could be found. The main building was enlarged by three relatively small frame additions. The factory was built in 1834 by Zephaniah Talbot and Samuel Salmond, who had acquired the water rights of the 18th-century mill that previously stood on the site. The Salmond family operated the factory, producing horse tack for many years, until the mid-20th century. The last occupant of the property was a printing company.

Diagram of the principle of a DEMO transaction between two actors, with the result in between. In DEMO the basic pattern of a business transaction is composed of the following three phases:Kecheng Liu (2001). Information, Organisation, and Technology: Studies in Organisational Semiotics. pp.198-2002. * An actagenic phase during which a client requests a fact form the supplier agent. * The action execution which will generate the required fact * A factagenic phase, which leads the client to accept the results reported Basic transactions can be composed to account for complex transactions. The DEMO methodology gives the analyst an understanding of the business processes of the organization, as well as the agents involved, but is less clear about pragmatics aspects of the transaction, such as the conversation structure and the intentions generated in each agents mind. Jan Dietz is the founder of the DEMO, and he is also co-founder and chairman of the DEMO Knowledge Center DEMO Institute. and he has participated in numerous practical DEMO-projects regarding the redesign and reengineering of organizations. Since early 2004 he is also the leader of the national research program Extensible Architecture Framework.Extensible Architecture Framework Dutch national research program. = Enterprise Ontology = Enterprise Ontology is about the need to develop organizational models on a high-level of abstraction, in order to be able to develop effective and efficient, so called, inter- and intra-enterprise information systems. These models need to be so that it is understood both by business people, who are defining their functionality, and software engineers, who are constructing and implementing the software systems that realize the system's functionality. The idea of business components for modeling information systems is very valuable since they directly reflect the business rules and the constraints that apply to the enterprise domain.Jan Dietz (2007). Enterprise Ontology and the Identification of Business Components Keynote Lectures at the ICSOFT 2007. Retrieved 24 Junly 2008. The identification of business components seems still to be in its infancy. The notion of enterprise ontology, as developed by Jan Dietz at Delft University of Technology, appears to be a powerful revelation of the essence of an enterprise or an enterprise network. Dietz' research seeks to improve the identification of business components based on the ontological model of an enterprise, while at the same time satisfying well defined quality criteria. The results of applying the developed identification method are reusable and self-contained business components with well defined interaction points that facilitate the accessing and execution of coherent packages of business functionality.

The Greek Revival structure was built in 1808 by Colonel Peter Pierce, one of the town's leading businessmen of the mid 19th century. It is presently unoccupied. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The former Peter Pierce Store occupies a prominent location the center of Middleborough, at the northeast corner of North Main and Jackson Streets. It is a T-shaped wood frame structure, with a two-story central section forming the leg of the T, and single-story flanking sections on either side. The central section is fronted by a monumental four-column Greek Revival portico, the columns supporting an entablature and fully pedimented gable with a semi- oval window at the center. The side wings have gable roofs perpendicular to that of the central block, and are each five bays wide with a center entrance framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. Peter Pierce (or Peirce, 1788-1861) was for many years one of Middleborough's most prominent businessmen. In addition to a retail store, he operated a cotton mill, a shovel factory, and served as a money lender. He was active in civic affairs, serving for two years in the state legislature. This building was erected in stages between 1825 and 1830 to house all of his diverse retail affairs. The business was operated by his sons until 1901, and then sold out of the family. In 1935 it was purchased by the town and adapted for use as its police headquarters, a function it served until 2018. It is one of the town's most architecturally significant 19th-century buildings.

The National Park Service, US Forest Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management employ teens each summer to participate in the YCC. The YCC has introduced young Americans to conservation opportunities in public lands since the program was created in 1970. In the late seventies and early eighties the program included a grant-in-aid component that funded state and local YCC projects nationwide. This element fell to 1982 budget cuts, but several states continued the effort with their own funds. Some employees currently working in land management agencies were introduced to their profession through the YCC. Youth Conservation Corps members work in public lands restoring, rehabilitating, and repairing the natural, cultural, and historical resources protected as federally preserved places. Some examples of work completed each season by Youth Conservation Corps are: * Historic Structure Preservation * Exotic Plant Removal * Fence Construction * Boundary Marking Signage * Boardwalk Repair * Wildlife Research Assistance * Anthropologic Research Assistance * Bridge Construction * Trail Construction * Campsite/Campground Restoration * Environmental Education Planning/Teaching * Habitat Preservation * IT Work * Visitor Use Assistance * Energy Retrofitting Participants are paid the established federal minimum wage. Participants in states with a minimum wage higher than the federal are paid at the higher rate. Youth Conservation Corps programs are conducted for 4‚Äì10 weeks during the summer. Participants must be between 15‚Äì18 years old at the start of the program, though the age limits can vary locally. Most YCC programs are non-residential; however the National Park Service does have one residential program at Yellowstone National Park. Select Forest Service units offer residential programs as well. The Youth Conservation Corps focuses on conservation and community. These are some of the aspects they focus on: * How the work projects benefits the site or the overall environment. * Appreciating and understanding the nation‚Äôs environmental and historic heritage. * Gaining an understanding and appreciation of Ecosystems and Community.

In February 1949, a letter in the Eastern Daily Press suggested the formation of a trust to preserve a wherry. The fifty-year-old wherry Albion was then owned by Colman's Mustard factory and was moored at the company's works at Carrow Bridge in Norwich. In October 1949, after restoration work, Albion sailed regularly from Great Yarmouth to Norwich, carrying timber or grain, and sugar beet from Surlingham to Cantley.

Cedar Swamp is an area of more than of wetlands that include the headwaters area of the Sudbury River. Archeological surveys of the environmentally sensitive and critical area have identified many Native American sites of interest. It is believed that Native Americans prized wood from the cedar trees that grew in the area. The archeological district, which encompasses much of the Cedar Swamp area, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description The Cedar Swamp Archeological District is located east of the center of Westborough, encompassing a large swampy area, bounded on the east and west by roadways, and the north and south by lines drawn across the terrain at a mean altitude of above sea level. Parts of this area are traversed by highways (including Interstates 90 and 495), as well as secondary roads. One archaeological site of note is located on an island in the swamp, which was discovered in 1974 and excavated in 1984-86. Features of this site include a large refuse midden and a hearth, the latter of which has been radiocarbon dated to about 200 BCE. Neville and Stark projectile points were also found at this site. A second site of interest is based around a stone outcrop on the northern edge of the swamp. This site has extensive evidence of stone tool making, using materials gathered from the outcrop. The swamp was first examined by amateur archaeologists in 1939, with the first substantive collections of artifacts gathered in the 1960s. Local and state efforts to investigate sites of interest in the swamp gained traction in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in the area's National Register designation in 1988. Finds at sites in the swamp range in age from the Archaic Period to the Late Woodland.

When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was centered on the triangular junction of Main Street, North Main Street, and School Street, extending away from this area along Main Street, North Main Street, and Foster Hill Road. A few of its properties lie on side streets adjacent to these roads. This area represented the core of Brookfield, before it was broken into smaller communities, including West Brookfield. It has a fine collection of 18th and 19th century homes, ranging stylistically from Federal to Queen Anne, as well as the town hall and public library. The district was enlarged in 2006 to include a residential and industrial area south of the center, primarily along Milk, Front, and Ware Streets. This area was developed largely after the arrival of the railroad in 1839. It is composed mainly of residential structures dating from that time to the early 20th century, although it does include a cluster of fairly nondescript 19th century railroad-related buildings, as well as two passenger depots: an Gothic Revival structure built between 1839 and 1847, and a Richardsonian Romanesque passenger station built in 1884 to a design by Springfield architect E.

It consists of a cluster of three buildings: Bigelow Tavern, the White/Gibbs Store, and Temple's Distillery. The buildings have a history of common ownership, and the area was locally important from the late 18th century into the late 19th century. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Bigelow Tavern and its associated properties are located in the village center of West Boylston, north of the town common on either side of Worcester Street (Massachusetts Routes 12 and 140). On the east side of the road stands the tavern, a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboard siding. The building is oriented facing south, toward the cemetery, and has a single-story ell extending to the east, joining it to a 1-1/2 story shed. Across the street from the tavern stands a former distillery associated with the tavern; it appears as a three-bay 1-1/2 story Cape facing east. Although it has been converted to residential use, it retains a number of interior feature that appear to be distinctive to its original use as a distillery. North of the distillery stands the tavern store, a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a five-bay front facade and central entry. Its interior is arranged with a large room in the front, and smaller rooms in the rear flanking a central staircase. The town of West Boylston was settled in the 18th century, and was incorporated in 1808 out of parts of neighboring towns. Its town common was laid out in 1795, when its first church was built, and it is around those that its village center grew. The Bigelow properties were built between about 1790 and 1810, and effectively functioned as the town's first commercial center. Ezra Bigelow was the first operator of the tavern, and members of his family and its descendants would operate it until 1833. The distillery, also an early operation, probably fell victim to the growing temperance movement. All of the businesses depended to some degree on the sale of alcohol, and were likely harmed by a decision to relocate the church further south after it burned down in 1832.

The Attack of Love, Matth√§us Seutter, 1730 Biography Seutter started his career as an apprentice brewer. Apparently uninspired by the beer business, Seutter left his apprenticeship and moved to Nuremberg where he apprenticed as an engraver under the tutelage of the prominent J. B. Homann. Sometime in the early 18th century Seutter left Homann to establish his own independent cartographic publishing firm in Augsburg. Though he struggled in the early years of his independence, Seutter‚Äôs engraving skill and commitment to diversified map production eventually gained him a substantial following. Most of Seutter‚Äôs maps were heavily based upon, if not copies of, earlier work done by the Homann and Delisle firms. By 1732 Seutter was one of the most prolific publishers of his time and was honored by the German Emperor Charles VI with the title of ‚ÄúImperial Geographer‚Äù. Seutter continued to publish until his death, at the height of his career, in 1757. The Seutter firm continued under Seutter‚Äôs wastrel son Albrecht Carl until his death in 1762. Following Albrecht‚Äôs death, the firm was divided between the established Probst firm and the emerging firm of Tobias Conrad Lotter.

The library is housed in one of Hubbardston's most architecturally significant buildings, an 1874 Second Empire/Italianate brick building that also houses the town offices. Construction of the building, and a significant portion of the library's early collection, were made possible through grants and gifts from Hubbardston native Jonas G. Clark, founder of Worcester's Clark University. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.  Architecture and building history  The library is located in the village center of Hubbardston, on the west side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 68), north of its junction with Brigham and Elm Streets. It is the most distinctive and architecturally elaborate building in the village, two stories in height, built out of red brick, with granite and white wooden trim, and a slate roof. The center bay of the front facade projects, and is capped by a steeply pitched multicolor slate roof; this was originally crowned with iron cresting, which has been removed. Ground-floor windows are set in rounded openings with stepped granite headers, while second-floor windows are set in segmented-arch openings with bracketed lintels. The central bay has the main entrance recessed in a round-arch opening, with paired round-arch openings on the second level. A gable projects below the main tower roof, above a stone panel in which the name of the building's donor and year of construction are carved. Prior to the construction of this building, the town of Hubbardston had no buildings in public ownership; its town meetings were held in the local church. It was the town's only public building until the 1980s, when the police station was built. It was designed by Worcester architect Elbridge Boyden for the donor, Jonas G. Clark, and was built on what had been three house lots, acquired by Clark for the purpose. Clark was probably responsible for bringing in the materials, and the craftsmen that constructed the building, from outside the community, whose other masonry buildings of the period were much simpler. Since its construction, the building has housed the town's library, town offices, and a community meeting space.

The cut is deep, long, and wide; it is the second-deepest cut built by hand in the Western Hemisphere and the oldest functional cut which has not been improved upon. Work on the cut began in 1907 and concluded in 1908; the project was completed primarily with hand tools. The Mindoro Cut was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History Mindoro farmers and La Crosse County officials commissioned the Mindoro Cut as part of the Good Roads Movement, linking a creamery in Mindoro with a railroad station in West Salem. Before the cut was made, Phillips Ridge was too steep to be traversed, so traffic to Mindoro had to take a longer route bypassing the ridge. Construction on the cut began in 1907 and was primarily conducted with hand tools, though dynamite was also used. Planners initially thought the ridge was composed entirely of sandstone; construction became more difficult when it was realized that the ridge had an interior made of hard dolomite. Since horses could not be effectively used on the steep slope, waste rock was removed from the site via wheelbarrows which were balanced on narrow, uneven planks. Louis Miller, a contractor and supervisor of the project, would fire workers who toppled their wheelbarrow three times; many workers reportedly left the job after bringing their first load down the ridge. Workers were paid $1.25 per day and purchased meals from an on-site cook shanty. The project was completed in 1908; its ultimate cost was $11,241.29, reportedly a loss to its contractors. The highway was paved through the cut and guardrails were put in place in 1920; the cut has not been changed since. The cut was added to the Wisconsin State Register of Historic Places in October 2006 and the National Register of Historic Places on May 15, 2007.

It is a rare example of a hybrid pony truss that is similar to the 19th century truss design of Simeon S. Post. It was built by J. H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia in 1870. It was the first iron bridge to be constructed in the town. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The bridge formerly carried Bolton Road, but was closed to vehicular traffic in 1975 and bypassed by a modern highway bridge in the 1980s. Atherton Bridge in 2009 The bridge remained open to pedestrian traffic until April 2020, when a flash flood damaged the bridge's wooden deck and it was closed to all traffic. The long-term future of the bridge is uncertain. The sign commemorating Atherton Bridge states: Technical information The Atherton Bridge has iron compression posts that incline inward towards the center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented Phoenix columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck. The bridge is long and feet wide, and is composed of eight panels. It rests on granite abutments. The bridge was photographed in 1979 by Jet Lowe of the Historic American Engineering Record, and documented in 1990 as part of the Massachusetts Historic Bridge Project. At that time, it was one of only two known examples of the Post type of truss still surviving.

It was the country's first state reform school for girls, opening on August 26, 1856. The facility provided its charges with separate rooms, arranged in three-story cottages with kitchen, dining, and other public facilities on the ground floor, rooms for the girls and a housemother on the second, and space for teachers on the third floor. This school paved the way of social reform, moving away from child imprisonment towards a correctional paradigm. This was in part achieved because of the observed benefits of environmental change in children, as well as the importance of education plus the added pressures of having to deal with the rise in child delinquency brought by social changes of the industrial age. After its closure in 1975, it was redeveloped into Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Lancaster. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Campus The Lancaster School's campus is located southeast of the town center, on of landscaped terrain between Old Common Road (to the south) and Still River Road (Massachusetts Route 110) to the north. The campus includes eighteen historic buildings, dating from the late 18th to early 20th centuries. Many of its purpose-built buildings from this period are of brick construction, and most of those date to the period of the school's founding in the 1850s. There are three wood-frame buildings on the campus from the 18th century, all farmhouses which were standing when the state acquired the land. These buildings were used by the school for staff housing and offices. A number of the buildings are residential \\"cottages\\", which had common spaces on the ground floor, and sleeping arrangements for both students and staff. The common spaces included a dining room, kitchen, sewing room, laundry, parlor, and classroom.

Description and history The Anthony Lane House is located northeast of the town center of Lancaster, at the northeast corner of Seven Bridge Road and Harvard Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame house, five bays wide and two deep, with a front-facing gable roof, end brick walls, clapboard siding on the front, and interior chimneys on each side. The front gable is fully pedimented, with a modillioned cornice and two small sash windows in the center. Windows are set in rectangular openings with operable shutters, and are arranged symmetrically around the main entrance on the front facade. The front entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-round transom window. The interior retains many original finishes, most notable finely carved wainscoting in the main parlor. The house was built in 1809 by Pliny Newhall, a local bricklayer who purchased the land from his employer, whose yard was across the street. He sold the house in 1818 to Captain Anthony Lane, a local farmer who served for several separate terms as town selectman. Architecturally, the house is a harmonious blend of Greek Revival and Federal styles, unusual for the front-facing gable, an uncommon feature in Federal period houses.

The district includes a collection of houses, most dating to the first half of the 19th century or earlier. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The town of Lancaster, one of the oldest in northern Worcester County, was founded in 1643. The area that became North Village was first settled in 1717 by John Bennett, whose house built that year still stands near the center of the district. Around 1800, it experienced a period of growth, in which more houses and several businesses, including a tannery, machine shop, and inn were established. These small industries eventually declined, leaving the village as a cluster of mainly 18th and 19th-century residences. The historic district is anchored at the eastern end by a triangular green formed by Main Street (Massachusetts Route 117) and Otis Street, and peters out in the west near Main Street's crossing of the Nashua River. Of the 22 buildings in the district, only three were built after the 19th century. All are of wood-frame construction, and either 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height, with sash windows and clapboarded exteriors. Two houses were built in the 19th century; that of John Bennett is a large building that also served historically as a tavern. Most of the other buildings in the district were built before 1860, and are in conservative vernacular interpretations of Federal and Greek Revival styles popular at the time.

The bridge in 2012 The bridge was built in 1871 for town by the Watson Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey. It was built at a location where wooden bridges had stood since the 17th century, on the major road leading north from Lancaster. The route was bypassed by the present alignment of Route 70 in 1965.

Since 1946, the estate has been owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which operated Atlantic Union College there until its 2018 closure. The main house is presently home to Thayer Conservatory, bringing community together through music and the arts. Description and history The Thayer Estate is located at the northern end of the former Atlantic Union College campus, roughly midway between the villages of South Lancaster and Lancaster on the west side of Massachusetts Route 70. It is a large wood frame structure, with a central three-story block flanked by two-story wings that project forward of the main block's facade. The central block is five bays wide, and is covered by a truncated hip roof with modillioned cornice. The central three blocks project slightly, and are topped by a pedimented gable. The main entrance is at the center, sheltered by a flat-roof portico with paired Doric columns. The interior is richly decorated with marble and wood, and features a large drawing room (now a performance space) in one of the wings. A house was built on the site in 1798 when Reverend Nathaniel Thayer (1769-1840) constructed his parsonage in South Lancaster. Thayer was the town's Congregationalist minister for 47 years. His son Nathaniel, who had made a fortune in business, took down the original home and developed the estate in 1846, building the core of the present house. It was enlarged and remodeled in 1902 by the architect and interior designer Ogden Codman Jr. to 42 rooms for Nathaniel Thayer III. After being sold out of the Thayer family and having its furnishings sold at auction, the house was sold to Atlantic Union College in 1943 at a cost of $12,500. It was used as the school's administration building between 1945 and 1951, and then as a dormitory until about 1970.

Description and history The village of Rockdale is one of the principal villages and former industrial centers in the central Massachusetts town of Northbridge. Its industrial history begins in 1814, but it did not become a successful industrial center until the 1860s, when the mill privilege was acquired by the Whitin family, a leading operator of textile mills in the Blackstone River valley. The Whitins attracted a reliable workforce by building housing, schools, and other community buildings for their workers. In the late 19th century an influx of French Canadians drawn to work at the mill in Rockdale prompted the company to build additional housing east of Taft Street. The historic district includes seven residential structures built by the Paul Whitin Company between about 1880 and 1920. They are located in a single square block, bounded by Mcbride, Plantation, and Taft Streets, and Church Avenue. Two long six-unit rowhouses stand on the east side of Taft Street, larger in form than earlier tenement houses built to the west; these were built about 1915. Facing McBride and Taft Streets are four triple decker apartment blocks, housing six or twelve units. Built c. 1917, these have notable Colonial Revival styling in their front porches and polygonal window bays. Lastly, one six-unit building with Italianate styling also faces Taft Street.

The bridge was built to replace an older wooden span at the request of Edwin Bartlett, the owner of textile mills in North Oxford, whose businesses and employees would have used the road. Bartlett had originally requested that the town build an iron truss bridge, but it opted instead for one made of stone, which was completed by Worcester-based stonemasons in six months at a cost of $2200.

Built in 1887, it is a well-preserved local example of late Victorian commercial brick architecture, and has played a prominent role in the business economy of the Webster downtown's west end. The block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The town of Webster's downtown area extends along Massachusetts Route 12, roughly from the French River and the railroad tracks running north- south just to its east, eastward toward Lake Street. The Shumway Block is located on the south side of the Street, just east of the railroad tracks. This area was not originally the center of Webster's economic activity, but became an important area when the railroad was built through the area. A wood- frame commercial building stood here for many years, and was a fixture of economic activity related to the railroad. It burned down in 1886, and the present Shumway Block was built on the site by Oscar Shumway, who had purchased the building in 1872. The block is a three-story brick structure, nine bays wide, with a flat roof. Its facade is divided into three sections, articulated by stone piers on the first floor and brick pilasters on the upper levels. Each section has a commercial storefront on the first floor, with glass display windows and recessed entrances. Windows on the upper floors are grouped in threes, with stone lintels and sills. Decorative brick panelwork is found between the second and third floors, and there are half-round terra cotta panels above the three windows in the center section third floor. A band of corbelled brickwork runs below the roofline, and the central section has a parapet flanked by square posts with urns at the ends.

Merrie Melodies cartoon animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on November 12, 1960 and features Elmer Fudd. Elmer is voiced by Hal Smith, as Arthur Q. Bryan had died the previous year. The main plot revolves around Elmer doing a favor to his boss by watching his dog, Rupert, during an out-of-town trip ... the catch being that Rupert behaves as though he is a human and expects to be treated accordingly, and that Elmer must do everything he can to not offend his guest or risk losing out on more than just a work promotion. Summary Elmer receives a phone call from his demanding boss, Mr. Billy Bob Crabtree, asking him to watch his dog, Rupert, while he goes on vacation. Crabtree admonishes Fudd that Rupert thinks he's human and expects to be treated like one, then informs him that there are two ways to go in the company -- \\"up (clears his throat) ... or down!\\" If Fudd does a good job, there may be a vice presidency available at the company for him, Crabtree continues. Elmer does everything he can to not offend Rupert, but unwittingly fails at the simplest, seemingly banal tasks. First, Fudd turns on the TV so the two of them can watch Classie, with Fudd stopping Rupert only after reminding him that humans also enjoy watching an adventure series about a dog. Later, Fudd‚Äîfixing himself a steak‚Äîfeeds Rupert dog food, prompting the irritated mutt to once again walk out; Fudd appeases his guest only after eating the dog food himself! That night, when Rupert tries to sleep on the bed, Fudd tries to shoo him out, only for the dog to call his boss to report the offense; a frustrated Fudd, reminded of the consequences of doing an unacceptable job caring for Rupert, winds up sleeping in the dog bed. The next morning, as Elmer is fixing breakfast, Rupert accidentally gets into the medicine cabinet and drinks bay rum (because he saw Fudd gargling mouthwash and does the same thing). When Elmer sees that Rupert is drunk, he takes him out for a ride to sober him up. However, Rupert somehow gets control of the car and speeds through town, terrifying Fudd as Rupert drives through stores and causes a major accident. In the end, a motorcycle cop pulls Rupert over and both the dog and Elmer are charged with driving while intoxicated. When Crabtree posts bail for Elmer and Rupert, he tells Fudd that he will be moving up ... \\"up, up, up, up\\" in the company. Elmer indeed does move up‚Äîto the top of the flag pole atop the E.J. Crabtree office skyscraper. As Elmer bitterly muses that he thought he was going to be vice president, the appointee for the position‚Äînone other than Rupert‚Äîis sitting comfortably at his new desk.

Built in 1835, the one-room schoolhouse was the first school building built by the recently incorporated town of Webster. It served the town as a school for 100 years, after which it was used by the school system for storage. In 1966 it became the museum and headquarters of the Webster- Dudley Historical Society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The District Five Schoolhouse is located south of Webster's central business district, on the east side of School Street, historically the major route leading south toward Thompson, Connecticut. It is a single story brick building, rectangular in shape, with a gable roof oriented parallel to the street. A gable-roofed wood frame vestibule on the south side houses the main entrance, and a shed-roof ell extends to the north. The east and west sides each have three sash windows. The interior houses a single classroom, with the northern ell originally housing wood storage and a bathroom, now altered to house a kitchen and bath. The town of Webster was incorporated in 1832, principally by the efforts of early industrialist Samuel Slater, out of neighboring towns. This school was built soon afterward, and was the first school to be built in the new town, at a cost of $447.50. Although the town abolished its district school system in 1867, this school remained open, serving the nearby neighborhood. In 1883 the school designated one of the town's primary schools. The school was briefly closed during the Great Depression, and was permanently closed in 1939. After being used by the town for storage for many years, it was leased in 1962 to the local historical society for $1, on the condition it be used as a museum.

Cutting and built in 1889. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Architecture and history The library is set on the north side of Main Street (Massachusetts Routes 19 and 67), just east of the town's central business district and west of the town common. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, built of granite with brownstone trim, with a slate roof and a granite foundation. Its front facade is asymmetrically arranged into three sections, with a three-story pyramidally-roofed tower on the left, the main entrance in the center, and a large projecting gable section on the right. Courses of granite are periodically interspersed with bands of brownstone that extend across and around the building. The tower has a projecting bay window, above which is a round-arch opening with a pair of round-arch windows within, topped by an oculus. An arcade of small arched openings bands across the tower between that opening and the roof. The Warren Public Library was chartered in 1876, and first opened to the public in 1879 in rooms of the town hall. Rapidly outgrowing that space, a fund drive was held to fund the construction of a dedicated building, which resulted in the construction of this building on land donated by Wilson H. Fairbank in 1889. The building was designed by Amos P. Cutting, who had previously designed the nearby Congregational Church. The original building plan called for the upstairs to be used as a meeting hall for lectures and civic events. It was instead decided to use space there for a museum, and display cases were purchased at an early date to fulfil this role. The stacks were eventually expanded into the space as well, but it was closed off during World War II as an energy conservation measure, and not reopened until 2001.

Laid out in the 1750s, the area has been the focus of the town's civic and economic affairs since, and includes its finest assortment of 18th and early 19th-century architecture. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The district was in 2010 named as one of the 1,000 places to visit in Massachusetts by the Great Places in Massachusetts Commission.http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/07/12/1000_places_to_visit/ Description and history The area that is now the northern Worcester County town of Templeton was organized as a township called Narragansett Number 6 in 1734, but significant settlement did not begin until the 1750s. The first meeting house was built in 1753, a burial ground was laid out in 1754, and the common was laid out in a plan of 1759. The town was incorporated as Templeton in 1761. The towns economy was mainly agrarian until about 1820, when small industries began to develop. The town center's economy also benefited from being a crossroads of three major stagecoach routes, with a number of taverns serving passing travelers. Chair manufacturing became a significant enterprise after 1820, and there was a small tin factory located in what is now the Grange hall. Development in the center ceased as a significant activity around 1860, as industrial employment was drawn to larger surrounding communities. The historic district is centered on a complex junction of multiple roadways south of the town's geographic center. Baldwinville Road enters from the south, Patriots Road (Massachusetts Route 2A) enters from the west, Dudley Road (Massachusetts Route 101) from the southwest, Wellington Road from the south, Hubbardton Road from the southeast, and Patriots Road enters from the east (designated here as MA Routes 2A and 101). The district extends north along Baldwinville Road beyond Otter River Road, and for shorter distances along Gardner, Hubbardston, and Wellington Roads. Most of the buildings in the district are residential, stylistically from the Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival periods. The most prominent civic building is the First Congregational Church, designed and built by Elias Carter in 1811. This church is particularly notable, as its form was frequently copied, most clearly by Carter himself in the construction of several churches in southern New Hampshire over the following 20 years.

Although its industrial elements have largely been lost, the district retains period housing and civic buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The town of Templeton was settled beginning in the 1750s and was incorporated in 1761. The northern part of the town remained sparsely settled, although a bridge was built across the Otter River in what is now Baldwinville in 1763, adjacent to an early saw and grist mill. The district's oldest surviving building is the 1797 residence of Eden Baldwin, owner of local lumber and brick yards, at the junction of Maple Street and Baldwinville Road on the south side of the river. In 1805 a turnpike was opened to the bridge from Royalston, which helped the area develop into a small village by 1830, when it was formally named Baldwinville. Although none of the mill buildings survive, Greek Revival houses in the district date to this phase of development. Development was further spurred by the arrival of railroads in 1847 and 1872, and it became the principal economic center of the town, focused primarily on the manufacture of chairs. During the height of the village's prosperity in the late 19th century, fine Queen Anne and Stick style houses were built. The area's industries were regularly impacted by floods and fire, and the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 destroyed or damaged most of its remaining industrial buildings. The historic district is roughly linear in shape, extending along Elm Street north of the river and Baldwinville Road south of the river. Its northern boundary is roughly Mason Street, while its southern boundary is roughly Mountain View Street. The district bulges on the north side of the river, where the village's commercial center is located, extending west along Pleasant and Memorial Streets, and east along Circle and Central Streets.

The brewery is owned and run by head brewer Scott Vaccaro. Vaccaro, a homebrewer since 1995, trained in brewing science at UC Davis. Many of Captain Lawrence's beers are strongly influenced by traditional Belgian ale styles, although often with an American twist. Barrel-aging and ales with sourness or flavors contributed by bacteria and wild yeasts such as Brettanomyces, are also part of their repertoire. Like many small breweries, Captain Lawrence seeks to be environmentally sensitive, including donating its spent grain to a local farmer for use as cattle feed. Their beers are fermented in stainless steel cylindro-conical vessels. The brewery takes its name from Captain Lawrence Drive in South Salem, New York, the road on which Vaccaro's childhood home is located. The street is named after Samuel Lawrence (1733‚Äì1796), a captain in the Westchester County Militia, 3rd Regiment, during the American Revolution.  History  Vaccaro brewed his first beer before he was legally allowed to drink. As a teenager in high school he saw a friend's father brewing beer at home, asked if he could participate, and was told it would be allowed with parental permission. After enrolling at Villanova University to study accounting, Vaccaro realized his real desire was to become a professional brewer. He transferred to UC Davis and studied fermentation science. He interned at Adnams Brewery in the UK. Following graduation he worked at Sierra Nevada and the short-lived Colorado Brewery in Danbury, Connecticut. Captain Lawrence Brewing Company was founded in 2006. Its first brewery was located on Castleton Street in Pleasantville, New York and had a 20-barrel system. After five years, needing more space to operate a bottling line and a larger system to increase capacity, the brewery was relocated to Elmsford, New York, approximately five miles from the original brewery. The new facility has a 40-barrel brewing system and more fermentation capacity. There is also a small seven-barrel system for experimental and specialty batches. The new brewery began operation in 2011.

Federal archivists stated that the process is slow due to the need to perform redactions due to the law, and likely would extend past the 2008 presidential election. Clinton had said at the time of the library's opening in 2004 that \\"everything's going to be available.\\"CNN Larry King Live Transcript from November 21, 2004, interview with Hillary Clinton Political consultants said that the unreleased documents might be a rich source for opposition research against Clinton. This issue intensified with the October 30, 2007, Democratic debate at Drexel University, where Hillary Clinton came under fire about it from MSNBC moderator Tim Russert and from Democratic opponents. Russert displayed a document signed by President Clinton that specifically requested that certain records and communications involving her not be made public until 2012. When Russert asked Hillary Clinton whether she would lift the presidential order, Hillary Clinton responded by saying, \\"That's not my decision to make.\\" A concurrent Newsweek investigation stated that Bill Clinton had requested the archivists hold back a large variety of documents. A few days later, Bill Clinton vigorously defended his wife's responses, saying that Russert's question was \\"breathtakingly misleading\\" and that Newsweek's article was off the mark, saying, \\"She was incidental to the letter, it was done five years ago, it was a letter to speed up presidential releases, not to slow them down.\\" Factcheck.org subsequently concluded that Russert's claim was incorrect, that Bill Clinton had released White House records earlier and in greater numbers than his two immediate predecessors, and that there was not much Hillary Clinton could do to speed up the release of records involving her. However, on March 6, 2008, Federal archivists at the Clinton Presidential Library blocked the release of hundreds of pages of White House papers on pardons that the former president approved, including clemency for fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, based on guidance provided by Bill Clinton. =Fears of backlash= An August 12, 2007, article described concerns that a Clinton candidacy could lead to a backlash due to fears that she might prove \\"polarizing.\\" The article states, \\"A strategist with close ties to leaders in Congress said Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races would be strongly urged to distance themselves from Clinton.\\" According to an online poll, \\"half of likely voters nationwide said they would never vote for New York Sen.

Clinton explained individuals can keep their current employer-based coverage, or choose an expanded version of Medicare or federal employee health plans. The projected cost of the plan is $110 billion annually and will require all employers to cover their employees' health insurance or contribute to the costs of their employees' health insurance coverage; tax credits will be provided to companies with fewer than 25 employees to help cover costs.\\"Clinton Sees Better Chances for Health Overhaul\\". NPR. 2007-09-18. Retrieved on 2007-09-18. She proposed to pay for the plan by cutting government medical costs and by not extending the Bush tax cuts to those making over $250,000 a year. Clinton emphasized that this was not a reprise of the failed 1993 Clinton health care plan, saying it reflected her experiences and now involved no new government bureaucracy, but Republican opponents disagreed and immediately dubbed it \\"Hillarycare 2.0\\". However, many of the health care industry groups that had opposed and funded attacks upon the 1993 plan, were now contributors to Clinton campaigns. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Edwards, wife of fellow Democratic candidate John Edwards, said it was too imitative of Edwards' plan, which had come out seven months earlier. =$5,000 for every baby= In September 2007, Clinton suggested that every newborn baby receive $5,000 upon reaching their 18th birthday. Clinton said that with this money, \\"they will be able to access it to go to college or maybe they will be able to make that downpayment on their first home\\". In October 2007, Clinton withdrew this proposal and according to USA Today stated that \\"it was just an idea and not a policy proposal\\".Pickler, Nedra. \\"Clinton urges 401(k)s, matching funds\\".

The advertisement dealt with Clinton's legislative efforts to address the Ground Zero illness issues of clean-up workers at \\"the Pile\\" site of the former World Trade Center. Some interpreted the ad as an implicit criticism of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani. The ad, filmed in black-and-white, shows an earnest-looking Clinton wearing a paper mask. The voiceover says, \\"She stood by Ground Zero workers who sacrificed their health after so many sacrificed their lives, and kept standing 'til the administration took action.\\" The ad referred to Clinton's Congressional effort to secure additional funding and medical care for workers who have suffered Ground Zero illnesses, such as cancer and sarcoidosis.Geoff Earle and Maggie Haberman, \\"Hillary in 9/11 Air Strike ,\\" New York Post, October 5, 2007, p. 5. = Debate performance in Philadelphia= During the course of the 2007 Democratic debates Clinton had established a reputation, even amongst her ideological opponents such as Rich Lowry, as a very solid debater who never made mistakes. However, at the October 30, 2007, MSNBC Democratic debate at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Clinton was the subject of two hours of near-continuous attacks from her Democratic rivals as well as pointed questioning from moderator Tim Russert. This was not unexpected, as leading up to the debate, Clinton had assumed a wide lead in many polls, rival Barack Obama had indicated that he was now going to be more aggressive in pointing out differences between himself and Clinton, and another leading rival John Edwards had also been increasing his statements against Clinton. Adam Nagourney of The New York Times called it \\"the most eagerly anticipated forum of this year.\\" In the debate, Clinton suffered her possible first major campaign setback when she engaged in what reporters for The Washington Post termed \\"a rare night of fumbles,\\" including statements that Jake Tapper of ABC News termed \\"obfuscatory and less than forthright,\\" making for what Roger Simon of The Politico called \\"the worst performance of her entire campaign\\" in which \\"for two hours she dodged and weaved, parsed and stonewalled.\\" Clinton refused to commit to a position on Social Security, Illegal Immigration, the war in Iraq and the New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's bill to deliver driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Her response on the last issue brought the most criticism, with opponent Senator Christopher Dodd and Edwards immediately saying she had contradicted herself, an assessment echoed by Margaret Carlson of Bloomberg News, who wrote that \\"In the course of two minutes, she gave two different answers while trying to give none at all.\\" Clinton's own supporters conceded that her performance had not been very good. The following day, however, the Clinton campaign assembled and released a short video entitled \\"The Politics of Pile On\\", which showed her debate opponents mentioning her by name over and over. Furthermore, during a November 1 speech at her alma mater Wellesley College, she said that \\"In so many ways, this all-women's college prepared me to compete in the all-boys' club of presidential politics.\\" This, combined with comments made by some supporters, including remarks by Clinton campaign manager Mark Penn against moderator Russert, led pundits to believe she was playing the \\"gender card\\". This in turn led to another round of criticism of Clinton, who had previously stressed her toughness as being one of her strengths as a potential president; Obama pointed out that he had never complained that attacks on him were due to his being African-American. On November 2, Clinton issued a clarification, stating \\"I don't think they're picking on me because I'm a woman, I think they're picking on me because I'm winning.\\". Meanwhile, the Edwards campaign assembled and released a video of Clinton's contradictory debate remarks entitled \\"The Politics of Parsing\\", which Daily Kos termed \\"devastating\\". A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national poll in the wake of the debate and its attendant publicity found Clinton with a reduced but still substantial lead over Obama and Edwards, while an NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll found her lead to be unaffected; a WNBC-TV/Marist poll found her lead slipping in first primary state New Hampshire. A week after the debate, Clinton said, \\"I wasn't at my best the other night. We've had a bunch of debates and I wouldn't rank that up in my very top list,\\" but defended her desire to give nuanced responses to questions and reiterated that gender was not an issue in terms of being subjected to political attacks. =Prompted Queries= On November 12, 2007, the New York Times reported that \\"At two campaign events in Iowa this year, aides to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton encouraged audience members to ask her specific questions, a tactic that drew criticism from an opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination and led her yesterday to promise that it would not happen again.\\" In response, Clinton remarked, 'It was news to me [...] and neither I nor my campaign approve of that, and it will certainly not be tolerated.'\\"\\"Clinton Aides Prompted Queries at Campaign Events\\", The New York Times, November 12, 2007. =Las Vegas debate= At the next Democratic debate at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, on November 15, Clinton rebounded to previous form, aggressively combating Obama's and Edwards' attacks. Democratic strategist Garry South said, \\"To the degree she might have been stumbling in the last debate, she regained her footing tonight,\\" while ABC News said, \\"After her roughest two weeks on the presidential campaign trail, [Clinton] showed up on a debate stage in Las Vegas ... with a new aggressive game plan and appeared to successfully get her campaign ship back on course.\\" Her answer to the previously troublesome question of supporting driver's licenses for illegal immigrants was now given in one word: \\"No.\\" =New Hampshire campaign office hostage-taking= On November 30, 2007, a man identified as 47-year-old Leeland Eisenberg, armed with road flares strapped to his chest which he claimed were a bomb, entered a Clinton presidential campaign office in Rochester, New Hampshire. He took hostage the six people in it, and requested to speak to Clinton, believing she could assist him in gaining psychiatric help. Two hostages were released early on, a woman and her infant. Two subsequent hostages were released by Eisenberg during the first 90 minutes of the crisis and the final two Clinton staffers managed to escape the building on their own accord after more than five hours of being held against their will. The standoff ended with Eisenberg's surrender about six hours after the incident began. At the time of the event, Clinton was in the Washington D.C. area, scheduled to speak at a Democratic National Committee meeting in Vienna, Virginia; she canceled her appearances at public events for the remainder of the day. That evening she flew to Rochester in order to meet with and comfort the hostages, praise the law enforcement officials who handled the situation, and vow not to change her campaign style due to the incident. =December 2007: A tightening contest= By early December 2007, the race between her and Obama had tightened up, especially in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. With real voting less than a month away, Clinton brought into Iowa her daughter Chelsea and a very rare campaign appearance from her 88-year-old mother Dorothy Rodham. Veteran political observers such as Bloomberg News' Al Hunt reported that \\"things are tense in Hillaryland these days,\\" that the camps of Clinton and her husband were at odds, and that the campaign's \\"plan A\\" of being the dominating, inevitable, establishment candidate was at risk of failing. On December 13, 2007, Bill Shaheen, co-chairman of the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire, resigned his position after saying that Obama's admission of past drug use would hurt his chances in a general election matchup: \\"The Republicans are not going to give up without a fight ... and one of the things they're certainly going to jump on is his drug use ... It'll be, 'When was the last time? Did you ever give drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?' There are so many openings for Republican dirty tricks. It's hard to overcome.\\" Shaheen, husband of former Governor of New Hampshire Jeanne Shaheen, apologized for his comments. In addition he indicated that \\"they were not authorized by the campaign in any way.\\" The final Democratic debate before the caucuses was held the same day by the Des Moines Register; it was peaceful and polite among all candidates there. The two most influential newspaper endorsements for the early states were split: Clinton gain the endorsement of The Des Moines Register, which had endorsed Edwards in 2004, while Obama gained the endorsement of the circulated-in-New Hampshire Boston Globe. Bill Clinton assumed a more central role in his wife's campaign, trying to focus the day-to-day message on her being a \\"change\\" agent, while sometimes getting her campaign into further difficulties with his public statements. By mid- month, prompted by continued high negative ratings in polls, Clinton staged an explicit \\"likability\\" drive, using testimonials from friends and constituents on the campaign trail and on a new \\"The Hillary I Know\\" website. When the close proximity of the first contests to the holidays led to many candidates putting out Christmas videos ‚Äì allowing them to keep presenting their message but in a more appropriate setting ‚Äî Clinton chose one that showed her wrapping various \\"gifts\\" she would give the country, such as \\"universal health care\\" and \\"bring troops home\\", with a bit of humor added when she momentarily could not locate \\"universal pre-K\\". It was one of the most issue-oriented of the candidate holiday videos. Caucuses and primaries 2008=Iowa= In the initial delegate selection event of 2008, she placed third with 29.45 percent of the state delegate selections in the January 3, Iowa Democratic caucus to Obama's 37.58 percent and Edwards' 29.75 percent. In terms of the actual number of delegates that would later be selected to the national convention, the difference between the top three candidates was minor, with Clinton possibly ahead of Edwards. Nevertheless, in terms of damaging her image as the \\"inevitable\\" leader in the race and in giving Obama considerable momentum, this was a major blow to Clinton's campaign. She remained upbeat in her remarks that night, saying that \\"This race begins tonight and ends when Democrats throughout America have their say. Our campaign was built for a marathon, and we have the resources to run a national race in the weeks ahead.\\" The following day, reports described \\"panic\\" among some Clinton donors; some Clinton supporters began questioning the soundness of her strategy and the ability of her top campaign advisors, with chief strategist Mark Penn the focus of particular criticism. =New Hampshire= Hillary Clinton greets supporters after her New Hampshire Primary win. Polling showed a tight race in the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary. While some polls showed a dead heat between Clinton and Obama, January 6 polls conducted by CNN/WMUR-TV and USA Today/Gallup showed Obama jumping ahead by 10 and 13 points respectively after winning Iowa.Poll: Obama jumps ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire CNNPolitics.comm, January 6, 2008Poll: Obama, McCain lead ahead in N.H.

In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton could not bring change, while he and Obama can. \\"Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack.\\" He made clear that he was referring to Clinton, adding, \\"I didn't hear these kind of attacks from Senator Clinton while she was ahead. Now that she's not we hear them.\\" Clinton passionately retorted: \\"Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is somebody who can deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes.\\" At another point, when one moderator asked Clinton why polls showed she was less \\"likeable\\" than other candidates, particularly Obama, she joked tongue-in-cheek, \\"Well that hurts my feelings ... but I'll try to go on.\\" In the wake of the Iowa defeat, the campaign hoped that Bill Clinton could help salvage a win in New Hampshire, where he had achieved a political comeback in his 1992 presidential campaign. As he had in Iowa, the former President campaigned intensively, but his New Hampshire appearances failed to draw large or enthusiastic crowds. On the day before the primary, press reports indicated that Hillary Clinton advisers were pessimistic about the immediate future, thinking it was unlikely she would be able to win either New Hampshire or South Carolina. That same morning, Clinton became \\"visibly emotional\\" at a stop in Portsmouth, when after a friendly question from a voter about how she kept going on the campaign trail, she said, \\"It's not easy, and I couldn't do it if I just didn't, you know, passionately believe it was the right thing to do.\\" On election day, January 8, 2008, seven different polls led to a win for Obama, by margins from 5 points to 13 points, with an average of 8.3 points. Elegies were published on the Clinton campaign. Weather was good and voter turnout was reported as heavy all day long, with election officials worried they might run out of ballots; the large turnout was expected to favor Obama. During the day and into the evening there were reports of a major shakeup in Clinton's campaign staff scheduled for the next day, in the wake of an expected loss. In contrast to expectations, Clinton won New HampshireAlan Fram, Late NH polls missed Clinton upswing Newsweek.com, January 9, 2008 gaining about 39 percent of the vote compared to Obama's 36 percent. In her victory remarks to supporters that evening, Clinton said, \\"I come tonight with a full heart. Over the last week, I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice.\\" Clinton's win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. (Shirley Chisholm's prior \\"win\\" in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern.) The day after her win New Hampshire, Chris Matthews appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe said of Clinton: \\"I'll be brutal, the reason she's a U.S. senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around. That's how she got to be senator from New York. We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit.\\" The comments were criticized as unfair by such diverse media figures as Bill O'Reilly, Joy BeharABC: The View, January 10, 2008. and Gloria Steinem, and led to protests outside NBC's Washington, D.C. studios, as well as a joint letter of complaint to NBC from the National Organization for Women, Feminist Majority and the National Women's Political Caucus. Matthews apologized for the comments on the January 17, 2008 edition of his own MSNBC program, Hardball. In the following days, media outlets engaged in self-examinatory listing of the many faults of their coverage, while pundits advanced dozens of theories to explain the unexpected result. The reason for the comeback that most captured the public imagination was her humanization in the last days of the campaign, in particular the \\"likeability\\" issue being raised in the debate and her moment becoming became \\"visibly emotional\\" the day before which resonated with female voters. Meanwhile, Internet theories sprung questioning the voting and arguing that there were discrepancies between machine-counted votes (which supported Clinton overall) and hand-counted votes (which supported Obama overall). Fifth-place finisher Dennis Kucinich's campaign paid $25,000 to have a recount done of all Democratic ballots cast in the primary, saying \\"It is imperative that these questions be addressed in the interest of public confidence in the integrity of the election process and the election machinery.\\" On January 16 the New Hampshire Secretary of State's office began the recount. After recounting 23 percent of the state's Democratic primary votes, the Secretary of State announced that no significant difference was found in any candidate's total, and that the oft-discussed discrepancy between hand-counted and machine- counted ballots was solely due to demographic factors. =Maya Angelou= American poet, author, and actress, Maya Angelou recited her poem, \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993, the first poet to do so since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. In January 2008, Angelou announced that she wrote a poem for Hillary entitled State Package for Hillary Clinton for The Observer. On the subject of writing the poem, The Guardian stated that, \\"Angelou is steadfast in her loyalty to Clinton. She said recently: 'I made up my mind 15 years ago that if she ever ran for office I'd be on her wagon' [...] Angelou says that she has had many long telephone conversations with [Oprah] Winfrey on the subject of Obama versus Clinton. 'She thinks he's the best, and I think my woman is the best,' she has explained. 'Oprah is a daughter to me, but she is not my clone.'\\" On April 30, 2008, Angelou made a public endorsement of Clinton. =Issues of race= Issues of race came to the forefront as campaigning began for the January 26 South Carolina primary, the first to feature large African American participation in the Democratic electorate. First, in the closing stages of the New Hampshire campaign, Bill Clinton had referred to Obama's claim that he has been a staunch opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning as a \\"fairy tale,\\" which some subsequently thought was a characterization of Obama's entire campaign. The former President called into Al Sharpton's radio show to personally clarify that he respected Obama and believed in his viability. Around the same time, Hillary Clinton discussed Martin Luther King, Jr. and President Lyndon Johnson in an interview for Fox News. She stated that, \\"I would point to the fact that that Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do, the President before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done. That dream became a reality, the power of that dream became a real in people's lives because we had a president who said we are going to do it, and actually got it accomplished.\\" Some African-American leaders took this statement as a denigration of the accomplishments of King and the larger Civil Rights Movement. Hillary Clinton blamed Obama for the controversy, claiming his campaign had fanned the flames, a charge which Obama dismissed as \\"ludicrous\\". Shortly before, and during, a January 15 Democratic debate in Nevada, Clinton and Obama declared a truce on the matter, with both making reconciliatory statements about race, gender, and each other. However, there was concern that Clinton's support among some African Americans may have been damaged, with SUNY Albany's Debra Dickerson stating \\"The Clintons have to do something dramatic and symbolic to win back the trust of many African-Americans.\\" In part the tension resulted from the historical coincidence of the first viable female presidential candidate, and the first viable African American candidate, running against each other in the same nomination race. One South Carolina pastor lamented that he had been waiting all his life for either \\"first\\" to happen, and said, \\"I really hate that they had to run at the same time in the same election. It just makes what should be a wonderful situation very stressful for folk like me. I never imagined you could have too much of a good thing.\\" Clinton acknowledged that she understood the situation: \\"I wish it didn't have to be a choice. I think a lot of people who are torn between us feel that way. But it is a contest ...\\" Feminism and the civil rights movement had a long intertwined history in the United States, often working in concert but sometimes opposed; while the bitter 19th century split between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Frederick Douglass illustrated the latter, the unified opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas had exemplified the former. After the Clinton-Obama tension on this matter, one Democrat interviewed by the Financial Times said, \\"After Iowa, Obama was the post- racial candidate who appealed to all of our better natures. Now he's a black politician and she's a woman. And it is back to politics as usual.\\" =Michigan ‚Äì maybe= Because of a party dispute over scheduling, the January 15 Michigan primary lost its delegates to the national convention, and all major candidates signed a pledge \\"not to campaign or participate\\" in Michigan's primary. The majority of candidates, including Richardson, Edwards and Obama, interpreted the pledge as requiring the removal of their names from the Michigan ballot. Clinton, however, decided to keep her name on the ballot, only agreeing to the \\"campaign\\" part of the pledge. Thus, little or no campaigning was done there (in the actual vote, Clinton would win nothing with 55 percent of the vote against 40 percent for an uncommitted slate) and attention instead moved to the January 19 Nevada caucuses. Later, in the month, Clinton announced that she wanted a Michigan delegation (and Florida's, in the same circumstance) seated at the convention, saying \\"I hear all the time from people in Florida and Michigan that they want their voices heard in selecting the Democratic nominee. I believe our nominee will need the enthusiastic support of Democrats in these states to win the general election, and so I will ask my Democratic convention delegates to support seating the delegations from Florida and Michigan.\\" This seemed to contradict her previous statement on NH public radio where she said, \\"Well, you know, it's clear, this election they're having is not going to count for anything.\\"New York Senator and Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary ClintonNew Hampshire Public Radio The Obama campaign responded that it was clear these contests were for no delegates and that \\"it seems like Hillary Clinton will do or say anything to win an election.\\" =Nevada= The Clinton campaign benefited from a surge in fundraising after its New Hampshire win, garnering $6 million in new funds. Robby Mook served as Clinton's state director in Nevada. In Nevada, Obama gained the valuable endorsement of the Culinary Workers Union, whose 60,000 members staff the casinos and resorts of Las Vegas and elsewhere. Clinton countered by appealing to the Hispanic vote in the state, emphasizing that they were at special risk from the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis. Meanwhile, a proxy legal battle between Clinton and Obama broke out over the creation of special at-large precincts within nine Las Vegas resorts, which were approved in 2007 to allow casino employees a chance to participate in the caucuses, as many employees could not leave the casinos during voting hours. Clinton supporters said they violated equal protection and one-person-one-vote requirements, and the Nevada State Education Association filed a lawsuit seeking to eliminate the casino caucus sites. The organization did not officially endorse Clinton, but many of its top officials have done so. This led Obama to allege that the suit was filed in order to hurt his chances at the caucuses. \\"Some of the people who set up the rules apparently didn't think we'd be as competitive as we were and are trying to change them last minute,\\" he said. On January 17, a federal judge ruled that the casino at-large caucus plan could go ahead. This was seen as a win for Obama because of the Culinary Workers Union endorsement. To further complicate matters, the major news and polling organizations decided to not do any polls before the Nevada caucuses, fearing the newness of the caucus, the transient nature of Nevada's population, and more fallout from their bad experience in New Hampshire. In one of the few polls that was conducted, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that Clinton was ahead by 9 points. Clinton finished first in the caucuses on January 19, winning 51% of delegates to the state convention compared to 45% for Obama.Clinton, Romney win in Nevada NBC News, January 19, 2008 After the caucuses, there was dispute over which candidate would send more delegates to the national convention. It appeared that Obama won 13 to Clinton's 12, because the apportionment of delegates is based on county totals. Delegates to the national convention will be determined officially at the April 19 state convention,Clinton Cashes In Nevada Win With High Roll in Vegas CQ Politics, January 19, 2008 and the Nevada Democratic Party said that it was not necessarily true that state delegate preferences would remain the same by that time.Clinton campaign says Obama is wrong Reno Gazette Journal, January 19, 2008. On January 23, the Obama campaign filed an official letter of complaint with the Nevada Democratic Party charging the Clinton campaign with many violations of party rules during the caucuses, based upon 1,600 complaints they had received. The Clinton camp said the Obama operation was \\"grasping at straws\\" and that they had their own complaints about Obama campaign actions during the caucuses. =South Carolina= The issues of race that came to the forefront had no greater effect than where campaigning began for the January 26 South Carolina primary, the first to feature large African American participation in the Democratic electorate. The January 22 CNN/Congressional Black Caucus debate in Myrtle Beach was according to CNN a \\"debate punctuated by sharp exchanges.\\"Sparks fly in most contentious debate to date CNN.com, January 22, 2008 Clinton criticized Obama for voting \\"present\\" on many occasions while in the Illinois Senate. \\"It's hard to have a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote,\\" she said. Obama said that he was working to help unemployed workers in Chicago while Clinton was \\"a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart.\\"Clinton, Obama Engage in Bitter Debate Associated Press, January 22, 2008 He also took issue with statements made on the campaign trail by Bill Clinton, saying \\"I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes.\\"Quotes From Monday's Democratic Debate Associated Press, January 22, 2008 It was the most-watched primary season debate in cable television news history. In the days after the debate, Hillary Clinton left to campaign in some Super Duper Tuesday states, while Bill Clinton stayed in South Carolina and engaged in a series of exchanges with Obama. Clinton's decision to leave the state was subject to criticism. Hillary aides responded by stating that criticism directed towards Clinton was created in order to \\"undermine the former president\\". Edwards stayed clear of the fray in the debate and later said that he represented the \\"grown-up wing\\" of the party. Bill Clinton attracted controversy for his participation in his wife's campaign after a series of attacks made on his part against Obama, which many former Clinton supporters felt to be unfair. While some felt the attacks against Obama may eventually pay off, others felt it would damage Hillary Clinton's presidential prospects and alienate Democratic voters in the general election if she won the nomination. There was also concern that the former President was overshadowing the candidate on the campaign trail. According to CBS, \\"By injecting himself into the Democratic primary campaign with a series of inflammatory and negative statements, Bill Clinton may have helped his wife's presidential hopes in the long term but at the cost of his reputation with a group of voters that have long been one of his strongest bases of political support.\\" Some critics accused Clinton of \\"pulling the race card\\" against Barack Obama. On January 26, Obama won by a more than two-to-one margin over Clinton, gaining 55 percent of the vote to her 27 percent and Edwards' 18 percent. Bill Clinton had compared Obama's victory to Jesse Jackson's victory in the 1988 South Carolina primary, in which he said \\"Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here.\\" He would be criticized for these comments because they were widely seen as implying that Obama was \\"the black candidate. \\" Hillary Clinton would later apologize for her husband's remarks in front of the State of the Black Union conference. Clinton had already left the state and gave her concession speech from Tennessee State University, where she said she was looking forward to the February 5 Super Duper Tuesday contests. =Kennedy family endorsements= In late 2007, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his sisters Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Kerry Kennedy (children of the late Senator and United States Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy) announced that they would be endorsing Hillary Clinton. On January 27, 2008, their cousin Caroline Kennedy (President John F. Kennedy's daughter) announced in a New York Times op-ed piece entitled, \\"A President Like My Father\\", that she would endorse Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. On the same day, her uncle Senator Ted Kennedy announced that he would endorse Obama despite appeals by both Clintons not to do so. Senator Kennedy's endorsement was considered among the most influential that any Democrat could get. In particular, it raised the possibility of improving Obama's vote-getting among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats. It was later followed by an announcement that his son Congressman Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island's 1st District would also endorse Obama.Patrick Kennedy says Obama can galvanize nation to changeKennedy Endorses Obama ‚Äì \\"Change in Air\\" Obama was also subsequently endorsed by Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, and two of their children, Max Kennedy and Rory Kennedy In response to these endorsements, Robert, Kathleen, and Kerry wrote in a January 29, 2008, editorial, \\"By now you may have read or heard that our cousin, Caroline Kennedy, and our uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, have come out in favor of Sen. Barack Obama. We, however, are supporting Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton because we believe that she is the strongest candidate for our party and our country.\\" California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a member of the Kennedy family through his marriage to Maria Shriver, an Obama supporter, commented, \\"What is surprising is that I think for the first time, the family is not in sync [...] three of them have endorsed Barack Obama and three of them have endorsed Hillary Clinton. I think that's the interesting story there.\\" Shriver's brother, Anthony Shriver, supported Clinton as well. =Impact of Bill Clinton= Bill Clinton campaigning for Hillary Clinton at Virginia Tech. February 9, 2008. After South Carolina, the Clinton campaign sought to find a \\"gentler\\" role for Bill Clinton, whose actions during the South Carolina campaign and earlier was suspected of having polarized the Democrat electorate and harming Hillary Clinton's standing among women, in addition to having contributed to Ted Kennedy's decision to endorse Obama. Congressman Charles Rangel, an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, said of Bill Clinton, \\"He's got to [pull back]. The focus has got to get back on Hillary. For all that he cares about his wife, this has to be her election to win, and it's become too much about his role.\\" By two days after South Carolina, CNN's Candy Crowley reported that there was \\"a huge wave\\" of sentiment inside and outside the Clinton campaign that the former President \\"needs to stop.\\" Bill Clinton did subsequently maintain a lower profile on the campaign, relying on standard talking points and rarely mentioning Obama by name, or if he did, praising him: \\"I'm not against anybody. I'm for Hillary ... If you disagree, you have another very attractive choice.\\" Bill Clinton said that in retrospect, \\"Everything I have said has been factually accurate, but I think the mistake I made was to think I was a spouse just like any other spouse who could defend his candidate. I think I can promote Hillary but not defend her because I was president.\\" By late February, with Hillary Clinton trailing further behind Obama, one unnamed senior adviser to her campaign said that in hindsight it had been unwise to use Bill Clinton as much as they had, as \\"his presence, aura and legacy caused national fatigue with the Clintons.\\" =Florida ‚Äì maybe= The Florida Primary on January 29, like the earlier Michigan one, had had its delegates stripped from it due to its jumping too early in the primary season. The Democratic candidates agreed not to campaign in the state, although unlike Michigan all were on the ballot here. Several days before the primary, Clinton announced that she believed Florida delegates should get seated at the national convention. Despite no delegates apparently being at stake, over 1.5 million Democrats voted in the primary. Clinton won with 50 percent of the vote, compared to 33 percent for Obama and 14 percent for Edwards. Clinton was in Florida that evening and gave a brief victory speech, saying, \\"You know, I could not come here to ask in person for your votes. But I am here to thank you for your votes today. This has been a record turnout because Floridians wanted their voices to be heard on the great issues that affect our country and the world.\\" =Super Tuesday= Clinton campaigning at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, Minnesota, two days before the twenty-two state vote. Super Tuesday took place on February 5, 2008, with twenty-two states holding Democratic caucuses or primary elections on this date. It was preceded by two events for Clinton. The first was a debate held at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles on January 31 which was notable for its civil tone. The second was Hillary's Voices Across America: A National Town Hall which was broadcast on the Hallmark Channel at 9 pm on February 4.Clinton Buys Block on Hallmark Mediaweek January 31, 2008 During this time, Clinton also announced that she had loaned her campaign $5 million. Of this loan Clinton commented, \\"I loaned it because I believe very strongly in this campaign. We had a great month fund-raising in January, broke all records. But my opponent was able to raise more money.\\" There were a number of issues at stake going into Super Tuesday, with no clear winner assured in the race.Economy Crucial On 'Super Tuesday One critical factor was the California primary which was deemed the \\"biggest prize in the Super Tuesday contest: the state delivers 370 delegates for the Democratic candidates.\\" In the California contest, Clinton had gained three important endorsements: Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. Clinton won nine states on Super Tuesday including important delegate rich ones: the California Primary, 52% to 42%, with 204 delegates for Clinton and 160 for Obama; the New York Primary 57% to 40% with 139 delegates for Clinton and 93 for Obama; the New Jersey Primary 54% to 44% with 59 delegates for Clinton and 48 for Obama; the Arizona Primary 51% to 42% with 31 delegates for Clinton and 25 for Obama; the Arkansas Primary 70% to 20% with 27 delegates for Clinton and 8 for Obama; Oklahoma Primary, 61% to 37%, of which Clinton gained 24 delegates and Obama 14; and Tennessee Primary, 54% to 41%, of which Clinton gained 40 delegates and Obama 28. She also won the Massachusetts Primary 56% to 41%, of which Clinton gained 55 delegates and Obama 38. The Massachusetts Primary was described by The Guardian as a \\"symbolically important triumph\\" for Clinton. New Mexico had to postpone declaring a winner in order to conduct a recount. Clinton was announced the winner of New Mexico on February 14. Obama won the primaries in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri and Utah. He also won all of the states which held caucuses ‚Äì Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota and North Dakota; among the reasons for this were his campaign's fundraising advantage, which allowed him to procure the costly ground operations crucial to success in caucuses. According to CBS News estimates, Obama won 803 pledged delegates on Super Tuesday and Clinton took 799.Dems Fight to a Draw On Super Tuesday CBSNews.com, February 6, 2008. Within a few days after Super Tuesday, Clinton raised $10 million from 100,000 donors. =Louisiana, Nebraska, Washington, and Maine= Clinton competed in Washington, with advertising and personal appearances, as well as in Maine, with Bill Clinton going to Louisiana. In Washington, which had the most delegates at stake, Clinton had the endorsements of Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, but lost Governor Chris Gregoire to Obama. Nebraska was visited by daughter Chelsea Clinton, who talked to students at Creighton University. On February 9, Clinton lost the Louisiana primary 57% to 36%, the Nebraska caucuses 68% to 32%, and the Washington caucuses 68% to 31%. Across the three states, Obama gaining 84 delegates to Clinton's 45. On February 10, Clinton lost the Maine caucus 59% to 40%. Obama gained 15 delegates to Clinton's 9. =The Potomac primary= The \\"Potomac primary\\", with votes cast in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, was held on February 12. Clinton made personal appearances in the District, Maryland, and Virginia. Obama was able to begin his television advertising in the states earlier than Clinton, due to his campaign's fundraising advantage. Clinton lost the D.C. primary 75% to 24%, the Maryland primary 61% to 36%, and the Virginia Primary 64% to 35%. Clinton herself responded to the loss by stating, \\"I think everybody knew that he was favored there. My husband lost Maryland when he was running in the primary. We go on. We're ready for the contests that are upcoming. There are hundreds of delegates that will be in play on March 4. We are well organized and well positioned.\\" Regarding a response to Obama's win CNN argued, \\"for the second election night in a row, Hillary Clinton failed to acknowledge or congratulate Barack Obama after he won the day in dominating fashion.\\" CBS, however, quoted Clinton as telling reporters, 'I want to congratulate Senator Obama on his recent victories and tell him to meet me in Texas, we're ready.'\\" On February 14, a national poll by Ipsos-Public Affairs placed Clinton at 46% and Obama at 41%. National polls from Rasmussen and Gallup were released the same day. Rasmussen showed Obama ahead 49‚Äì37, and Gallup had the race virtually even, with Obama holding a one-point lead.Daily Presidential Tracking Poll Rasmussen Reports, February 14, 2008Tracking Election 2008 Gallup Poll, February 14, 2008 The same day, Obama passed Clinton in the overall Pollster.com aggregate national poll for the first time during the campaign. NBC News noted that even if Florida and Michigan were included in the tally, Obama led in the total popular vote after the Potomac primary.First Thoughts: Mr. Front-runner , MSNBC.com, February 13, 2008 =Role of superdelegates= Following the Potomac primary, the potential role of superdelegates in deciding the Democratic nomination was heavily discussed. In particular, the possibility of one candidate gaining more pledged delegates from primary and caucus wins, but losing the nomination to the other due to the decisions of superdelegates, made some Democratic leaders uncomfortable. The Clinton camp, behind in pledged delegates, advocated that superdelegates exercise their own judgment in deciding which candidate to back; Clinton campaign worker Geraldine Ferraro argued for this option, with Ferraro stating, \\"The superdelegates were created to lead, not to follow.\\" The Obama camp, ahead in pledged delegates, advocated that superdelegates follow the will of the voters and back whichever candidate had the most pledged delegates. Some party leaders, such as U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, argued for the latter interpretation, while others such as Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean argued for the former interpretation. African American superdelegates previously pledged to Clinton, found themselves under pressure to switch to supporting Obama's historic candidacy; Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr. suggested that those staying with Clinton might face Democratic primary challenges in the future. MoveOn.org started an Internet petition to urge superdelegates to \\"let the voters decide between Clinton and Obama, then support the people's choice.\\" Clinton was viewed as having an institutional advantage in amassing superdelegates by virtue of her fifteen years of national prominence in party politics. However, Obama had heavily outspent Clinton in previous contributions to superdelegates through their political action committees. Whether or not Clinton actually could prevail with the help of party-appointed superdelegates was also an increasingly debated question, as Obama gained 47 new superdelegates between Super Tuesday and mid-March, while Clinton lost 7. =Wisconsin and Hawaii= The Wisconsin primary and the Hawaii caucuses were next on the campaign schedule. Chelsea Clinton made appearances at four Wisconsin universities: University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse, and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire.Chelsea wows Davies crowd WISN-TV noted Chelsea's statement at UW‚ÄìMilwaukee that, \\"On the war in Iraq, '[her mother] would end it the first day (in office) if she could,' but acknowledges that it would take about 60 days to come up with a plan to withdraw our troops and set up a workable plan to leave.\\" Chelsea also planned to appear for her mother in Honolulu and in Maui. Hillary Clinton reduced her already limited scheduled appearances in Wisconsin, with her campaign feeling disadvantaged by Governor of Wisconsin Jim Doyle's endorsement of Obama and the fact that independent voters are able to vote in the state's Democratic primary. Clinton made Obama's refusals to add any additional debates to the campaign schedule a primary focus of her messaging in Wisconsin, saying, \\"I will meet Senator Obama any place in the state. There's only been one debate between the two of us. This has only been a two person race for a little over two weeks. And I think it's a real disservice to the people of Wisconsin that you haven't had a chance to see the tough questions asked and answered.\\" Obama responded by saying, \\"We've had 18 debates. Eighteen debates!\\" Obama outspent Clinton 4‚Äì1 in television advertising in the state, and was able to get on the air earlier than Clinton due to his campaign's greater financial strength. Clinton did air a large number of negative ads against Obama in the final days of the campaign. The most publicized charge which Clinton used against Obama preceding the Wisconsin primary were accusations that he plagiarized portions of his campaign's national co-chair Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts. The lines Obama used were in response to charges by Clinton that his campaign offered \\"speeches but not solutions.\\" The lines Obama used were almost verbatim from portions of a speech made by Patrick in 2006, stating \\"Don't tell me words don't matter.'I have a dream.' Just words? 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.' Just words! 'We have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Just words ‚Äì just speeches!\\" Obama stated that he borrowed the lines after being recommend to do so by Patrick who had faced similar attacks that he was only offering talk but not action. On February 19, Clinton's losing streak to Obama stretched to ten in a row. Obama won the Wisconsin primary 58 percent to 41 percent, with a trend continuing of Clinton losing support in demographics that had previously been most favorable to her, such as women, lower-income families, and people who belong to labor unions. That evening, when Clinton's televised remarks did not include acknowledgment of Obama's victory, he started his own victory remarks before she finished, causing the cable news channels' to switch their live coverage to Obama. Obama also won the Hawaii caucuses overwhelmingly, 76 percent to 24 percent, in the state where he was born, spent much of his childhood, and still has family. The New York Times termed the night's results and demographic trends \\"grim tidings for Mrs. Clinton,\\" while the Los Angeles Times headlined, \\"Wisconsin: Beginning of the end for Clinton?\\" and the Associated Press described her campaign as \\"fading\\".Obama and McCain Win Wisconsin Primaries Associated Press, February 19, 2008 Two days later, the results of the worldwide Democrats Abroad primary were announced, with Obama winning by a wide margin and stretching Clinton's losing streak to eleven. =Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont= The Ohio primary, Rhode Island primary, Texas primary and Texas caucus, and Vermont primary took place on March 4. The delegate-rich Ohio and Texas primaries were considered to be top prizes for both candidates: Ohio offers 141 pledged delegates and Texas 193. A number of news organizations, most notably cable television network Fox News named the March 4 primaries and caucuses \\"Super Tuesday II.\\" In Texas, a Houston rally was held on February 10 in support of Clinton. On February 12, according to CBS, Hillary received a \\"rock star welcome\\" when she spoke before a crowd of 12,000 at the University of Texas at El Paso. In Ohio, polls released on February 13 indicated that Clinton had a 17-point lead. She gained the endorsement of Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and Ohio First Lady Frances Strickland, of astronaut and former Senator John Glenn, and of Akron mayor Don Plusquellic. She also gained the endorsement of the Columbus Dispatch. In mid February Chelsea Clinton's campaigning for her mother included visits to Cleveland State University, the University of Akron Ohio State, and Ohio Wesleyan. In Rhode Island, a February 13 Brown University poll for the state indicated Clinton was the choice of 36 percent of voters surveyed while Obama was supported by 28 percent. As Obama solidified his lead, Clinton shook things up with a revamped message and sharper digs at her party's front man on February 20, 2008. However, in the February 21 Democratic debate at the University of Texas at Austin, the next-to-last one of the campaign, Clinton generally refrained from attacking Obama. Clinton's closing statement in the debate drew praise from political analysts and a standing ovation from the audience. A police officer was killed February 22, 2008, in a motorcycle accident as Clinton's motorcade made its way through downtown Dallas. A visibly angry Clinton lashed out February 22 at Obama over campaign literature that she said he knows is \\"blatantly false\\". At the same time, a New York Times report portrayed her as still fighting, but philosophical and realistic about the possibility that she would lose the race. With only a week left in the race a February 26 New York Times report by political correspondent Patrick Healy stated that Clinton had developed a new \\"kitchen sink strategy\\" to confronting Obama which involved a slew of negative campaign attacks on Obama's experience and especially his readiness to be commander in chief. This began with a February 25 speech at George Washington University on foreign policy with Clinton comparing Obama's foreign policy inexperience to President George W. Bush. With a week and a half to go, both Ohio and Texas tightened: An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken February 16‚Äì20 indicated that Clinton's lead over Obama in Ohio had shrunk to 7 percentage points. Another poll, released February 25, projected also a statistical dead heat in Texas between the two. On February 25 USA Today/Gallup poll showed that Obama had a double- digit lead for the first time,\\"Poll: Obama now seen as most electable\\", USA Today, February 26, 2008. and a CBS News/New York Times poll showed an even larger Obama lead. In the last scheduled debate of the campaign, at Cleveland State University on February 26, Clinton and Obama argued with each other over negative campaigning, health care and free trade. Clinton personally echoed a theme her campaign had emphasized over the past days, that media coverage on her was much tougher than that on Obama, by making reference to a Saturday Night Live skit on the same point from the weekend before. New York Times writer Alessandra Stanley said that the debate, hosted by MSNBC and featuring grillings from Tim Russert, \\"did look a bit like the 'S.N.L.' parody.\\" Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama battled for votes over the airwaves and on the ground in Texas on February 29. Hillary Clinton met her match while appearing on NBC's \\"Saturday Night Live\\" to deliver the show's trademark opening line and provide an \\"editorial response\\" to a mock presidential debate. On March 2, 2008, Hillary Clinton tried to convince Ohio voters they have what it takes to fix the economy as they campaigned before contests that could decide the Democratic presidential nomination. The state's 3.6 million eligible Hispanic voters could tip the balance in delegate-rich Texas toward Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. But they're deeply divided. Clinton relied on a loyal grass- roots network of community leaders. One of the most controversial and upfront moves of the so-called \\"kitchen sink\\" strategy against Obama had been an ad entitled \\"Children\\" which Clinton aired in Texas concerning a 3 am phone call at the White House during a world crisis and touting Clinton's national security credentials. Many political commentators compared the Clinton ad to one used in the 1984 Democratic primary by Walter Mondale against Gary Hart. Obama responded with a similar ad on the same day claiming that Clinton lacked the judgment to deal with a world crisis because of her vote for the Iraq War. Clinton gave her harshest rebuke of Obama yet on March 3 when she repeatedly stated that she and Senator McCain had foreign policy experience while Obama only had a speech. The Obama campaign responded asking what foreign policy experience Clinton truly had. Hillary Clinton said March 17, 2008, she is the only candidate who would exercise the leadership needed to end the Iraq War. Sen. Barack Obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail, but he didn't start working aggressively to end the war. Clinton broke the 12-state winning streak for Obama with her victory in Rhode Island 58%/40%. The state had Clinton leading in the polls, though her lead had been narrowing in the days leading up to the primary. Clinton also won the Ohio primary 54%/44% and the Texas primary 51%/47%. She lost Vermont 59%/39% and the Texas Caucus 56%/44% with 41% reporting. Overall, Obama secured 99 Texas delegates, while Clinton earned 94. Clinton's wins in Ohio and Texas resulted in large part from her gaining back her core demographic areas of support, such as women and lower-income groups. The day after, on March 5, Clinton raised the possibility on several morning news programs of a joint ticket with Obama, saying: \\"That may be where this is headed. But, of course, we have to decide who is on the top of ticket. I think the people of Ohio very clearly said that it should be me.\\" Soon after, in Wyoming, Obama explicitly rejected the notion, saying \\"You won't see me as a Vice Presidential candidate.\\" =Wyoming and Mississippi= The Wyoming caucus was held on March 8, 2008, with Senator Obama winning by 61% of the vote compared to Clinton's 38%. President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea had campaigned in the state, and Hillary Clinton made a Wyoming appearance the day before the caucuses.Obama Wins Wyoming Caucuses, NY Times, March 9, 2008 The Clinton campaign had continued to criticize Senator Obama's inexperience with what one Clinton aide called the \\"kitchen sink\\" strategy ‚Äì throwing everything at Obama in the days leading up to the March 4 primaries in Ohio and Texas.Clinton campaign starts 5-point attack on Obama International Herald Tribune, February 26, 2008 The Obama campaign was seen as \\"off balance\\" by former John Edwards campaign manager Joe Trippi in an interview with New York Magazine because many problems mired the Obama campaign after its Ohio and Texas losses, Trippi expressed concern that Obama's negative counter-attack strategy could backfire. Earlier in the week the campaign of Republican nominee John McCain attacked a gaffe by Obama's foreign policy advisor Susan Rice on MSNBC's \\"Tucker,\\" wherein she said that neither Obama nor Clinton was \\"ready to receive that 3 am call,\\" referring to Clinton's Texas attack ad. Obama was also hurt by news that foreign policy advisor Samantha Power had called Clinton a \\"monster\\" in an interview with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman. Power subsequently resigned from the campaign. Obama responded to the re- vamped Clinton \\"kitchen sink\\" strategy by raising Senator Clinton's reluctance to release her tax returns, with campaign manager David Plouffe calling Clinton \\"one of the most secretive politicians in America today\\". Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson responded to the attacks by comparing Obama to former special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. The Clinton campaign continued to hint that a Clinton victory would entail Obama being chosen as vice Presidential running mate, and on March 8, former President Bill Clinton made known his support of this as a \\"dream ticket\\" which would be an \\"almost unstoppable force\\" However, the day before, in Casper, Wyoming, Senator Obama had explicitly rejected this notion. On March 10, Obama noted that he, not Senator Clinton, held the lead in delegates won. \\"I don't know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who is in first place,\\" he said.Obama Rejects Clinton Suggestion of Vice Presidency Bloomberg.com, March 10, 2008 He further stated that Clinton's VP suggestion was an example of what he called \\"the old okey-doke\\", telling a Columbus, MS crowd that the Clinton camp was trying to \\"bamboozle\\" or \\"hoodwink\\" voters.Obama: VP spot is not for me Biloxi Sun Herald March 10, 2008 Obama inquired why the Clinton campaign believed him competent for Vice President, but not as President. The Mississippi Primary was held on March 11, 2008, with Obama winning 61% of the vote to Clinton's 37%. It was notable that the Mississippi results were largely divided by racial lines with exit polls by CNN showing Obama winning 91% of the black vote while 72% of the white vote went to Clinton. =Ferraro comments and resignation= On March 7, 2008, the 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee and Clinton finance committee member Geraldine Ferraro, gave an interview to the small California newspaper Daily Breeze in which she said, \\"I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama's campaign ‚Äì to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against. For one thing, you have the press, which has been uniquely hard on her. It's been a very sexist media. Some just don't like her. The others have gotten caught up in the Obama campaign. If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.\\" Ferraro justified her statements by referring to her own run for vice president saying that she \\"was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) if you go back to 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984 if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification.\\" By the day of the March 11 Mississippi primary, the comments had achieved wider circulation and she was accused of being racially insensitive. Hillary Clinton rejected Ferraro's comments ‚Äì saying, \\"It is regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides, because we've both had that experience, say things that kind of veer off into the personal. We ought to keep this on the issues\\" ‚Äì but did not call for Ferraro's resignation from the Clinton campaign. Ferraro rejected apologizing or repudiating her comments once they came under fire from the Obama campaign, and spoke to the Daily Breeze again, where she said, \\"I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?\\"Gene Maddaus, \\"Ferraro defends controversial comments on Barack Obama\\" , The Daily Breeze, March 11, 2008. On March 12, MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann launched an unusually vehement critique of the Clinton campaign, accusing the campaign of using Ferraro as a surrogate to imply that Obama (who was president of Harvard Law Review at Harvard Law School during his time there and is a magna cum laude graduate of its law school) was the beneficiary of social and media affirmative action. Some commentators saw these comments by Ferraro as a coded attempt by the campaign to appeal to race-conscious white voters in the upcoming Pennsylvania primary. Later on March 12, Ferraro resigned from the Clinton campaign, saying \\"The Obama campaign is attacking me to hurt you. I won't let that happen.\\" At a campaign stop with the National Newspaper Publishers Association which represents over 200 African American newspapers, Clinton was asked to apologize for Ferraro's remarks and said, \\"I said yesterday that I rejected what she said, and I certainly do repudiate it.\\" =Comments about 1996 Bosnia trip= During her presidential campaign, Clinton had made several references to her March 1996 trip to visit U.S. troops enforcing the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, detailing a harrowing experience. At a February 29, 2008, event in Waco, Texas, with retired Gen. Wesley Clark and remarks at a December 29, 2007, event in Dubuque, Iowa, Clinton detailed how she had to make a run for it on the tarmac at Tuzla Air Base to avoid sniper fire. On March 17, 2008, during her Saint Patrick's Day speech at The George Washington University, Clinton described her trip to Bosnia: The Associated Press could find no evidence that Clinton had been under extraordinary risk during her landing at Tuzla Air Base. A video of her arrival, released by CBS News, shows Clinton and her daughter Chelsea smiling and waving as they walked at a leisurely pace across the tarmac from a cargo plane, stopping to shake hands with Bosnia's acting president and listen while an 8-year-old girl read a poem. Clinton shook hands with American troops and posed for pictures with a group of 7th graders who were also on the tarmac. Comedian Sinbad, who accompanied Clinton on the trip, said, \\"I never felt that I was in a dangerous position. I never felt being in a sense of peril, or 'Oh, God, I hope I'm going to be OK when I get out of this helicopter or when I get out of his tank.'\\" When spokesman Howard Wolfson was asked about her remarks, he said that she \\"misspoke\\". CBS News reported that hundreds of thousands of viewers had by then seen video of the 1996 event that offers evidence of Clinton's exaggeration, with Clinton aide Lissa Muscatine saying the event \\"was not quite as dramatic as Clinton put it.\\" Clinton acknowledged her mistake, saying \\"I made a mistake. That happens. It proves I'm human, which you know, for some people, is a revelation.\\" The Obama campaign responded by releasing documentation of three other instances in the past in which Clinton had repeated the same sniper fire claim.Earle, Geoff, \\"Now Bunko Hill Is Under Fire: Insulted Military Blasts Her Serial 'Sniper' Lies\\", New York Post, March 26, 2008. =Campaign finance= The Clinton campaign had $33 million on hand at the end of February 2008, but due to federal election laws, would only be able to spend $11 million of that on the Democratic primary. As of the end of February, the campaign owed $8.7 million in unpaid debts. The campaign has also been slow paying vendors, drawing criticism from small business owners who have provided services to the campaign. A February 8, 2008, article in the Portsmouth Herald stated, \\"Rochester physician Terry Bennett said he rented a city building to people who worked for Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign ‚Äì and skipped town without paying the bill. Making matters worse, Bennett said, the building at 236 Union St. was left trashed...Realtor Michael Whitney... said he has been trying to collect rent for four weeks. 'I sent about 20 e-mails,' said Whitney. '...I called, but they will not return any of my calls.'\\"Landlord: Clinton staff stiffed me on rent Portsmouth Herald, February 8, 2008 A February 23, 2008, article in The New York Times reported that a caterer, a hotel, and a cleaning service all had trouble collecting money from Clinton's campaign for services that they had provided. A March 31, 2008, article in The Politico titled \\"Clinton didn't pay health insurance bills\\" stated, \\"Among the debts reported this month by Hillary Clinton's struggling presidential campaign, the $292,000 in unpaid health insurance premiums for her campaign staff stands out... the unpaid bills to Aetna were at least two months old, according to FEC filings.\\" After Clinton's April win in the Pennsylvania primary by 9.4%, her campaign released to the media that it had received a renewed national boost, as evidenced by 60,000 donors who contributed a total of $10 million, more than 80 percent of whom the campaign said were first-time donors. An investigation from The Politico, however, concluded that the claim was only \\"successful campaign spin,\\" and \\"a case of shaping favorable media coverage by crafting a narrative too compelling to overlook.\\" Politico concluded this because the campaign's claims, it said, were \\"impossible to independently verify.\\"Kenneth P. Vogel, \\"The story behind Clinton's record haul\\", Politico, April 26, 2008.Available online. Archived. Data released by the Federal Election Commission revealed that the real figure was approximately $4.3 million. A May 12, 2008, Bloomberg News article states that Clinton has \\"more than $10 million in unpaid bills to vendors and consultants.\\"Clinton Deadline Looms for Recouping $11 Million Personal Loan Bloomberg News, May 12, 2008 An August 22, 2008, CNN blog entry by CNN reporters Alexander Mooney and Robert Yoon stated, \\"According to an FEC report filed Wednesday, Clinton's debt as of the end of July stood at just under $24 million ‚Äì a decrease of only $1.2 million since the end of June. More than $13 million of that total is owed to the New York senator herself, while close to $11 million is owed to individual vendors.\\"Disclosure reports show Clinton still deeply in debt, CNN blog from CNN writers Alexander Mooney and Robert Yoon, August 22, 2008 =NAFTA position= During her campaign, Clinton repeatedly criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, despite it having been one of the major achievements of her husband's administration, and said that as First Lady she had been against the agreement. Her opposition to NAFTA had been a key issue in the Ohio primary. The mid-March release of Clinton administration White House calendar documents that suggested that Hillary Clinton had participated in several meetings during 1993 to promote NAFTA's passage within Congress led to the Obama campaign accusing her of mendacity. Obama advisor David Axelrod said the documents provided \\"direct, incontrovertible evidence\\" that the First Lady worked for NAFTA's passage and that \\"This is the political equivalent of consumer fraud.\\" The NAFTA matter thus became one of several where Clinton's credibility was being called into question. Thereupon followed a range of remembrances from Clinton administration officials involved at the time. David Gergen and Robert J. Shapiro said she had opposed NAFTA on the merits, as well as for getting too high political priority compared to the Clinton health care reform plan, an assessment that was echoed by biographers Sally Bedell Smith and Carl Bernstein. Others such as Robert Reich recalled only her opposition to the priority and not to the agreement herself. In any case, once her husband had made the decision to support NAFTA, she did publicly support that. =Tax return disclosure= On April 4, the Clintons released their tax returns for the past eight years. The total reported income for the time period was $109 million, most of which came from Bill Clinton's books, speaking engagements, and other enterprises. The Clintons paid $34 million in federal taxes over the period. =Health insurance story= In early April, the Clinton campaign had problems arising from Clinton's use of a story of health insurance coverage, an Ohio hospital, and a patient's death. Based upon a story Clinton had heard from a Meigs County sheriff's deputy in Pomeroy, Ohio, in February, but had not had fact-checked, Clinton described a woman from rural Ohio who was making minimum wage at a local pizza shop, was uninsured, and became pregnant. As told, there were complications with the pregnancy and the woman was denied treatment at a local hospital because she couldn't afford a $100 payment; she later was taken to the hospital by ambulance and lost the baby; she was then taken by helicopter to a Columbus hospital where she died of complications. Clinton used the story through April 4 in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Officials at O'Bleness Memorial Hospital in Athens, Ohio, said the woman did have insurance and had not been turned away; they expressed frustration that Clinton's campaign never called to verify the story, and asked that Clinton stop telling it. In fact, the woman had been earlier denied treatment at a private clinic because she owed them several thousand dollars from unpaid previous visits, and so thought she could not go to the clinic again once she became pregnant, even though she now had insurance. Thus she did not seek medical care until she was already in an emergency situation. On April 6, the Clinton campaign indicated it would drop use of the story. On April 11, Paul Krugman wrote a column in the New York Times saying the essential point about the poor state of health care in the United States was lost in the media storm about this episode and that Clinton's point about a pregnant woman who died after being turned away was essentially correct. =Pennsylvania= Bill Clinton at a \\"Solutions for America\\" rally at the Henry Memorial Center at Washington & Jefferson College on March 11, 2008 Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama would both statistically tie Republican John McCain in a general election matchup, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released March 18, 2008. At the same time, daily tracking polls from Rasmussen Reports showed McCain with a lead over both Democratic candidates.Daily Presidential Tracking Poll Rasmussen Reports, March 23, 2008 The National Archives on March 19, 2008, released more than 11,000 pages of Sen. Hillary Clinton's schedule when she was first lady. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign has pushed for the documents' release, arguing that their review is necessary to make a full evaluation of Clinton's experience as first lady. Ed Rendell, Catherine Baker Knoll, and Stephen Reed rally for Clinton in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on March 11, 2008 The Pennsylvania Primary will be held on April 22. With 188 delegates, one Pennsylvania newspaper said that the state is \\"poised to become decisive in the Democratic presidential nomination.\\" President Bill Clinton highlighted the importance of the state for the Clinton campaign saying on March 11 at an event in Western Pennsylvania that \\"If she wins a big, big victory in Pennsylvania, I think it'll give her a real big boost going into the next primaries... I think she's got to win a big victory in Pennsylvania. I think if she does, she can be nominated, but it's up to you.\\" This was a repetition of his tactic before March 4, warning supporters that his wife might not be able to continue if she did not win Ohio and Texas. Hillary Clinton emphasized that Pennsylvania was something of a home state for her, as her father came from Scranton, Pennsylvania, she and her brothers were christened there and had vacationed near there each summer, and her brothers still maintained the family cottage near there. A February 14 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll placed Clinton ahead of Obama 52% to 36%. Another poll, released two weeks later, saw that margin decreasing, with Clinton leading Obama by 6 points, at 49% to 43%. As April began, Clinton's lead had been virtually wiped out in the state. A poll from Public Policy Polling had Obama two points ahead, while an Insider Advantage poll showed Clinton hanging on to a two-point advantage. Both results were within the margins of error, making the state a virtual dead heat. Another late-March poll from Quinnipiac University had Clinton nine points ahead.Pennsylvania poll shows Clinton campaign on life support Southern Political Report, April 3, 2008 On March 27, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont called for Clinton to withdraw from the presidential campaign and support opponent Barack Obama. The six-term senator, and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee made the statements during an interview on Vermont Public Radio. Leahy stated: \\"Senator Clinton has every right, but not a very good reason, to remain a candidate for as long as she wants to. As far as the delegate count and the interests of a Democratic victory in November go, there is not a very good reason for drawing this out.\\" Clinton rejected calls to withdraw, saying \\"The more people get a chance to vote, the better it is for our democracy...we of all people [know] how important it [is] to give everyone a chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted.\\" Campaigning in the week of April 14, 2008, included a tough debate between Obama and Clinton, who pounded her rival for his recent remark that decades of economic decline had left some rural voters \\"bitter\\" and clinging to religion and guns. On April 22, she won the Pennsylvania primary by 9.2 percentage points, keeping her campaign alive and bringing in a much-needed $4.3 million in new funds over the next 24 hours, although the campaign claimed the figure was $10 million. Weekly churchgoers made up almost 36 percent of the electorate, who went to Clinton by a 56‚Äì44 margin. More than a third were gun owners, and they preferred Clinton by an almost-identical margin‚Äî60 percent to 40 percent, exit polls found out. The victory showed she had the better shot at winning on November 4, 2008, than he, she stated. A total of 158 delegates to the convention were at stake. =North Carolina and Indiana= In a series of political ads and speeches while campaigning in Indiana, Clinton blamed the closing and move of Magnequench in Valparaiso, Indiana, a company that manufactures military-grade magnets used in smart weapons on the Bush administration. However, the company's sale to a Chinese company was approved under the administration of her husband Bill Clinton in 1995 despite national security concerns. A memo from the office of Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, who is also a supporter of Clinton, revealed that Bayh blamed the Clintons for the closing of the Magnequench plant. Clinton was heavily outspent by Obama in both states. Clinton made her proposal of a summer gas tax holiday a central part of her campaigning. Obama opposed the notion, and it became a major issue between them. When most economists came out against the proposal, Clinton denounced \\"elite opinion\\" and said, \\"I'm not going to put my lot in with economists.\\" On May 6, a narrow win in the Indiana primary coupled with a large loss in the North Carolina primary, damaged Clinton's campaign's chances and led to speculation about whether she could or would remain in the race. Clinton had hoped to score a solid win in Indiana and finish a close second in North Carolina, especially after Obama had endured a difficult period in his campaign due to continuing effects from the Jeremiah Wright controversy. As the results came in from these two states, ABC political analyst and former top Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos declared the Democratic race \\"over\\", and NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert said, \\"We now know who the Democratic nominee will be.\\"Hillary Clinton refuses to quit, but battle is 'over' Daily Telegraph, May 7, 2008 The day after the North Carolina and Indiana votes, it appeared that superdelegates and party leaders were beginning to coalesce around Obama. He added four superdelegate endorsements to Clinton's one, and former Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern switched his support from Clinton to Obama. Clinton fights on as focus turns to superdelegates CNN.com, May 7, 2008 Regardless, Clinton vowed that her campaign would continue through the remaining primary states, and she loaned it an additional $6.4 million from her own funds. =West Virginia= Clinton expressed her rationale for staying in the race by saying, \\"I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on ... [there is an Associated Press article] that found how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me. There's a pattern emerging here.\\" The bluntness of her demographic analysis garnered some attention, and Clinton aides later said she regretted the remarks. When Congressman Charles Rangel, a strong Clinton supporter, said \\"that was the dumbest thing she could have said,\\" Clinton acknowledged that \\"he's probably right.\\" Campaigning for the coming primaries, the Clinton campaign was forced to economize in its presentation values. While Internet and conventional fundraising continued, it fell far short of the burst she had received after her Pennsylvania win. Ahead of the West Virginia vote, Obama took the lead in committed superdelegates on May 9. Obama had picked up seven endorsements from superdelegates since the May 6 primaries.Obama Takes Lead in Superdelegate Tally ABCNews.com, May 9, 2008 Recognizing that the nature of the contest had changed, Clinton largely eliminated mention or criticism of Obama from her stump speeches and advertisements. Clinton won the state by a 41-percentage-point margin, and told supporters that she was \\"more determined than ever to carry on in this campaign\\".After big win, Clinton vows to push forward CNN.com, May 13, 2008 After exit polls revealed that large numbers of Clinton supporters were planning to vote for John McCain rather than Obama should she lose the nomination, Clinton said it would be a \\"terrible mistake\\" for those voters to do so: \\"I'm going to work my heart out for whoever our nominee is. Obviously, I'm still hoping to be that nominee, but I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me ... understands what a grave error it would be not to vote for Sen. Obama.\\" After winning West Virginia, the Clinton campaign claimed a lead in the popular vote. The math behind this claim required (1) excluding the caucus states of Iowa, Nevada, Maine, and Washington; (2) including the disputed Florida totals; (3) including the disputed Michigan totals; (4) allotting 0 votes to Obama in Michigan. By that calculation, Clinton was ahead by roughly 27,000 votes of 33.4 million cast, or 0.08%. CNN noted that \\"Four different scenarios of the total popular vote have been kicked around,\\" and that Obama led under all four scenarios. Clinton was ahead only under a fifth scenario excluding caucus states. =Kentucky and Oregon= Obama continued to add to his superdelegate lead in the week before the May 20 Kentucky and Oregon primaries, and former Democratic candidate John Edwards endorsed Obama on May 14.Edwards endorsement pays off for Obama Associated Press, May 15, 2008 Ex-Rival Edwards Throws His Support Behind Obama NY Times, May 15, 2008 On May 20, Clinton won the Kentucky primary by a 35-point margin, while losing the Oregon primary by 18 points. With the results, Obama gained a majority of all the pledged delegates to the convention. With Obama approaching victory in the nomination process, Clinton continued to avoid attacking him. The campaigns had not yet begun discussing what Clinton might want in any concession negotiation. Bill Clinton began strongly pushing for Obama to take Hillary Clinton as his vice presidential running mate. =RFK remark controversy= While campaigning in South Dakota on May 23, Clinton responded to questions about why there was pressure on her to leave the race: Clinton's mention of the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in the context of her rationale for staying in the race drew a quick storm of national attention, as well as strong criticism from the Obama campaign. By the end of the day, Clinton issued an apology, saying that the Kennedys were on her mind due to the recent medical condition of Ted Kennedy and that she only used the example because of the June timeline, not, as speculated, to imply an Obama assassination. She had made a similar remark to Time magazine in March. The following day Obama said he would give Clinton the benefit of the doubt, adding, \\"I have learned that when you are campaigning for as many months as Senator Clinton and I have been campaigning, sometimes you get careless in terms of the statements that you make. And I think that is what happened here.\\" Throughout the Memorial Day weekend, the Clinton campaign sought to do damage control over the remarks, arguing more strongly that her remarks had been deliberately taken out of context by the news media and the Obama campaign. Campaign spokesperson Howard Wolfson said, \\"It was unfortunate and unnecessary, and in my opinion, inflammatory, for the Obama campaign to attack Senator Clinton on Friday for these remarks, without obviously knowing the full facts or context.\\" Clinton was also criticized for exaggerating the meaningful duration of her husband's 1992 campaign; while he did not clinch the nomination until June of that year, he had effectively won it by mid- March. =Florida and Michigan resolution= At a meeting of the Democratic National Committee Rules & Bylaws Committee held in Washington, D.C., on May 31, 2008, decisions were made regarding seating delegates from the Michigan primary and Florida primary. The Florida delegation was seated by following the results of the primary, but with each delegate having one-half vote in consequence of the penalty for holding the primary too early. This gave Clinton 105 pledged delegates (52.5 votes), Obama 67 delegates (33.5 votes), and Edwards 13 delegates (6.5 votes). The Florida resolution was acceptable to all sides and approved by a committee vote of 27 to 0. The Michigan resolution was less obvious, since only Clinton of the major candidates had been on the ballot. The same half-vote penalty was employed, then a formulation was devised wherein the Michigan delegation was seated with 69 delegates (34.5 votes) pledged to Clinton and 59 delegates (29.5 votes) for Obama. This gave Obama four more delegates than the primary results would have warranted, assuming that all \\"uncommitted\\" votes were for Obama. The Michigan resolution was approved by a vote of 19 to 8. Harold M. Ickes, a strong supporter and representative of Clinton, objected strongly to the resolution, saying: \\"This motion will hijack ‚Äì hijack ‚Äì remove four delegates won by Hillary Clinton. This body of 30 individuals has decided that they're going to substitute their judgment for 600,000 voters.\\" He then announced that Clinton reserved the right to appeal the Michigan resolution to the DNC Credentials Committee and thus possibly to the Democratic National Convention. The meeting was conducted before a boisterous audience of candidate supporters, mostly pro-Clinton. =Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Montana= The final three primaries took place in early June. The Clinton campaign knew the end was near, but enjoyed the time spent at events in Puerto Rico, and Clinton spoke of the virtue of \\"finishing the job.\\"Mark Leibovich, \\"Far From Her Party's Bitter Feuding, a Breezy Island Weekend for Clinton\\", The New York Times, June 2, 2008. On June 1, Clinton won the Puerto Rico primary by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Later on June 3, Clinton won the South Dakota primary and Obama won the Montana primary. This was the final primary of the season. =Obama becomes the presumptive presidential nominee= A flurry of superdelegates declared for Obama on June 3, and that combined with the day's winning of new pledged delegates in the two primaries, meant Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive presidential nominee. Following the result, after rumors fueled by a misunderstanding of an Associated Press report, the campaign dismissed suggestions that Clinton was going to concede in the speech following the primaries. In her speech after the closing of the Montana polls, Clinton said \\"I will be making no decisions tonight.\\" She invited Americans to write to her on her website to provide input into what her next steps should be. Meanwhile, while not officially confirming interest in the vice presidential slot, Clinton hinted at the possibility earlier on June 3. When asked for clarification, her campaign released the statement \\"Today on a conference call with New York legislators, Sen. Clinton was asked whether she was open to the idea of running as vice president and repeated what she has said before: She would do whatever she could to ensure that Democrats take the White House back and defeat John McCain.\\" The vice presidential possibility had been raised by Bill Clinton in the previous month, but this fueled speculation that Hillary Clinton was definitively interested in the possibility. The New York Times described the relationship between Obama and Clinton during the campaign as having \\"veered between strained and strange\\", and suggested that the manner in which Obama reacted to Clinton and her supporters would be a major test of the post-primaries period. By June 4, several media networks and top Clinton aides confirmed that she had been planning to concede the race for the Democratic nomination and endorse Obama. By June 5, the Clinton camp backed away from any suggestion about the vice presidential slot, with Clinton's spokesperson saying \\"[she] is not seeking the vice presidency, and no one speaks for her but her. The choice here is Senator Obama's and his alone.\\" End of campaign On June 7, 2008, in a speech before her gathered supporters at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., Clinton officially announced that she was suspending her campaign and was fully endorsing Barack Obama. Clinton said: Clinton also adopted Obama's signature slogan, \\"Yes We Can\\", in her concession speech. Obama responded to the speech in a number of venues. Shortly after she gave it, Obama stated that he was \\"thrilled and honored\\" to be supported by Clinton. In North Carolina on June 9, 2008, Obama began his speech by praising Clinton. He stated: Obama also thanked Clinton on his website and asked his supporters to do so as well via a special page designated for that task. In addition, at a rally in Michigan on June 16, Obama defended Clinton as she was being heckled by some members of the audience, stating that \\"she is worthy of our respect, she is worthy of our honor.\\" The 2014 book HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton says that as the campaign wound down, a handful of staffers were tasked with compiling a list of Democrats based on their perceived loyalty or disloyalty during the campaign. Vice-presidential selection and convention Clinton speaks during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, while delegates and audience members hold signs reading \\"Hillary\\". After conceding defeat to Obama, Clinton's name was mentioned exhaustively by speculators and party officials as a possible running mate for the Illinois senator; the potential ticket was dubbed \\"the Dream Team\\", \\"the Dream Ticket\\", and \\"the Unity Ticket\\" in some quarters. However, she was never seriously considered or vetted by Obama for the position. Ultimately, Obama selected Delaware Senator Joe Biden over Clinton and a number of other rumored candidates, including Texas Rep. Chet Edwards, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh (an early and prominent Clinton supporter), and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine; the announcement was reported by CNN after midnight (U.S. Eastern Time) on August 22. During the Democratic National Convention, Clinton released her delegates and urged them to vote for Barack Obama. On August 27, 2008, she motioned that Sen. Obama be officially nominated by acclamation.

He was the Member of Parliament MP for Glasgow from 1857 to 1874. Life Dalglish was born in Glasgow, the son of Robert Dalglish (1770‚Äì1844) the Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1830 to 1832 and brother of Andrew Stevenson Dalglish (1793‚Äì1858). He was educated at Glasgow University and became the head of the family calico printing firm of Dalglish, Falconer & Son founded in Lennoxtown by his father. He was Independent Radical M.P. for Glasgow from 1857 to 1874 speaking in favour of extending of the franchise, voting by ballot and a more equal distribution of electoral districts.. He was a popular and respected MP. \\"Vanity Fair\\" in 1873 said \\"Popularity is commonly but a poor test of merit, yet in Parliament it has a distinct value and meaning, so that Mr. Dalglish may well be proud of being known for the most popular Member of the House of Commons. He has in truth all the qualities which command consideration among a body of ordinary sensible men. He possesses the charity that is not puffed up, he is an easy-going, good-natured man, he is fond of the fair sex, he gives good dinners, and yet at the same time he has a sound judgment and discretion, often appealed to by men whose names are far more frequently before the public. He is one of those valuable and too rare Members who are useful in Committee, and seldom speak at all, and never without saying something to the point at issue and worthy of being ranged among the arguments concerning it.\\" He was a great admirer of the Duke of Wellington and was heavily involved in the erection of Marochetti's statue of the \\"Iron Duke\\" in front of the Royal Exchange Square, Glasgow. Dalglish himself is commemorated by a bas-relief on Queen Victoria's statue in George Square. He owned and resided at Kilmardinny House in Bearsden from 1853, making substantial improvements to the property to the designs of architect James Smith. Kilmardinny was purchased by Thomas Reid (1831-1900) Chairman of Nobel Explosives and Provost of Govan following Dalglish's death.

The anomaly is recognized as \\"psychosomatic\\" in that death is caused by an emotional response‚Äîoften fear‚Äîto some suggested outside force. Voodoo death is particularly noted in native societies, and concentration- or prisoner of war camps, but the condition is not specific to any particular culture.Stumpfe, K.D. \\"The psychogenic death of Mr. J. A case report.\\" pp. 263‚Äì73. Walter Cannon and his work In 1942, Walter Bradford Cannon, MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern physiological psychology, published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress.Cannon, Walter. \\"Voodoo Death.\\" pp. 169‚Äì181. Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of supernatural consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives. What Cannon describes has since been termed \\"bone-pointing syndrome,\\" wherein an individual receives some sort of shock‚Äîoften the breaking of some social/religious taboo‚Äîthat he interprets as an ill omen for himself; his physical condition then deteriorates at a rapid rate, and he dies within a period as short as 24 hours after the initial shock. Cannon discusses the example of a Maori woman who learned that the fruit she had eaten came from a tapu (tabooed) place; less than 24 hours later she was dead. Conversely, Cannon also shares the example of a young man who had fallen ill when the local witch doctor had pointed a bone at him, a societal taboo that meant a curse of death; however, when the perpetrator explained to the young man that the whole thing had been a mistake, and that no bone had been pointed at him at all, the young man's health returned instantly. Cannon notes the similarities in each case: the individuals were both members of a society where beliefs in the supernatural are fiercely upheld, and both had suffered what they both believed to be some form of a curse as dictated within their personal beliefs; also, the individuals shared similar physical symptoms. And yet, in the case of the young man, once the cause for the psychological distress was removed, his mysterious illness disappeared. Cannon attributes these rather drastic physical repercussions as the workings of the emotion fear upon the mind which then leads to destruction of the physical condition. Causes=Cannon's explanation= According to Cannon, the emotion of fear working on the mind, which he terms the \\"sympathetic\\" or \\"sympathico-adrenal\\" division of the nervous system, causes a fall in blood pressure as brought on by \\"a reduction of the volume of circulating blood\\". Cannon explains the loss of blood volume by the constant injection of adrenaline into the small arterioles which constrict, preventing a proper flow of blood within the body and causing a drop in blood pressure. From there, the weak blood pressure prevents the sufficient circulation of the blood by damaging the heart and nerves responsible for the maintenance of the vessels which transport blood, thus making it harder for circulation to continue since the very organs necessary to maintain proper blood circulation are deteriorating. An accelerated heart rate then ensues, followed by rapid breathing. Added to these symptoms are the effects of no food or drink in the person experiencing psychological distress: Cannon suggests that true shock, in the medical sense, could be the cause of death as a result of little food or drink. States Cannon: \\"The combination of lack of food and water, anxiety, very rapid pulse and respiration, associated with a shocking experience having persistent effects, would fit well with fatal conditions reported from primitive tribes.\\" =Modern explanations= Since 1942, scientists have discovered many more of the processes involved in the effect of stress upon the body, such as the region of the brain called the amygdala. The series of events by which a sensory stimulus is introduced to the mind, and the amygdala processes the emotion of fear which follows is called the \\"vision-to-fear pathway\\", or the \\"auditory-to-fear pathway\\", depending on the stimulus. The generally recognized sequence of events, as enumerated by Esther M. Sternberg, MD, in 2002, stands as follows: various chemicals and electrical impulses are released that are transmitted by nerve fibers. Simultaneously, hormones are excreted from the brain, adrenal and pituitary glands in response to stress on the system. Cardiac arrhythmias are often the result of an overabundance of these hormones on the system.Sternberg, Esther. \\"Walter B. Cannon and 'Voodoo' Death: A Perspective From 60 Years On.\\" pp. 1564‚Äì1566. In 1981, Wylie Vale, PhD, discovered corticotrophin, the brain's hypothalamic stress hormone, or CRH: this hormone secreted by the hypothalamus coordinates with \\"the brain stem adrenaline centers involved in initiation of the sympathetic response ... to cause a massive release of both adrenaline-like nerve chemicals and stress hormones. Together these might well cause illness, including loss of appetite, weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even vascular collapse that could result in death.\\" Martin A. Samuels, MD, elaborates further on still another process of death, stating that with the release of adrenaline and an increased heart rate, sometimes catecholamines, stress hormones, will build up, leading to calcium channels opening and remaining open, resulting in an overflow of calcium into the system, killing off cells.Kirn, Timothy. \\"Voodoo death is brain's lethal response to fear.\\" Parasympathetic over-activation Cannon believed that extreme emotional stress could be explained in terms of degree of sympathetic-adrenal excitation. However, an experiment performed by Curt Richter (1957) responded to Cannon's challenge with an animal model. Richter placed pre-stressed rats in closed turbulent water; the latency to drowning was then recorded. Most domestic lab rats lasted for hours while unexpectedly all of the wild rats died within 15 minutes. Richter monitored heart rate and determined whether the heart was in systole or diastole after death. He found out that heart rate slowed down prior to death and the heart was engaged with blood reflecting a state of diastole. This contradicted Cannons proposal that sympathetic adrenal over-activation is the result of death since a sympathetic over-arousal would increase both heart rate and blood pressure to severe degrees. Richter interpreted this that the rats died as a result of over- stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, specifically the vagus nerve which regulates heartbeat. The lethal vagal effect was the psychological state of hopelessness. Sudden prolonged immobility or faked death is an adaptive response exhibited by many mammalian species. Hofer(1970) demonstrated that several rodent species when threatened exhibited an immobility that was accompanied by a very low heart rate. For some of the rodents that heart rate reached below 50% of the baseline. Hofer distinguished between prolonged immobility and faked death phenomenon. Unlike the behavior of \\"hopelessness\\" described by Richter, the death-faking occurred with a sudden motor collapse during active struggling. Hofer interpreted the fear- inducing slowing of heart rate as a vagal phenomenon. These data suggest that vagus contributes to severe emotional states and may be related to emotional states of immobilization, such as extreme terror. Unfortunately, this immobilization technique is potentially life-threatening for mammals (but not for reptiles). Mammals would undergo states of bradycardia or hypoxia as an over-activation of parasympathetic vagus system. The organs of the oxygen- hungry mammal are deprived of oxygen due to lack of blood flow, and the animal dies. Critical evaluation Despite Cannon's general ignorance on the particulars of physiological breakdown, scientists in the intervening years since the publication of Cannon's work, have generally agreed with his fundamental hypotheses concerning voodoo death. Criticisms that generally come against Cannon's work are directed at the hearsay nature of Cannon's case studies, but recent studies have discovered numerous examples of voodoo death in various societies.Lester, David. \\"Voodoo Death.\\" pp. 1‚Äì18. To those who allege difficulty in the experimental process of validating Cannon's theory, Barbara W. Lex, in her 1974 article titled, \\"Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old Explanation\\", states that \\"Voodoo death\\" can easily be observed without complicated experiments: > Pupillary constriction, easily observable and indicative of parasympathetic > activation ... the amount of saliva, of perspiration, degree of muscle > tonicity and skin pallor in an individual are also discernible without > complicated instruments.Lex, Barbara. \\"Voodoo Death: New Thoughts on an Old > Explanation\\" pp. 818‚Äì823. However, there are those who contest the theories involving psychologically- induced body failure. David Lester, PhD, in 1972, contends that Cannon's evidence, particularly the evidence concerning animals, is anecdotal and irrelevant, and instead sets forth the concept of \\"death by suggestion\\", and supports \\"giving up-given up\\" complex set forth by George L. Engel, thus attributing the cause of death entirely to the psychological state of the individual in question rather than a psychological‚Äìphysiological connection adduced by Cannon.Lester, David. \\"Voodoo Death: Some New Thoughts on an Old Phenomenon.\\" pp. 386‚Äì390. Going even further, Harry D. Eastwell, MD in his 1982 article, \\"Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia\\", rejects entirely the concept of \\"Voodoo death\\", stating that the deaths in cases reported by Cannon et al. were more likely due to dehydration rather than to any psychological response.Eastwell, Harry D. \\"Voodoo Death and the Mechanism for Dispatch of the Dying in East Arnhem, Australia.\\" pp. 5‚Äì18. Influence of this theory on modern science=Fight or flight= Deeply related to these cases of sudden death is what Cannon termed the \\"fight-or-flight response\\", what has been classified as a \\"neurophysiological-behavioral\\" response pattern. \\"Fight or flight\\" is a phrase used to describe the instinctual and physiological responses to strong emotion within animals as well as humans. Cannon associates the two emotions of rage and fear because of the similar effects the emotions will have upon the mind and body‚Äîrage will encourage the response to \\"fight\\", while fear will encourage \\"flight\\". The mind, when faced with one or both of these emotions in response to a perceived threat, will emit adrenaline, and heart rate will increase; however, sometimes the system is overwhelmed by the responses, and collapse ensues as brought about by the workings of stress hormones. In the case of voodoo death, the \\"flight\\" response overpowers the system, but there is little to no possibility for action in the mind of the individual suffering from the perceived threat‚Äîconsidering the state of aboriginal tribes, the victims believe themselves to be suffering from a curse in which they are condemned to die, and so they believe themselves to be unable to act to save themselves.Gomez, E.A. \\"Voodoo and sudden death: the effects of expectations on health.\\" pp. 75‚Äì91. =New fields= Cannon's theory concerning voodoo death opened research into various fields of psychological studies; since the publication of Cannon's work, scientists have discovered many disorders and the like related to psychosomatic responses to situations. Because of Cannon's postulation that the mind could bring about death, scientists have become open to the idea of the mind working on the body in a greater number of ways, leading to the development of psychosomatic medicine.Lane, R.D., Waldstein, S.R., Chesney, M.A, et al. \\"The Rebirth of Neuroscience in Psychosomatic Medicine, Part I: Historical Context, Methods, and Relevant Basic Science.\\" pp. 117‚Äì134. The advent of theories concerning voodoo death within the scientific field has also led to the development of a branch of psychology termed psychophysiology. Notable cases Though cases within aboriginal societies are the most commonly cited when researchers such as Cannon set forth examples, similar cases of psychosomatic death have also been reported in other cultures. In his 1964 article, James L. Mathis, MD, describes a case of a previously healthy man who died from asthmatic attacks when his mother \\"cursed\\" him for going against her wishes. Mathis proposes that \\"fatal psychosomatic conditions\\" were the cause of this man's death, and thus a form of voodoo death.Mathis, James L. \\"Sophisticated Version of Voodoo Death.\\" pp. 104‚Äì107. Another scientist‚ÄîClifton K. Meador, MD‚Äîin 1992 discussed the case of a man diagnosed with cancer who, along with his physicians and family, believed he was dying of cancer. In the autopsy after his death, however, the doctors discovered that his cancer was not at all the cause of his death. Meador deduces that the man's belief in his imminent death was the cause of his death itself.

It was directed by Kim Manners and written by series creator Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. The installment explores the series' overarching mythology and is the conclusion of a two-part episode revolving around the final revelation of what really happened to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) sister, Samantha. Originally aired by the Fox network on February 13, 2000, \\"Closure\\" received a Nielsen rating of 9.1 and was seen by 15.35 million viewers. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics; many felt that the final reveal was emotional and powerful, although some were unhappy with the resolution. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, after Mulder is forced to accept that his mother's death was by her own hand, he is led by a man whose son disappeared years earlier to another truth: that his sister, Samantha, was among the souls taken by ‚Äòwalk- ins‚Äô, saving the souls of children doomed to live unhappy lives. \\"Closure\\" was a story milestone for the series, finally revealing Samantha's fate; this story-arc had driven a large part of the series' earlier episodes. The episode was written as a continuation to the previous episode, \\"Sein und Zeit,\\" but branched off into different territory. Although a majority of the episode was filmed on a soundstage, several scenes were shot on location, such as the scenes at the former Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California. Several of the sequences, specifically those featuring the souls of dead children, required elaborate filming techniques. The episode has been analyzed due to its themes of belief and hope.  Plot =Background= For the first five seasons of the series, FBI federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) sought to gain understanding about the disappearance of Mulder's sister, Samantha, who was abducted when Mulder was 12 years old.Kowalski (2009), pp. 243‚Äì246. In the previous episode, \\"Sein und Zeit\\", Mulder and Scully tracked down a serial killer who targeted children. While investigating the case, Mulder began to get emotionally involved, due to the similarities with his sister's disappearance.Shapiro (2000), pp. 119‚Äì128 = Events = Mulder and Scully aid the Sacramento Police in the investigation of a brutal murder committed by Truelove, the owner of the Santa Village. As the remains of more children are discovered, he admits killing twenty-four children, but denies murdering Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in the previous episode. Mulder is approached by psychic Harold Piller, who tells Mulder that he has helped law enforcement across the world, and has proved in various cases that children had been taken by \\"walk-ins\\", beings composed of starlight. Piller believes that walk-ins save children who suffer terrible fates. Scully becomes worried about Piller's influence over Mulder. The agents return to Washington, D.C., where Mulder keeps searching for evidence in the case. Meanwhile, Piller gets another vision of Samantha, leading Mulder to April Air Force Base. Scully finds evidence that Samantha's disappearance is linked to The Smoking Man (William B. Davis); when she returns to her apartment, she finds him waiting for her. He tells her that he had called off the search for Mulder's sister when she vanished because he knew she was dead. When Mulder returns to April Air Force Base, he uncovers proof that Samantha lived with the Smoking Man along with his son, Jeffrey Spender, and that she was forced to undergo painful tests. Scully finds a 1979 police report of a girl matching Samantha's description, and learns that she was taken to a hospital emergency room. She and Mulder find the nurse who treated her, and the nurse describes how Samantha disappeared the same way as Amber, without a trace. Mulder later walks through the forest and receives a vision of Samantha along with the spirits of other children. Upon telling Scully and Piller of his vision, Piller reacts badly upon hearing that his son is dead, while Mulder accepts that his sister is dead and in a better place. When Scully comforts Mulder and asks if he is all right, he responds with a choked \\"I'm fine. I'm free.\\"Shapiro (2000), pp. 130‚Äì139.  Production =Writing= right \\"Closure,\\" written by series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz, brought an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. While the idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members, many realized that the time had come for the show to answer one of its biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, \\"I think [series star, David Duchovny] grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. [...] I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play [that part].'\\" Paul Rabwin noted that, \\"It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away.\\"Shapiro (2000), p. 139. \\"Closure\\" continued where the previous episode, \\"Sein und Zeit\\", left off but branched off into different territory. Carter later explained that, \\"emotionally, it was heavy stuff for everybody, but necessarily so. These episodes involved two very personal cases, the search for a serial killer [in 'Sein und Zeit'] and the search for Mulder's sister [in 'Closure'].\\" Marc Shapiro, in his book All Things: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 6 noted that, in addition to bringing an end to the Samantha story arc, the episode was \\"very much a [Smoking Man] episode\\" in that it explored his involvement in Samantha's abduction and revealed to the audience that he was seriously ill. The episode's tagline was changed from the usual \\"The Truth is Out There\\" to \\"Believe to Understand\\". =Filming= Manners argued that \\"Closure\\" was one of the first episodes in which the production staff was able to \\"shoot in Los Angeles with the sun out\\". Previous to this episode, the show's production staff was \\"struggling with the fact that we weren't in Vancouver anymore and that our show had suddenly become very bright and cheery\\". To amend this, Bill Roe, director of photography, used tree branches and c-stands to block out the sunlight. The first scene with the walk-ins rising up from their grave, shot at Griffith Park above the playground, was \\"tricky,\\" according to director Kim Manners, as he felt uncomfortable telling the children to rise out of \\"graves\\", feeling it could psychologically hurt them; instead, he had the crew call the holes in the ground \\"forts.\\" The scenes taking place at April Air Force Base were shot in San Bernardino, California, at a closed airfield, the former Norton Air Force Base. On the airbase was a large, derelict complex of over 400 buildings (many of them houses) that had been constructed and used by the United States military. According to Manners, the entire area was an \\"eerie ... ghost town\\", as many of the houses were still full of old, abandoned furniture. Originally, the producers wanted the name of the fictitious air force base to be \\"March Air Force Base\\". However, the presence of a real air reserve base with the same name located less than 10 miles away in Riverside, California, necessitated a change to \\"April Air Force Base\\". The scene at the restaurant was shot at the Carriage Inn on Sepulveda Boulevard. During filming, David Duchovny decided to act out the reunion scene in a manner contrary to what the script called for. Manners later said, \\"In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [‚Ä¶] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress‚Äîthere was a beatific smile on his face that was absolutely astounding.\\" Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode.Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 177. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. The scenes were laborious and took \\"many passes\\" to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made slightly transparent. These scenes were actually shot in daylight, and a specialized \\"day for night\\" photography (in which the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided) was used to make the finished scene look as if it had been filmed at night. The scenes were shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of the show's normal filming speed. Rebecca Toolan traveled to Los Angeles from Vancouver specifically for this episode and \\"Sein Und Zeit\\". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff filmed Toolan and superimposed the image over a shot of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video that Scully watches, with the director-turned-actor later noting, \\"I only act when you can't actually see my face\\". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig used in this scene‚Äîwhich had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that \\"this is [not] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [the show's make-up director] won an Emmy for.\\" Composer Mark Snow described his score as possessing a \\"sense of biblical fervor and religiosity‚Äîan elegy‚Äîa feeling about it that was so poignant and touching to me.\\"Fraga (2011), p. 124 \\"My Weakness\\", a song by Moby from his 1999 album Play, is used in this episode, first when the FBI discover the mass grave and finally at the end when Mulder encounters his sister's spirit. Carter never told Snow about the decision to use someone else's music, although Snow has since said that his reaction to the use of the song was very positive and that the song was a \\"perfect\\" fit. Another Moby song, \\"The Sky is Broken\\" also from Play, would be featured in the later seventh-season episode \\"all things\\".Anderson, 2:07‚Äì2:35. Themes According to Amy M. Donaldson in her book We Want to Believe: Faith and Gospel in The X-Files, Mulder's opening monologue may be an example of \\"Mulder now being more receptive to the possibility of God's intervention\\".Donaldson (2011), pp. 44‚Äì45. Throughout much of the series, Mulder has shown a disdain for religion. However, in \\"Closure\\", Donaldson points out that \\"Mulder's belief in God, as always, revolves around his beliefs about his sister's fate\\". As such, Mulder expresses hope that those who die in a cruel fashion \\"live on in some other way\\". Furthermore, she argues that because \\"Closure\\" opens with the tagline \\"Believe to understand\\", Mulder must \\"take the leap of faith\\" in order to find enlightenment, and ultimately the truth about his sister. The first half of the episode plays out according to the tagline; Mulder first believes in \\"his desire stated in the opening voiceover\\", and then finds closure.Donaldson (2011), pp. 60‚Äì61. Donaldson also parallels elements in the episode to the plots of other episodes such as the fourth season entry \\"Paper Hearts\\", wherein it is suggested that a serial killer murdered Samantha. In \\"Paper Hearts\\", a father of a victim notes that the uncertainty of his daughter's murder allowed those who were involved to \\"consider the possibilities, both for the best and for the worst\\". However, once it is revealed that his daughter was murdered, all hope was removed. Conversely, Mulder holds onto the possibility that Samantha is alive through much of the series, but when he realizes that she is indeed dead in \\"Closure\\", hope is removed but in its place is found peace. To parallel Mulder's acceptance, Harold Piller refuses to believe his son is dead; as such, he \\"cling[s] to the possibility [because] uncertainty allows him hope.\\"Donaldson (2011), pp. 68‚Äì69.  Reception =Ratings= \\"Closure\\" first aired in the United States on February 13, 2000. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.1, with a 13 share. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the U.S. This means that roughly 9.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 13 percent of households watching television, were watching the episode. It was viewed by 15.35 million viewers in the United States.Shapiro (2000), p. 281. On May 28, 2000, the episode debuted on Sky 1 in the United Kingdom and gathered 0.68 million viewers, making it the eighth most watched program shown on Sky 1 that week, in front of Angel and The Simpsons. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e May 15‚Äì21, 1999\\", listed under Sky 1 The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 ‚Äì Colonization, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist's plans to take over the earth. =Initial reviews= Initial reviews were mixed, with some critics applauding the story's conclusion, and others deriding it. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6‚Äì9 of the X-Files, opined that the episode worked best \\"if some of the previous Samantha-related clues were forgotten\\", such as when the Alien Bounty Hunter told Mulder that she was still alive in \\"End Game\\". Despite this, he wrote that \\"it was only right that Samantha be dead since Mulder's life had always been defined by what he has lost, not what he has found\\". He surmised that the episode was not \\"perfect\\", but that its \\"plusses greatly outweighed any missteps along the way\\". He was also complimentary towards \\"the ethereal quality of the final few moments\\", writing that they \\"lifted this episode up and made it one of the season's most memorable\\".Kessenich (2002), pp. 111‚Äì113. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was pleased with the episode, and wrote, \\"'Closure' is a satisfying episode, one that puts to bed the now-tiresome search for Mulder's sister Samantha.\\" Jeremy Conrad from IGN referred to the episode as \\"excellent\\" and noted that a large portion of The X-Files mythology ended with the resolution of Samantha's abduction, saying, \\"['Closure' is] a final, and concrete, answer to the single thing that was driving Mulder for the entire run of the series. In some ways, when he got that answer a major part of The X-Files story ended.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from CFQ gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote, \\"Instead of a grand, breath-taking, heart-breaking finale that should be the climax of Mulder's search for Samantha, the story expires limply with some nonsense about Samantha being of the starlight children.\\" Bobby Bryant and Tracy Burlison of The State named the episode the \\"Worst Conspiracy\\" episode. The two noted that because \\"a tenet of The X-Files was that Mulder's sister, Samantha, had been (a) kidnapped by aliens or (b) kidnapped by government conspirators\\", the fact that she had actually been turned into a spirit \\"insanely offers a supernatural explanation to a science-fiction mystery\\". = Later reviews = Later reviews, however, have seen \\"Closure\\" in a much more positive light, with many critics praising its ending. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\". He argued that the episode worked due to two scenes: the sequence in which Mulder reads aloud from Samantha's diary, and the final shot of Mulder being reunited with his sister. He wrote that the \\"stark simplicity\\" of the former made it emotionally powerful, and that the latter was \\"a bit sappy, a bit surreal, a bit lovely\\" but nonetheless \\"a beautiful moment\\". Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that the story was \\"silly\\", but that, when paired with the idea that Samantha was truly an innocent victim, successfully becomes a \\"comfort\\". She called it a move that \\"the show must give Mulder, and us, in order to shut down this storyline for good.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it \\"brave\\". The two noted that while some of the sentimentality is pushed too far‚Äîsuch as when Mulder finds his sister's diary speaking to him, or when Mulder talks about all lost souls being stars‚Äîthe \\"critical moment\\" featuring Mulder reuniting with his sister's spirit is \\"extraordinarily moving\\".Shearman and Pearson (2009), pp. 216‚Äî217 FootnotesBibliography    External links  \\"Closure\\" at TV.com 2000 American television episodes Television episodes set in California Television episodes set in Connecticut The X-Files (season 7) episodes Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

The Archdiocese is the oldest ecclesiastical territory in Malaysia, with a long history slowly rising along with the Catholic population all the way from a prefecture to an Archdiocese with 2 suffragans, the Diocese of Keningau and the Diocese of Sandakan. Its Cathedral archepiscopal see is Sacred Heart Cathedral, Kota Kinabalu.  History  Originally erected on 4 September 1855 as the Apostolic prefecture of Labuan and Borneo, created on territory split off from the then Apostolic Vicariate of Batavia (Java) (including the neighbouring Dutch East Indies). On 5 February 1927 it was renamed the Apostolic Prefecture of Northern Borneo, and lost territory to form the Apostolic Prefecture of Sarawak. On 14 February 1952 the prefecture was promoted to Apostolic Vicariate of Jesselton, hence entitled to a titular bishop. On 22 March 1962 its name was changed once more to the Apostolic Vicariate of Kota Kinabalu, after its see. On 31 May 1976 the vicariate was elevated to a full Diocese of Kota Kinabalu, suffragan in the ecclesiastical province of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Kuching. The diocese lost territories twice, to create its present suffragans : * on 17 December 1992 the diocese the Diocese of Keningau with the appointment of the Rt. Rev. Datuk Cornelius Piong. * on 16 July 2007 the Diocese of Sandakan with the appointment of the Rt. Rev. Datuk Julius Dusin Gitom. On 23 May 2008, the diocese was elevated to Metropolitan Archdiocese, whose ecclesiastical province comprises the above suffragan dioceses, both formerly part of the original territory of the diocese of Kota Kinabalu: the Diocese of Keningau and the Diocese of Sandakan.

T. Waller to traverse the Philippine island of Samar from Lanang (now Llorente, Eastern Samar) to Basey, Samar, a distance of some . Waller had proposed the expedition in October 1901 to Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith, commander of the military district, as a prelude to the establishment of outposts stretching across the island and thereby stop the flow of supplies to rebels in the north and to isolate rebels in the south. Smith was receptive because he thought that the march might identify the best route for a telegraph line to connect Samar's east and west coasts. The expedition proved disastrous due to the unexpected harsh conditions as well as a mutiny of many of the Filipino porters. Ten Marines died during the attempt and eleven Filipinos were subsequently executed for their role in the mutiny.  Background  General Jacob H. Smith's infamous order \\"Kill Everyone Over Ten\\" was the caption in the New York Journal cartoon on May 5, 1902. The Old Glory draped an American shield on which a vulture replaced the bald eagle. The caption at the bottom proclaims, \\"Criminals Because They Were Born Ten Years Before We Took the Philippines\\" For a period of some two years following the cessation of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, various local groups challenged the occupying army of the United States. The island of Samar had for some time been a source of opposition to American rule. On September 28, 1901, 36 soldiers of U.S. Company C, Ninth Infantry, stationed at Balangiga, were killed in a surprise attack by the insurrectos while many were in the mess hall eating breakfast. Another eight later died of their injuries, and twenty- two were wounded; only four escaped unharmed. It was this event, known as the Balangiga massacre, that provoked General Smith to call for reinforcements, which brought the U.S. Marines into action on Samar. Soon after the Balangiga incident, Captain Edwin Victor Bookmiller, the commander in Basey, sailed with Company G, 9th Infantry Regiment for Balangiga aboard a commandeered coastal steamer, the USS Pittsburgh. Finding the town abandoned, they buried the American dead and set fire to the town. The Balangiga incident provoked shock in the US public, with newspapers equating the massacre to George Armstrong Custer's last stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Major General Adna R. Chaffee, military governor of the Philippines, received orders from US President Theodore Roosevelt to pacify Samar. To this end, Chaffee appointed Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith to Samar to accomplish the task. General Smith instructed Major Littleton Waller, commanding officer of a battalion of 315 US Marines assigned to bolster his forces in Samar, regarding the conduct of pacification: As a consequence of this order, Smith became known as \\"Howling Wilderness Smith\\". He further ordered Waller to have all persons killed who were capable of bearing arms and in actual hostilities against the United States. When queried by Waller regarding the age limit of these persons, Smith replied that the limit was ten years of age. However, it was known that Smith earned his sobriquet, \\"Hell-Roaring Jake\\" not due to his violence in war, but because of his penchant for making outrageous oaths and the extravagance of his language. Waller therefore, did not execute Smith's orders. Instead, Waller applied the rules of civilized warfare and the rules provided under General Orders No. 100 of 1863 dealing with irregular warfare, which stated that if enemy units gave no quarter and became treacherous upon capture, it was lawful to shoot anyone belonging to that captured unit. Food and trade to Samar were cut off, intended to starve the revolutionaries into submission. Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction to force the inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans from fear and starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General Vicente Lukb√°n, but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. Littleton Waller, in a report, stated that over an eleven-day period his men burned 255 dwellings, shot 13 carabaos and killed 39 civilians. The Judge Advocate General of the Army observed that only the good sense and restraint of the majority of Smith's subordinates prevented a complete reign of terror in Samar. However, the abuses were still sufficient to outrage anti-Imperialist groups in the United States when these became known in March 1902. The exact number of Filipino civilians killed by US troops will never be known, but an encyclopedic book on casualties in warfare puts the figure at 2,000; an exhaustive research made by a British writer in the 1990s put the figure at about 2,500; Filipino historians believe it to be around 50,000. The rate of Samar's population growth slowed as refugees fled from Samar to Leyte,US Senate Committee Hearings \\"Affairs in the Philippine Islands\\" Feb 3, 1902, Vol 3, page 2341 yet still the population of Samar increased by 21,456 during the war. A great loss of life is not supported.Bulletin of the American Historical Collection, April‚ÄìJune 2004, Volume XXXII, page 65 Arrival of the Marines On October 20, 1901, a battalion of Marines, consisting of Major Littleton W. T. Waller (commanding), Captains David Dixon Porter (USMC), Robert H. Dunlap, A. J. Matthews and Hiram I. Bearss, First Lieutenants J. T. Bootes, H. J. A. Day, C. C. Carpenter, A. S. Williams and Harry R. Lay, Second Lieutenants J. P. V. Gridley, Frank Halford and M. C. Rogers, Surgeon G. A. Lung, Assistant Surgeon J. M. Brister, and 300 enlisted men, was detailed at Cavite (Luzon, P.I.) for duty on the island of Samar, the easternmost of the Visayan group, by Rear Admiral Frederick Rodgers, U.S. Navy, Senior Squadron Commander of the Asiatic Squadron. Although the Marines were placed under the command of Brigadier General Smith, to reinforce and cooperate with the U. S. Army troops on Samar, it was also contemplated that Major Waller's movements should be supported, as far as possible, by a vessel of the fleet, to which he should make reports from time to time, and through which supplies for his battalion were to be furnished. USS New York (ACR-2) as she appeared around the time of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War The battalion, composed of Companies C, D and H, First Regiment, and Company F, Second Regiment, equipped in heavy marching order, embarked on the Flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the armored cruiser USS New York at Cavite, October 22, 1901. The battalion arrived at Catbalogan, Samar, on October 24, and the men and supplies were transferred to the USS Zafiro. Preceded by the USS Frolic, carrying Rear Admiral Rodgers and staff and Brigadier General Smith and his aides, the Zafiro proceeded through the straits between Samar and Leyte to Tacloban, Leyte, and then to Basey, Samar, where Major Waller disembarked his headquarters and two companies and relieved some units of the Ninth Infantry. The remainder of the battalion took aboard a 3-inch landing gun along with a 6 millimeter M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun and proceeded to Balangiga, on the south coast of Samar, where Captain David D. Porter was left in command with 159 men, relieving the 17th U. S. Infantry, with instructions to begin operations as soon as possible. Major Waller then returned to Basey. Marine operations on Samar The area assigned to the Marines embraced the entire southern part of Samar. Active operations were immediately begun, both at Basey and Balangiga; small expeditions were sent out almost daily to clear the country of guerrillas under the command of General Vicente Lukb√°n, who usually operated in small, roving bands. Recently offered amnesty in exchange for his surrender by U.S. General Arthur MacArthur, Jr., Lukb√°n had turned it down and swore to fight to the end. The situation in the vicinity was very tense because of the Balangiga massacre and other recent happenings; hence the measures prescribed for crushing the insurrection were somewhat retaliatory. Littleton Waller, in a report, stated that over an eleven-day period his men burned 255 dwellings, shot 13 carabaos and killed 39 people.The Balangiga Massacre: Getting Even by Victor Nebrida On November 5, Major Waller took a detachment to the Sohoton River and drove the guerrillas from their trenches there; two Marines were killed. A number of small expeditions were sent up the Cadacan River; several of these parties were fired on, but the skirmishes were slight. In an engagement, November 8, at Iba, several insurgents were killed and captured. An expedition under Captain Porter, sent out to scout in the vicinity of Balangiga, killed one insurgent and captured seven, and found many relics of the massacred men of the Ninth Infantry. As a result of the continual harassing by the Marines along the southern coast of Samar, General Lukb√°n and his insurgents fell back from that region and occupied their fortified defenses on the Sohoton cliffs, along the Sohoton River. About the middle of November three columns of Marines were sent into the Sohoton region to attack this stronghold, which had been reported by scouts and others to be practically impregnable. Two of the columns, under the command of Captains Porter and Bearss, marched on shore, while the third column, commanded by Major Waller, went up the river in boats. The plan of attack was for the three columns to unite on November 16 at the enemy's stronghold and make a combined assault. On November 17, the shore column struck the enemy's trail and soon came upon a number of bamboo guns. One of these guns, emplaced to command the trail, had the fuse burning. Acting corporal Harry Glenn rushed forward and pulled out the fuse. The attack of the Marines was a complete surprise, and the enemy was routed. After driving the insurgents from their positions the Marines crossed the river and assaulted the cliff defenses. In order to reach the enemy's position, the Marines had to climb the cliffs, which rose sheer from the river to the height of about 200 feet and were honeycombed with caves, to which access was had by means of bamboo ladders, and also by narrow ledges with bamboo hand rails. Tons of rocks were suspended in cages held in position by vine cables (known as bejuco), in readiness to be precipitated upon people and boats below. The guerrillas were unable to spring their trap, however, because of heavy covering fire provided by Medal of Honor recipient Gunnery Sergeant John H. Quick on the Colt machine gun.Boot, Max, \\"The Savage Wars of Peace\\", p. 121 The Marines scaled the 200 foot cliffs and with their Krag-Jorgensen rifles and .45 Caliber pistols, drove the insurgents from their positions and destroyed their camps. Major Waller's detachment, coming up the river in boats, did not arrive in time for the attack, which fact probably saved it from disaster; instant destruction would have undoubtedly been the fate of the boats had they undertaken the ascent of the river before the shore column had dislodged the insurgents. Further pursuit of the enemy at this time was abandoned because the rations were exhausted and the men were in bad shape. The volcanic stone had cut the men's shoes to pieces, many of them were barefooted, and all had bad feet. The men had overcome incredible difficulties and dangers in their heroic march. The positions which they had destroyed must have taken several years to prepare. Reports from old prisoners said they had been there years working on the defenses. No white troops had ever penetrated to these positions, and they were held as a final rallying point. The insurrectos of Samar had spent years of labor on the defenses, and considered the cliff fortifications impregnable. No Marines were killed in the attack, which resulted in the deaths of around 30 insurgents and the capture of General Lukb√°n and his lieutenants. Two of the Marine officers involved in the action, Captains Porter and Bearss, would both later receive the Medal of Honor for their conduct. The March Smith's desire that the Marines make the march from Basey across the island of Samar to Hernani, for the purpose of selecting a route for a telegraph wire to connect the east and west coasts. General Smith also asked Major Waller to run wires from Basey to Balangiga, and left to the Major's discretion the point of departure from the east coast, either from Hernani or Lanang. On December 8, two columns left Basey for Balangiga, one, under command of Major Waller, proceeding along the shore line, and the other, under Captain Bearss, marching about two miles inland. Stores were sent by the cutter which was kept abreast of the beach column. Although the Marines did not encounter any organized resistance, the obstacles of nature which they encountered proved far more deadly than the natives and their many contrivances. Major Waller decided to start his ill-fated march across Samar from Lanang, work up the Lanang River as far as possible, then march to the vicinity of the Sohoton cliffs, which his Marines had recently captured. On arriving at Lanang, Major Waller was urged not to make the attempt, however, he says in his report: \\"Remembering the general's (General Smith's) several talks on the subject and his evident desire to know the terrain and run wires across, coupled with my own desire for some further knowledge of the people and the nature of this heretofore impenetrable country, I decided to make the trial with 50 men and the necessary carriers.\\" The detachment started from Lanang on the morning of December 28, 1901, and was composed of the following personnel: Major Littleton W. T. Waller, Captain David D. Porter, Captain Hirim I. Bearss, First Lieutenant A. S. Williams, Second Lieutenant A. C. DeW. Lyles, U. S. Army (Aide sent by General Smith), Second Lieutenant Frank Halford, 50 enlisted U. S. Marines, 2 native scouts and 33 native carriers.The start was made in boats but when Lagitao was reached, it was found impossible to use them further on account of the numerous rapids; the remainder of the distance was made on foot. One of the most trying features of the march was the necessity for crossing and recrossing the swollen river many times, which kept the men's clothing wet continually. On December 30, it was necessary to issue reduced rations, and the next day the rations had to be cut down to one-half and the number of meals per day to two. The march was continued across the rugged mountains on January 1 and 2. On January 3, the rapidly vanishing food supply and the serious condition of the troops made the situation very critical. The men were becoming ill, their clothing were in rags, their feet were swollen and bleeding, and the trail was lost. After a conference with his officers, Major Waller decided to take Lieutenant Halford and thirteen of the men who were in the best condition and push forward as rapidly as possible and send back a relief party for the main column, which was placed under the command of Captain Porter with instructions to go slowly and follow Major Waller's trail. The advance column was afterwards joined by Captain Bearss and a corporal, the former carrying a message from Captain Porter. A message was sent back to Captain Porter, directing him to follow the advanced column to a clearing which had been found where there was a quantity of sweet potatoes, bananas and young cocoanut palms, and to rest there until his men were in condition to continue the march. This message did not reach Porter, however, as the native by whom it was sent returned two days later, stating that there were so many insurrectos about that he was afraid. On January 4, Major Waller's party rushed a shack and captured five natives, among whom were a man and a boy who stated that they knew the way to Basey. After crossing the Sohoton River, the famous Spanish trail leading from the Sohoton caves to the Suribao River was discovered and followed. The party crossed the Loog River and proceeded through the valley to Banglay, on the Cadacan River. Near this point the party came upon the camp which Captain Dunlap had established to await their arrival. Major Waller's party went aboard Captain Dunlap's cutter and started for Basey, where they arrived on January 6, 1902. Concerning the condition of the men of his party, Major Waller later said: > The men, realizing that all was over and that they were safe and once more > near home, gave up. Some quietly wept; others laughed hysterically. ... Most > of them had no shoes. Cut, torn, bruised and dilapidated, they had marched > without murmur for twenty-nine days. Immediately after the arrival of the detachment at Basey, a relief party was sent back to locate Captain Porter's party. The following day Major Waller joined this relief party, and remained out nine days searching for signs of Captain Porter without success. The floods were terrific and several of the former camp sites were many feet under water. The members of the relief party began to break down, due to the many hardships and the lack of food, and the party had to return to Basey. Upon returning to Basey, Major Waller was taken sick with fever. Meanwhile, Captain Porter had decided to retrace the trail to Lanang and ask for a relief party to be sent out for his men, the most of whom were unable to march. He chose seven Marines who were in the best condition and with six natives, set out January 3 for Lanang. He left Lieutenant Williams in charge of the remainder of the detachment with orders to follow as the condition of the men would permit. Lieutenant Porter's return to Lanang was made under difficulties many times greater than those encountered during the march to the interior. Food was almost totally lacking, and heavy rains filled the streams making it almost impossible to follow down their banks or cross them as was so often necessary. On January 11, Captain Porter reached Lanang and reported the situation to Captain Pickering, the Army Commander at that place. A relief expedition was organized to go for the remainder of the Marines but it was unable to start for several days because of the swollen Lanang River. Without food, yet realizing that starvation was certain if they remained in camp, Lieutenant Williams and his men slowly followed Captain Porter's trail, leaving men behind one by one to die beside the trail when it was no longer possible for them to continue. One man went insane; the native carriers became mutinous and some of them attacked and wounded Lieutenant Williams with bolos. Williams later testified that their mutinous behavior left the Marines in daily fear of their lives; the porters were hiding food and supplies from the Marines and keeping themselves nourished from the jungle while the Marines starved. The 11 porters were placed under arrest when Williams' command reached Lanang. After an investigation, Waller ordered the summary execution, without trial, of the eleven Filipino porters for treason, theft, disobedience and general mutiny. Ten were shot in groups of three (one had been gunned down in the water attempting to escape) The bodies were left in the square, as an example, until one evening, under cover of darkness, some townspeople carried them off for a Christian burial. Waller later reported the executions to General Smith, as he had reported every other event. \\"It became necessary to expend eleven prisoners. Ten who were implicated in the attack on Lt. Williams and one who plotted against me.\\" After having left ten marines to die along the trail, Lieutenant Williams was finally met by the relief party on the morning of January 18 and taken back to Lanang. Lieutenant Williams, left in charge of the weakest men of the expedition, undoubtedly had the most trying task of the whole unfortunate affair. The full circumstances of his attempt to extricate these exhausted men from the midst of that wild tropical jungle is one of the most tragic yet the most heroic episode in Marine Corps history. The entire march across Samar was about 190 miles. Major Waller's march, including his return with the party searching for Captain Porter, was about 250 miles. Waller's Marine Battalion on Samar was relieved by U.S. Army units on 26 February 1902. He and his Battalion left Samar on 29 February, returning to Cavite on 2 March 1902. For many years, thereafter, officers and men of the United States Marine Corps paid a traditional tribute to the indomitable courage of these marines by rising in their presence with the following words of homage: \\"STAND, GENTLEMEN, HE SERVED ON SAMAR!\\" Aftermath General Smith passed Waller's report of the executions to his superior, General Adna R. Chaffee. Chaffee decided to investigate these executions, despite General J. Franklin Bell purportedly having carried out similar executions on a much larger scale months before with no subsequent investigations. Waller was brought up on charges of murder in ordering the execution of the eleven Filipino porters. A court martial began on March 17, 1902. The court-martial board consisted of 7 Army officers and 6 Marine Corps officers, led by U.S. Army General William H. Bisbee. Major Henry P. Kingsbury, USA, the prosecutor, read the charge and specification. Waller's attorney, Cdr Adolf Marix USN, first argued, unsuccessfully, that the Army had no jurisdiction over him as he was still under Marine Corps command. From the court martial transcript: > \\"The specification does not allege that Major Waller is now detached for > service with the United States Army, nor does it allege that due process > against him for the offence was instituted before he was detached from the > Army. The charge does not, therefore, represent a case within the > jurisdiction of the Army court martial.\\" In other words, Marix said, the > Army did not charge Waller when he was assigned to them, and he is not > assigned to them any longer. > \\"The charges brought against Major Waller were handed to him on March 4, and > constitute the first process against him. This was several days after he was > detached from the Army ... the jurisdiction was therefore voluntarily > surrendered.\\" > \\"The plea is that the defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction of this > court\\", General Bisbee noted. > \\"We want to know whether there is any possible written or other evidence > from the President of the United States placing him on detached duty with > the Army, and thereby placing him within the province of this court.\\" \\"I can have them here tomorrow morning\\", the prosecutor responded, and next day he submitted in evidence a series of telegrams between Admiral Rogers and General Chaffee in which the offer of three hundred Marines for service with the Sixth Brigade is made and accepted. \\"The Marines were serving in Samar by order of the President. The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy knew they were there.\\" Besides, Major R. N. Getty had been assigned to investigate the shootings at Basey, and had so advised Waller before the Marine battalion was detached from Sixth Brigade on 19 February.\\" > Not sufficient, Marix responded. \\"Legal proceedings are defined clearly ... > the accused has a right to be present, the witnesses sworn, and be > represented by counsel. Nothing of the kind happened in this case. An > inspector is not a judicial officer.\\" General Bisbee decided that the court was without jurisdiction in the case, but left open the possibility of reversing himself if instructions were received from the office of the Adjutant General of the Army. On 21 March, the instructions arrived. The Assistant Adjutant General noted that the Commanding General of the Philippine Department (General Arthur MacArthur, Jr) had ordered a preliminary examination of the case, with a view to legal action, before Waller was relieved of duty with the Army. Waller assisted in Major Getty's investigation, and was questioned by him, so he had to know that he was a party to the proceedings. Besides, a \\"brief lapse of jurisdiction\\" cannot mitigate a murder charge. General Bisbee \\"now decides that (the court) has jurisdiction and directs that the case proceed to trial.\\" Waller carefully entered his plea: To the specification - Guilty, except to the words \\"willfully and feloniously and with malice aforethought, murder and\\" - to those words, not guilty. To the charge - Not Guilty Waller did not use Smith's orders \\"I want all persons killed\\" to justify his deed, instead relying on the rules of war and provisions of a Civil War General Order Number 100 that authorized \\"exceeding force\\", much as J. Franklin Bell had successfully done months before. Waller's counsel had rested his defense. The prosecution then decided to call General Smith as a rebuttal witness. On April 7, 1902, in sworn testimony, Smith denied that he had given any special verbal orders to Waller. Waller then produced three officers who corroborated Waller's version of the Smith-Waller conversation, and copies of every written order he had received from Smith, Waller informed the court he had been directed to take no prisoners and to kill every male Filipino over age 10. During the trial, some sensationalist American newspapers, including his hometown newspaper in Philadelphia, nicknamed Waller the \\"Butcher of Samar\\". The court martial board voted 11-2 for acquittal of Waller. Later, the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General dismissed the entire case, agreeing that a Marine Corps officer was not subject to an Army court. As a result of evidence introduced at the Waller trial, General Smith was then court martialed, convicted, admonished, and forced to retire.

He was considered by Penor Rinpoche to be one of the most learned Nyingma scholars alive.Dharma Fellowship, Khenchen Palden Sherab, Contemporary Master Biographies, http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/contemporarymasters/khenchen- palden-sherab.htm Among other highly notable activities, he founded the first nunnery in Deer Park (Sarnath), the Orgyen Samye Chokhor Ling Nunnery.Orgyen Samye Chokhor Ling Nunnery, https://www.padmasambhava.org/orgyen-samye- chokhor-ling-nunnery/ Born in Tibet, Khen Rinpoche escaped the Chinese in 1960 to arrive in India where he joined other monastic leaders to collect and salvage Tibetan buddhist teachings carried by the exile community. He became the Nyingma professor at the Central University of Tibetan Studies, in 1967. As a close student of Dudjom Rinpoche, Khen Rinpoche also taught in France and in the United States. Khen Rinpoche founded Padmasambava Buddhist Center in upstate New York, U.S., which grew to include centers in Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico, India and Russia. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche's seat is Orgyen Samye Chokhor Ling Nunnery in India, which opened in 2003 and was consecrated in 2006. The Yangsi Rinpoche was born in Nepal, and enthroned in India as Palden Yonten Thaye Lodro Choyki Gyaltsen. Life Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche was born in the village of Joephu (), in the Dhoshul () region of Kham, Tibet, near the sacred mountain of Jowo Zegyal (). He entered monastic studies at the age of 6 years at Gochen Monastery, founded by Tsasum Lingpa. His nickname was \\"the Cyclone\\" due to his constant activities.Turtle Hill Sangha web site, http://www.turtlehill.org/cleanup/khen/zkpsr.html At the age of 12, Khen Rinpoche entered Riwoche Monastery in eastern Tibet. Just prior to China's invasion, he completed his shedra (monastic university) education at the Taklung Kagyu monastery of Riwoche (), in the Riwoche region of Kham, where he was being groomed to take over as the khenpo, or abbot, of Gochen Monastery () which his family had administered for generations. Following China's annexation of eastern Tibet, he fled with his family over the Himalayan mountains into India in the winter of 1960. They escaped from capture on three occasions. His sister Ting Ting and another sister died during the journey, as did his mother shortly after arriving in India. Khen Rinpoche's father, Lama Chimed Namgyal Rinpoche, and his brother, Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, survived. After the escape, they lived in Indian refugee camps with others fleeing the Chinese. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche received full ordination three years after escaping. While in exile, Dudjom Rinpoche requested that Khen Rinpoche join a year-long conference, overseen by the 14th Dalai Lama, of the four main Tibetan buddhist schools dedicated to protecting the culture and spiritual heritage of Tibet. Their focus was also recovering sacred texts missing or destroyed in the struggle with China. Khen Rinpoche salvaged thousands of texts and commentaries, and the complete cycle of teachings was recovered. In 1967, the Central University for Tibetan Studies, which resulted from the conference, opened in Sarnath. Khen Rinpoche was for a time the only professor and administrator of the Nyingma Department, teaching up to 13 classes a day in the first years. He taught there for 17 years, writing the text from Mipham Rinpoche on a blackboard. He also taught in the Tibetan department at the Government Sanskrit College in Varanasi. In 1984, he drafted the basis for the commentary, \\"The Radiant Light of the Sun and Moon\\", published by the Central University in 1986. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche first traveled to the U.S. in 1980 with his brother, Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche. In 1981, Khen Rinpoche replaced his brother as Khenpo of Dudjom Rinpoche's Dorje Nyingpo center in Paris, France, due to Khenpo Tsewang's problems with travel documents. In 1984, they followed and attended Dudjom Rinpoche in New York and then California, and taught periodically at Yeshe Nyingpo. In 1985, Khen Rinpoche founded Dharma Samudra, a non-profit publishing organization, and with his brother published 11 volumes on Tsasum Lingpa as the inaugural publication. They were referred to as \\"The Khenpo Brothers\\" by western practitioners. Khen Rinpoche wrote and published numerous texts on Tibetan history, language, poetry, grammar, Buddhist philosophy, practice, logic, as well as text and commentary on tantra. In 1989, Padmasambhava Buddhist Center was founded, and its main retreat center and monastery is Palden Pema Samye Ling, () located in Sidney Center, Delaware County, New York. PBC grew to include retreat centers and monastic institutions in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, Russia, and India. Khen Rinpoche undertook large building projects at the monasteries and centers, and completed the Miracle Stupa at Padma Samye Jetavan in Shravasti. In Tibet, he also began rebuilding Gochen Monastery. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche passed into paranirvana on Saturday, June 19, 2010 at Palden Pema Samye Ling. His body () remained there in post-death meditation () until Wednesday, June 23, 2010. He was cremated on Thursday, June 24, 2010. In this life, he received recognition, honors, and appointments from Dudjom Rinpoche, the 14th Dalai Lama, head of the Nyingma school Penor Rinpoche, and other Tibetan spiritual leaders. Penor Rinpoche stated Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche was the most learned Nyingma scholar presently alive. The Yangsi Rinpoche of Khenchen was located in Nepal, where he was born. In 2019, he was enthroned in India by Terton Namkha Drimed Rinpoche, and given the name Palden Yonten Thaye Lodro Chokyi Gyaltsen. His seat is the Orgyen Samye Chokhor Ling Nunnery in India. Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche held full knowledge in the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana schools, and held transmissions in Nyingma ka-ma and terma lineages. He was particularly well known and respected for his texts and teachings on Dzogchen ().  Publications = English = *Khenchen Palden Sherab. Radiant Light of the Sun and Moon.

Widely distributed in northern temperate regions, it is usually found under birch, mostly in pine forests. The very poisonous death cap can have a similar appearance, especially from above. Taxonomy The species was first described in Elias Magnus Fries's 1863 work Monographia Hymenomycetum Sueciae. The specific epithet aeruginea is derived from the Latin aeruginus, referring to the tarnished color of copper. It is commonly known variously as the \\"tacky green Russula\\", the \\"grass-green Russula\\", or the \\"green Russula\\". Description The cap is flat when young, soon funnel shaped and weakly striped; somewhat sticky and shiny, pale green to light grey-green, more rarely olive green. It is often in diameter. The closely spaced gills are pale cream when young, later becoming light yellow when the spores mature. The stipe is white, occasionally with rust-coloured spots at the base, often rather short with longitudinal furrows. It measures long by thick. The flesh is white, brittle and without scent, with a mild taste. R. aeruginea mushrooms are edible. The spore print is cream-yellow. Spores are spherical to oval with ridges and warts on the surface, and measure 6‚Äì8 by 6‚Äì7 Œºm. Green specimens of the crab brittlegill, Russula xerampelina, can be mistaken for R. aeruginea. They can be readily distinguished in that specimens of R. xerampelina always smell of cooked shellfish, while specimens of R. aeruginea do not have any distinctive odor. Habitat and distribution The fruit bodies of Russula aeruginea grow on the ground in woods, in troops in leaf litter or in grass. It is ectomycorrhizal with birch, but also with found under conifers, particularly pine and spruce. It is widely distributed in northern temperate zones. Fruiting occurs from July to November in Europe, and in later summer to autumn in North America. The fungus is also found in East Africa.

She hires Harvard graduate and former Access Hollywood special correspondent Lizza Monet-Morales. After that, Lizza sets up a workout for Tiffany at a gym in Hollywood and hires someone to make a reel of her most famous moments set up. The guy who makes her reel was supposed to deliver her reel to her the next day so she would have it for her show later that afternoon. He does not end up delivering her reel until right before she goes on stage. She then does her performance and all of the talent scouts wait for her to come out. It takes her too long and they all leave. The episodes ends with her going home. ;Episode Two: \\"Actress vs. Celebrity\\" First aired August 11, 2008 Tiffany needed a manager and Lizza found one. He sets up two auditions with major directors. At the first audition, she meets a woman named Kelly. After Tiffany tells her to stop talking, Kelly goes in and Tiffany has trouble with her script. She did not do well so she went to her next audition. At this audition, she saw Kelly again. In the audition, the director criticized her but she told her she did well. Later that day, the manager then recommended an acting school. She once again, saw Kelly and thinks she is a stalker. After, she does an acting game with a man named Vos and thought he was cute. Shortly after, Kelly told her she did decent. New York got mad and it broke out in an argument. The two had a meeting with the acting coach and both are then kicked out for the day. ;Episode Three: \\"Japanese Commercial Shoot\\" First aired August 18, 2008 New York learns that you have to give a little to get a little when her new manager sets her up with a spec commercial for a Japanese energy drink. New York and her assistant do a little research into their idea of \\"Japanese culture.\\" New York completes the spec commercial after having the director blow up at his assistant for not cutting the wooden board so that when New York hit the object it would \\"chop\\" in half. ;Episode Four: \\"At Home With New York\\" First aired August 25, 2008 New York's assistant is late...again! Slightly perturbed, New York takes a call from her manager regarding an In Touch photo shoot that he set up at her house. The anxiety over the photo shoot is compounded when New York receives the call that her mother is coming out to visit. When New York's mother (aka sister P.) arrives, she terrorizes New York's assistant, and the photo shoot is put in jeopardy by the domineering stage mother. Later, Sister P. demands a meeting with this new Hollywood manager and when Sister P. drags religion into the meeting and insults a prospective movie producer, New York starts to consider whether having her mother around is an asset to her career or a \\"bump in the road\\" on her path to acting stardom. ;Episode Five: \\"And She Sings??\\" First aired September 1, 2008 It's a brand new day for New York but Sister P is still an ominous presence hovering over her career. New York is awakened by a phone call from her manager, who makes New York aware that today she is doing back up vocals for an R&B; group and lessons with a vocal coach, stressing the importance of a celebrity to have cross-over ability. New York's assistant calls in sick, there's a cab ride from hell to the lesson, and New York has to perform weird vocal exercises. Later, Sister P has an altercation with the recording artists who turn out to be Little Jackie, which threatens to destroy New York's cross-over career before it even has a chance to begin. New York is forced to make a decision on the role her mother is plays in her acting career by sending her home. ;Episode Six: \\"Talk Show Appearance\\" First aired September 8, 2008 The past comes back to haunt New York as she starts her day with a phone call in an attempt to salvage a past romantic relationship and the conversation has a seemingly nasty finality when she calls Tailor Made. New York's manager calls with the intent of putting her on the Chelsea Lately show. Anxiety grows, as New York dreads the questions that Chelsea Handler will ask. Later, New York's acting coach drops a bomb on New York, revealing an impending Shakespeare showcase and romance threatens to cloud her priorities as New York and her acting partner attempt to rehearse in an all too romantic setting. Finally, a surprise visit from Tailor Made further tests New York's ability to focus on her acting career and keep it from derailing. ;Episode Seven: \\"Romeo and Juliet...and...\\" First aired September 15, 2008 New York's surprise visitor adds fuel to the fury that is New York, threatening to drag her away from her career path as Tiffany the aspiring actress. After an explosive argument at her house, in front of her new acting partner Vos, New York is put to the test on whether she can muster up the professionalism to deliver a solid performance in the Romeo and Juliet showcase. She now understands the fact that her ex flame, Tailor Made, has burned out. Her relationship with Tailor Made is over, and her relationship with her new acting partner has begun. Also, New York has to make a decision on whether to close another chapter that is the New York of the past or threaten the dream that Tiffany the actress has built. ;Episode Eight: \\"The Finale\\" First aired September 22, 2008 New York has an audition for a film, but must give up reality television if she gets the role. At the same time, Cris Abrego and Mark Cronin offer her a new season of I Love New York. New York auditions for the film role after practicing with Vos and gets the part.

Eleven of these had been ordered from ≈†koda Works before the war to equip the first unit of the s that Austria had ordered. The ships were cancelled shortly after the outbreak of the war, but the guns continued in production.  History  The first gun and its cradle was reported ready for delivery by Skoda on 28 May 1915, but it was not tested until April 1916. Shortly afterwards it was sent to the Italian Front and installed in the train yard of Calceranica al Lago near the shore of Caldonazzo lake, where it fired 122 shots before it was returned to Skoda on 30 May 1916 for refurbishing. It was nicknamed \\"Lange Georg\\" by the troops and the first task assigned was to support the Strafexpedition targeting at the Italian command center in Asiago 34 km away, where Italians believed to be out of range by artillery attacks. The operative position near the town center forced the personnel to activate a siren before shooting in order to open all the surrounding windows to prevent damages by the shock waves. Either \\"Georg\\" or Gun No. 2 was sent to the Romanian Front to assist in the crossing of the Danube in November 1916, but only a few shots were fired before it was withdrawn. Skoda reported in May 1917 that Gun No. 1 had returned from the front, Gun No. 2 had been delivered, Gun No. 3 was complete (it was tested on 18 May 1917), Gun No. 4 was in the final stages of completion while Guns No. 5-11 were in different stages of completion. Gun No. 2 was sent to the Italian Front at the end of August 1917 at Santa Croce, north of Trieste. It was ready to fire on 23 September 1917 against the Italian coastal batteries between Grado and the Isonzo estuary. It fired the first shot over the Gulf of Trieste on 18 October 1917. Italian front, 1917 The fate of the guns is unclear. The Italians captured one as did the French (probably No. 4, which had been delivered shortly before the end of the war) and the Serbs. The former two scrapped theirs, but the Serbs had one during the interwar period. A proper mount for the gun couldn't be devised in a timely manner and its carriage was mounted on a steel platform lined with wood. It had to be traversed with winches. A 100-ton crane was required for assembly. Postwar plans were to mount them on rail carriages, but these came to naught with the breakup of Austria-Hungary.

Early life  William Carlos Ives was born in Compton, Quebec on October 30, 1873. His family moved to the Alberta District in the Northwest Territories shortly after he was born, to ranch near Pincher Creek in 1881. Ives' father George would be one of the original members of the Northwest Mounted Police in 1879. When he reached his teenage years he left home to work his first job as a cowhand. He left the territories to attend McGill University and graduated in 1899 with a Bachelor of Laws. Ives became a lawyer in Montreal shortly after graduating, being called to the bar in 1900, and worked in the city for two years before moving back to Alberta.  Political career  Ives moved to the town of Lethbridge in 1901 and joined a legal firm partnering with established lawyer Charles Conybeare. He soon became interested in provincial politics and joined the Conservatives. Ives ran twice as a candidate for the Alberta provincial Conservative party. He ran for the first time in the Lethbridge electoral district in the 1905 Alberta general election. He was defeated by former Northwest Territories MLA Leverett DeVeber in a hotly contested race. Ives ran for a second time in the Lethbridge City electoral district. He again finished second, this time in a three way race ahead of incumbent Labor MLA Donald McNabb but was defeated by Liberal candidate William Ashbury Buchanan. Ives was unable to expand his popular vote garnering the exact total as his run for office in 1905.  Judicial career  Ives left his practice in Lethbridge moving to Calgary in 1914 after he was appointed to be a judge for the Supreme Court of Alberta. He retired from his judicial career in 1944. Early in his career he became known by the nickname of the \\"Cowboy Judge\\". Ives was known on the bench for his placid demeanor, and his colleagues referred to his poker face. He would rarely interrupt counsel during trial, except the occasional injection of dry humour. Ives judgements were known to be short and to the point, and rarely reserved cases, and was known, and sometimes criticized for the assistance he would provide young and inexperienced lawyers in the court room. Ives presided over the scandalous seduction trial of United Farmers Premier John Brownlee. After the jury verdict came down, Ives threw out the jury decision in favour of the plaintiffs and dismissed the case; the Supreme Court of Canada eventually overturned Ives' decision The trial scandalized the United Farmers government and helped lead to its defeat in the 1935 Alberta general election. Ives would also adjudicate the infamous Powlett and Powlett v. The University of Alberta which a University of Alberta student suffered a breakdown after a brutal hazing ritual. The case was brought forward by Calgary lawyer and the victim's father Horatio Powlett and he sought $200,000 in damages. The case would be complicated as during the proceeding Ives' own son would commit suicide. He would find for the Powlett family and award them $40,000. Ives would also hear R. v. Solloway and R. v. Mills which the stock broker defendants from Ontario which shorted stocks they were selling to people across Canada. Ives would find both defendants guilty on charges of conspiracy, and sentenced them to four months hard labour and fined $275,000.  Personal life  William Ives would marry Millicent May Troull and have two children, Bill and Elizabeth. His daughter Elizabeth would marry the son of prominent Calgarian and Senator Patrick Burns.  Late life  After retiring from the judiciary, Ives remained at the Cochrane Ranch, just outside Calgary. He died in Calgary in 1950.

He was working as a science teacher in Mesa, Arizona in 1985 when he was awarded a Teacher of the Year award. A few months later, the then 28-year-old Lamberton was arrested for child molestation for having an affair with a 14-year-old student and transporting her across state lines. During his twelve-year prison term at the Santa Rita unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex at Tucson, he participated in a creative writing program run by Richard Shelton and became a writer, penning essays for the prison magazine La Roca. After his release on September 25, 2000, he began to publish non-fiction books and articles on natural history and crime and punishment in the Southwest. Lamberton has published four books since 2000 and written hundreds of essays and articles. His first book, Wilderness and Razor Wire: A Naturalist's Observations from Prison, received critical acclaim from the San Francisco Chronicle which felt it was \\"....entirely original: an edgy, ferocious, subtly complex collection of essays...\\". It won the 2002 John Burroughs Medal for nature writing. In 2007, Lamberton was awarded a Soros (the millionaire known for personally funding the education of black university students in Cape Town, South Africa, during apartheid) Justice Fellowship by the Open Society Institute to complete his fourth book, Time of Grace: Thoughts on Nature, Family, and the Politics of Crime and Punishment. Lamberton has published more than 100 science and nature articles in national magazines, as a part of his experience in prison and trying to forget about this period of his life. Lamberton has achieved relative success with his books and is generating interest in literary circles.Song Retrieved on 08 Jan 2018 Bibliography * Wilderness and Razor Wire: A Naturalist's Observations from Prison.

Built in c. 1752 by Jonas Holland, it is one of the town's four surviving colonial- era houses. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Holland‚ÄìTowne House is located on a private road north of the Petersham village center. The privately owned house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a side-gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and fieldstone foundation. The main facade faces south, and is nearly symmetrical, with windows in the outer bays, and the entrance slightly off-center, with simple trim and a four-light transom window above. The interior retains a great deal of original 18th-century materials, with the latest alterations dating to the early 19th century. A barn, probably dating to the turn of the 19th century, stands to the house's west. The house was built c. 1752 by Jonas Holland and is one of only four colonial-era houses in the town. It is made more remarkable because its setting is also relatively unaltered since the early 19th century, with stone walls, agricultural and forest lands, and unpaved lanes. Jonas' sons, Park and Luther Holland, were American Revolutionary War veterans and active participants in the 1786 rural uprising known as Shays' Rebellion, and it is believed that some of the rebels were sheltered here. In 1816 the property was sold out of the Holland family; it was purchased by Dwight Towne in 1877. The house property is the subject of a preservation easement held by Historic New England (formerly known as the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities).

Laid out in 1733 and centered on the town common bounded by Main and Common Streets, it retains most of its 19th-century character, with only a few turn-of-the-20th-century civic buildings adding later character. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Buildings within the district include the Petersham Memorial Library and the Nichewaug Inn. Description and history Land in what is now Petersham was first granted to colonists in 1733, and the town was incorporated in 1754. Its town common was laid out in 1733, along with a series of house lots extending to the north and south, along what is now Main Street (Massachusetts Route 32). It is where the town's first meeting house was built, and it is where all of its town halls have been located. Since 1878, the common has been cared for by a village improvement society, and it has been the subject of a local historic district since 1967. The historic district is basically linear, extending along Main Street between New Salem Road in the south and North Street in the north. Most of its 45 buildings were built before 1850; only a few are from the 20th century, and two of those (the town hall and the Unitarian Church, are from the outside reproductions of 19th-century buildings. Most of the buildings are wood-frame structures one or two stories in height; there is one brick building, built in 1848 as a schoolhouse. Two late additions to the district were designed by architect Edmund Wilson of Stone, Carpenter & Willson: the stone Petersham Memorial Library was built in 1889-91 as a memorial to the town's Civil War soldiers, and the Shingle style Hotel Nichewaug was built in 1899 as accommodations for summer visitors. Most of the other buildings in the district are Greek Revival. In addition to the common, other open space in the district includes the North Common Meadow, now a conservation property of The Trustees of Reservations. Nichewaug Inn Petersham, Massachusetts Nichewaug Inn is a historic hotel in Petersham, Massachusetts. There was an inn on the site as far back as 1850. The current structure was built by James Brooks in 1899 after two earlier inns on the site were destroyed by fire. It was designed by Stone, Carpenter & Willson, who also designed the Petersham Memorial Library and Petersham Center School (1906). The Inn's golf course is now North Common Meadow. Cellist Helen Isabel Moorhouse wrote letters to her lover Alice E. Brown during her stay at the inn in the summer of 1915 and they are now part of the University of Michigan collection. In 1952 it was purchased by the Sisters of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin who expanded it and used it as a parochial high school for two decades, Maria Assumpta Academy. The inn has been mostly empty since the 1980s and has had several owners until being acquired by the town. In 2018, the future of the property was the subject of public hearings. In 2018 the town, which owns the building, was seeking proposals from interested buyers.

History Crafton was one of the first communities established in the San Bernardino Valley area. Lewis Cram and his brothers had been in the business of making chairs at San Bernardino de Sena Estancia (also known as Old San Bernardino), but around 1857, they decided to move upstream along the community aqueduct (called the zanja, Spanish for ditch) in order to gain more milling power from the water flow. Other settlers began to settle the area, planting barley, wheat, grapes, apples and peaches. George H. Crafts, Sr. bought land, known as the Altoona Ranch, in the area then called Eastberne in 1858 for his brother Myron, who arrived in 1861 to find George had already established a bounty of crops. In 1870, Myron H. Crafts planted an acre and a half of navel oranges, and the success of his crop soon convinced others in the area to plant larger plots. The Crafts ranch became popular as a resort; a person who regained his or her health there called it Crafton, and the area has been known by that name since. Soon, Crafton began to rival Old San Bernardino in agricultural production. Myron H. Crafts, said to be intelligent and energetic, had begun to divert too much water from the zanja which carried water from Mill Creek. In court in 1864, Dr. Benjamin Barton of Old San Bernardino claimed exclusive right to all water in Mill Creek, with Crafts to have none. The court took a compromise stance that allowed Crafts to have any water he could divert daily between three o'clock in the afternoon and nine at night.California State University, San Bernardino. etextbooks. George William Beattie. Origin and Early Development of Water Rights in the East San Bernardino Valley November 1951 In 1867, W. W. McCoy filed a claim which would allow him to divert excess seasonal water from Mill Creek to his land in Crafton. His claim was denied at first but allowed later. In 1870, another water suit was filed, this time by Crafts, for the purpose of once more defining his right to water in the zanja. The court decision established that he had the right to four hours of water per day. In 1871, the court decided further that Crafts must divide the stream of water into two flows, one for others and a smaller one for himself, an order which Crafts did not carry out. Crafts bought his neighbor's farms to the east through which the zanja ran, and reasoned that, since he thought of the ditch as a natural stream, which it resembled in places, that he should have half of its water. Other farmers in the area disagreed and brought suit. This case was taken to the California Supreme Court, where Crafts lost. The first Protestant religious service in San Bernardino Valley was held in the Crafts home in 1873. Having accumulated of land by this time, Myron H. Crafts established the Crafton Land and Water Company in 1882, and constructed a reservoir above the subdivision of Crafton: the Crafton Reservoir. The Crafton School District was organized in 1882, and a bond passed in 1887 to erect a schoolhouse first used in 1888. A post office was established in Crafton in 1885, with M.H. Crafts as postmaster. In 1886, the Crafton Water Company was formed by other area residents who bought the reservoir from Crafts and expanded it. Initially, they owned 14% of zanja flow but by 1949 had increased ownership to 53%. In the 1870s and 1880s, a number of Native Americans of the Cahuilla tribe remained living in Crafton, working at agricultural tasks and tending sheep and stock that were owned by white settlers. Myron Crafts constructed a store for trading with the natives in the early 1880s. The building's first floor was the general store; its second floor was used as a Sunday School. Geography Crafton lies on a sloped alluvial plain of the San Bernardino basin. The elevation increases toward the southeast.MSR Maps. USGS The National Map. Redlands, California, United States 7/1/1988 The area is fairly dry and requires irrigation to supply the navel orange groves. The supply of mountain water via Zanja Aqueduct is plentiful.

Community The neighboring city of Redlands considers Mentone and Crafton as being within its sphere of influence; Crafton has no community plan of its own, though it has striven to maintain a rural feel with 50% of its homes hidden amid citrus groves.A Strategic Plan For The General Redlands Plan Update. Report On Redlands Community Vision City of Redlands. June 2006 The maintaining of lots per residence was seen as a Crafton goal, as was the avoidance of its annexation to Redlands. Redlands noted in 2006 that if Crafton continues with their pattern of \\"grove estate\\" homes, the whole area can be annexed once the pattern is established, and that developers will go along with this. The sloping land of Crafton serves as a watershed for Redlands, so the nearby city continues to be concerned with Crafton's water issues. Crafton has been observed by Redlands as having most of its residences on city water but not using city sewer services. Most homes use a septic tank system. Crafton's historic citrus groves are inexpensive to sustain, making the area possibly the last agricultural community in the San Bernardino Valley area. A concern voiced in 2006 was the maintenance of the necessary agricultural infrastructure. Another concern is that increasing traffic through the area will have a deleterious effect on farming efforts.

Its town common was one of the first parts of the town to be laid out, along what was then the one of the Boston Post Roads, connecting Boston to Springfield. The area remained residential and civic in character, with the town's economic center focused on the Post Road (now Main Street) just west of the common. The properties surrounding the common have retained broad lawns and an open character, typical of the 18th and 19th century. The visual focus of the historic district is the First Congregational Church, located at the north end of the common. It was built in 1766, using materials salvaged from the town's first meetinghouse, built on the same site in 1722. West of the church stands the 1830 brick schoolhouse, now housing town offices and the local historical society. On the west side of the common is the town's main firestation, a modern construction, and the much-extended 1797 Sumner House, built for the town's second minister and now converted into a funeral home.

Bradley House, also known as Oakcrest, is a historic mansion at 5 Sadie Hutt Lane in Southborough, Massachusetts. Built in 1913, the massive, stucco house is one of the finest surviving works of architect Charles Adams Platt in Massachusetts. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999, where it is listed at 60 Sears Road. Description and history The J.D.C. Bradley House is located in northern Southborough, at the center of the loop created by Sadie Hutt Lane. It is set at the crest of a rise, which affords views to the west. The house is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a wooden frame and exterior brick walls finished in stucco. It has a large central block long and seven bays wide, with symmetrical flanking wings three bays wide. Each section is topped by a hipped roof; the central block has three gable dormers projecting from the front facade. The interior retains most of its original finishes, and includes a library room in size, sufficient to house 4,000 volumes. The house was built in 1913 for James Donald Cameron Bradley, as a gift for his bride-to-be Helen Sears from her mother, Sarah Choate Sears. The house, intended as a country estate, was designed by Charles Adams Platt, who was then at the pinnacle of his career. It was built not far from the c. 1897 summer house of the Searses, now at 1 Sears Road. It remained in the Bradley family until 1972, when it was sold to the Southborough School for Girls. The school adapted it for its uses, but only occupied it for a few years. In 1984, the estate was sold to developers, who subdivided the land surrounding the house for residential development.

He always had so strong an urge to fuck That he was called Sir Fucker, A fucker, alas! unhappy and sad, And he said, \\"He dies badly and lives worse Who doesn't fuck the one he loves.\\"W. D. Paden and F. F. Paden (2007), Troubadour Poems from the South of France (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer), 238. Tribolet was an obscure troubadour, known only for one song, the obscene Us fotaires que no fo amoros. The song's rubric was read as t'bolet by Giulio Bertoni, who identified its composer as Tremoleta, but Alfred Jeanroy suggested the reading \\"Tribolet\\", which is widely accepted. He also suggested that the composition attributed to him is a parody of a piece now lost.Alfred Jeanroy (1934), La po√©sie lyrique des troubadours (Toulouse: Privat). The song is preserved in one chansonnier (G, folio 128) dating from the final third of the thirteenth century, the same period in which the song may have been written.W. D. Paden and F. F. Paden (2007), Troubadour Poems from the South of France (Cambridge: D. S. Brewer), 238. The phrase \\"the one he loves\\" (le qui ama) found in the ninth and eighteenth verses has caused some confusion, since le seems masculine: \\"the one [man] he loves.\\" On this reading, it appears that the composer is a frustrated homosexual, who has plenty of sex with women but misses sex with the man he desires. It has been argued that an overt expression of homosexuality would have been impossible in a medieval court setting; the poet, however, may mean merely to hint at it.William E. Burgwinkle (1997), Love for Sale: Materialist Readings of the Troubadour Razo Corpus (New York and London: Garland), p. 24. Francesco Carapezza, however, argues that just as celes (\\"any woman\\") is an aberrant form of the usual celas, so le is just an unusual form of feminine la, in which case the poem is a comic exaggeration of heterosexual lust. According to C. H. Grandgent, the masculine form le may indicate influence from Old French, and Fran√ßois Zufferey has catalogued other instances of the normal masculine lo replaced by le in Old Occitan.

Now part of the MWRA backup systems, it was designed to deliver water from the Sudbury Reservoir in Framingham to the Weston Reservoir in Weston. The aqueduct begins at the Sudbury Dam, and passes through the towns of Southborough, Framingham, Wayland, and Weston. In 1990, the route, buildings and bridges of the aqueduct were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Weston Aqueduct Linear District. History The Weston Aqueduct was built early in the 20th century during the third phase of the evolution of the Greater Boston water supply system, now administered by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). During this phase, the other major elements of the water supply included the Sudbury Dam and Reservoir, and the Wachusett Aqueduct and Reservoir. The purpose of the aqueduct and Weston Reservoir were to channel water to the suburbs north of Boston via Spot Pond in Stoneham. The aqueduct was built between 1901 and 1903, under the supervision of the Frederic P. Stearns, the chief engineer of the MWRA predecessor, the Metropolitan Water Board. The buildings that shelter the aqueduct's above-ground elements were designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. The landscaping of the aqueduct's open channel was (along with other elements of the Weston Reservoir) designed by the Olmsted Brothers. The functions of the Weston Aqueduct and Reservoir have been taken over by the Hultman Aqueduct, built in 1941, and the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel, completed in 2003. They continue to be held by the MWRA as emergency-use facilities along with the Chestnut Hill Reservoir and Sudbury Aqueduct. Description The aqueduct is a water channel that runs mostly underground, through a structure that is about high and wide. The cross section is roughly horseshoe-shaped, with a concrete base, side walls lined in brick, and an unlined concrete arch. There are two chambers where water flow through the aqueduct is metered: both are located in Framingham, and consist of a concrete substructure, on top of which stands a small building housing equipment. These are square, made of ashlar granite, with predominantly orange coloring, and pink-gray quoins. There are two siphon sections where the aqueduct cross low spots in the terrain. The western of these crosses the Sudbury River, and consists of a steel pipe in length that is built over the river as an arch mounted on stone abutments ; the eastern one crosses Happy Hollow and under Massachusetts Route 126, and is long. At each end of the siphons stands a control house that is square, styled similarly to the metering chambers. At the Weston end of the aqueduct is a channel chamber, a hip-roofed structure from which the flow into the open channel can be regulated. The open channel is feet long and about wide, and is lined with riprap. The open channel is spanned by the Ash Street Bridge, a concrete arch bridge faced in stone. The Weston Reservoir was carefully designed by the Olmsted Brothers to appear natural; the final element of the aqueduct is the terminal chamber near the reservoir outlet, from which distribution pipes channel the water onward. The building housing the terminal chamber is larger and more elaborate than the other structures, but is similarly styled.

The game is described by the development team as a . The gameplay in Rui wa Tomo o Yobu follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters. The title Rui wa Tomo o Yobu is also a Japanese proverb equivalent to the English proverb \\"birds of a feather flock together\\" when written with the kanji and kana . Gameplay Rui wa Tomo o Yobu's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all five plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay is for the player to enable the viewing of hentai scenes depicting the protagonist, Tomo, and one of the five heroines having sexual intercourse. Plot Rui wa Tomo o Yobu revolves around the feminine Tomo Wakutsu who was brought up by his mother as a girl due to a small mark he has on his body. After his mother's death, he discovers via her will that she emphases Tomo continue to live as a female, and following this, Tomo starts to go through more troubles in his life. Tomo soon discovers that he is linked with five girls who are around his age as a second year high school student. These girls happen to have the same mark he has, and also have been going through hardships in their lives. Tomo and these five girls decide to form a pact to stay together and support each other to solve each of their problems and to bring peace to their lives. Though Tomo initially hides the fact that he is male from the others, the five girls eventually discover his secret. Development Rui wa Tomo o Yobu is Akatsuki Works' second game in less than one year. The project is notable as having a very few people credited for having taken a part in the creation of the game, and none of them had previous worked on Akatsuki Works' first title Boku ga Sadame-kun ni wa Tsubasa o.. The scenario was divided between two writers, Wataru Hino and J≈ç Sh≈´d≈ç. Art direction and character design were done by Hokuto Saeki who was also one of five main artists for BaseSon's 2007 visual novel Koihime Mus≈ç. =Release history= Before Rui wa Tomo o Yobu's initial release, a free game demo became available for download at the visual novel's official website. In the demo, the player is introduced to the main characters in the game that is typical of the gameplay found in a visual novel which includes times during gameplay where the player is given several choices to make in order to further the plot in a specific direction. The full game was first released on June 26, 2008 as a limited edition playable as a DVD on a Microsoft Windows PC; the regular edition followed on July 31, 2008. The limited edition contained an art collection from the game which includes storyboards and rough illustrations. Music The visual novel has two main theme songs, one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme, , is sung, written, and composed by Marika of the Japanese musical group Angel Note. The ending theme, , is sung and written by Riryka, and composed by Shunsuke Shiina, both of whom are also from Angel Note. A vocal CD maxi single containing both theme songs was released as a promotional gift to those who pre-ordered the limited edition version of the visual novel, and was released with that version on June 26, 2008. Reception The limited edition version of Rui wa Tomo o Yobu ranked tenth in terms of national sales of PC games in Japan in June 2008.

This list of birds of Ontario includes all the bird species recorded in the Canadian province of Ontario as determined by the Ontario Bird Records Committee (OBRC). As of July 2020 there were 501 species on this list, 291 of which are known to breed in the province. Ontario has a considerable variety of bird species. One of the factors in this diversity is the size and range of environments in Ontario. Another is the Great Lakes; many birds use the shores as a stopping point during migration. The OBRC Checklist divides the province into the Lowlands, Central, and South review zones and requests documentation of sightings of birds which are rare or accidental in one, two, or all of the zones. Of the 496 species on the list, 168 are noted as rare anywhere in the province and another 108 are rare in one or two of the zones. Eight species have been introduced to North America. One species has been extirpated, one is extinct, and another might be. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that Canadian English spellings are used and the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following codes are used to categorise some species: *(A) Accidental - a species that only occurs in Ontario as a rare vagrant *(B) Breeding - a species that currently breeds or has bred in Ontario *(E) Extinct ‚Äì a recent species that no longer exists *(Ex) Extirpated ‚Äì a species that no longer occurs in Ontario, but populations still exist elsewhere *(I) Introduced - established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention; synonymous with non-native and non-indigenous Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes ducks and most duck- like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The main period of historic interest is the peak period of Spencer's industrial history in the last quarter of the 19th century, although there are a significant number of properties that predate this period. History The town of Spencer was settled in the 1720s and incorporated in 1753. Main Street, now Massachusetts Route 9, was essentially a former Native American trail that served English colonists as a major east-west route since the 17th century. At first strung out along Main Street, the town center grew at the junction of Main with Pleasant and Maple Streets (Massachusetts Route 31), which provided transport to the communities north and south of the village. The town remained economically agricultural until the 19th century, when the Embargo Act of 1807 spurred industrial development. Business engage in the manufacture of textiles, wires, and boots arose in the following years, spurring growth in population, housing, and supporting businesses. Textile manufacturing in particular was concentrated just south of Main Street, resulting in early growth of housing to the east and west. Later in the 19th century, as bootmaking changed from a cottage industry to a centralized one, the center again grew to accommodate workers at boot factories.

The order was used to award persons for exceptional services that resulted in notable and proven utility to religion (Roman Catholicism), to humanity and the state. Knights of the Order of Christ were part of the untitled nobility of the Empire of Brazil. On 22 March 1890, the order was cancelled as national order by the interim government of United States of Brazil. However, since the deposition in 1889 of the last Brazilian monarch, Emperor Pedro II, the order is claimed as a house order, being awarded by the heads of the House of Orleans-Braganza, pretenders to the defunct throne of Brazil. The current Brazilian Imperial Family is split into two branches, Petr√≥polis and Vassouras, and the Grand Mastership of the Order is disputed between those two branches.  Origin  After the Independence of Brazil emperor Dom Pedro I continued his inherent authority as the ‚Äúfount of honors‚Äù transmitted by his father King Dom Jo√£o VI of Portugal. His right extended to conferring titles of nobility and also the three ancient Portuguese orders of chivalry: Order of Christ, Order of Aviz and the Order of Saint James of the Sword. Dom Pedro I became the first Grand Master of the Brazilian branch of the Order of Christ. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, Dom Pedro I stated in a decree that his right originated in: ‚ÄúSovereign Kings my Predecessors, ‚Ä¶ and especially by my August and Sovereign Father D. Jo√£o VI.‚Äù After the death of his father, Dom Pedro I also became the Grand Master of the Portuguese Order of Christ as King Pedro IV of Portugal. Description of the Order of Christ in the Almanak Laemmert, court almanac published in 1889: > Created by King Dom Dinis, in 1316. Preserved as a Brazilian order by the > law of October 20, 1823. Regulated by decree n. 321 of September 9, 1843. > Also decree n. 2853 of December 7, 1861. This order has 12 Grand crosses > (treatment of Excellency), not included in these numbers the members of the > Imperial family and the princes and foreign citizens; Commanders and Knights > are without a set number. The Emperor is the Grand Master; the heir of the > Crown is the Major-Commander.Sauer (1889), p. 94. Reform of 1843 Knights of Christ in Rio de Janeiro during the reign of Dom Pedro I. In 1834 the Portuguese Order of Christ was reformed by the Liberal government of Portugal and Queen Maria II (sister of Emperor Dom Pedro II). The order lost its military prerogatives with the reform and became a national order. As such the Brazilian branch of the Order of Christ was the only branch that maintained its military status. In 1843 the Brazilian branch was also reformed by Emperor Dom Pedro II and became a national order with decree N. 2853. As such the Order of Christ ended its existence as a military order both in Portugal and Brazil; however the order remained highly regarded by the nobility of Brazil and Portugal as a result of its importance to history and the prestige that it provided to knights. Members of all Brazilian orders of knighthood were part of the untitled nobility regardless of grade, depending on the knight's grade they also received military honors, salutes and honorific styles. Admission It was considered relevant and extraordinary services for admittance into all imperial orders after 1861 the following services: * Services provided for the maintenance of the public order and for preservation of the national independence, integrity and dignity. * Services provided during public calamity. * Services provided for the benefit of the parish church (Roman Catholic), roads, waterways and other works or establishments for the public good. Military Funeral of a Knight of Christ in Rio de Janeiro during the reign of Dom Pedro I. Basically all services that resulted in notable and proven utility to religion, to humanity and the state, that were provided during public, ecclesiastical or military functions; be it in science, letters, arts or industry. =Forms of admission= There were two ways to be admitted to the Order of Christ after the reform of 1861, they were: *The Order was given by the Emperor after review by the Minister of Internal affairs for extraordinary services recognized by the Empire. Members of the Imperial administration, such as ministers of state, the Imperial family and high ranking foreigners were excluded from any requirements. *A citizen could file a petition to the Emperor, the individual had to prove extraordinary services; the process was very complex and involved the approval of different authorities, including the state attorney, the provincial president, the Emperor and sometimes the Bishop. =Requirements for admission= If filing a petition, the following requirements had to be completed: * Art 1. Nobody was admitted to the Empire's honorific orders without a request that proved at least 20 years of distinct services. The only exception was for members of the clergy of the Catholic Church, they were admitted with 10 years of service and also members of the military, they had the years of service counted twice for each year required. * Art 2. The request had to be signed by a representative especially authorized and the following documents had to be added to the request: Authentic documents that proved the services provided; criminal record proving that the individual was not involved as a defendant in a criminal procedure; letters from superior authorities with whom the individual had served attesting to the records; other documents necessary to prove 20 years of service. * Art 3. The provincial attorneys had to give their opinion regarding the individual and after it send the recommendation to the provincial president and the president sent the request to the Imperial government. If the individual was a member of the clergy the Church superiors also had to authorize the request. The provincial president and the bishop had to be explicit about their opinion of the individuals entering the order. * Art 4. The person that petitioned for entrance into the order could use his record of service only once, if a new petition was made he could use only the services provided after the first petition. * Art 5. Admission for any applicant if approved was always in the first grade of the order, individuals could not be promoted without proof of 4 extra years of service after admission to the previous grade. =Loss of Knighthood= Membership into the order was given for life, however, members could be expelled from the order if: a member lost his Brazilian citizenship for breaking articles 2, 3 or 7 of the Imperial constitution; if guilty of a criminal offence; if the individual lost his post in the Guarda Nacional as a result of a criminal offence; and if the individual committed a political crime that resulted in the loss of political rights. Grades The decoration of a military knight (front) The Order of Christ was issued in three grades: * Grand Cross, who wore the badge on a sash on the right shoulder, plus the star on the left side of the chest; * Commander, who wore the badge on a necklet; * Knight, who wore the badge on a ribbon on the left side of the chest. The order had a limit of 12 Grand Crosses, not included in this numbers the members of the Brazilian Imperial Family (grand crosses) and the princes and foreign citizens. There was no maximum numbers set for Commanders and Knights. Insignia The insignia were basically the same as the Portuguese Order of the same name, with the addition of a stylized Imperial Crown of Brazil to the badge and a different ribbon to distinguish it from the Portuguese Order. * The badge was entirely different for civil and military knights: the civil knights wore a cross that was a silver gilt and red enamel cross potent formy with decorative chiseled border and with inset white enamel Latin cross. The military knights had a different insignia, this being a gilt, white enameled Maltese Cross with ball-tipped finials, with laurel wreath between the arms. The central disc was on the front a golden rayed disc and on the back a white enameled disc, with a miniature of the above described cross in it; the badge was topped by a gilt imperial crown. * The star of the Order has 22 asymmetrical arms of rays, in gilt for Grand Cross, and in silver for Commander. The central disc was in white enamel, with a miniature of the above described cross in it. The Sacred Heart of Christ was placed at the top of the star. * The ribbon of the Order was red with small blue stripes at each edge.

Although most of its buildings date to the 19th century, the farm has retained the form of a typical 18th-century farm, including a substantial portion of the land granted in 1717 to Freegrace Marble, one of Sutton's earliest colonial settlers. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Freegrace Marble Farm is located in a rural area of northern Sutton, its complex of buildings located at the junction of Burbank and Sibley Roads. The farm covers about , which is divided roughly equally between open land (for meadows and intensive agriculture), and woodlands. Stone walls line many elements of the property, with particularly well-formed ones lining the road near the farmstead. A family cemetery is located near the northern edge of the property; although its oldest readable marker is dated 1786, it is known to include the grave of the farm's founder Freegrace Marble, who died in 1775. The farm complex consists of a 1-1/2 story Cape style plank-framed house, set on the south side of the street junction. Across the street to the north stands a cluster of two barns and a toolshed. The area that is now Sutton was settled by English colonists in the 1710s, the land having been purchased from the Nipmuc Indians in 1704. Freegrace Marble was one of thirty settlers to arrive in the new community in 1717, and settled on a farm of more than . The core of his holding, including his original farmhouse (no longer extant, believed to stand west of the present house), passed to his son Malachi upon his death in 1775. Malachi built the present house, in which he raised twelve children. The core of the farm remained in the hands of Marble descendants until 1895. Its form, with the farm buildings across the road from the house, is a typical 18th-century form, differing from the 19th-century connected farmstead, where the house is connected to the barn via a series of ells.

SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 187-188 also point to the fact that the Oirat spoken in Xinjiang is separate in that it is less influenced by Mongolian proper than other dialects of Oirat spoken in China. In the above article, it was assumed that \\"Qaranusu\\" which is either a county or a city (Mongolian \\"siyen qota\\") is the original Mongolian name of \\"Wusu\\". To some degree, this distribution can be associated with the history of the Torgut tribe, one of the four crucial members of the clan federation \\"D√∂rben Oirat\\".Bl√§sing 2003: 229, Birtalan 2003: 210 Grammar=Phonology= Torgut has the vowel phonemes and SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 399, but we write /o/ and /u/ instead of and in accordance with an observation by BulaŒ≥-a 2005: 27 who nevertheless keeps on writing and . The notation and is more in line with Svantesson et al. 2005: 149, 179 that may be short or long.This analysis follows SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005. Svantesson et al. 2005 would instead claim that there are phonemic and non-phonemic vowels in non-initial syllables. When appearing in the first syllable of a word, these vowels determine the vowel harmony class, e.g. Written Mongolian talbiŒ≥un, Khalkha-Mongolian , but Torgut 'broad'. However, , , and in a non-initial syllable are neutral vowels. /oÀê/, and /eÀê/ never appear in any but the first syllable of a word.SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 405-408 The consonant system consists of the phonemes .SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 408.

As a convention, only one form of a suffix is given, as it is understood that almost all suffixes are subject to vowel harmony. seems to be somewhat peculiar. The case system is standard Oirat which differs from Mongolian in lacking an allative and retaining the old comitative case, that is, it is rather conservative. In contrast to Middle Mongolian and Southern Mongolian and in agreement with Khalkha, the accusative case always has -g, not -i.Birtalan 2003: 217, SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 413 The reflexive-possessive retains -n, thus -aan.Birtalan 2003: 217, SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 414 The pronominal forms are not substantially different from Khalkha. The first person singular pronoun stem is nam- ~ nan-, next to the standard Mongolian first person plural there is also a variant in ma-, namely madan, madnu:s (both nominative), and the third person singular accusative is peculiar in that it is based on the regular stem yy/n- (proximal, distal is tyy/n-), thus inflecting as yyg compared to Written Mongolian , Standard Khalkha .BulaŒ≥-a 2005: 70-72 =Verbal system= The old voluntative -su: ~ -s is retained in Oirat, while the new voluntative -ja (at least in Xinjiang Torgut) rather tends to indicate a plural subject.BulaŒ≥-a 2005: 75 Like in all Oirat varieties, the converb -xla:SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 422 is quite common. As is common to all Oirat dialects except for Alasha, participles and finite verbal suffixes can inflect for first and second person and for number; in case it is present, these inflections follow a modal particle.SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. 2005: 423-424 Else, the formal inventory is what would be expected from a Mongolian variety, though it is not clear to what degree the functions are the same.

With an estimated construction date of 1756, the house was one of Sterling's oldest surviving structures, before it was destroyed by an arsonist in 2007. It was also notable as the birthplace of Mary Sawyer, who alleged she was the subject of the American children's nursery rhyme \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\". The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The Sawyer family, whose descendants still own the property, have had a reproduction of the house built on its site. Description and history The Sawyer Homestead is located in rural eastern Sterling, at the junction of Maple Street and Rugg Road. It is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, four bays wide, with an off-center interior chimney, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The main entrance is in the second bay from the left. A single-story gabled ell extends to the rear. The property included, prior to the rebuilding effort, an early 20th-century Federal Revival outbuilding, and a barn was located across Rugg Road. The barn was also destroyed by an arsonist, in 1979. The original house had a complex evolutionary construction history, dictated by the changing demands of the Sawyer family, who occupied the house for more than 250 years. The traditional historical claim is that the core of the house was built in 1756 by Ezra Sawyer, Jr., who died while serving in the American Revolutionary War. Sawyer's granddaughter Mary is believed to be the girl described in the nursery rhyme \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\\" attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale. Sawyers lived in the house until 1889, and owned it and the surrounding farmland for most of that time as well. The property then stood vacant and deteriorating, but remained the property of a Sawyer family trust. It was destroyed by an arsonist on August 12, 2007. The family then decided to recreate the house, beginning construction in 2008.

Sun Open Storage was advertised as avoiding vendor lock- in. Background Prior to Open Storage, most storage products were based on customized operating systems running on specialist hardware. In many cases, the specialist hardware was based on old generation hardware, because the customized operating systems were behind in support for current processors and system architectures. During the 2000s, the phenomenal growth in processor performance and processor multithreading left these (often single threaded) storage products with a significant internal processing gap versus current industry standard computers. Open Storage is the concept of building storage products on current industry standard hardware using standard operating systems which have a large enough user and support base to be tracking current hardware (processors, threading, memory, controllers, flash, etc.), avoiding the costs of specialist hardware and custom operating systems, and the performance penalty of not being able to use current generation technologies. Sun's Open Storage products were a combination of their server technologies and software, starting with Solaris 10 6/06 (\\"Update 2\\") in June 2006, which included ZFS and the set of protocols to build NAS, SAN, and local storage servers. Core features provided by Solaris included the operating environment, the ZFS file-system, the Network File System (NFS) and SMB protocol interfaces, Solaris Fault Management Architecture, and other core features. Sun produced the 7000 series Storage Appliance range, based on the Open Storage platform with closed source parts added to create a complete integrated storage appliance. Other companies such as Greenplum, Nexenta, Delphix, etc. also used the Sun Open Storage platform to produce storage products/appliances with various specialities. Statements by Sun around their Open Storage products indicated that products based on common hardware and open source Solaris, would remove vendor lock-in for customers. In 2008 Sun estimated that open storage products and related services would gain 12 percent of the storage market by 2011. Storage solutions from other vendors are closed systems, in which all the components must come from the vendor. The move to create storage products based on software personalities, running on standard hardware are also part of a broader move within the system and storage industries. Companies including Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, NetApp and numerous smaller vendors all have been moving towards storage products based upon standard server hardware and customized software. Following the acquisition of Sun by Oracle in 2010, Oracle stopped using the Open Storage branding and stopped selling the Open Storage hardware products (Storage Servers and JBODs) related to it. Oracle continued manufacturing some of these products only for sale as part of the 7000 series, rebranding them \\"Unified Storage\\" instead of \\"OpenStorage\\". However, by this time, many other vendors were selling Open Storage hardware. Open Storage branding continued to be used by some of the other companies with Storage products based on Open Storage (ZFS and open sourced Solaris such as illumos), together with an annual Open Storage Summit, although Oracle has not participated. Technologies At the storage protocol layer, OpenSolaris supported SCSI, iSCSI, iSNS, Fibre Channel, FCoE, InfiniBand, RDMA, Object storage device, and SAS. =Software= * OpenSolaris, or Illumos, or FreeBSD, or Linux using ZFS on Linux * ZFS, NFS, and SMB * NexentaStor, FreeNAS, SmartOS, OmniOS =Hardware platforms= * Sun Fire X4500 * Sun Storage J4500 Array * Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage ReferencesExternal links * Sun Open Storage * OpenSolaris Storage Projects * The Open Storage Revolution (presentation by Jeff Bonwick) Computer storage devices ","title":"Sun Open Storage"},{"id":"18561366","text":"Sir Kenneth Bertram Adam Scott (23 January 1931 - 23 February 2018) was the Deputy Private Secretary to Elizabeth II between 1990 and 1996.

It was the old administrative and territorial division of the Mapuche, Huilliche and the extinct Picunche people. Aillarehue acted as a unit only on special festive, religious, political and especial military occasions. Several aillarehues formed the Butalmapu, the largest military and political organization of the Mapuche.  Etymology  Each Mapuche lof, levo or cav√≠ (lineage) celebrated its religious rituals at a unique rehue or rewe (\\"altar\\"), near the home of a local lonko, Ulmen or cacique, often the word rehue was used with the sense of party or clan (\\"I am from this rehue\\"), in a way similar to the old form of Christian administrative allegiance to parishes. Although aillarehue ment \\"nine altars\\" these confederations did not necessarily conform to this number of rehues. The name of many of these aillarehue confederations have remained in the present toponymy of the southern regions of Chile.  List of known Mapuche Butalmapu, their aillarehues and their known member rehues = Picunmapu = Although it is known the Picunche had many aillarehues in the central zone of Chile, like those of Codegua, Vichuqu√©n and Rapel most of their names are unknown. The following list is reconstructed from the listing of the aillarehues of the Moluche and Huilliche between the Itata River and Reloncav√≠ Sound, due to the work of Ricardo E. Latcham in the 1920s. Five Butalmapu were known to the Spanish at the beginning of the 18th century. Add to them the one in the region between the Itata and Bio Bio Rivers, that existed at the early part of the Conquest of Chile. With this one six are known to have existed. One is thought to have existed among the Picunche to the north of the Itata River, at the beginning of the conquest. It is thought to have extended from the Limari to the Mataquito Rivers.Ricardo E. Latcham, La organizaci√≥n social y las creencias religiosas de los antiguos araucanos, pg. 597-604.] The Picunche of the region of the Maule River valley may have been a separate Butalmapu or an aillarehue allied with the Cauquenes aillarehue and aillarehue of the northern Moluche Butalmapu at the time of the Inca invasion of Chile and at the Battle of the Maule.Their allies south of the Maule were the Cauqui(Cauquenes), Antalli (Andali√©n?), and Pincu(Peguco?).

Since the deposition in 1889 of the last Brazilian monarch, Emperor Pedro II, the order continues as a house order being awarded by the Heads of the House of Orleans-Braganza, pretenders to the defunct throne of Brazil. The current Brazilian Imperial Family is split into two branches Petr√≥polis and Vassouras, and the Grand Mastership of the Order is disputed between those two branches. History Created by a short decree of 16 April 1826, the order was only regularized by Decree No. 228 of 19 October 1842, which would finally establish its degrees, number of holders and establish the design of the insignia. In that time, it was characterized as a strictly personal award of Emperor Pedro I, its grand master, which awarded only one person: his father-in-law Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor. It was Emperor Pedro II who most distributed the order, being, nevertheless, the Brazilian order that had fewer holders. It would be intended for both nationals and foreigners, who, as well as members of the Imperial Family, would not need to take oath or respect the maximum number of members of each degree. Despite what some sources cite, the creator of the project was not Jean-Baptiste Debret, so he himself does not know how to accurately describe the insignia in his Voyage pittoresque. Characteristics Many authors point out the similarities of this with the insignia of the French Order of the Iron Crown =Insignia= Grand cross *Obverse: topped by imperial crown, winged dragon, in reference to the House of Braganza, red sole and out of crown (old), garnished with fruity coffee branches and topped with green ribbon with gold inscription Founder of the Empire of Brazil.

There are discussions as to whether Felisberto Caldeira Brant, the Marquis of Barbacena, would have been honored as a knight or great cross. It is supposed, however, that it is a confusion, for the Marquis of Barbacena was in fact the bearer of the Grand Cross granted to Francis I of Austria, the latter being the first to be awarded. From what can be found in official records, only this holders of the Order are considered: * Alexander III of Russia * Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours * Prince Gaston, Count of Eu * Francis II of the Two Sicilies * Princess Maria di Grazia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies * Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor * Leopold II of Belgium References * Poliano, Lu√≠s Marques.

This shows the inside - where the archer would have stood. An arrowslit at Cit√© de Carcassonne. The wall thickness is reduced to 0.7 m to accommodate the niche and the embrasure widens at an angle of 35¬∞. An arrowslit (often also referred to as an arrow loop, loophole or loop hole, and sometimes a balistraria) is a narrow vertical aperture in a fortification through which an archer can launch arrows or a crossbowman can launch bolts. The interior walls behind an arrow loop are often cut away at an oblique angle so that the archer has a wide field of view and field of fire. Arrow slits come in a remarkable variety. A common and recognizable form is the cross, accommodating the use of both the longbow and the crossbow. The narrow vertical aperture permits the archer large degrees of freedom to vary the elevation and direction of his bowshot, but makes it difficult for attackers to harm the archer since there is only a small target at which to aim. Balistraria, plural balistrariae, from balister, crossbowman balistraria at Merriam-Webster, accessed 1 July 2019 can often be found in the curtain walls of medieval battlements beneath the crenellations. History The invention of the arrowslit is attributed to Archimedes during the siege of Syracuse in 214‚Äì212 BC (although archaeological evidence supports their existence in Egyptian Middle Kingdom forts around 1860 BC). Slits \\"of the height of a man and about a palm's width on the outside\\" allowed defenders to shoot bows and scorpions (an ancient siege engine) from within the city walls.. Although used in late Greek and Roman defences, arrowslits were not present in early Norman castles. They are only reintroduced to military architecture towards the end of the 12th century, with the castles of Dover and Framlingham in England, and Richard the Lionheart's Ch√¢teau Gaillard in France. In these early examples, arrowslits were positioned to protect sections of the castle wall, rather than all sides of the castle. In the 13th century, it became common for arrowslits to be placed all around a castle's defences. The successor of arrowslits after the advent of gunpowder was the loophole for firearms. Design In its simplest form, an arrowslit was a narrow vertical opening; however, the different weapons used by defenders sometimes dictated the form of arrowslits. For example, openings for longbowmen were usually tall and high to allow the user to shoot standing up and make use of the bow, while those for crossbowmen were usually lower down as it was easier for the user to shoot whilst kneeling to support the weight of the weapon. It was common for arrowslits to widen to a triangle at the bottom, called a fishtail, to allow defenders a clearer view of the base of the wall. Immediately behind the slit there was a recess called an embrasure; this allowed a defender to get close to the slit without being too cramped. The width of the slit dictated the field of fire, but the field of vision could be enhanced by the addition of horizontal openings; they allowed defenders to view the target before it entered range. An arrowslit at White Castle, Wales. Usually, the horizontal slits were level, which created a cross shape, but less common was to have the slits off-set (called displaced traverse slots) as demonstrated in the remains of White Castle in Wales. This has been characterised as an advance in design as it provided attackers with a smaller target; however, it has also been suggested that it was to allow the defenders of White Castle to keep attackers in their sights for longer because of the steep moat surrounding the castle. When an embrasure linked to more than one arrowslit (in the case of Dover Castle, defenders from three embrasures can shoot through the same arrowslit) it is called a \\"multiple arrowslit\\". Some arrowslits, such as those at Corfe Castle, had lockers nearby to store spare arrows and bolts; these were usually located on the right hand side of the slit for ease of access and to allow a rapid rate of fire.

They were acquired by Linear Technology, Inc in December 2011, which in turn was acquired by Analog Devices, Inc in 2017. The Dust Networks product team operates in the IoT Networking Platforms group of Analog Devices. Dust Networks works with industry and standards groups such as WirelessHART, IEEE and IETF to help drive the adoption of interoperable wireless sensor networking products. Company history In 1997, Kristofer S. J. Pister, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, conceived of and started the Smart Dust project with DARPA funding. =Smart Dust= The Smart Dust project attempted to demonstrate that a complete sensor/communication system could be made of sensors one cubic millimeter in size. This involved advances in miniaturization, integration, and energy management. The project focus was independent of any particular sensor, and looked at both commercial and military applications including: * Defense- related sensor networks such as battlefield surveillance, treaty monitoring, transportation monitoring, and scud hunting. * Virtual keyboard sensors: by attaching miniature remotes on each fingernail, accelerometers could then sense the orientation and motion of each fingertip, and communicate this data to a computer in a wristwatch. * Inventory control: by placing miniature sensors on each object in the inventory system (product package, carton, pallet, truck warehouse, internet), each component could \\"talk\\" to the next component in the system. This evolved into today's RFID inventory control systems. * Product quality monitoring: temperature and humidity monitoring of perishables such as meat, produce, and dairy. * Impact, vibration and temperature monitoring of consumer electronics, for failure analysis and diagnostic information, e.g. monitoring the vibration of bearings to detect frequency signatures that may indicate imminent failure. The project led to the founding of Dust Networks, to provide commercial applications of the above. =Timeline= * July 2002: Dust Networks founded by Pister, Tod Dykstra, Rob Conant and Brett Warneke * February 2004: Completes $7 million Series A financing from Foundation Capital, Institutional Venture Partners and In-Q-Tel * July 2004: First product delivered - SmartMesh shipping * February 2005: Completes $22 million Series B financing from Crescendo Ventures, Cargill Ventures and prior investors * March 2005: Launches products based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz ISM band * June 2006: Launches SmartMesh-XT wireless sensor networking system optimized for industrial applications * September 2007: WirelessHART standard ratified * October 2007: SmartMesh IA-500 family of WirelessHART standards-based systems announced * July 2008: Launches initiative focused on the use of Internet Protocol (IP) networking in urban infrastructure, building automation, utility metering, and other wireless sensor networking applications * December 2011: Dust Networks is acquired by Linear Technology * 2017: Linear Technology is acquired by Analog Devices Technology Wireless sensor networks attempt to increase transmission reliability and quickly adapt should the transmission fail and automatically route around failed links. This requires embedded networking intelligence that establishes, maintains and utilizes redundant multi-hop routing from source to destination. Dust Networks implements full-mesh networks, sometimes referred to as ‚Äòmesh-to-the-edge‚Äô, which provides redundant routing to the edge of the network. In a full-mesh network every device has the same routing capabilities and is able to ‚Äòdecide‚Äô where it belongs in the routing structure based on what other nodes it can communicate with, its proximity to the network gateway, and its traffic load. This allows for self-forming and self-healing. The multi-chip modules used to drive these networks are divided into 'gateways' and 'motes' (or mote modules). Gateways then tie back into larger networks used to make decisions within large industrial plants (oil refineries, chemical plants, produce facilities, etc.). The company has evolved from using a proprietary protocol called TSMP (Time Synchronized Mesh Protocol), to WirelessHART to launching an Internet Protocol-based initiative, in support of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), focused on the use of IP networking in urban infrastructure, building automation, utility metering, and other wireless sensor networking applications.
