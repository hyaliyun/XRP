It has an apparent magnitude of about 5.5, meaning that it is just barely visible to the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft, this star is located some 310 light years (95 parsecs) away from the Sun. Eta Chamaeleontis has a spectral type of B8V, meaning it is a B-type main sequence star. These types of stars are a few times more massive than the Sun, and have effective temperatures of about 10,000 to 30,000 K. Eta Chamaeleontis is just over 3 times more massive than the Sun and has a temperature of about 12,000 K. Eta Chamaeleontis cluster Eta Chamaeleontis is the brightest and most massive member of the eponymous Eta Chamaeleontis cluster (also known as the Eta Chamaeleontis association or Mamajek 1, pronounced ), a very nearby (316 light years), and young (8 million years old) stellar moving group discovered in 1999. The cluster contains nearly 20 stellar members spread out over a 40-arcminute diameter region of sky, including the neighboring A-type star HD 75505 and the eclipsing binary RS Cha. The eclipsing binary RS Cha is a well-constrained system which enables precise age-dating, which recent results yield an age of 9 million years. All of the low-mass members (including RS Cha) are pre-main sequence, and several of them appear to still be accreting from protoplanetary disks. Although containing only about 20 members, the cluster appears to be the densest stellar cluster within 100 pc (~30 solar masses per cubic parsec).

Ley, who would ultimately become the grandfather of Nutting Hall's first owner (Christian Ley, Sr.), began his family with wife Barbara in what is now Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Among their nine children was son Michael Ley (1739-1824), who built Myerstown's historic Tulpehocken Manor Plantation, where Washington stayed during three visits to Lebanon County between 1777 and 1794.\\"Yesterday, today live together in historic Pine Grove house.\\" Pottsville, Pennsylvania: Pottsville Republican, September 22, 1984, p. 13.

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Senate, retrieved online August 26, 2019. Thirty- two years old at the time that Washington made his final visit to Tulpehocken Manor, Christian Ley was representing Lebanon and Dauphin Counties in the Pennsylvania House during this time. He then relocated to Pine Grove in Schuylkill County, where he became one of that county's prominent businessmen due to his buying and selling of land. It was during this period that Christian Ley contracted with Peter Filbert to erect a new residence for his wife, Anna Catherine Koppenhoffer (1769-1822), and their three children, Christian Jr., John and Catherine.\\"Yesterday, today live together in historic Pine Grove house, Pottsville Republican. Completed by Filbert between 1823 and 1825, that home was occupied by Christian Ley and his family until Ley's death in 1831. It was then sold in 1837 to William Graeff, a tanner who had opened a large general store in Pine Grove. Following Graeff's death in 1873, the home was then inherited by his daughter, Barbara Ann, who had married Bowdoin College graduate James L. Nutting (1818-1880), the owner of a large farm in nearby Brookside, Pennsylvania who went on to become a public and private school teacher and school director in Pine Grove. Barbara Ann (Graeff) Nutting and her husband, who also had interests in the coal and iron industry, had three children, only one of whom (Anne) survived to adulthood. That child, Anne Nutting, then went on to marry Richard Wigton in the backyard at Nutting Hall and, following her father's death in 1880, became the next to inherit the historic home. She and her husband subsequently had three children of their own: Jeanette (born in 1882), Kathryn, Nutting, Elizabeth and Richard (born in 1883).

Note: This includes Saint Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church, which had its beginnings in another church that had been erected across the street from the present-day stone structure located at 312 South Tulpehocken Street, was established by Jacob Gunkle in 1782. The foundation for the \\"new\\" stone church at 312 S. Tulpehocken was then laid in the spring of 1816. Topped by a shingle roof, it featured a tall, white pulpit, which was accessible by a flight of steep, winding stairs. In 1851, the church's congregation added a bell tower; the bell, which was tuned to B-flat, was produced by the Meneeby Bell Foundry in Troy, New York. It lasted 60 years. The church building was then remodeled between 1870 and 1872 to add a basement, replace the existing pulpit and gallery, replace existing windows while enclosing others in stone, raise the ceiling, add two new stairways, and improve the bell tower. A reed organ was added in 1901. The church was then remodeled again between 1914 and 1915 to add a stone chancel at the building's south end, remove the gallery, install new art glass windows, Fresco the walls of the church auditorium, replace the altar, pews, pulpit and lectern, add new carpeting, install a new steam heating system, and erect a new stone bell tower above the building's northeast corner. The existing bell was replaced with a duplicate B-flat-toned bell from the same manufacturer, the Meneeby Bell Foundry, and the church was rededicated on November 21, 1915. The bell tower was then shored up with steel girders in 1926; church leaders also added a new hardwood floor in the Sunday school room that same year, enlarged the primary room, and upgraded the heating system. A decade later, the reed organ was replaced with a pipe organ. Sidewalks, curbs and a stone wall were added to the property's grounds in 1941. The church was then expanded again, beginning with the construction of a one-story addition to the rear of the church in 1955, which extended the building 40 feet on the north side. The sanctuary was then renovated, the pipe organ was rebuilt, and new Sunday school rooms were also added before the existing bell tower was replaced with a new stone bell tower, and the existing parsonage was relocated to the upper lot behind the church.

The success of this special meant that the Thursday night show was to be installed as a permanent fixture in the Nine schedule. The show discusses the weekend's matches so far, showing scores and highlights and interviews players from the sides that have played that round. Before the Nine Network obtained the TV rights to AFL matches, it was a lighter look at the AFL with a panel featuring the likes of Sam Kekovich,Max Walker, Sam Newman, Ted Whitten and Lou Richards. It has had numerous formats over the years, but is currently back to a traditional panel feel. Melbourne sports presenter Tony Jones formerly hosted the Sunday version from 2006 until the end of the 2008 season when he was replaced by James Brayshaw. Mark Bickley and Danny Frawley also left the show at the end of the 2008 season to take up roles in the AFL, being replaced by the recently retired Crawford and Nathan Thompson. In 2010, Brian Taylor and Peter Larkins left the show to make room for Barrett and Brown. In November 2011, Nine announced that Brayshaw would be stepping down as host due to having many commitments commentating footy games, Olympic coverage and Triple M Melbourne's Rush Hour, Simon O'Donnell was announced as his replacement. However, on 28 November 2012, Nine announced that O'Donnell left the network and Craig Hutchison was announced as his replacement for 2013. Lou Richards was part of the Footy on 9 until the end of 2008, when he left due to illness. However, they continue to pay tribute with \\"Lou's Handball\\", a segment where players from opposing teams are pitted against each other in a handball target practice, and \\"Lou's Showcase\\", which is a showcase of prizes given to special guests. There was controversy on the Sunday edition of the Footy on 9 on 12 August 2007, when former North Melbourne Football Club captain Wayne Carey responded to criticisms from Nathan Thompson by mocking Thompson's well- publicised bout with depression. In addition, on returning from a commercial break, he was heard to make references to \\"necking himself\\", to the apparent delight of other members of the Footy on 9 panel. Carey and the Nine Network were quick to issue an apology over the incident, although no mention was officially made of the \\"necking himself\\" comment. In 2009, Brian Taylor made rare appearances, due to his commentary work on Fox Sports, with a guest AFL panelist taking his spot when Taylor was not present. In December 2016, it was announced that Tony Jones would return to hosting the show replacing Hutchison, who moved to the Thursday night show following the departure of James Brayshaw. Luke Ball also left the show to take on the role of National Umpiring Director at the AFL on a permanent basis, he was replaced by Kane Cornes. In 2019, it was announced that Sam Newman will be returning to Footy on 9.

Based upon parallax measurements, this star is around 188 light years away from the Sun, but it is drifting closer with a radial velocity of −4 km/s. Spectra of the star taken in different years have been given types of F3IV/V and F5III, leading to a mean published type of F3/5 III/V, with the suspicion that the spectrum is variable. It is an F-type star, likely an evolving subgiant. It is 1.2 billion years old with 3.6 times the Sun's radius. The star has a high rate of spin with a projected rotational velocity of 130 km/s, which is giving it an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge some 9% larger than the polar radius. It is radiating over 20 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,429 K.

The film depicts an emotional bonding between a father (Sai Kumar) and son (Prithviraj). Simhasanam was initially intended to be a remake of the cult Mohanlal-starrer Naduvazhikal. But on scripting, it deviated so much from the original story that, it is no longer a rehashed version of the 1989 hit. So they made it as a loosely based adaptation of Mario Puzo's The Godfather. Plot The story centers around the Chandragiri family whose head Madhava Menon is liked by all in the village. His only son Arjun who is a student in Manipal. As Madhava Menon's popularity rises and spreads to other parts, so does the number of enemies who feel that he is stealing the limelight from them. Things reach a pass where Arjun had to be summoned from Manipal to clear up the atmosphere and restore order. The constant struggles between Madhava Menon and Arjun Madhav on one side and their enemies on the other side is the main theme in the story. Trivia * This is the first time that Shaji Kailas directed a film with the script written by him. * Shaji Kailas directed many films in a family background such as Aaram Thamburan, Narasimham, Madirasi etc. This is one of the film that has action mixed with family bonds. * This is the first time that Shaji Kailas directed a film with Prithviraj as the hero.

Overview  First- World privilege is often explicitly maintained by legal means such as immigration laws and trade barriers. Further, very few nations have laws that prevent explicit discrimination on the basis of nationality for access to employment, promotions, education, scholarships, etc.Global Rights, Local Wrongs, and Legal Fixes: An International Human Rights Critique of Immigration and Welfare Reform; Hernandez-Truyol, Berta Esperanza; Johns, Kimberly A. Laws of many nations actively encourage the discrimination against foreign nationals, for employment and educational purposes, via stringent immigration requirements, exorbitant fees, devaluation of educational qualifications, and scholarship quotas that usually favor citizens from developed nations.Drawing the global colour line: white men's countries and the international challenge of racial equality Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008. First World nations usually have mutual trade and immigration arrangements and treaties that limit the discrimination faced by First-World nationals regarding employment, education and business in other First World countries. The existence of discriminatory laws and barriers across the world, according to First World privilege theory, on balance systematically favor the employment, business, access to education and health care, and subsequently welfare of citizens of First World nations at the cost of the welfare and oppression of the people of developing nations.

Structure The quadrate ligament is a fibrous band attached to the inferior border of the radial notch on the ulna and to the neck of the radius. Its borders are strengthened by fibers from the upper border of the annular ligament. The ligament is long, wide, and thick. Function The quadrate ligament reinforces the inferior part of the capsule of the elbow joint and contributes to joint stability by securing the proximal radius against the radial notch and by restricting excessive supination (10–20° restriction) and, to a lesser degree, pronation (5–8°). History The quadrate ligament was first described by the French anatomist Jean-Paul-Louis Denucé in 1854, but its function and even presence has been disputed in anatomical literature ever since. It received little attention before Nomina Anatomica Parisiensia recognized it as a functional structure in 1955. , nevertheless, found no evidence of the ligament, and described it as \\"nothing more than a thin fibrous layer\\" of the joint capsule — somewhat in line with Denucé's note that the ligament could be considered a simple extension of the synovial recess or an extension of the annular ligament. , on the other hand, described the ligament as having an anterior border denser and stronger than the posterior, with a thin central portion. This description was, however, not corroborated by who, while recognizing the ligament's importance, found it to be of even thickness.

of that city, taking place during the Great Turkish War. Belgrade had been conquered by the Austrians under the elector of Bavaria, Maximilian II Emanuel on September 6, 1688, after a five-week siege. Only 20 days later, King Louis XIV of France invaded the Rhineland, starting the Nine Years' War. This made the Emperor stop all offensives in the Balkans and redirect the bulk of his army in the East towards the Rhine. This allowed the Ottomans under Grand vizier Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha to regroup their army and retake the initiative. In 1690 the Ottomans recaptured Niš and by October 2, they had reached Belgrade. The siege lasted only for 6 days as the Austrians were forced to surrender when their main powder magazine was hit by a Turkish shell and exploded. The Turks would hold the city until the Austrians retook it in the Siege of Belgrade (1717).

He resigned his office and served with the Belgian battalion during the Korean War (1950–1953). Background and Personal Life Henri Moreau de Melen came from the Liège region of Belgium. His father, Eugène Moreau, was a professor at the University of Liège. His mother was Marie Malherbe. Henri studied for a law degree and practiced as a lawyer in Liège. In 1940, at the outbreak of World War II he was conscripted into the Belgian Army. He was taken prisoner by German forces, and held as a prisoner of war until 1945. He married Marie-Louise Ancion (1904–63) in 1931. After her death, he re-married in 1970 to Countess Jacqueline de Lalaing (1910–2006). He had no children. Career and Resignation Henri Moreau de Melen began a political career in 1946 with his election as a member of the Senate in which he represented the interests of the District of Liège as a member of the Christian Social Party (PSC).http://www.racine.be/content/racine/wbnl/listview/2/index.jsp?titelcode=13868 He served as Justice Minister between 1948 and 1949. During his tenure as Minister of Defence under the government of Joseph Pholien, the decision was taken to send Belgian forces to fight in the Korean War. Moreau de Melen was a staunch royalist, and was so disillusioned by the resignation of Leopold III in August 1950 following the \\"Royal Question\\" that he resigned his ministerial post to enlist in the Belgian battalion sent to aide South Korea. He served in Korea with distinction with the rank of Major of the Reserve, second-in- command of the entire unit. He finished the war with the rank of Lieutenant- Colonel. He had a Brevet état-major. After his return from Korea, he returned to politics and resumed his position as senator for Liège which he held until 1968.

Formed in July 1942, it existed for a little over 15 months. Reduced to battle group size by October 1943 in fighting during the Battle of the Dnieper on the Eastern Front, it was disbanded in November 1943. Its surviving troops were absorbed by other German army formations. History The 39th Infantry Division was formed in Germany in July 1942, largely from Polish and other non-German personnel. Its foundation commander was Generalleutnant Hugo Hoefl. The division spent time serving garrison duty in the Netherlands before being transferred to the Eastern Front in March 1943. Now under the command of Generalleutnant Ludwig Löweneck, the division was engaged in various actions against the Red Army. Involvement in the Battle of the Dnieper caused heavy losses and the division was little more than battle group size by October 1943. The division was disestablished in November, with the surviving infantry forming a divisional group that was absorbed by the 106th Infantry Division. The headquarters staff, under Generalmajor Paul Mahlmann as Löweneck had been killed in May 1943 in a vehicle accident, was integrated into the 41st Fortress Division, which garrisoned the Peloponnese in Greece.

He is known for his nature poetry and his essays on the history and culture of Saxony. The son of a stonemason, Kirsten was born in Klipphausen, Meissen. He worked as salesman, bookkeeper and labourer before graduating from the Workers' and Farmers' College (Arbeiter- und Bauern-Fakultät) of Leipzig in 1960, and then completed a teaching degree in German and Russian in 1964. At the same time he worked on a freelance basis for the compilers of the Dictionary of the Upper Saxon Dialects, providing them with more than a thousand words from his own household. After obtaining his degree, he worked briefly as a teacher, and then in 1965 moved to Weimar to work for the Aufbau Verlag publishing house, where he would stay until 1987. To further his career as a poet, in the years 1969 and 1970 Kirsten spent nine months studying at the Johannes R. Becher Institute of Literature, under the tutelage of Heinz Czechowski and Georg Maurer. Between 1968 and 1977, he wrote several volumes of poetry, followed in 1984 by a volume of two prose works. Much of the poetry is collected in die erde bei Meißen (1986), which received the Peter Huchel Prize in 1987, and helped introduce him to West German audiences. During the upheavals of 1989 and 1990, Kirsten became involved in the New Forum at Weimar, but he was quickly disillusioned and retired from political activism. Between 1992 and 2010 he published his work through Ammann Verlag in Zürich, which issued his collected works in 2004 under the title Erdlebenbilder. He lives in Weimar.

It is known for being heavily promoted through aggressive advertising and affiliate marketing. MacKeeper faced a class-action lawsuit because the company allegedly deceived users into paying for unneeded fixes. The lawsuit was settled in 2014 for US $2 million without any admission of guilt by the company. History , five major versions of MacKeeper had been released. The first beta version, MacKeeper 0.8, was released on 13 May 2010. MacKeeper 1.0 was released on October 26, 2010. MacKeeper 2.0 was released on 30 January 2012 at Macworld – iWorld with an expanded number of utilities related to security, data control, cleaning and optimization. Kromtech Alliance acquired MacKeeper from Zeobit in April 2013. MacKeeper 3.0 was released in June 2014 as software as a service with a new \\"human expert\\" feature and optimization with OS X Yosemite. In July 2018, MacKeeper 4.0 was released.MacKeeper 4.0 press release MacKeeper was initially developed in 2009 by Zeobit. In April 2013, Zeobit sold MacKeeper to Kromtech Alliance Corp. Kromtech was closely affiliated with Zeobit in Ukraine and hired many former Kiev-based Zeobit employees. In December 2015 security researcher Chris Vickery discovered a publicly accessible database of 21GB of MacKeeper user data on the internet, exposing the usernames, passwords and other information of over 13 million MacKeeper users. According to Kromtech, this was the result of a \\"server misconfiguration\\" and the error was \\"fixed within hours of the discovery\\". In 2019 Clario acquiredhttps://www.aithority.com/security/clario-to-disrupt- digital-security-market-with-fusion-of-personalized-features-and-human- intelligence/ the IP and human capital of Mackeeper, from Kromtech.  Features  It integrates Avira's anti-malware scanning engine, but some versions opened a critical security hole. The filesystem-level encryption tool can encrypt files or folders with a password. The data recovery utility permits users to recover unintentionally deleted files. A backup software is also included, which can copy files to a USB flash drive, External HDD or FTP server. The data erasure permits users to permanently delete files although PC World argues that this feature duplicates the secure empty trash feature formerly built into macOS. The disk cleaner finds and removes junk files on the hard drive in order to free up space. Reception=Version 1.0 and 2.0 The earlier bundles received mixed reviews, with reviewers being divided as to the effectiveness of the software. Macworld gave MacKeeper 3.5 out of 5 stars in August 2010, based on the 0.9.6 build of the program, and found it a reasonably priced set of tools but experienced lagging while switching between tools. MacLife rated it at 2.5 out of 5 and said it to be useful mainly for freeing up drive space, but found other features offered inconsistent results and believed most users won’t need its antivirus feature. AV-Comparatives found that MacKeeper had an excellent ability to detect Mac- based malware. They noted that it was \\"very well suited to enthusiasts who have a good understanding of security issues, but not ideal for non-expert users who need pre-configured optimal security for their Macs.\\" Zeobit claims that negative attacks were launched against MacKeeper by an unnamed competitor, and that many users and press were confusing MacKeeper with another application. Version 3.0 Reviews of the latest software version have been largely negative. A May 2015 test by PC World found that MacKeeper identified the need for extensive corrections on brand new fully patched machines. In December 2015, Business Insider and iMore suggested users avoid the product and not install it. Top Ten Reviews has removed MacKeeper from its top 10 ranking noting that the software had more features than its competitors but its performance in Mac malware identification tests showed other software had better detection rates, resulting in a score of 7.5 out of 10. A July 2017 AV-TEST assessment found MacKeeper only detected 85.9 percent of the tested malware. MacKeeper has been criticized for being very difficult to uninstall; both Tom's Guide and MacWorld have published how-to guides for deleting the software. According to MacWorld, users frequently ask how they can get rid of MacKeeper. Sophos and Malwarebytes, both competing vendors to Kromtech in the anti-virus software market, have identified MacKeeper as a potentially unwanted program; Sophos reported MacKeeper as 2017's most prolific macOS potentially unwanted program. MacWorld observed that aggressive MacKeeper advertising leads people to believe that the software is either malware or a scam, when it is neither; MacWorld also notes that some pop-up and pop-under ads may be due to third-party installers. Computerworld described MacKeeper as \\"a virulent piece of software that promises to cure all your Mac woes, but instead just makes things much worse\\". Softonic.com described the software as \\"not perfect, but genuinely useful\\" while also noting MacKeeper exaggerates the threat associated with a user not having a security app. Marketing techniques Multiple reviewers have criticized Zeobit's marketing and promotional techniques. Kromtech buys upwards of 60 million ad impressions a month, making it one of the largest buyers of web traffic aimed at Mac users. Zeobit has been accused of employing misleading advertising with regard to its promotion of MacKeeper, including aggressive affiliate marketing, pop-under ads and planting sockpuppet reviews as well as websites set up to discredit their competitors. Kromtech has also had issues with affiliate advertisers, attracted by the 50 percent commissions Kromtech pays for sales of MacKeeper, who have wrapped MacKeeper ads into adware. In 2018, Kromtech began to take steps against affiliate marketers it said were scamming users.Kromtech cancelled partnerships that caused problems—MacKeeper.com Lawsuits In January 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against Zeobit in Illinois. The lawsuit alleged that \\"neither the free trial nor the full registered versions of MacKeeper performed any credible diagnostic testing\\" and reported that a consumer's Mac was in need of repair and was at-risk due to harmful error. In May 2014 a lawsuit was filed against Zeobit in Pennsylvania, alleging that MacKeeper fakes security problems to deceive victims into paying for unneeded fixes. On 10 August 2015, Zeobit settled a class action lawsuit against it for . Customers who bought MacKeeper before 8 July 2015 can apply to get a refund. Kromtech also filed at least two unsuccessful lawsuits against those it perceives are defaming them. In July 2013 Kromtech filed a lawsuit against Macpaw, the developers of CleanMyMac. Kromtech alleged that Macpaw employees created several usernames and posts on several websites defaming the MacKeeper software. The case was dismissed before the hearing. A year later, in 2014, Kromtech again filed a lawsuit against David A. Cox alleging that he defamed Kromtech by calling MacKeeper a fraudulent application in a YouTube video. The judge dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. In July 2016, Kromtech sent a cease and desist letter to Luqman Wadood, a 14-year old technology reviewer for alleged harassment and slander of the MacKeeper brand in a number of YouTube videos. Luqman said the videos were diplomatic.

Background Weigand of Redwitz was a member of the Franconian Redwitz family. The Redwitzes were Imperial Knights; the family was named after Redwitz an der Rodach, a village in Lichtenfels district in Upper Franconia. Weigand was a son of Henry of Redwitz at Theisenort and Tüschnitz and his wife, Agatha of Bibra. His relative Catherine II of Redwitz (d. 1560) was Abbess of Obermünster Abbey in Regensburg from 1533 to 1536.  Life  Weigand of Redwitz became a canon in Bamberg in 1490. He made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In 1520, he was the senior pastor of Kronach. Among his congregation was the reformer Johannes Grau, who had to flee to Wittenberg after he married the daughter of a citizen of Kronach. During his time as bishop, Weigand acted against Luther's followers and removed Lutheran clergy from office. However, under the restraining influence of his veteran advisor John of Schwarzenberg, he was less radical than some of the people who had elected him would have liked. At the time Weigand was appointed bishop, Adrian VI was Pope and Charles V was Emperor. During his reign, the Peasants' War raged in the area. Over 70 manors and several monasteries were destroyed. Weigand attempted to resolve the conflict diplomatically. When military intervention appeared unavoidable, he turned to the Swabian League. The cathedral chapter also favoured intervention by the Swabian League. When the troubles began, the chapter had more rights than ever before, but now existential questions about their position were being posed. Although some of the canons may have sympathized with the Protestant faith, the demands of the peasant, which implied disempowering the canons, met with fierce resistance. The commander of the League's forces, Georg, Truchsess von Waldburg, was a loyal, but also ruthless military leader. Weigand's supporters were rewarded with properties confiscated from wealthy families in Bamberg. After the revolt was suppressed, Weigand, unlike some other feudal rulers, did not impose draconian punishments on the rebels. However, some rebel leaders were beheaded in the marketplace. He pledged Veldenstein Castle to the Burgraviate of Nuremberg.weber-rudolf.de During the Second Margrave War, near the end of his reign, the Protestant Margrave Albert III Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach invaded his territory. Weigand was not prepared and had to give in to the Margrave's excessive demands. He ceded almost half of his territory. To secure his claims, Albert occupied the key central cities Forchheim and Bamberg. Albert Alcibiades had made many enemies with his bellicose behaviour and was defeated in 1553. He died in exile in 1557.  Coat of arms  Coat of arms of the Redwitz family. As bishop, Wiegand used these arms as an element in a quartered arms Wiegand's coat of arms were quartered. The second and third field show the Redwitz family coat of arms. According to Siebmachers Wappenbuch, this consisted of a blue field with three silver bars, covered by a red diagonal bar. The other two quarters show the black lion of Bamberg, topped with a silver diagonal bar on golden ground. Weigand's coat of arms can be found attached to the St. Veit Bastion of Forchheim Fortress. There are also several copies on the core castle of Rosenberg Fortress in Kronach, which was expanded by Weigand.  Grave monument in Michaelsberg Abbey  Weigand was buried in the Bamberg Cathedral. However, when this cathedral was restored, his grave monument was moved to the left aisle of the church of Michaelsberg Abbey, to achieve a greater stylistic unity in the Romanesque cathedral. The monument was designed by Hans Polster.

It is planned to include about 40,000 biographies of distinguished Italians.La Stampa 15/03/2011 The entries are signed by their authors and provide a rich bibliography. History The work was conceived in 1925, to follow the model of similar works such as the German Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (1912, 56 volumes) or the English Dictionary of National Biography, from 2004 the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (60 volumes). It is planned to include biographical entries on Italians who deserve to be preserved in history and who lived at any time during the long period from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the present. As director of the Treccani, Giovanni Gentile entrusted the task of coordinating the work of drafting to Fortunato Pintor, who was soon joined by Arsenio Frugoni. In 1959 the direction was taken up by Alberto Maria Ghisalberti. The first volume appeared in 1960 to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Unification of Italy. It had taken about 15 years to organize a huge index of historical figures from which 40,000 were selected as Italians deserving to be remembered by a separate entry. 92 volumes had been published by 2018, up to the letter \\"S\\" (Sisto IV). Updates were occasionally issued. For example, in 1990 a supplement was issued for the letters A-C containing entries of people who had died before 1985. The final work should be composed of 110 volumes, excluding appendices and supplements. In October 2009, following the threatened closure of the work, or reduction to a simplified version that would only be maintained online, the publisher launched an appeal to ensure the continuation according to the strict scholarly criteria that had hitherto characterized the paper version. In 2010 the list of planned items from the letters M to Z was published, for the purpose of their inclusion in the planned future volumes. Currently the director of the work is Raffaele Romanelli. In March 2011 a new portal was designed to access the dictionary, in conjunction with the online version of the Treccani Encyclopaedia. This was formally launched on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Italy.

Born in South Africa, he qualified for Ireland through residency, made his international debut in 2016 and has won 6 caps. He primarily plays as a lock. Before his move to Ireland, Roux played rugby in his birthplace, lining out for the Stormers in Super Rugby and Western Province in the Currie Cup and Vodacom Cup. Career=Early career Roux started playing for Western Province in 2011, and was a member of the side which won the 2012 Vodacom Cup, the team's first ever win in the competition. Roux's performances for Western Province led to a call up for Super Rugby side, the Stormers. He made his Super Rugby debut on 2 June 2012, replacing Eben Etzebeth in the 51st minute of 19–14 win over the Bulls. Leinster In June 2012 it was announced that Roux was moving to Irish provincial team Leinster on a one-year deal. He joined the squad for the 2012–13 season. Roux played in nine games in the 2012–13 Pro12, starting in seven of these. Roux did not feature for Leinster in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup as the team was eliminated in the pool stages. After the team were knocked down to the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup, however, Roux featured in each of Leinster's matches. He made his European debut as a replacement against London Wasps in the quarter-final, before also coming on as a replacement against Biarritz. Roux then started for Leinster in the Challenge Cup final against Stade Français, which saw Leinster crowned champions. He extended his contract with Leinster in March 2013, signing a two-year extension to the original deal. In the following season, Roux made seven appearances in the Pro12, with all but one of his appearances coming as starts. On 12 October 2013, Roux made his Heineken Cup debut. He came on as a replacement in the province's win over the Ospreys. Roux also made a replacement appearance against Castres the following week. Connacht Ahead the 2014–15 season, it was announced Roux was joining Connacht, another Irish province, on a loan deal to last until 31 December 2014. The move to Connacht saw him reunited with his former Western Province teammate Danie Poolman. Roux made his Connacht debut on 6 September 2014, when he started against Newport Gwent Dragons in the first game of the 2014–15 Pro12, and played the full 80 minutes in a Connacht victory. Roux started the game against his parent club Leinster on 19 September 2014, as Connacht pulled off an unlikely victory over their Irish rivals. Roux continued to feature regularly for Connacht, and extended his loan deal for the remainder of the season, taking him to the end of his contract with Leinster. It was announced in January 2015 that at the end of his contract with Leinster Roux would join Connacht permanently, with the second row signing a deal to take him up to the summer of 2017. International Roux debuted for Ireland in the second test in their 2016 series against South Africa.

In a career which lasted from 1977 until October 1979 he ran twelve times and won five races. His most important success came in July 1978 when he won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. He was retired to stud in 1979 and sired The Derby winner Kahyasi. Background Ile de Bourbon was a dark-coated bay horse standing 16.1 hands high, bred in the United States by Jane Engelhard, the wife of Charles W. Engelhard, Jr.. He was sired by the Triple Crown winner Nijinsky out of the French mare Roseliere, whose wins included the Prix de Diane and the Prix Vermeille. In addition to Ile de Bourbon, Roseliere also produced the leading British filly Rose Bowl and was a full sister of the leading National Hunt stallion Roselier. When the British trainer Fulke Johnson Houghton first saw the yearling in Kentucky, he described him as \\"all ribs, looking a right bugger\\", but bought him anyway and brought him back to train at his stable at Blewbury in Wiltshire. Ile de Bourbon ran in the colours of David McCall and was owned by McCall in partnership with Sir Philip Oppenheimer, Fulke Johnson Houghton and the trainer's mother, Helen Johnson Houghton. Racing career=1977: two-year-old season In 1977, Ile de Bourbon finished fourth over seven furlongs on his racecourse debut and was then moved up sharply in class for the Group One William Hill Futurity at Doncaster in which he finished ninth behind Dactylographer. 1978: three-year-old season Ile de Bourbon began his three-year-old season by running second in the Listed Heathorn Stakes at Newmarket. He then finished second in the Predominate Stakes, a trial race for The Derby. Ile de Bourbon missed The Derby but ran two weeks later at Royal Ascot, when he recorded his first important win in the Group Two King Edward VII Stakes. He returned to Ascot in July for Britain's most prestigious all- aged race, the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes. He started at odds of 12/1 in a field of fourteen runners. Ridden by John Reid, he won by one and a half lengths from the Prix du Jockey Club winner Acamas and the Epsom Derby runner-up Hawaiian Sound. Acamas was subsequently disqualified after failing a drug test. In August, Ile de Bourbon won the Geoffrey Freer Stakes at Newbury. Ile de Bourbon was made favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster but finished sixth of the fourteen runners behind Julio Mariner. 1979: four-year-old season Ile de Bourbon began his four-year-old season by winning the Clive Graham Stakes. He was then sent to Epsom and won the Coronation Cup by three lengths from a field which included the leading French colts Frere Basile and Gay Mecene. He missed a clash with Troy in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, before returning in the September Stakes at Kempton. In a major upset, he was defeated by the three-year-old Cracaval. On his final racecourse appearance, Ile de Bourbon finished unplaced behind Three Troikas in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Assessment John Reid reportedly regarded Ile de Bourbon as one of the best horses he rode in his career. Timeform rated Ile de Bourbon at 133 in both 1978 and 1979. He was the highest-rated European three-year-old of 1978 and the highest-rated older horse of 1979. Stud record Ile de Bourbon stood as a stallion in Europe before being exported to Japan in 1987. His most successful progeny included Kahyasi, Ile de Chypre, Petite Ile and Ile de Nisky (Cumberland Lodge Stakes). Ile de Bourbon died in 1997.

The area has been designated a Special Historic Site and forms part of a grouping of sites submitted in 2007 for future inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List: Asuka-Fujiwara: Archaeological sites of Japan’s Ancient Capitals and Related Properties. Excavations in the 1980s uncovered a well-preserved section of the temple's covered corridors that predate the surviving buildings of Hōryū-ji: \\"for the history of Japanese architecture, this discovery is of as great moment as the finding of the seventh-century Takamatsuzuka tomb paintings in March 1972 was for the history of Japanese art.\\" History Yamada-dera was established in 641 by Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro. After drainage of the site, work began on the kondō and surrounding corridors. The Nihon Shoki chronicles the suicide of the Soga founder at the kondō in 649, after false charges of treason had been brought against him. The Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu, a biography of Shōtoku Taishi, documents renewed construction at the site from 663 with the erection of a pagoda, after Prince Naka-no-Ōe, who had married one of the founder's daughters, had ascended the throne as Emperor Tenchi; this building was complete by 676. The uragaki or notes to Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu mention the eye-opening ceremony of a sixteen-foot Buddha in the temple's Lecture Hall in 685. The Nihon Shoki records a visit by Emperor Temmu a few months later to the temple of Jōdo-ji, identified by Aston as Asuka-dera but now thought to refer to Yamada-dera. In the following decade, Emperor Mommu granted lands to support the temple. Fujiwara no Michinaga visited in 1023 and was impressed by its splendour, according to the . By the end of the following century the kondō and pagoda had burned and, according to the , the temple had become a branch of Tōnomine-dera (today's Tanzan Jinja). Architecture Excavations of the site by the Nara Research Institute for Cultural Properties from 1976 have revealed the plan of the complex. The main temple buildings were arranged along a central north-south axis, with the gate opening through the covered corridors and leading to the pagoda, standing in front of the kondō; thus far the plan was the same as at Shitennō-ji, but unlike that temple, the kōdō or lecture hall was outside this inner precinct, behind the rear arcade. The pillars of the 3x3 bay gate were sunk directly into the ground, rather than their being supported on base stones; similar sunken pillars may be found at Ise Jingū. The central pillar of the 3x3 bay pagoda rested on a base stone a metre below the podium on which it stood, as in the later examples at Hōryū-ji and Hōrin-ji. The base stones, uniquely carved with lotus petals, of the kondō reveal a 3x2 bay central core or moya and unusually narrow side bays. The base stones of the 8x4 bay lecture hall include holes bored for swing doors. The precinct itself extended 22 bays east to west, some eighty-four metres between the outer walls. In the 1982 phase, at a depth of 2.2 m, a large number of tiles were discovered from the site of the east corridor, including circular eave-end tiles of the \\"Yamada-dera type\\", deeply moulded, with eight double lotus petals and a ring of six seeds around the centre. Beneath, a 1.7 bay section of the wooden outer wall was uncovered, including base stones with lotus designs; columns, with marked entasis; base and head penetrating tie- beams; middle non-penetrating tie-beams; latticed windows; sections of lath for plastering; and bracket blocks. Additional elements discovered the following year include bracket arms, rainbow beams, rafters and purlins. Traces of red paint on the timbers and fragments of plaster were also uncovered. Further discoveries in 1984 included better-preserved windows and ground plates and pivot blocks for doors. The pillars are of camphor other than one of cypress, perhaps an historic repair; the other elements are largely of cypress, although one zelkova tie-beam again seems to be evidence of an historic repair; some of the wall laths are of pine. Statuary NT); ; dedicated in 685; now at Kōfuku-ji A bronze Buddha head, tentatively identified as that of Yakushi, is the sole surviving element of the principal triad of the former kōdō or lecture hall. The statue group was cast between 678 and 685. Appropriated by monks from Kōfuku-ji in the 1180s, it was moved to Nara and re-enshrined in Kōfuku-ji's East Kondō. Only the head survived destruction in the fire caused by a lightning strike in 1411. Subsequently deposited under the altar platform, it was rediscovered in 1937 and is now a National Treasure on view in the Kōfukuji National Treasure Museum. The work marks a watershed in the periodization of Japanese Buddhist sculpture. It is a \\"document of stylistic transition, embodying the naiveté of Suiko faith, yet already swelling with the maturity of Tempyō\\". Conservation To avoid anistropic shrinkage and cell collapse during the drying of the waterlogged wood recovered, the architectural members were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a Synthetic fiber polymer used gradually to replace the water content before permanent hardening. This treatment methodology was introduced in the late 60s and early 70s in Denmark to conserve the Skuldelev ships and in Sweden for the Vasa. In Japan it was used first on wooden tablets from Gangō-ji and then in 1972 on parts from the Kodera dam site in Matsuyama. Although this treatment is irreversible and leads to visual darkening, consolidation with PEG also makes the wood inedible thus helping prevent biodeterioration; since Japanese Buddhist architecture makes use of joinery rather than metal pins, the incompatibility of PEG with associated metal components was not a concern; PEG is the most common choice of consolidant for such applications, and has since been used on the Bremen cog and Mary Rose. Since PEG has an affinity with water, it is necessary to maintain artefacts treated in this way in a stable low-humidity environment. Designated an Important Cultural Property, the excavated artefacts are now stored and displayed at the Asuka Historical Museum.

The differences between the categories are then exaggerated, and differences within the categories themselves are minimised. Memory of anything that can be categorized is subject to an accentuation effect in which the memory is distorted toward typical examples. In the case of people, the accentuation effect is similar to stereotyping and social categorization in that when classified as part of a group, people's features seem to more closely match their classification rather than any individual differences they have. The effect was first identified by Henri Tajfel in the late 1950s.  Judgement  The accentuation effect often works to create more polarized judgements within individuals. A study conducted by Eiser, 1971, showed this through people’s judgements of different attitude statements. Those who were judging were asked to rate a variety of statements regarding the non-medical use of drugs from being ‘extremely permissive’ to ‘extremely restrictive’. The group which received the statements already categorized into two distinct groups, one being from anti-drug newspapers and the other being from pro-drug newspapers, accentuated the differences between these two groups as opposed to those from the control condition. This resulted in the polarization of their judgements regarding the statements and where they belong on the scale. Once judgements are grouped into different categories, people often accentuate the subjective differences between them. Another way in which this occurs is when the response language of questions is manipulated. In another study, that was testing people’s response to statements as being pro or anti, when the pro was at the positive end of the scale and anti was at the negative end of the scale, those that agree with the statement accentuate their judgement and label them in a more polarized ways, whereas those that disagreed with the statement labelled them in less polarized ways. The opposite effect is seen when the scale is switched. This ultimately means that the most polarized labels are given when the judge’s end of the scale is positively labelled.  Intergroup accentuation  The accentuation effect is often found in group interactions, with group members exaggerating the differences between their ingroup and outgroup. For those in the ingroup, the accentuation of characteristics were less for the ingroup than the outgroup, suggesting that this effect may be due to distancing the outgroup from the ingroup. However, this accentuation effect didn’t just depend on the categorization of different groups, but the perceived stereotypical differences between the groups themselves. Rothbart and Lewis, 2006, demonstrated this using the perceived differences of temperament between three groups of a university marching band. The differences that were accentuated between the groups relied on how much the groups were expected to be different, despite the temperament of all three groups being close to the same. This means that groups that were stereotypically different accentuated the differences between them more so than groups that were stereotypically similar. The exaggeration took place due to the expectations as opposed to the actual group differences present. This effect between the ingroup and the outgroup is due to a number of reasons. Those in the ingroup encode outgroup characteristics, leading to the perceived differences between the two groups, but especially from the perspective of the ingroup. Furthermore, people focus on features that are typical as opposed to atypical in groups, and when there are two clear categories in place, this information works to polarize the groups, resulting in greater differences between them. The contact between ingroups and outgroups, however, didn’t work to reduce this effect. Instead, it increased. The longer the groups spent with each other (and in the case of the study the longer people in the different groups spent in marching bands), the more they perceived that there were differences between them. The preference for the ingroup over the outgroup in the study also did not result in a correlation with the accentuation of differences, suggesting it did not play a role. However, the groups observed in the study were not hostile towards each other, as previous research has reported strong accentuation with groups that are ideologically opposed, meaning that hostility between the ingroup and outgroup as opposed to preference may result in an increased attenuation effect. The understanding of intergroup accentuation is important as it could lead to the understanding of conflict between different groups. Within ethnicity and faces Researchers Corneille, Huart, Becquart, and Bredart found that, when participants looked at ethnically ambiguous faces, certain ethnic features that stood out caused participants to falsely remember the person more toward an ethnic category than they actually were. Researchers used Caucasian or North African faces, and morphed them to be either low, moderate, or high on stereotypical features. The faces that were moderately stereotypical of either a Caucasian or North African person were falsely recollected in memory as more Caucasian or North African than they actually were. This is evidence for how distortions in memory are due to stereotypical conceptions that are held about certain ethnicities. . Research by Freeman & Ambady, 2011a, found that when faces with neutral facial features or ambiguous facial features are placed in ethnically specific locations, individuals tend to associate the neutral facial features as belonging to the specific ethnicity of that particular location. A specific location might include a scene of the Great Wall of China with a neutral facial feature displayed across it or an image of the US Capital with neutral facial features flashed across the image. When a Chinese scene with a neutral facial feature is shown, the participant more quickly associate the neutral facial features as Asian and likewise, when an American scene appears, the participant more quickly categorize the neutral facial features as White. However, when a neutral facial picture is presented with a neutral scene, the results depend on the ethnicity of the person responding. This suggests that similarity and settings are directly related to an individual's ability to recall and associate, playing a vital role in social categorization and stereotyping. Association and categorization of multiracial facial features are also impacted by specific locations or context, however achieved in a slightly differing manner, according to Pauker and Ambady. Those categorizing individual's with multiracial features struggle with the ambiguity of their look, resulting in uncertainty and the need for further clarification from the multiracial individual. Those with multiracial features may, as a result, depend less on external cues and classification and more on their own individual concept of race and what it means.  Social categorization – the benefits and negative effects  Social categorization has its benefits as well as its obvious negatives. First, it is important to understand that the categorization of individuals into different social groups is, for the most part, an unconscious and natural reaction. Research by Lee, Jussim, & McCauley, 1995, suggests that categorizing things, including people, is helpful because with the multifaceted, intricate world in which we live, individuals categorize things and people in order to better process and understand information around them. However, there is also a danger with social categorization. For those that are categorized and stereotyped, it removes the person's individuality, their unique traits, beliefs and mannerisms and for those doing the categorization, it misrepresents their view of the groups or individuals and results in all within the categorized group being treated the same way. This theory was tested through an experiment conducted by Tajfel & Wilkes, 1963. Tajfel & Wilkes study highlighted how lines of differing lengths, when grouped together are perceived to be the same length, but when categorized (by color change) the lines are perceived to be different lengths. Within temperature estimates A study at Brown University found accentuation effects happened when participants were asked to estimate average temperatures in days throughout the year. Typically, four days in a month were used, i.e., September 2, 10, 18, and 28, and the average high and low temperatures were estimated for each day. Results of this study found that when estimating the temperature, there was more of a jump in temperature estimates between months as opposed to estimates within months. Even though the temperature rises and falls fairly steadily with each passing day through the year, participants assume there is more of a drop in temperature, for example, between August 25 and September 2 than there is between September 2 and September 10, based entirely on the idea that August is warmer than September. .  Within money = Currency  In Tadeusz Tyszka and Krzysztof Przybyszewski's \\"Cognitive and Emotional Factors Affecting Currency Perception\\" they found that although money is known to have a nominal value, the perception of its value is often accentuated because of emotional connection. In other words, people who value a certain country's currency very highly may presume that something may have a higher value if say in US dollars versus as if it is expressed in Euros, even if the actual value does not reflect the same idea. If someone has strong emotional ties to a country they may see the value of something being greater than it really is, simply because it is expressed in their great country's currency. Likewise, they determined that people that have poor opinions about a country or culture may devalue their currency even if the rate is inaccurate. For example, if someone thinks a country is mostly poverty- stricken it may accentuate this idea of poverty and so they may value that currency lower than its nominal value. .  Monetary value  Powerlessness of individuals is observed to accentuate how they represent objects with monetary value physically. This physical representation of the objects related to its monetary value manifests itself through changes in size. This means that objects will be perceived as larger than they are the more monetary value they hold, unless the value is associated with its small size, where it will instead be perceived smaller. Researchers Dubois, Rucker, and Galinksy, 2010, demonstrated this through an experiment that assigned participants three power rankings (high, low, and baseline), achieving this by providing an imaginary scenario encompassing one of these rankings. The participants were then asked to draw to different objects with monetary value. The individuals that were designated low power rankings, and had a sense of powerlessness, increased the size of objects that were associated with monetary value. This was not seen in participants with high or baseline power rankings. The more associated an object was with monetary value, the more that those who felt powerless distorted the size. Objects that didn’t hold monetary value, such as blank discs, were drawn the same size by all groups, suggesting that this effect is only observed to objects with value. The researchers theorized that the lack in power led to participants compensating for this through changing the physical representation of objects associated with monetary value, as there is an increased need for them to restore the power that they’ve lost. The relationship with powerlessness and monetary value itself may be due to the nature of the restoration of power within people, as individuals will try to achieve this by obtaining high-status objects in order to increase their standing in the social hierarchy. Real world examples One example that researchers presented was that after an Italian colleague returned from a two- week vacation in Italy, his friends noticed that his hair and eyes were lighter than they had remembered. This happened because his categorization as Italian caused them to remember him with darker hair and eyes than he actually had. Thus, while there was no actual change in his hair and eye color, their memory of his features had been shifted to match what the stereotype of an Italian looks like, rather than his actual appearance..

He was best known for his work at KLIF in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in the 1960s and 1970s and at KIMN, KOSI, and KXKL-FM in Denver, Colorado from 1981 until his death in 2001. Early life Mills was born in Dallas, Texas, on November 5, 1948. He grew up in the Lakewood neighborhood of Dallas and attended W.T. White High School. Career=KVIL-AM/FM Mills' first job in broadcasting was in 1967 at KVIL-AM/FM in Dallas. Just 18 years old when he started, Mills was heard on both the AM and FM bands. The KVIL studio was then located in the Highland Park Village shopping center. KLIF broadcaster In April 1968 Mills took a position at Dallas Top 40 radio station KLIF which was located at the 1190 AM frequency. Its daytime power was 50,000 watts and it was Dallas's top-rated radio station. Mills' time slot was overnight and he was heard all over Dallas. He announced commercials and promoted station events. In May 1969, Mills moved to the evening time slot where he was heard from 6PM-9PM weeknights. In October 1969, Mills and Rod Roddy (who was also a KLIF broadcaster at the time) examined in depth the \\"Paul Is Dead\\" urban legend about Paul McCartney of The Beatles. From October 1972 to August 1973, Mills was a solo anchor of the KLIF morning show. In September 1973 he was joined by fellow KLIF announcer Dave Ambrose and they hosted the morning show together until August 1974. Voice in FM stereo Gordon McLendon owned KLIF along with FM station KNUS-FM, now known as KLUV-FM. KNUS was located in the KLIF Triangle Point Studios in Downtown Dallas as well and Mills was also a voice of KNUS. At the time AM was still dominated by Top 40 formatted stations and KNUS was album-oriented rock and underground music formatted. There were still fewer radios with the FM band at the time but Mills had helped KNUS get attention.

He was the founder of Pariyatti Shiksha (Buddhist education) in the country, and in 2006 was named the fifth Sangha Nayaka (Chief Prelate). Pages 7-9. Early life Sapta Ratna was born to father Purnananda and mother Surjamaya Vajracharya in Kwa Baha, Kathmandu. In 1940, he went to Kushinagar, India, and was ordained as a novice monk. He was given the dharma name Buddhaghosa. He then went to Burma, where he studied Buddhism and meditation, and in 1943 received higher ordination as a full monk in Mandalay. He was the first from a Vajracharya family to become a Theravada monk.

The weekly dharma classes attracted large numbers of youths, and the study of Buddhism progressed beyond sermons and services. Buddhaghosa authored, translated, or edited 22 books in Nepal Bhasa and Nepali on the Tripitaka, which consists of the Theravada Buddhist scriptures.

Early life  Born in Clonmel, he was educated at Rockwell College, County Tipperary. During the Irish War of Independence he served with the Tipperary Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) as an Intelligence Officer.Ambrose, Joe (2006), Dan Breen and the IRA. Cork, Mercier Press. pp.124–25 He became Commanding Officer of the Second Southern Division and was arrested and interned on Spike Island but escaped. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and fought with the Anti-Treaty IRA forces. During the Irish Civil War he issued a Proclamation that if any member of his Command was executed he would have an equivalent number of leading Free State citizens executed as a result. None were executed by the Government forces as a result.Andrews, C.S. (1979), Dublin Made Me. Cork, Mercier Press. p.291 At the 1923 general election he was an unsuccessful Sinn Féin candidate in the Tipperary constituency. After the end of the Civil War, Quirke left Ireland and went to the United States, Canada and Mexico where he held a variety of different jobs including a ranchman, builders' labourer, lumberjack and cowpuncher. While in Los Angeles, California he married Clare Riordan in January 1928. The couple then returned to Ireland where Quirke joined the newly formed Fianna Fáil party. He was one of seven successful Fianna Fáil candidates who secured election to Free State Seanad at the 1931 Seanad election, securing a nine- year term.O'Sullivan, Donal (1940), The Irish Free State and Its Senate. London, Faber and Faber. p. 278 He was a member of the Seanad until its abolition in 1936.  Political career  From 1938 onwards, he was re-elected by the Agricultural Panel to the new Seanad Éireann In the upper house he was the Fianna Fáil Leader of the Seanad and chief spokesperson. He was also a Vice-President of Fianna Fáil. When the party was in opposition he acted as Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad. A farmer, he was also a partner of Stokes and Quirke, an auctioneering firm with offices in Dublin, Clonmel, Fethard and London and was for a time a director with the Agricultural Credit Corporation and Butlin's Irish Associates. When the Turf Development Board was created in 1934 Quirke and Aodogán O'Rahilly were appointed as part-time board members at the request of Todd Andrews. This organisation became Bord na Móna.Andrews, C.S. (1982), Man of No Property. Cork, Mercier Press. p.131 In 1947 three gentlemen representing a company called Trans-World retained the services of Stokes and Quirke to buy Locke's whiskey distillery in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath. They managed to secure an appointment to have tea with the President Seán T. O'Kelly, which was photographed, as they appealed for extra time before putting down their initial down payment of IR£75,000. As the weeks passed people became suspicious of their backgrounds and the Minister for Justice, Gerald Boland, ordered an investigation which resulted in their arrests. Two fled the country while the third was put on the mailboat to Holyhead. As there were by-elections in the offing the opposition capitalised on the issue. Oliver J. Flanagan, in particular, made a number of allegations of corruption in the Dáil and the Government under Éamon de Valera set up the Locke Tribunal to investigate the matter. The report was very critical of Flanagan and called him irresponsible but did not find any Fianna Fáil politician guilty of corruption. Nevertheless, the perception remained going into the 1948 general election which benefitted the Clann na Poblachta party.Kerrigan, Gene and Brennan, Pat (1999), This Great Little Nation: The A-Z of Irish Scandals and Controversies. Dublin, Gill and Macmillan. pp.188–191  Death  He died while on a stag hunt with the Ward Union Hunt on 5 March 1955 while still a Senator. His funeral mass was attended by many former colleagues from the Second Southern Division of the Old IRA and by President O'Kelly, Fianna Fáil Oireachtas and party members, and representatives of the Government parties.

It was the last film of child actress Taruni Sachdev. The original music and background score of the film were composed by Mani Sharma, cinematography was handled by Ramesh Kumar, while editing was by Kishore Te. Vetri Selvan revolves around three youth who have been rejected by the society and how they try to reform it. It was released on 19 June 2014.

Ajmal was signed for the lead role, that of a student, and singer Mano was reported to play a \\"prominent character\\", that of a professor in the film, acting in a film again after Singaravelan; Sherif, winner of a reality show, was given the role of a dancer. During the shooting, Ajmal met with an accident during the shoot of Vetri Selvan. Ajmal and the film’s lead actress Radhika Apte were travelling in an auto on the hills of Ooty as part of the film, when the auto rammed on a median and fell stumbling down on the road. The shoot came to a halt for a couple of hours giving time for Ajmal to recuperate. The director had to find another auto similar to the previous one to continue with the shooting as the initial one was heavily damaged during the accident. Child actress Taruni Sachdev, who had played a supporting role as Apte's sister in the film, died in a plane crash in May 2012. She had completed most of her part however, with Rudhran stating that her footages would be retained and \\"as a remembrance of the prodigy\\" and that the rest of her part would be patched up during the post-production. Soundtrack The film's music was composed by Mani Sharma scoring for an Ajmal film for the second time after Thiru Thiru Thuru Thuru (2009). The audio was launched by director Bala on 2 November 2012, while directors Ameer and Seenu Ramasamy, producer G. Dhananjayan and writer Tamilachi Thangapandian were also present. All songs were written by Madhan Karky.

It gnaws at his soul. After nights spent writhing in torment, he decides that he needs to exorcise those feelings — and what better way than to create a work of art, with each scene, every line of dialogue a stinging whiplash on the aspect of society that reduced him to this state? And then he discovers it doesn’t quite work that way. There’s an audience out there, and they don’t give a rat’s behind about his suffering. They want entertainment — songs, action, comedy, romance. There are films that manage this balancing act well. Vetri Selvan isn’t one of them.\\". The Times of India gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Even if we set aside the question of whether movies should really have a message, the sincerity in wanting to spread a message doesn't reflect in the inelegant filmmaking. The fault lies in the formulaic storytelling. The director chooses the tried and tested trope of a lighter first half with a mystery around the protagonist and a serious latter half where secrets are revealed and a point is made. But the problem here is that the initial set-up is very much non-existent\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"An insipid screenplay, lacklustre narration and some uninspiring performances make sure that Vetriselvan leaves no impact\\". Sify wrote, \\"The intentions of director Rudharan is honourable but the way he has executed the film is shoddy and boring. The story and treatment is a long yawn. The director has tried to fit in as many commercial items and in the process the film loses its steam.

Behindwoods.com gave it 1.25 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Rudran has genuinely attempted to pack the first half with comedy and finish the movie off on a sentimental note, however the lack of quality humour and an overdose of drama backstabs the engaging factor of the movie.

In its home city of The Hague, the orchestra runs its own chamber, Baroque and symphonic concert series in partnership with venues Philipszaal, the Raad van State and the Dutch radio. The orchestra tours regularly and has appeared at many of the major European music festivals. Tours outside of Europe have taken the orchestra through northern <>, Russia, Asia and Australia. The orchestra records for Dutch label PENTATONE and has won major music industry awards for its CDs, including the Edison Award.  Tours and performances  The NDA's performances in the low countries have included cycles of Stamitz, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven and Mendelssohn symphonies for Dutch radio at Amsterdam's Het Concertgebouw, Rotterdam's De Doelen, Utrecht's Vredenburg and The Hague's Philipszaal. The NDA has appeared at major European festivals including the Händel Festspiele Halle, the Bachfest Leipzig, Thüringer Bachwochen, Musikfestspiele Potsdam Sanssouci, Roma Europa Festival, Goldberg Festival, and the Festival van Vlaanderen (Festival of Flanders).

Discography  The NDA's discography includes world première presentations of works of 18th century symphonists Stamitz, Richter, Schmitt (\\"The Dutch Haydn\\"), Graaf, Schwindl and Zappa. The groundbreaking NDA recording of Corelli's Concerti Grossi, made during the 2003 Festival of Early Music Utrecht, was the first disc to ever present Corelli's own large-scale, authentic orchestral soundscape, featuring Corelli's preferred instrumentation with a large variety and amount of basso continuo instruments (cello, bass, organs, harpsichords, baroque lutes, baroque guitars, archlutes and theorbos), together with improvisation and extemporisation. It was voted by Dutch national radio as one of the top 5 highlights in the 30-year history of the festival and was reviewed by the BBC Music Magazine as \\"the best of both worlds ... the NDA is a big band playing on period instruments\\". The NDA's CDs for PENTATONE include Early Mannheim String Symphonies by Stamitz and Richter Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 (2003 and 2004), Corelli Concerti Grossi (2004), Joseph Schmitt \\"The Dutch Haydn\\" Early Symphonies (2006) and <> Symphonies / Symphonies from the Court of Orange, The Hague (2009).

Live concert performances of the NDA have been featured on live CD sets by the Dutch national broadcaster and include performances of Mozart and Beethoven Symphonies.  Background  The orchestra was established in 2002. It was launched through a 3-day festival of lectures, recitals, and concerts of chamber and orchestral music presented in the Netherlands' oldest purpose build concert hall, the Felix Meritis, in partnership with Dutch radio NCRV in March 2002. The orchestra made its Festival of Early Music Utrecht début in 2002 and its debut in the Amsterdam Het Concertgebouw in 2004. The orchestra released its first CDs with Pentatone in early 2003, winning an Edison Award in 2004 for its first disc of early, Mannheim school symphonies. The NDA made its début at the Musikfestspiele Potsdam Sanssouci in 2007, Händel Festspiele Halle with Handel's Water Music in 2008, Thüringer Bachwochen in 2009, and at the Bachfest Leipzig in 2010. In the Netherlands, the NDA has appeared at Dutch radio's Zaterdagmatinee series, opened the first ever Festival Classique in The Hague in 2007, and has regularly appeared as a guest at the country's major concert halls. The orchestra regularly co-operates with Dutch radio for concert broadcasts and special projects. For the 2006 NPS/EBU \\"Amsterdam - City of Music\\" project, the NDA created and performed a series of concert programmes of newly rediscovered Dutch 18th century symphonies which were broadcast live to more than 30 countries. In 2009, the NDA represented the Netherlands at the Cultural Olympiade in Vancouver and for the Hudson 400 celebrations in New York. The orchestra became part of the official cultural infrastructure of the city of The Hague in 2009. Through its research and performing activities, the orchestra has been instrumental in rediscovering and reintroducing the Netherlands' own symphonic tradition.

It aired on KBS2 from August 24 to November 10, 2005 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 24 episodes. My Rosy Life was a huge hit, with average viewership ratings of 34.2%, and reaching 47% at its peak. It was the second top-rated Korean drama of 2005 (next to MBC's My Lovely Sam Soon), and was the highest rated among all the KBS dramas aired that year. It is especially notable for the much-praised performance of lead actress Choi Jin-sil. Playing the role of a deserted wife who later discovers that she has cancer, My Rosy Life resurrected Choi's career. Widely known as \\"Korea's Sweetheart\\" in her 15-year acting career, Choi's image as the eternal girl next door was destroyed in 2004 after her acrimonious and highly publicized divorce from baseball player Cho Sung-min, and industry insiders predicted that her career was over. But Choi made a successful comeback in My Rosy Life, as she reinvented herself as a more approachable \\"ajumma\\" (the Korean term for a middle-aged married woman), gaining six kilograms for the role. The pain and suffering of Choi's character blurred the line between reality and fiction, and her performance aroused empathy from TV audiences; with My Rosy Life, she received the best reviews of her career from viewers and critics alike. The cast received acting recognition at the year-end KBS Drama Awards, winning nine awards combined, including Top Excellence Awards for Choi Jin-sil and Kim Hae-sook, and an Excellence Award for Son Hyun-joo. At the Baeksang Arts Awards in 2006, Choi also won Best Actress in a TV Drama, as did Kim Jong-chang for Best TV Director. Plot Maeng Soon-yi (Choi Jin-sil) has sacrificed everything in her life for the sake of others. She missed out on her youth because she was too busy taking care of her father (Jang Yong), who started drinking heavily after her mother abandoned them when Soon-yi was 10 years old. Soon-yi gave up on her own education so that she could earn the money to pay for her younger siblings' tuition. Soon-yi's younger sister Young-yi (Lee Tae-ran), is now a successful career woman. She is having an affair with a married man, Lee Jung- do (Jang Dong-jik). Jung-do was Young-yi's first love, but he broke up with her for the sake of his career. While younger brother Chul-soo has settled down in the United States where he's earning his doctorate degree, completely ignoring his responsibilities at home. Soon-yi perseveres despite the constant hardships that life throws at her. Until one day, she is jolted when Ban Sung- moon (Son Hyun-joo), her husband with whom she has two daughters, tells her that he has fallen in love with another woman and demands a divorce. Worse, she is diagnosed with stomach cancer shortly after. Abandoned by everyone around her, all those who she has worked so hard to make happy her entire life, Soon-yi decides that it's never too late to start living the life you want, and begins to be a little selfish and find some true happiness. When they find out about her disease, her family finally realizes what she means to them. And her husband Sung-moon also rethinks his actions and finally shows her the genuine meaning of marital love.

Since her divorce and its ensuing scandal, MBC had not cast Choi in any dramas for one year, and Choi asked to be released from her contract, but the network refused and took legal action. They eventually reached an out-of-court settlement that enabled Choi to make the KBS drama, after which she finished the remainder of her contract by starring in the 2007 MBC drama Bad Woman, Good Woman.

Overview Published in 1996, the book outlines a two-part hypothesis about revelations. First, it presents a universal design linking all revelations on earth, and explains the continuity of this phenomenon via the arrival of a last and final transmission on earth with future guidance hidden in it, in layers. Humanity is expected to decode the guidance, layer by layer, in different time frames till its end. The second part of the book then analyses the claim of the Qur'an as being that final Message. To support this hypothesis, the author presents several arguments from the historical records describing the advent of Qur'anic revelations (Wahy), its language of communication, its time of arrival, the characteristics of its recipient nation, the information in its contents, and the presence of an interpreting mechanism built into the Qur'an. The effect of the Message is presented, encompassing not only the initial seven centuries of development and progress under Muslim rule, but also the later period extending till today, when as per the author, the chaos gradually took hold of the Muslim realm and a different part of the planet developed, based on the infra-structure of information provided through the fall of Spain. Final chapter of the book is devoted to an analysis of Rashad Khalifa's controversial mathematical structure in the text of Qur'an, pointing out the problems that had become the basis of its rejection in the Muslim world. Plot The story is set sometimes in the twenty-first century. An expanding shell of low energy from the sun's core, moving towards its surface for the last million years, breaks through its outer envelope. The shell is thin, and the slight decrease in the solar output is not expected to last long. Still, the event has tremendous potential of menace. Even this tiny solar hiccup has the capability to push the planet again towards a cold grave, from which it had painfully emerged just twelve thousand years ago. Concurrent with this freak solar activity, a young scientist begins having strange and puzzling dreams of momentous events from the past. He sees an event in the formation of solar event, a day in the Cretaceous period, Noah's Ark being constructed, Buddha's sermon to a large multitude, Moses climbing the mountain to keep tryst with the mysterious fire, child Mary's guardianship being decided in the temple, and an episode in Mohammed's life. The mystic night visions leave the young man perturbed and intrigued, but also prod him to study and collect data on meta-physical aspect of life. Meanwhile, falling temperatures all over the world herald the onset of an ice age. The planet in its fight for survival, tries to distribute the heat stored in oceans all over the land. Tornadoes, squalls and high velocity winds sweep the planet and add to the misery of the humanity already suffering from the energy crunch. It is at this crucial juncture that the young man receives an inspiration, and presents before the world a hypothesis about a 'Grand Cosmic Design'... The Design is aesthetically beautiful, extremely simple and awesome in its expanse. Yet, the most remarkable thing about it is its promise of the expected arrival of a 'Message from stars' that has all the knowledge of Cosmos hidden in it. Spread over six days of teleconference, the young scientist then lays before the world hundreds of arguments, from different disciplines of science, showing to humanity that this 'logically predicted Message of the Design' is not a thing of the future, but is already here, and in order to save the planet, humanity is only required to unravel the information coded within it... But humanity dithers. And as the ice age tightens its talons around the planet, and organic life groans under the increased sufferings, the young man himself decides to work on the Message. Once again he gets help and presents before the world, the ultimate argument, its anomaly and its solution... Reception The book was published independently, and therefore was not widely distributed through commercial channels. Nonetheless, it received critical coverage in a number of media, and was promoted by Sheikha Azza Sultan Al-Qasimi, daughter of Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi. Khaleej Times in an article entitled \\"Holy Quran in Scientific Light\\" dated May 2, 1998 cited a number of commentators on the book: * Uthman Barry (died in 2010), a teacher who hosted the 'Discovering Islam' on Sharjah TV said that \\"This book has interest for religious persons certainly, scientists definitely and even for those interested in science fiction\\". * Syed Khalil, executive director of Galadari Brothers pointed out that 'The Ultimate Revelations' is \\"the first attempt made to present the Quran in a scientific manner to the modern world\\". He also said that \\"its presentation with the aid of mathematical and scientific arguments would give the work credence among even the Western scientific community which was sceptical of all things religious\\". * Dr. Bilal-Abdul Aleem of the Sharjah Auqaf department and co-host of Discovering Islam said that \\"Throughout my education, I was taught that science and religion do not go together,\\" but \\"This book goes a long way in presenting spiritual philosophies to intelligent, scientific people.\\" The book has been called \\"gripping\\", \\"a clever amalgam of fact and fiction\\" and a \\"message from the stars\\". Tariq Abdullah, a religious scholar, called 'The Ultimate Revelations' \\"a unique religion-science fiction, with a purpose and therefore very different from other science fictions\\". The book has, however, been criticised for its author's misunderstanding of Arabic, and for its obsession with numerology.

In 2014, a Pennsylvania woman filed a class action lawsuit against Zeobit LLC, claiming that the company's computer security program identifies problems that don't exist and generates false error messages to scare users into purchasing an upgrade. (see Holly Yencha, et al. v. Zeobit LLC, Case No. 2:13-cv-00578, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.) According to the complaint filed in US District court, \\"Once installed, MacKeeper prompts the user to conduct a diagnostic scan\\", the MacKeeper class action lawsuit says. \\"This scan purportedly detects errors that lead to the problems identified in Zeobit's marketing materials (i.e., performance issues, security and privacy threats)—problems that MacKeeper is supposedly designed to fix.\\" However, the Zeobit class action lawsuit alleges that after the diagnostic scan is completed, MacKeeper reports that it identified thousands of issues that cause the computer to be in \\"critical\\" condition. While the trial version of MacKeeper purports to \\"fix\\" a limited number of the issues, customers are encouraged to purchase a full, registered version of the security software to fully repair the computer. Yencha alleges that neither the free trial nor the full versions of MacKeeper perform reliable diagnostic testing of the computer. \\"Instead, Zeobit intentionally designed MacKeeper to invariably and ominously report that a user's Mac needs repair and is at-risk due to harmful (but fabricated) errors, privacy threats, and other computer problems, regardless of the computer's actual condition\\", the class action lawsuit alleges.

She was in service on the route from Bremen to Baltimore from her 1900 launch until seized by the Allies of World War I in 1914, and was involved in the 1900 Hoboken Docks Fire. Unlike her sister ships Neckar and Rhein, she never entered service for the United States Navy.  History  SS Main was launched on 10 February 1900 by Blohm & Voss of Hamburg, Germany, for North German Lloyd. The ship was long between perpendiculars ( overall) was abeam, and had a draft of . The ship's two quadruple-expansion steam engines turned her twin screw propellers that drove her at speeds of . She had one funnel and four masts and could carry 139 first class passengers, 125 second class passengers and 2500 steerage passengers. Her maiden voyage was on 28 April starting from Bremerhaven to New York City.www.schiffe-maxim.de:Main II (1900 - 1925 ) (German) After only a few months in revenue service she was completely gutted in the 1900 Hoboken Docks Fire on 30 June 1900. Even though the Main was furthest from the fire’s starting point, she was soon on fire. As she was unable to get loose from her moorings for more than seven hours, the damage was nearly beyond repair. The Main was ultimately towed to Weehawken, New Jersey, where she was beached. Amazingly, 16 coal trimmers who had survived the fire hiding in a coal bunker then crawled out of the hulk.“Over 200 Perish in Burning Liners,” New York Times, 1900-07-01. Two days after the fire began, the red-hot ship continued to smolder and smoke, which further delayed rescue and recovery efforts.“Fire Still Holds the Liner Main,” New York Times, 1900-07-03. On 27 July she was refloated and sent to Newport News for repair. On 15 October 1901 she reentered revenue service. The last voyage of Main from Bremen to Baltimore was in June 1914. Afterward she was seized by the Allied forces in Antwerpen, but in October returned to Germany. Following the war, on 21 May 1919 she was awarded to the British Shipping Controller, where she was operated by Turner, Brightman & Co. On 30 June 1921 she was turned over to the French government and laid up. The liner Main was scrapped in 1925.Bronsor, N.R.P. (1978). North Atlantic Seaway, Volume 2.

The station is operated by National Express Coaches, who provide the majority of services. History The station was first opened in 1950 and consisted of three platform islands with long shelters. The station was re-designed in 1963 by Leach Rhodes Walker with the addition of a multi-storey car park and was reopened in 1967. Similar to the original station, it had three platform islands and had a semi-open concourse. The station had a reputation for being a miserable station, with the semi-open concourse making conditions feel cold and windy. The station underwent a major re-build and was reopened in 2002. Services The station is staffed by National Express who operate the majority of services from the station. Eurolines also operates coach services to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Prior to 2018, High Peak operated the Transpeak service to Buxton, Matlock and Derby, a service previously operated by Trentbarton with a fleet of coaches, but was operated with standard buses by High Peak. From 22 July 2018, this service was curtailed at Buxton, and no longer served Manchester or Stockport. National Express's rival company, Megabus used to operate services from outside the coach station on Chorlton Street but moved across the city to Shudehill Interchange in April 2009. Connecting services Blackburn Bus Company and Burnley Bus Company bus services X41 and X43 terminate and start from outside the station, with the X41 running to Ramsbottom and Accrington, and the X43 running to Rawtenstall and Burnley every 15 minutes, and then Colne and Skipton every 30 minutes. Between 2017 and 2018, Cityzap Manchester also started outside the station, for Leeds. This was withdrawn in July 2018 due to low passenger numbers. Stagecoach Manchester service 219 to Ashton-under-Lyne and Metroshuttle service 1 also stop outside the station, while a number of local bus services stop around the corner on Portland Street. Piccadilly Gardens is a three-minute walk away from the coach station, from where many bus services run to destinations across Greater Manchester, along with Metrolink tram services. Piccadilly railway station is a five-minute walk away, from where the majority of regional (Northern and East Midlands Railway) and national (Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales Rail) services depart.

He was the first parliamentary clerk of both the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly in the Victorian colonial parliament. Barker was the eldest son of the late John Barker and Mary Anne, and was born at Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He emigrated to Port Phillip (now Victoria) in 1840, after entering himself for the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and engaged in pastoral pursuits with his brother Edward, afterwards a well-known physician in Melbourne. Revisiting England, he was called to the bar in 1843; and in 1844 married Susanna, daughter of Richard Hodgkinson, of Morton Grange, Nottingham. He returned to Port Phillip in November 1844, accompanied by his brother William (who subsequently practised as a surgeon at Emerald Hill, Melbourne). In the next year he was appointed a magistrate, and in August 1849 was one of the Commissioners under the Disputed Boundaries Act, having the Hamilton district assigned to him. Barker, who was admitted to the Victorian bar in November 1851, was in October of that year, on the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales and its formation into the colony of Victoria, appointed Clerk of the Legislative Council then constituted, and successfully performed the difficult task of inaugurating its procedure. When responsible government came into operation in 1856, Barker was offered the choice of the clerkship of the new Upper or Lower Chamber. He accepted the latter, and remained Clerk of the Assembly until April 1882, when he was appointed Clerk of the Legislative Council and Clerk of Parliaments, a post which he resigned in 1891. He died on 15 November of that year. At his death he was the last surviving participant from either the first parliament or the formation of the Legislative Assembly.

The System Ten, introduced in 1970, featured an early form of logical partitioning. The System Ten was a character-oriented computer, using 6-bit BCD characters and decimal arithmetic. In the early 60s The Singer Sewing Machine Company had a dominant share of the world market in domestic and small industrial sewing machines. By 1962 its chain of retail stores were selling their machines, fabrics, haberdashery and patterns – everything for the housewife who made clothes and furnishings. There were 175 retail stores in the US, and many in Europe as well. Like many chains of small retail stores with a wide product range, stock control and stock swapping were critical to cash flow and profits. Under the leadership of its CEO, Donald P Kircher, Singer therefore approached several computer manufacturers, inviting them to bid for the design and manufacture of computers which could connect to the several tills in each store, and act as the central point for collecting real- time information on stocks and sales. IBM and NCR, then the world’s largest computer companies, rejected the offer to bid, and so did some others. The only company to take up the challenge was Friden, Inc., an American company based in San Leandro, CA which made desktop calculators and accounting machines based on punched paper tape. Singer accepted Friden’s bid. In 1965 Singer bought out Friden, setting it up as Singer Business Machines. It then designed a computer, originally called the Business Data Processor (BDP) and soon renamed the System Ten. In 1969, Singer Business Machines created a subsidiary, the Advanced Systems Division, in each Western European country to launch and market the Singer System Ten. Newly appointed Managers and Directors were trained in the technology and the marketing strategy, and the Singer System Ten was launched throughout Europe on April 2, 1970. The design of the System 10 was revolutionary, because of the special requirements of what are now called “point of sale” systems. The machine had no operating system that scheduled the use of the processor: instead, it would have up to 20 'partitions' each of which had dedicated memory of up to 10 kilobytes, and a common area that all partitions could access, limited initially to 10K in the earlier models but expanded up to 100K in later ones. The system was called “The System Ten” because it performed all of its computations in decimal, as opposed to its counterparts which operated in binary. (It was never called “System 10”, with or without a hyphen, although many countries tried to rename it. In Spain, the complaint was that “System Ten” means “Hold the system!”). Each partition in turn would handle up to 10 I/O devices, depending on the partition type. For devices such as terminals, printers, card readers and punches, a 'Multi-Terminal IOC (input-output channel) was installed, which ran at about 20 kbit/s. The partition would respond to CPU I/O instructions to retrieve and transfer data in bursts from terminal devices to main memory, there were no small or single character transfers of data to reduce the demand for access to the processor memory. The processor would cycle through each partition in turn, bypassing those that had an I/O instruction in progress, and executing instructions in the others until either a new I/O was posted or 16.7ms (20ms in Europe) had elapsed and a successful branch instruction was encountered. Theoretically it was possible to 'hog' the processor if a successful branch or I/O instruction was never encountered. There were several other types of partitions that could be installed, for the retail terminals an MD (multi-data IOC) was used, which could control up to 10 or them. These devices buffered an entire transaction which was sent in a burst as a speed of 1200 bits per second. As all transfers were made directly from the partition into memory, it was only possible to have one active transmission per terminal at a time, which could cause some devices to 'time out' during transmission on a busy system. In addition, three types of serial communications controllers were available, a synchronous communications adapter, which was capable of emulating the IBM 2780 terminal of the day, however in ASCII, not in EBCDIC, and an asynchronous version of the same was also available, but both were limited to line speeds of no more than 2400 bit/s, the maximum dial-up rate of the day. Another serial controller called the Asynchronous Terminal Adapter (ATA), enable a character-oriented terminal to be interconnect, at a maximum speed of 300 bit/s. Strictly speaking it was not 10K, but 10,000 characters per partition as the System Ten’s memory consisted of 6-bit characters. It took 10 characters to make up one instruction, so each partition was only able to accommodate 1,000 instructions. The instruction set was extremely small, simple and powerful. The original processor, the model 20, had only 13 instructions, but its successor, the model 21 had 16 instructions, and it was mostly programmed in assembler language. Although relatively simplistic in its syntax, the assembler had a built-in macro language that was extremely powerful and complex, based on a string matching and parsing language. No machine language translator since has come anywhere close to this level of complexity, probably as few understood it, and the processing time for even the smallest programs could be prohibitively long. ICL System 25 console The machine obviously had a longer history in North America than in the UK, which started when the Singer Business Machines division was bought by ICL in 1976. At the time of the sale ICL estimated that there were 8,000 System Tens in use around the world. ICL continued to market the system as the ICL System 10, but also attempted to wean customers off it and onto their mainstream product offering, the 2900 series, by introducing a transition machine called the ME/29. When this strategy failed, they turned to a division of Singer which made intelligent terminals, to re-engineer the system and bring it up the then modern day standards and considerable reduce its size and power consumption, and the model 25, the last iteration of the machine, was then created. In the UK the marketing strategy was that customers would be trained in the assembler, and would write their own programs. This was the only serious strategic error Singer made. Some European Singer Business Machines companies ignored this strategy, and set up small internal software houses to write customers’ applications. Within two years, some of these software houses were independent of Singer, and specialized in supporting their national System Ten customers. In North America several other languages had appeared, including a 'table processor' approach to computing which was simple to learn, and an RPG/RPGII compiler which was later added with the advent of a second generation assembler that included a linker, a program which could bind several assembled modules together into a single executable. There were also tools called lpgc and Super Opus (from Safe Computing Ltd.), which used a data layout from the ICL tool for updating the files to define the layout of the data. LPGC was a report tool mostly though you could accept data at the start or if you patched the machine code you could do it in flight. Singer also created software packages for retail applications, which grew out of its installed customer base, the largest of which was at the John Wanamaker's Department store in Philadelphia. New installations were facilitated by only having to make customizations to the original code rather than having to re-write it from scratch each time, enabling larger installations to be turned up quickly. In England, Welwyn Department Store in Welwyn Garden City (now a branch of John Lewis) was the first to implement the System Ten as originally planned, and this became a flagship installation. Despite its major thrust as a retail backroom machine, it was still sold as a general purpose business computer, as it did support the common peripherals of the day such as video terminals, punched cards, printers and, later, disc and magnetic tape storage for sales, stock and accounting applications. It eventually faded into history with the end of the minicomputer era, when the PC became the more popular computing platform.

With Magen Broshi he discovered a number of residential caves in the near vicinity of Qumran and co-published a number of historically significant documents from Qumran. Academic progress Eshel received his academic training at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completing his B.A. at the Institute of Archaeology in 1984, his M.A. 1985–1988 and his Ph.D. in 1993, both in the Jewish History Department. His PhD was on the origins of Samaritanism. While working on his PhD he started teaching in the department of Land of Israel Studies and Archeology at Bar-Ilan University. That was in 1990. He would remain at Bar-Ilan for the next twenty years, receiving an appointment as an associate professor in 1999 and serving as head of the department between 2002 and 2004. The archaeologist As an archaeologist Eshel worked in 1986 and 1993 at a number of caves in the Judaean Desert where refugees hid from the Romans during the Bar Kokhba revolt. In one cave near Jericho he found 19 business documents in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. From 1995 to 1999 he co-directed five seasons at Tel Yatir near Arad. Eshel carried out three seasons at Qumran with Magen Broshi in 1996, 2001 and 2002, discovering amongst other things the remains of a series of caves inhabited at the time of use of the Qumran settlement. In 2004 Eshel was shown fragments of ancient Hebrew texts reportedly being offered on the black market. This was apparently an attempt by the holder to estimate the worth of his find. The following year Eshel found that the text had not been sold and so with money from Bar-Ilan University he purchased the material and turned it over to the Israel Antiquities Authority. He believed the fragments, from the book of Leviticus, originated in one of the caves in Nahal Arugot used as refuges from the Romans in the second century.From an AP report in the Charlestown Post and Courier Publications Eshel edited numerous books and published over 200 articles.

The name comes from the castle of Pietrapelosa (also called Kostel), at the center of the estate. The Gravisi-Barbabianca Palace and Gravisi-Buttorai Palace in Koper were both family residences. Foundation The first Marquis was Nicolò Gravisi, who foiled a plot in 1435 to betray Padua to Marsilio da Carrara and in return in 1439 received a pension of 400 ducats from the Republic of Venice. From 1440 the pension was reduced to 250 ducats in exchange for the Marquisate of Pietrapelosa, which gave an annual income of 150 ducats. It was the largest estate in Istria, a collection of villages between Koper, Buzet and the border with the Habsburg county. Nicolò Gravisi renovated the Pietrapelosa castle for use as a summer residence. In 1635 a fire destroyed the interior of the castle, but it was restored and inhabited until the 18th century. Notable family members Nicolò Gravisi had four sons, each of whom founded branches of the family. In 1446 the Gravisi were admitted to the nobility of Capodistria with the title of Marquis. In 1662 this was confirmed in Venice, and later in Austria by the Emperor Francis I. The family included both scholars and soldiers. Pietro Gravisi (1520–88) commanded a galley during the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, and fought in the War of Siena and against the Ottomans. Lucrezio Gravisi (1558-1613) was a cavalry commander in the army of the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa, who made him a knight for his services in Prussia and Russia. Several of the rectors of the school in Koper were from the family. Giuseppe (1704–74) was a writer and poet. One of the more notable members of the family was the scholar Girolamo Gravisi. Gravisi was born at Pietrapelosa on 15 June 1720. He was a humanist who read widely in Hebrew and Greek, studying theology and also literature. Among his surviving work is a 16-page manuscript on the Lutheran reformer Matthias Flacius, declared a heretic by the Catholic church. Gerolamo's son Dionysius was born in 1750. He was also a scholar and a poet. He made a translation of Voltaire's Alzira which was performed in many theaters in Italy. Dionysius was sickly since childhood and died in Venice in 1768. In 1782 the two branches of the Gravisi family controlled 36% of the olive presses in Koper. After the olives were badly damaged by cold in the winter of 1782-83, the Senate of Venice called on the patricians in Koper to advance studies of agriculture, particularly of olive groves. Eventually, Marquis Girolamo Gravisi wrote a Memoir on the olive trees in 1794-95. The Republic of Venice fell to the French army led by Napoleon in 1797, with Trieste occupied in April 1797. The pension paid to the Gravisi was stopped, and the Gravisi started a long correspondence with the Austrians and the French to get it restored. In October 1808 Girolamo Gravisi was named by the French viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais as a candidate for the Senate of the new Kingdom of Italy. He died in Koper on 31 March 1812 aged 92. The Gravis family owned the castle of Pietrapelosa until the final abolition of the feudal system in 1869. They were the only aristocratic family in Koper to own such an estate. As late as 1878 Caterina De Gravisi, widow of Giuseppe Gravisi, was recorded as the owner of the Palazzo Gravisi Buttorai in Koper.

Biography According to Prospero Petronio the Gravisi family originated in Tuscany. A Domenico de Gravisi was mentioned as living in Pirano in 1337. Nicolò Gravisi was born in 1396, son of Vanto Gravisi di Pirano. In the night of 7 March 1435 Gravisi was captain of the guard of one door to the city of Padua. He discovered a plot by some Paduans to deliver it to Marsilio, son of the former ruler Francesco Novello da Carrara, who had been deposed and later executed. He arrested the rebels and saved the city for the republic. As a reward for this and many other actions, on 10 March 1440 the doge Francesco Foscari assigned an annual pension of 260 gold ducats to Gravisi and his successors, granted him the castle and estates of Pietrapelosa, and gave him the title of Marquis of Pietrapelosa. Pietrapelosa, which gave an annual income of 150 ducats, was a collection of \\"villes\\" between Capodistria (Koper), Pinguentino (Buzet) and the border with the Habsburg County of Pazin. It was the largest estate in Istria. It included the domains of Stridone, San Quirico, Cepici, Salice and Pregara. The family was accepted into the Great Council of Capodistria on 25 March 1466. Legacy After the death of Nicolò Gravisi the family was divided into four branches, the descendants of his sons Michele, Gravise, Pietro and Vanto. The family of the first-born Michele i Gravisi created ties of marriage with the Barbabianca and Bocchina families. In the nineteenth century the heirs of Gravise and Pietro were still settled in Buzet. The descendants of Vanto, the fourth son, lived in Koper. Some became well-known writers and scholars.

He was on Sabbatical to ICFOSS as its founding Director during 2011–15. FishNet and Internet Advocacy (1993–94) Satish Babu was one of the earliest users and passionate advocates of the Internet from Kerala. He started using the Internet in 1993 at the Hull University, UK. He was a part of the IndiaLink programme of the Indian Social Institute, Delhi, which attempted to connect NGOs through email on the Internet in the mid-1990s. In 1994, he set up and ran the Trivandrum node of the IndiaLink email network, called FishNet (fishnet.frlht.ernet.in), which is perhaps the earliest free, open, public email service in Kerala. FishNet used the Waffle/UUCP BBS software on an MS-DOS PC, and provided free email services to anyone equipped with an acoustic modem. The uplink to the Internet was to ERNET in Bangalore, through FRLHT, a Bangalore-based NGO. FishNet continued its services until Internet was made available in Kerala through local dialup in 1996. Public access to Internet in India was provided by VSNL on 15 August 1995 for the first time. However, users from non-metros had to use expensive STD dial-up or the cumbersome X.25 to connect to these access points. In particular, Kerala had no local access points in 1995. He announced to the world in 1996 the arrival of public dial-up Internet in Kerala, through a post on the soc.culture.indian.kerala Usenet board. Free Software Satish was one of the earliest advocates of Free Software in India. He was the spokesperson and chief organizer of the 2001 \\"Freedom First!\\" Conference that introduced the concept and vision of Free Software in Kerala and India. Later, he was a co- founder of the Society for Promotion of Alternative Computing and Employment (SPACE ) and its Executive Secretary during 2003–2010. As the founding Director of the International Centre for Free and Open Source Software (ICFOSS), he was involved in setting up and building the institution from 2011 through 2015. He has convened several conferences and workshops on Free Software, including FOSS workshops at the Internet Governance Forum. ICANN Satish Babu is a volunteer in ICANN.

He was a co-founder of the India School on Internet Governance, (31 Oct – 2 Nov 2016), the first edition of which was organized just prior to the ICANN57 Meeting at Hyderabad. The objective of inSIG was to \\"...to train professionals in the domain of Internet Governance, equipping them with the skills to enable them to participate effectively in global Internet Governance processes and institutions.\\" A total of 44 participants successfully completed the program (including 15 international participants). inSIG was supported by the Government of India (through NIXI), ICANN, Internet Society , IIIT-Hyderabad, APNIC, and the Asia-Pacific School of Internet Governance (APSIG ), and was held at the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad, during 31 Oct 2016 – 2 Nov 2016. Co-locating with ICANN enabled inSIG to invite eminent experts in Internet Governance who are attending ICANN57 as faculty. It is also significant that inSIG reserved some seats for candidates from other countries in the region. Satish Babu has stated, \\"...although the primary objective of inSIG is to build capacity for Indian stakeholders, we also are committed to capacity building for the region. Initiatives such as inSIG, we believe, will encourage more participation from this region in global internet governance platforms such as ICANN, ISOC and Internet Governance Forum.\\" Satish was a supporter and organizer of the Asia- Pacific School on Internet Governance (), and was involved in creating its bylaws.

Argus' parentage is debated, but most often he is referred to be the son of Arestor. Arestor, a member of the Argive royal house, is given as his father by Apollonius RhodiusArgonautica 1. 112 and John Tzetzes,Tzetzes on Lycophron 883: \\"[son] of Arestor or Alector\\" but Hyginus says Argus' parents were Polybus and ArgiaHyginus, Fabulae, 14 or Danaus to be his father.Hyginus. Fabulae, 14.5 In Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica, Argus is said to have originated from Thespiae.Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica, 1. 93 & 124 Argus was also credited with creating a wooden statue of Hera that was a cult object in Tiryns.Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, 1. 1119, 2. 613; Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus, 4. 14. 7 referring to Demetrius' Argolica The Golden Fleece King Pelias did not believe that the crew would be able to come back with the Golden Fleece successfully because he knew that the king of Colchis would not part with it easily, and that a never-sleeping dragon guarded it. So the King gave Jason (leader of the Argonauts and son of Zeus) all the timber and the crew he needed. Argus was then selected to build the ship, and he was said to have constructed the ship under Athena's guidance. Athena with the help of Argus put a piece of a sacred oak on the prow of the ship that was taken from the sacred grove of Zeus at Dodona.This sacred piece of wood has the ability to speak in times of danger and advise Jason, the leader of the Argonauts what to do. Argus did such a great job constructing this ship that at the time it was referred to the “most seaworthy ship ever seen. The Argo was also notably the first ship that Argus ever built. Argus as one of the Argo’s crew included the very well known Greek heroes: Jason, the leader, Augeas, Theseus, Meleager, Peleus, Telamon, Nauplius, Orpheus, and Heracles. Many of the crew were fathers of Trojan War heroes. The Argonauts He should not be confused with the hundred-eyed giant Argus Panoptes.

She was born from the goddess and Sri Kameshwara. She is a form of the goddess Ashokasundari.  References in Hindu literature  Within the Brahmāņḍa Purāņa, Bālā Tripurasundarī is mentioned in chapter 26 of the Lalitā Māhātmya, where she joins the battle against the forces of the arch- demon Bhaņḍa:Shastri, J.L.: \\"The Brahmanda Purana - Part IV\\" pages=1174-1175. Motilal Barnasidass Publishers, reprint 1999 : On hearing that the sons of Daitya Bhaņḑa the chief of whom was Caturbāhu had come for the purpose of fighting, Bālā (the daughter of Lalitā) showed interest in it. She was the daughter of Lalitā Devi. She came from the golden kavasa of lalita. She always stayed near the goddess. She was worthy of being worshipped by all Śaktis. She was adept in martial feats and exploits. Her form and features were like those of Lalitā. She was always like a nine-year-old girl, yet she was a great mine of all lore. Her body was like the rising sun. Her creeper-like slender body was [missing text] in complexion. She was perpetually present near the footrest of the great queen. She was as it were the vital breath of the goddess moving externally. She was her fourth eye. She became furious and thought thus : \\"I shall immediately kill those sons of Bhanda who have come here\\". After making up her mind thus, Bālāmbā submitted to the great queen. : \\"Mother, the sons of Bhaņḑa, the great Daitya, have come to fight. I wish to fight with them. I am interested in this because I am a young girl. My arms throb with an itching sensation for war. This is my playful activity. It should not be curbed by your orders for prohibition. Indeed I am a girl loving toys and playful pastimes. By this play of fighting for a moment, I shall become delighted mentally.\\" : \\"Dear child, your limbs are very tender and soft. You are only nine years old. This is your first step and performance. Your training in warfare is fresh and recent. You are my only daughter. Without you, my breathing activity does not go on even for a moment. You are my very vital breath. Do not go in for the great war. We have Daņḑinī, Mantriņī and crores of other great Śaktis for fighting. Dear child, why do you commit this blunder?\\" Although prevented thus by Śri Lalitādevī, the girl was overcome by curiosity. She requested once again for permission to fight. On observing her steadfast decision, Srīlalitā, the mother, granted her permission after closely clasping her in her arms. She took off one of her armors and gave it to her. From her weapons, she gave her the requisite weapons and sent her off. Kūmārikā got into the covered palanquin that had been extracted by the great queen from the staff of her bow and to which hundreds of swans were yoked for drawing. She killed all 30 sons of the daemon Bhandasura which was extremely difficult to do.  Recent books on Hindu Spirituality  The author David Frawley describes Bala Tripura Sundari as:Frawley, David: \\"Tantric Yoga and the Wisdom Goddesses\\", page 90. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, reprint 2005 : Tripura Sundari is often represented as a girl of sixteen years age. As such she is called \\"sixteen\\" (shodashi) or \\"the young girl\\" (bala). At this stage of a woman's life, the delight aspect of her existence is most pronounced. Her nature is to play, to seek new experiences, and to charm others to her. Her innocence attracts all to her that is true and good. As a young girl Sundari guides the young aspirant on the path, representing the innocence of initial aspiration that we should preserve throughout our entire journeying into the infinite.

Life  He was the second eldest son of Count Simon VII of Lippe and his first wife Anna Catherine of Nassau-Wiesbaden. When his father died in 1627, Simon Louis was still underage. His step-grandfather, Count Christian of Waldeck was selected as his regent and guardian. His paternal uncle, Count Otto of Lippe-Brake was unavailable, due to the strained relationship between Lippe-Detmold and Lippe- Brake. His maternal uncle, John Louis of Nassau-Hadamar, was not asked because he was a Catholic. As was usual among members of his class, Simon Louis made a Grand Tour. His tour started in 1627 and brought him to Prague, France, England and the Netherlands. After he returned to Detmold in 1631, he applied to Emperor Ferdinand II to be declared of age early. Influenced by his chancellor Christoph Deichmann, Simon Louis gradually moved away from his father's cautious policy of neutrality and approached Sweden. This brought him into conflict with the imperial troops. The other side did no spare Lippe either. The Swedes demanded food supplies and the imperial troops demanded money. In 1634, Schwalenberg Castle was attacked and looted and in 1636, the same happened to Varenholz Castle. Simon Louis died of smallpox at the age of 26, on 8 August 1636 in Detmold. He was succeeded as Count of Lippe-Detmold by his eldest son, Simon Philip. Since Simon Philip was still a minor, Count Christian of Waldeck was appointed as regent again.  Marriage and issue  On 19 June 1631, Simon Louis married Countess Catherine of Waldeck (1612-1649), the daughter of his guardian Count Christian of Waldeck, and also a younger sister of his stepmother, Maria Magdalena (1606-1671).

The resort area was founded in the late nineteenth century and popular through the first half of the twentieth century. It surrounds Eagles Mere Lake. (master's thesis) Architecture and history The kidney-shaped Eagles Mere Lake covers 230 acres and is about 3/4 mile long. It is a natural spring-fed lake with exceptionally clear water in the Allegheny Mountains at an elevation of 2100 feet. Early resort promoters prohibited construction and tree cutting within 100 feet of the lake to protect the shoreline. The shoreline continues to be forested and is now owned by the Eagles Mere Association. Pristine forested areas with hiking trails surround the lake, and they are in turn surrounded by several thousand acres of more forest. The village sits at the south end of the lake; there is a small beach at the north end. Just north of the beach is the neighborhood called Eagles Mere Park. This neighborhood developed out of a Chatauqua which lasted from 1897 to 1902. The twelve houses of the original Chatauqua are still extant and 42 similar houses were built before 1930. The district includes 234 contributing buildings, 1 contributing site, and 6 contributing structures in the resort community of Eagles Mere. The buildings date to the late-19th and early-20th century and include cottages, boat houses, commercial buildings, churches, and outbuildings. Cottage architecture reflects a number of popular styles including Queen Anne, Bungalow / American craftsman, and Prairie School.

Over the years, his painting evolved from academic art to impressionism. Alongside Emile Claus, he is one of the earliest representatives of luminism in Belgium.  Biography = Youth  Évariste Carpentier was born into a modest family of farmers in Kuurne. He became a pupil at the Academy of Fine Arts of Courtrai in 1861, under the direction of Henri De Pratere. There, he obtained many distinctions. In 1864 he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp where he received tuition from Nicaise de Keyser. He proved to be gifted in painting from life, and achieved the prize of excellence in 1865, which allowed him to obtain a private studio in the Academy the following year.  Early career  Chouans in Ambush at the Battle of La Gravelle (1793), Musée d'art et d'histoire de Cholet In 1872, Carpentier established himself in Antwerp and acquired his own studio. It is there that he painted many commissioned works, which did not yet reflect his artistic personality. He began his career addressing religious topics, themes of antiquity and scenes inspired by the Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th century, but it is in the field of historical painting that he became well known. The painting \\"Les premières nouvelles du désastre de la Grande Russie\\", exhibited at the Artistic Circle of Antwerp in 1872, is an example of this success. In response to the academic tastes of his time, he liked to paint farm animals and, more generally, the charms of rural life. At around this period, Évariste Carpentier befriended some of his classmates from the Academy, including Emile Claus, Theodoor Verstraete, Frans Hens and Jan Van Beers. They met often at the exhibitions organised by the Artistic Circle of Antwerp.Johan de Smet, with introduction by Willy Van Den Bussche: \\"Emile Claus: 1849-1924\\". Monografieën over Provinciaal Museum voor Moderne Kunst (Ostend, Belgium). Snoeck-Ducaju & Zoon (Gent) - Pandora (Antwerpen) / Gemeentekrediet, 1997 From 1874 to 1877, Émile Claus occupied a corner of Carpenter’s studio.Citation de Léon Tombu in \\"Peintres et sculpteurs à l'aube du xxe siècle\\", Liège, Aug. Benard, 1907, p.82 In 1876, an old knee injury, caused in his youth, developed serious complications and threatened to require amputation. The pain prevented him from working. He left Antwerp to return to his hometown, where his sister provided him with care and treatment for the next three years.  France  thumbThe Lady-strangers (1887) Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium On the advice of his doctor, Carpentier left Kuurne in 1879 for the south of France, in order to speed up his recovery. The following year, on his return, he stopped in Paris, where he met his friend Jan Van Beers. He was persuaded to move to the French capital, where Van Beers would share his studio with him. Carpentier began to produce realistic paintings of Parisian bourgeoisie. In 1881, he was finally able to get rid of his crutches permanently and settled in 71 Boulevard de Clichy. He then followed his passion of historical painting. Scenes of the French Revolution, as well as the episodes of the War in the Vendée, became his main sources of inspiration. Having always had a predilection for dramatic episodes, Carpentier refined his composition skills in the search of better ways to depict the pathetic character of minor historical facts, such as those in \\"Chouans en déroute\\" (1883) and \\"Madame Roland à la prison Sainte-Pélagie\\" (1886).Carpentier a peint la prison Ste Pélagie (Paris) : Sa Madame Roland insultée par des prostituées s'inspire de \\"l'Histoire des Girondins\\" par Lamartine.

Stavelot, Ed. Chauveheid, 1991. His paintings became highly appreciated by the public. Promenade en bord de mer (Menton, 1888) This success constituted, however, an obstacle from his discovery of \\"plein air\\" painting. In this regard, the year 1884 marked a turning point in his career. Carpentier finally left the conventions of academism and found his true artistic voice. After discovering the works of Jules Bastien-Lepage, he began to dedicate himself to \\"plein air\\" painting, turning to nature through the Realism movement. He stayed for two seasons principally at Saint-Pierre-lès-Nemours, near the forest of Fontainebleau, but also at Le Tréport and at Saint-Malo.  Return to Belgium  Washing turnips (1890) , Liège Although Carpentier only gave up his studio in Paris in 1892, he returned to Belgium in 1886. There, he witnessed the increasing popularity of impressionism among artists from Brussels, such as Les XX. During his long stay in France, he had already been exposed to impressionists, but he had been influenced to a greater extent by the naturalism of Jules Bastien-Lepage and Jules Breton. His initial outdoor paintings, which had been produced with darker, thicker strokes, gave way to a noticeably brighter palette and progressively lighter brushstrokes. Once established in Belgium, he continued to travel. From 1886 to 1896, he travelled through the Belgian and French countryside, seeking new landscapes. He frequently visited the Campine in Genk with his friends, the landscape artists Franz Courtens and Joseph Coosemans. He also visited Brittany, a region that had a particularly strong influence on him. In 1888, Carpentier married Jeanne Smaelen in Verviers. Five children were produced from this marriage.One of his sons, Fritz Carpentier (1890-1978), specialised in natural sciences and became an eminent Belgian entomologist, pioneer of the morphology of insects. He became the curator of the collections of the Institute of Zoology of Liège, from 1922 to 1958. He was later in charge of the course of morphology and systematics of invertebrates in Zoological Sciences at the University of Liège (Prix Adolphe Crèvecœur, 1962) In 1890, the young couple moved to Belgian Brabant, at Overijse, where Carpentier painted \\"Washing Turnips\\", an important work that earned the artist a medal in Paris, and which was acquired by the MAMAC in Liège.Jacques Goijen, Dictionnaire des peintres de l'École Liégeoise du Paysage. Éditions, 2009 The Small Pond. Museum of Fine Arts, Verviers In 1892, Carpentier moved again, this time to La Hulpe. During this period, the artist flourished and sought to find the truth of nature, according to his impressionist vision, parallel to that of his friend Emile Claus. He turned to delicate tones and atmospheric touches. Carpentier became one of the most active propagators of luminism.  Professor and director  In January 1897, Carpentier applied for the position of professor of painting at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Liège, which had been vacant since the death of Émile Delperée. Musing While serious in his candidature, Carpentier had a disadvantage: he was not from Liège. This was a source of contention. Nevertheless, and despite the backlash from Walloons, he was eventually given the position and moved to Rue Mont Saint-Martin in Liège. He was 51 years old. In 1904, Carpentier succeeded Prosper Drion as the director of the Academy, a position which he held until 1910. In spite of the disputes caused by his promotion, which hurt him deeply, he carried out his task with the same dedication.\\"Il semble que ce poste (de directeur) lui était destiné dès son arrivée à Liège. C'est du moins ce qu'il (Évariste Carpentier) laisse sous- entendre dans un courrier plus tardif concernant sa mise à la retraite.\\" Gaëtane Warzée, À la recherche de... Évariste Carpentier, cat. expo. Espace BBL Liège, 1997-1998 From 1905 he lived in Rue Hors-château, still in Liège. By becoming a professor, Évariste Carpentier helped reshape the evolution of Liège painting. He freed local painting from academic conventions, popularising the impressionist aesthetic. Le goûter des dames He taught many artists, some of whom did not try to imitate his style. Among the best known of his students who were significantly influenced by his approach were Armand Jamar, Albert Lemaître and José Wolff. Other Liège artists that passed through his class were Fernand Steven, Robert Crommelynck, Adrien Dupagne, Marcel Caron, Jean Donnay and Auguste Mambour. In addition, he provided guidance and advice to painters who did not attend his class, such as Xavier Wurth. The painter of the Ardennes, Richard Heintz, also benefitted from Carpentier’s encouragement. From 1906, Carpentier spent his summer holidays in Vieuxville, at a house called L'Abbaye de Stavelot. Carpentier retired in 1919, and died in Liège on 12 September 1922, following a long illness. Femmes séchant le linge  Artwork and legacy  During his life, Carpentier achieved a great success. Throughout his career, he won many prizes and awards at international exhibitions, both in Europe and in the United States, receiving the golden medals at Antwerp, Munich and Berlin for \\"Summer sun\\" (1896), Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Nice. His work was practically forgotten shortly after his death. However, it was rediscovered towards the end of the 20th century. The importance of his work is now recognised for his contribution as a teacher in the Academy of Liège, where he taught a new way of painting, as well as for the whole of his work as an essential link in the development of modern Belgian painting.

Firefighting, among other tasks, was undertaken by volunteers and employees of the municipalities. At the same time, in Nicosia, the “Police Fire Brigade” was formed to the standards of other British colonies of the time, with Police Officers being organised into firefighting groups, depending on the circumstances and the time. In 1935 with the reorganization of the Police, the “Police Fire Brigade” was organized on a firmer basis, introducing new vehicles, permanent staff (that were serving as Police Special Constables and were specifically trained for the task) and with a fire station next to the Paphos Gate Police station, both of which exist at the same location today. With the outbreak of the Second World War and the establishment of the British Department of Air Defence for the protection from air raids, firefighting teams were established in all cities. With the end of the war, fire stations were established in the towns of Limassol and Famagusta. Permanent Police Officers along with emergency personnel were manning the stations. The Fire Service, in its present form, was launched in the mid-1950s, to meet the needs of the British that arose, due to the anti-colonial struggle of Cypriots and the developments in the Suez area. New Fire Stations were created in all cities with permanent staff and with the legislation which is in force until today, the \\"Cyprus Fire Service\\" was formed within the organizational structure of the police. Disaster Response Special Unit=History Although the formation of a special unit responding to disasters within the structure of the Fire Service was a concept that existed for several years, there were no significant steps made to implement it, but the large destructive earthquakes that struck Cyprus’ neighboring countries, Turkey and Greece in 1999, revealed the urgent need to create such a special unit for dealing with major disasters in the country. So, on 2 April 2002, the Cyprus Fire Service, established (Greek: ) or directly translated into Special Unit Dealing with Catastrophes, which is staffed by 50 firefighters from almost all districts of Cyprus. The unit is based in Kofinou due to the central location of this community, to allow easy access in the areas of Cyprus that are not occupied. Training For the success of the Unit’s objectives the specialised training of the men is required, so the men of the Unit received training both in Cyprus and abroad. Courses in Cyprus mainly involved climbing and rappelling on steep areas to rescue people, classes to handle polytraumatic patients and rescuing people that were involved in traffic accidents. Unit members were also trained in countries abroad. Specifically in the U.S. and Singapore the men were trained in earthquake rescue and in Sweden they were trained on how to deal with chemical materials. Number of elite members of the Unit also received specialised search and rescue Scuba diving training for sea, lakes and dams. The Unit recently acquired a specialised rescue team, for earthquake or open spaces rescue, with the use of trained tracking dogs. The training took place in Cyprus from qualified instructors and the last stage of the program took place on the premises of the equivalent agency in Greece.

Equivalently, the boolean hierarchy can be described as the class of boolean circuits over NP predicates. A collapse of the boolean hierarchy would imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy.  Formal definition  BH is defined as follows: * BH1 is NP. * BH2k is the class of languages which are the intersection of a language in BH2k-1 and a language in coNP. * BH2k+1 is the class of languages which are the union of a language in BH2k and a language in NP. * BH is the union of the BHi  Derived classes  * DP (Difference Polynomial Time) is BH2.  Equivalent definitions  Defining the conjunction and the disjunction of classes as follows allows for more compact definitions. The conjunction of two classes contains the languages that are the intersection of a language of the first class and a language of the second class. Disjunction is defined in a similar way with the union in place of the intersection. * C ∧ D = { A ∩ B  A ∈ C B ∈ D } * C ∨ D = { A ∪ B  A ∈ C B ∈ D } According to this definition, DP = NP ∧ coNP.

She is best known for attending the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, held in North Korea and praising President of North Korea Kim Il Sung in 1989, without first obtaining permission from the South Korean government. She attended the festival representing the student organization Jeondaehyop, now known as Hanchongryun. Upon her return to South Korea, she was arrested and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment.  Activism and political career  Lim was given the nickname Flower of Unification or Flower of Reunification () by the North Korean government after she visited Pyongyang. She was arrested on charges of violating the National Security Act after she returned to the South through Panmunjom. She was sentenced to prison for a term of 5 years, but served 2 years and six months before her release on good behavior. She was pardoned in 1999 by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. Lim claims that her attendance at the Festival was a purely selfless act. In April 2012, she was elected as a member of the 19th National Assembly as the Democratic United Party's 21st proportional representative. In June 2012, in a confrontation with a North Korean defector in a bar, Lim hurled insults and referred to a ruling party lawmaker as a \\"son-of-a-bitch betrayer\\" and another as a \\"traitor\\" in what has been described by Korea JoonAng Daily as \\"an alcohol-fueled tirade at a Seoul restaurant\\", questioning their legitimacy to challenge her as a lawmaker. This led to public protests. The Argentinian filmmaker José Luis García made the 2012 documentary La chica del sur (\\"The Girl From the South\\"), focusing on Lim, as well as his experience participating in the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, where he met her.La chica del sur IMDb The film shows Lim's struggle for a united Korea in 1989, and two further reunions between her and Garcia in South Korea and Argentina in 2012. La chica del sur tries to show the development of her thoughts and character after years of media attention, prison, the death of her son and divorce.

It marked the comeback of Avati to the thriller genre (a genre he had successfully explored decades before in films such as The House with Laughing Windows and Zeder) after a series of intimate dramas and nostalgic comedies. A more silent but very well made film from the Giallo Genre by Pupi Avati, that plays perfectly with the dark, gloomy atmosphere of an old, spooky house and its deadly secrets. The protagonist of the film spent 15 years of her life in a mental asylum, recovering from a nervous breakdown, after her husband committed suicide. With the intention to start a new life and to open a restaurant, she moves into an old, historical mansion. But she starts to feel she is not alone in this big, dark, building.. hearing frightening voices in the darkness and seeing things in the house, she starts to doubt her own mental sanity again, until she discovers a gruesome crime that happened 50 years back and its horrible secret. Plot One winter night, a young novice is brought back to the convents house by a chauffeur. He is saying the young girl doesn't feel well. Later on they found out she has been raped. The police is instantly informed but unwilling to do anything, as the offender seems to belong to a very rich family. The nuns are in rage and demand justice, while the rape-victim asks her befriended novice sister to help her, as the offender promised to marry her if she remains silent. Believing this lie, she tries to convince the other novice sister into helping her. 50 years later: A woman moves into the same house, after she spent 15 years in a mental asylum, due to a nervous breakdown caused by a heavy traumatic shock after her husband committed suicide. Her psychiatrist releases her from care, telling her to get in contact with him, if she starts to hear voices again. As her husband left her a good fortune, she decides to start a new life and to open restaurant in an old, historic mansion. Moving in, the first incidents start to occur. As she steps into the house she suddenly starts to feel sick and seems to have a small panic attack. She ignores these signs, believing them into being leftovers from her old trauma. Eaven before the furniture is brought in, the first scary incident happens. Suddenly she starts to hear a gruesome voice in the house, singing and whispering when she's alone. As the scary incidents start to increase and her fear starts to grow, she is finally convinced that she is not alone in this big, dark house. She seeks help from a befriended priest and contacts her psychiatrist, but no one seems to believe her. Completely alone, unable to get help, she starts to investigate by herself. As the electricity seems to not keep working, she starts to search the entire house with a light bulb and finds cages with rats in the attic. She flees in terror that night. Unwilling and to stubborn to leave the house, she starts to investigate about the history of the house and finds out that it once belonged to the church as a boarding house for nuns and novices. Finally the electricians arrive. Before leaving, they mention to her that this house is known as \\"Snakes hole\\" and known for its horrible past. She visits a local man, that tells her about a horrible murder case that occurred in this house 50 years ago: they found the bodies of three murdered convent women and two of the novices were missing and never found. As the gruesome voice in the house gets louder and more dreadful, she contacts the priest again, believing there's some entity or ghost. He warns her and tells her to better leave the house at once, but as she has put all her money into the purchase of the house she can not leave. As she starts to check the walls to find out where the voice comes from, she finds an old hidden, big ventilation system with tunnels that seem to run throughout the building. She can now clearly hear something moving through the ventilation-tunnels. She grabs into one of the ventilation gutters and pulls out a decomposed, human foot! As the mysteries about the murders in the house start to unravel, she finally starts to realize in what horrible danger she truly is...

Variety's writer Jay Weissberg criticized the direction of Avati, marked as \\"incapable of turning the gothic into anything remotely interesting, delivering bland, predictable scenes devoid of tension\\". The Hollywood Reporter's critic Natasha Senjanovic noted the high kitsch value in the film, and blamed on the \\"implausible and illogical\\" plot twists.

The septa have smooth margins and are irregularly arranged. The costae on young colonies sometimes form lobes which develop spines. These spines then elongate and a new polyp develops, this budding method being an unusual occurrence among corals. In the living coral, Plerogyra sinuosa has vesicles resembling bubbles up to in diameter. These enlarge during the day but retract to a certain extent during the night to expose the polyps and their tentacles. Biology Plerogyra sinuosa is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues including the walls of the vesicles. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the polyps. Status This is a common, widely distributed species in shallow reef environments. It is subject to the threats of climate change and destruction of its reef habitat common to other coral species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"near threatened\\".

Richthofen was a great uncle of his more famous namesake Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, who was his godson and named after him.  Early life  Manfred von Richthofen was born on 24 May 1855 in Gut Barzdorf, Silesia (now Bartoszówek, Poland). He entered the Imperial German Army in 1874 as an Ensign in the 4th (Westphalian) Cuirassier Regiment. By April 1902 he had risen to Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the Gardes du Corps Cavalry Regiment, personal bodyguard of the German Emperor Wilhelm II; and was assigned as his aide-de-camp in the following year. In 1906 he was promoted to Oberst (Colonel), and in March 1908 took command of the 2nd Guards Cavalry Brigade in Potsdam. In 1910, he was promoted to Generalmajor (Brigadier- General), and in February 1913 he took command of the Guards Cavalry Division with a promotion to Generalleutnant (Major-General). In February 1914 he moved on to command the 6th Infantry Division at Brandenburg.  World War I  At the beginning of World War I, Richthofen became commander of I Cavalry Corps (composed of 5th Cavalry and Guards Cavalry Divisions) preceding 3rd Army. These formed part of the right wing of the forces for the Schlieffen Plan offensive in August 1914 on the Western Front and took part in the Battle of the Frontiers and the First Battle of the Marne. The Corps was transferred to the Eastern Front on 6 November 1914 and joined the newly formed 9th Army. Richthofen and his corps played an important role in the Battle of Łódź, where his corps took part in breaking out the encircled XXV Reserve Corps. In September 1916, Richthofen became commander of XXXVIII Reserve Corps until November when he became commander of the XXV Reserve Corps. In March 1917, Richthofen was given command of 53rd Corps (z.b.V.) until January 1918, when he became Kommandierender General (Deputy commander) of the Guards Corps in Berlin, his highest rank. He surrendered the Berliner Stadtschloss without a fight in order to keep intact the building and the works of art contained in it. On 18 January 1918, Richthofen was awarded the Order Pour le Mérite, known informally as the Blue Max. On 2 May 1918, he attended a memorial service for his grandnephew Manfred von Richthofen who was killed in action on April 21.Baedecker, Berlin, (1927),p.145.  Later life  On 10 November 1918, Richthofen handed in his resignation, which was accepted. He died on 28 November 1939 on his Barzdorf estate in Silesia, aged 84. As he had no children and he wished to keep his estate in the family, he legally adopted his nephew Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen, later a Generalfeldmarschall of the Luftwaffe in the Second World War.

He made his debut for the Italian national side in August 2010, and has since captained Italy at several tournaments. Crowley is a right-handed batsman who bowls slow left-arm orthodox spin. Playing career Born in Cape Town, Crowley later moved to England, where he played county cricket for the Nottinghamshire Second XI in 2008 and 2009, but unable to force his way into the county first eleven. Although he had an Italian background through his grandmother (an immigrant to South Africa from Rimini), Crowley did not meet ICC eligibility requirements for Italy until 2010.(5 November 2013). \\"Italy has the belief to go all the way, says Crowley\\" – International Cricket Council. Retrieved 8 May 2015. Soon after, he was selected as part of Italy's squad for the 2010 World Cricket League Division Four tournament, which was hosted by Italy. He made his debut for Italy during the tournament against Nepal and went on to make a further five appearances during it, helping Italy earn promotion to the 2011 World Cricket League Division Three. Division Three was played in Hong Kong in January 2011, with Crowley selected as part of Italy's thirteen man squad. He played in all six of Italy's matches in the tournament, scoring 134 runs at an average of 26.80, with a high score of 53 not out. This was his only half century in the tournament and came against Denmark. In July 2011, Crowley played in the European T20 Championship in Jersey and Guernsey, which saw Italy end the tournament as runners-up to Denmark. This result qualified them to take part in the World Twenty20 Qualifier in the United Arab Emirates in March 2012. Crowley was selected as part of Italy's fourteen man squad for the qualifier. He made his Twenty20 debut during the tournament against Oman. He made eight further appearances during the tournament, the last of which came against Kenya. Having previously kept wicket for Italy, this role was instead undertaken by Alessandro Bonora and Hayden Patrizi, therefore allowing Crowley the opportunity to bowl regularly throughout the tournament. In his nine matches, he took 13 wickets at a bowling average of 12.46, with best figures of 4/18. He ended the tournament as Italy's joint leading wicket-taker alongside Carl Sandri. With the bat, he scored 137 runs at an average of 17.12, with a high score of 44. Italy finished the tournament in tenth place and therefore missed out on qualification for the 2012 World Twenty in Sri Lanka. In April 2013, he was selected in Italy's fourteen man squad for the World Cricket League Division Three in Bermuda. In September 2017, he scored the most runs in the 2017 ICC World Cricket League Division Five tournament, with a total of 308 runs in four matches.

He sketches a four-point research agenda on the effects of emigration. Clemens has also written about aid effectiveness, including an article for the Journal of Development Effectiveness: \\"When does rigorous impact evaluation make a difference? The case of the Millennium Villages.\\" Using a high-profile case, the Millennium Villages Project, an experimental and intensive package intervention to spark economic development in rural Africa, he and his co-authors illustrate the benefits of rigorous impact evaluation by showing the estimates of the project’s effects depend heavily in evaluation method. He also wrote Counting Chickens When They Hatch: Timing and the Effects of Aid on Growth for the Royal Economic Society’s Economic Journal, examining the cross-country relationship between foreign aid and economic growth.  Initiatives  Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clemens led an effort to make Haitians eligible for H-2A and H-2B low-skill temporary work visa program arguing that the economic impact of migration would be far more beneficial than any foreign assistance or aid to the country. In January 2012, the US government added Haiti to the list of countries eligible to participate in the H-2 visa program.

After a state of siege had been proclaimed by the Crispi government, armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops. Hundreds of insurgents were arrested and tried by military tribunals. Background According to a New York Times article of 1894, workers in the marble quarries were among the most neglected labourers in Italy. Many of them were ex-convicts or fugitives from justice. The work at the quarries was so tough that almost any aspirant worker with sufficient muscle and endurance was employed, regardless of their background.A Stronghold of Anarchists, The New York Times, January 19, 1894 The quarry workers, including the stone carvers, had radical beliefs that set them apart from others. Anarchism and general radicalism became part of the heritage of the stone carvers. Many violent revolutionists who had been expelled from Belgium and Switzerland went to Carrara in 1885 and founded the first anarchist group in Italy. The district in which the quarries are situated was consequently the original hotbed of anarchism in Italy. In Carrara, the anarchist Galileo Palla remarked, \\"even the stones are anarchists.\\"No License to Serve: Prohibition, Anarchists, and the Italian-American Widows of Barre, Vermont, 1900–1920 , by Robin Hazard Ray, Italian Americana, Spring 2011 Revolt The revolt started when on January 13, 1894, with a demonstration against the government crackdown of the Fasci Siciliani a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration in 1891–1894 on Sicily, who had risen up against the ever-increasing taxes on the prices of basic commodities, such as bread, and for land reform.

Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops.The Italian Government Alarmed; More Troops Called Out for Service in Sicily, The New York Times, January 4, 1894Martial Law Proclaimed In Sicily; Stern Measures Resorted To to Quiet the Anti-Tax Troubles, The New York Times, January 5, 1894 The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 165–67 As two Carabinieri tried to disperse the crowd, shooting from both sides ensued and one guard was killed while another badly injured. Several demonstrators were also injured and one killed. Police barracks and headquarters were attacked and protestors made off with weapons. A tax office in Carrara was set on fire and the main road to the neighbouring town of Massa was barricaded with huge marble blocks. Large bands of workers tried to march into the town of Carrara on January 14 and into Massa on January 16, but were stopped by the military.Tilly, The rebellious century, 1830–1930, p. 150Sympathy For Sicilians; Socialists at Leghorn Call for a General Strike. Anarchists Cause a Riot at Massa di Carrara, The New York Times, January 15, 1894Italy's Fight With Anarchy, The New York Times, January 16, 1894 By the following morning the city of Carrara was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Nicola Heusch. A state of siege had been proclaimed by the Crispi government on January 16, 1894.State of Siege Proclaimed, The New York Times, January 18, 1894 Among those threatened with arrest were many quarry workers, who responded by declaring a general strike. Instead of going to work, they came down from the mountains and gathered around the military barracks where hundreds of prisoners had already been detained. Troops were then ordered to amass and, as soon as the crowd came near enough, they fired. Eleven deaths resulted, as well as numerous other casualties. (Other sources mention 8 people killed and 13 wounded).Turcato, Making Sense of Anarchism, pp. 114-16 Armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops.Carrara Citizens Terrified, The New York Times, January 17, 1894 Aftermath Hundreds of insurgents were arrested and tried by military tribunals. On January 31, 1894, a military tribunal condemned the anarchist Luigi Molinari to 23 years imprisonment as the instigator of the insurrection. A protest movement was mounted and Molinari was amnestied on September 20, 1895. Molinari, Luigi, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani – Volume 75 (2011) Later that year in June 1894 an Italian anarchist killed French President Carnot and an anarchist attack on Prime Minister Crispi on June 16, 1894, increased the fear of anarchism. In this climate, Crispi was able to introduce a series of anti-anarchist laws in July 1894, which were also used against socialists. Heavy penalties were announced for \\"incitement to class hatred\\" and police received extended powers of preventive arrest and deportation. Some observers assert that the revolt was organized by the anarchist movement with a well defined plan, while others claim that the insurrectionary outcome exceeded the original intentions of the leaders who only wanted to stage a protest demonstration. Prime Minister Crispi explained the uprising as a conspiracy with \\"a broader subsersive plan that linked Apuan insurgents to those of Sicily, to the libertarian centres in Italy and abroad, and through the latter to the dark maneuvers of foreign powers.\\" ReferencesSources * Clark, Martin (2008).

It was the combination of this action, social inequalities and violations of sugar plantation workers labor rights which led to further civil unrest. Additionally, the party showed little interest in the indigenous peasants.Heilman. J.P. \\"We Will No Longer Be Serville: Aprismo in 1930s Ayacucho\\" On the dawn of July 7, 1932, an insurgent group composed mainly of peasants and workers, led by Manuel Barreto, attacked and captured the artillery barrack Ricardo O'Donovan, located at the former entrance to the city. In this assault, Barreto was one of the first to fall afflicted. The headquarters were ransacked. The weapons (including six mobile guns, rifles and machine guns) were distributed among the insurgents. In the morning, the city was taken by the people. Rebel Don Agustín Haya de la Torre (brother Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre) was appointed Prefect (highest civil authority). The districts bordering the city also joined the insurrection. The Executions Many of the fighters who had surrendered were shot without trial. A \\"Court Martial\\" with no warranties and independence issued the death penalty against 102 people accused of being primarily responsible for the uprising. Because many of these people were fugitives and others had died in the clash, the penalty could only be applied to 42 detainees.

He was a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley from 1962 through 2004, and in retirement was Professor Emeritus of Mathematics and Statistics. It has been thought that, since classic red-and-black casino roulette is a game in which the house on average wins more than the gambler, that \\"bold play\\", i.e. betting one's whole purse on a single trial, is a uniquely optimal strategy. While a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Dubins surprised his teacher Leonard Jimmie Savage with a mathematical demonstration that this is not true. Dubins and Savage wrote a book that appeared in 1965 titled How to Gamble if You Must (Inequalities for Stochastic Processes) which presented a mathematical theory of gambling processes and optimal behavior in gambling situations, pointing out their relevance to traditional approaches to probability. Under the influence of the work of Bruno de Finetti, Dubins and Savage worked in the context of finitely additive rather than countably additive probability theory, thereby bypassing some technical difficulties. Dubins was the author of nearly a hundred scholarly publications. Besides probability, some of these were on curves of minimal length under constraints on curvature and initial and final tangents (see Dubins path), Tarski's circle squaring problem, convex analysis, and geometry. His doctoral students include Theodore Hill.

The earthworks have an oval shape, are about 200 metres long and 140 metres wide. There is an entrance roughly in the middle of the western side. Towards the lake of Garzer See to the south (in the direction of Renz) the ramparts are lower. It lies up to 15 metres higher than the town of Garz.  History The castle was mentioned in 1165 as Borgar Gardz, when there were small-scale skirmishes with Danish warriors in front of the castle. The castle itself does not appear to have come under attack, but gradually fell into ruins afterwards. In 1300, the Prince of Rügen, Vitslav III, built a new castle and a chapel inside the original fort. After his death in 1325, the castle finally fell into disrepair. On the ramparts is now a war memorial to those who fell in the First World War and, in its immediate vicinity, is the Ernst Moritz Arndt Museum, where one can learn more about the history of the place.  Today  The Garz fort is now a protected archaeological site. It ranks, in terms of size and degree of preservation, as one of the most important Slavic strongholds. Originally, it was confused with the castle of Charenza, which was reported in historical chronicles. However, recent interdisciplinary research in 2004 and 2005 has shown that the fort at Venz (between Gingst and Trent onat the Neuendorfer Wiek) is much more likely to be the prince's castle and temple of Charenza, which was surrendered without a fight on 16 June 1168 to the King of Denmark Valdemar I and his army commander, Absalon of Roskilde, after negotiations had been held. This was one day after the conquest of the Jaromarsburg castle and temple site on Cape Arkona.Kratzke, Reimann, Ruchhöft: Garz und Rugendahl auf Rügen im Mittelalter.

As listed in The English and Australian Cookery Book by Edward Abbott, it calls for two pints of boiling water, sugar loaf, lime or lemon juice, one pint of ale or porter, one pint rum, and a half a pint of brandy. It has been described as a \\"notoriously potent alcoholic concoction\\". Some alternatively call the drink Blow My Skull Off, which may also refer to a historical version made instead by the mixing of rum, Cocculus indicus, \\"spirits of wine\\", cayenne pepper, Turkish opium and water. Origin and name conflation Blow My Skull punch recipe (The English and Australian Cookery Book, 1864) The drink was invented by Lieutenant Governor Thomas Davey of Tasmania, who was known for being a heavy drinker. The drink's \\"official\\" name has varied opinion. Some refer to Davey inventing it with the name \\"Blow My Skull\\", closely referring to the material found in The English and Australian Cookery Book. Others claim it was Davey inventing it as the \\"Blow My Skull Off\\". Unless the varying names were frequently conflated, for the latter claim to be true would mean that Lt. Governor Thomas Davey invented a drink containing opium and toxic plants that he served at barbeques he frequently held in a wattle hut erected a few miles outside of the capital. The version containing opium was a popular drink among gold miners in Australia in the 1850s. The \\"Blow My Skull Off\\" has been characterized as probably being \\"the most famous cocktail created in Australia\\". Cocktail historian Sebastian Raeburn has stated that Melbourne was \\"one of the great cocktail centres of the world.\\"  21st century usage  With historical roots based in rum punch drinks from the Oceanic region, \\"Blow My Skull\\" punch is sometimes served as a flaming drink when placed into a large skull shaped tiki bowl. As such it calls for Jamaican pot-still rum, dark porter, brandy, and lime juice mixed with demerara sugar and boiling water. This recipe is nearly identical to the non-opium containing version from mid-19th century Australia that was prepared using porter beer. Other 21st century drink guides may still refer to such a beer cocktail as a \\"Blow My Head Off\\" however. When the drink is referenced in 21st century cocktail books both names should be interpreted as meaning the porter-based version unless the guide specifically indicates to the contrary. Other versions A different version called the Flaming Skull Punch Bowl calls for very different ingredients than the porter-based \\"Blow My Skull\\" punch. Its ingredients include: 2 oz Jamaican Rum, 2 oz White Rum, 1 oz Black Strap Rum, 1 oz Angostura Amaro, 1.5 oz Lime Juice, 1.5 oz Orange Juice, 1.5 oz Orgeat, and 1 oz Passion Fruit Syrup. The Blow My Skull Off (Almost) is a single person version served at Tiki bars and other locations with little in relation to the original drinks but the name. It calls for: * 2 oz Cognac * 1/2 oz Peach Schnapps * 1/2 oz Herbal Liqueur (e.g., Jagermeister) The Almost Blow My Skull Off is also a single serving cocktail, its recipe being from well known mixologist Gary Regan and calling for: * 2 oz Cognac * 1/2 oz Jagermeister * 1/4 oz Ancho Reyes Verde liqueur See also * Hard multum * List of cocktails * Tiki culture References External links  * Recipe – Blow My Skull Off Cocktail (1850).

Zahl was a typical representative of the Nordland families. As such he is known through Knut Hamsun's famous character Mack. Photograph: Mr Finne Lauvøya, which has been possessed by, among others, the Jentoft family and the Hveding family. Photograph: Commons user Knut Nordland families () are the older families of burgher or clerical estate in today's counties of Nordland and Troms, plus Finnmark, in Norway. These families belonged to the leading social classes of Northern Norway.  Characteristics  Some basic characteristics of a Nordland family are that they were socially established since the centuries before 1800, that they lived on the countryside, where they had typical burgher culture and professions, that they married each other, that they bore permanent family names, something that very few people had (ordinary people used patronyms), and that they often had roots outside Norway, mostly in Denmark and the Duchies. Many Nordland families are, in some cases extensively, described in written pieces especially of the 18th and the 19th century. Among these are travel journals by Gustav Peter Blom, the Swedes Johan Erik Forsström, Sven Nilsson, and J.W. Zetterstedt, the German Leopold von Buch, and the Englishmen Sir Arthur de Capell Brooke and Frederick Metcalfe. These families' culture, among other their way of being, society life, and dances, was different from that of ordinary people. It is said that all Nordland families may be traced back to the noble family Benkestok. Not all, but however several Nordland families descend cognatically from this family. Among the most prominent is the family Ellingsen, whose progenitor Elling Christophersen (1676-1730) was a great-grandson of Margrethe Benkestok. To Nordland families belong many nationally prominent persons, among others trader Erasmus B.K. Zahl (Knut Hamsun's Mack) of the Zahl family, cabinet minister Sofus A.B. Arctander of the Arctander family, and cabinet minister Jakob M. Schøning of the Schøning family.  History  The concept is of old days. It is frequently used in historical and genealogical literature of the 20th century. Some years after the publication of genealogist Wilhelmine Brandt's Slægten Benkestok (1904), genealogist Stian Herlofsen Finne-Grønn described it as a genealogical magazine for Nordland families. Otherwise the concept occurs among other places in Jakob Schøning's Nordlands-slegten Schøning i 360 aar (1928), Johan Hveding's Nordlandsslekten Hveding (1944), Nils Parelius's Nordlandsslekten Mentzonis opprinnelse (1956) and Gerd Fjellstad's Fra adel til bumenn : Nordlandsslekter (1996).

EAs are required components of most hazardous waste site investigations. Such assessments, in conjunction with contamination and human health risk assessments, help to evaluate the environmental hazards posed by contaminated sites and to determine remediation requirements. In ecological assessment many abiotic and biotic indicators, reflecting the pluralistic components of ecosystems, are used. Reporting on the state of the environment requires that information on separate indicators are integrated into comprehensive yardsticks or indices. EA is extremely complex because of regional and temporal variation in vulnerability of ecosystems and because of limited understanding of ecosystem functioning and health. Indicators Indicators of ecological assessment Ecological indicators are able to * assess the condition of the environment * provide an early warning signal of changes in the environment, or * diagnose the cause of an environmental problem. Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system. In general EA indicators can be divided into abiotic and biotic indicators. Due to the complexity of ecosystems and environmental processes, a set of indicators reflecting the many facets of ecosystems is needed. Chemical, physical, and biological indicators each have specific advantages and disadvantages for monitoring and assessment. Abiotic indicators, which may give information on the risks or threats from stressors to ecosystems are comparatively well correlated with sources of pollutants and disturbances but may not reflect ecological end points in themselves. Biotic indicators may reflect end points and may be used to differentiate \\"healthy\\" from \\"sick\\" ecosystems. Correlation of biotic indicators with sources of pollutants and other disturbances is relatively difficult due to the complexity of environmental processes and the multitude of potential stressors. Critical appraisal: * small number of indicators lead to fail considering the full complexity of the ecological system * choice of ecological indicators depends on management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives * monitoring programs miss predominantly the scientific demand (lack of defined protocol for identifying ecological indicators) Types of ecological assessment Strategic ecological assessment (SEcA) is required to ensure that proposed new developments are compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of Environmental Impact Assessment, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the * availability * accuracy * reliability and * resolution of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals. The U.S. Nature Conservancy has developed Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA), an integrated methodology to provide the multiple scale, up-to-date information required to guide conservation actions. REA relies on analysis of aerial photography, videography, and satellite image data to identify conservation sites and to direct field sampling and research for cost-effective biological and ecological data acquisitions. Goals The goal of EA is to understand the structure and function of ecosystems in order to develop improved management options. Furthermore, developing models to predict the response of ecosystems to changes contributes to finding a particular management strategy. The results of the EA will be used to suggest possible improvements of the pollutant´s properties to reduce the potential environmental impacts. Typical applications * Education * Agriculture * Geographyhttp://www.miseagrant.umich.edu/downloads/nemia/report/NEMIA- Ch3-Ecological-Assessment.pdf * Engineering * Marine research. Ecological assessment in the U.S. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a definition for EA. Ecological assessment is a “qualitative or quantitative assessment of the actual or potential effects of a hazardous waste site on plants and animals other than people and domesticated species”. The methodologies used for EA noted down in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act are only vaguely defined. As a result, assessment methods applied by both consultants and regulatory agencies range from qualitative approaches, such as listings of potential biotic receptors at a contaminated site, to fully quantitative approaches that include detailed exposure estimations, quantitative toxicity comparisons, and supplementary biota sampling to evaluate uptake estimates.

Nye, Jr., more officially known as the United States Security Strategy for the East Asia Pacific Region, published in February 1995, is a report on the United States security strategy toward East Asia and the Pacific area, emphasizing the importance of the U.S. forward presence in Asia and its alliance with Japan.Millard, Mike (1998). Okinawa, Then and Now. JPRI Occasional Paper. 11. The aim of this plan was to reassure Japan and other states in the region of U.S. commitments to the alliance after a series of security crises in the early 1990s.Zartman, Matthew (2010). Military Basing and the United States-Japan Alliance. Georgetown University. It argued that U.S. military presence in the region had important consequences for the stability of the region, and for the success of America's political, economic, and security goals.Ikenberry, John(2003). America in East Asia. JAAS. Specifically, Nye advocated that the United States should maintain a total of 100,000 troops in East Asia, emphasizing the importance of the U.S. Marine Corps and other military forces in Okinawa.Shimpo, Ryukyu(2011). “Moving Marines to Australia is a smart move\\". Ryukyu Shimpo. While maintaining the U.S.-Japan alliance, it also aimed to check the structural forces, such as the rise of China and development of nuclear weapons capability by North Korea. The Nye Initiative had defined U.S.-Japan relations as the most important bilateral relationship and the Japanese security as the linchpin of the U.S. security policy in the region, helping Japan gain greater military autonomy and power projection capability in the future.“Japan-United States Relations”. Encyclopedia of Modern Asia, Vol. 3, pp. 253-258. Such process of re- strengthening the U.S.-Japan security tie was not forced or imposed by any of the two, but rather a product of the mutual recognition of each other's needs and interests.

Lucrezio Gravisi was a member of the family of the Marquis of Pietrapelosa, based in Capodistria but named after their estate of Pietrapelosa in the interior of Istria. Biography He was born in Capodistra in 1558. By the age of 16 he had sailed on the galley of his relative Pietro Gravisi in the war against the Turks. He traveled in Spain and Portugal, and then to the court of the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa. In 1588 Sigismund made him a knight for his services in Prussia and Muscovy. In 1606 he was Sigismund's representative in a mission to the papal court in Rome. Lucrezio Gravisi became a soldier of fortune, helping fight the Turks at Buda. For a year he guarded the castle of Brescia for the Venetian Republic. Returning to Venice, he was dispatched to Candia (Crete) with two companies of soldiers to stop the raids of pirates. However, while in harbor in Mandre, a port on the island of Pago in Dalmatia, pirates in six boats attacked his galley at night while the crew was sleeping. All the occupants were killed, including Gravisi, and their bodies thrown into the sea. His wife Paola Strassoldo, his brother and his cousin were also killed in this incident.

Traditionally thought by historians to refer to the Black River of modern-day Lorain County, it is now believed more likely to have been the Huron River, which passes Milan before meeting Lake Erie at the village of Huron. See also Guahadahuri, and Huron River, Ohio. History of name In 1755, 18-year-old James Smith was captured from Pennsylvania by indigenous Americans, and brought to live with their nation in Northern Ohio. (The custom of this tribe was to \\"adopt\\" a Caucasian male to replace one of their warriors killed in battle against them.) Smith lived here as one of them until 1759, having eventually found an opportunity to safely return to his Pennsylvania home. He later wrote about his own experiences. Much of his time in Northern Ohio was spent near a river which he calls \\"Canesadooharie\\". Smith, who was very well-educated for that time period, recorded that this river was \\"about 8 miles east of Sandusky\\" and \\"interlocks with the West Branch of the Muskingum\\". This corresponds to the Huron River, which is about 10 miles east of Sandusky Bay's mouth, and which nearly meets the headwaters of the Black Fork of the Mohican River, which connects into the Muskingum. But one additional detail that Smith recorded about the \\"Canesadooharie\\", that it had a \\"falls\\", \\"12 to 15 feet high, and nearly perpendicular\\". This detail was seized upon by later historians, as evidence that the river of Smith's travels, was instead the Black River of Lorain County, which has two separate and impressive falls in the vicinity of Elyria, Ohio. More historians added to the confusion, by attributing the meaning of the word \\"canesadooharie\\" as \\"black pearl\\", or even more romantically as \\"string of black pearls\\"; but it is not known what evidence, if any, that those historians used to support that translation. Later historians simply repeated the earlier theories, until finally Smith's \\"Canesadooharie\\" was accepted to be the Black River, instead of the Huron River. It is unfortunate that the original historians disregarded Smith's many details about his own travels here. The Black River is about 30 miles, not \\"about 8 miles\\", from Sandusky Bay; and the two separate falls on the Black River are each about 40 feet in height, and absolutely perpendicular, poorly matching Smith's description beyond the word \\"falls\\". The likelihood is that the single falls which Smith experienced over a many week period in 1756, \\"12 to 15 feet high, and nearly perpendicular\\", i.e. high and very steep rapids, was somewhere in the vicinity of (now) Norwalk, Ohio; and by the mid-1800s, nature had probably reduced them to being more like actual rapids, than a \\"falls\\". Regardless, due to 19th-century historians' errors, \\"Canesadooharie\\" is now accepted as an alternate name for the Black River, rather than for the Huron River for which it was intended.

Silicate perovskites are not stable at Earth's surface, and mainly exist in the lower part of Earth's mantle, between about depth. They are thought to form the main mineral phases, together with ferropericlase.  Discovery  The existence of silicate perovskite in the mantle was first suggested in 1962, and both MgSiO3 and CaSiO3 had been synthesized experimentally before 1975. By the late 1970s, it had been proposed that the seismic discontinuity at about 660 km in the mantle represented a change from spinel structure minerals with an olivine composition to silicate perovskite with ferropericlase. Natural silicate perovskite was discovered in the heavily shocked Tenham meteorite. In 2014, the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) approved the name bridgmanite for perovskite-structured (Mg,Fe)SiO3, in honor of physicist Percy Bridgman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1946 for his high-pressure research. Structure The perovskite structure (first identified in the mineral perovskite) occurs in substances with the general formula ABX3, where A is a metal that forms large cations, typically magnesium, ferrous iron, or calcium. B is another metal that forms smaller cations, typically silicon, although minor amounts of ferric iron and aluminum can occur. X is typically oxygen. The structure may be cubic, but only if the relative sizes of the ions meet strict criteria. Typically, substances with the perovskite structure show lower symmetry, owing to the distortion of the crystal lattice and silicate perovskites are in the orthorhombic crystal system. Occurrence=Stability range Bridgmanite is a high-pressure polymorph of enstatite, but in the Earth predominantly forms, along with ferropericlase, from the decomposition of ringwoodite (a high-pressure form of olivine) at approximately 660 km depth, or a pressure of ~24 GPa. The depth of this transition depends on the mantle temperature; it occurs slightly deeper in colder regions of the mantle and shallower in warmer regions. The transition from ringwoodite to bridgmanite and ferropericlase marks the bottom of the mantle transition zone and the top of the lower mantle. Bridgmanite becomes unstable at a depth of approximately 2700 km, transforming isochemically to post-perovskite. Calcium silicate perovskite is stable at slightly shallower depths than bridgmanite, becoming stable at approximately 500 km, and remains stable throughout the lower mantle. Abundance Bridgmanite is the most abundant mineral in the mantle. The proportions of bridgmanite and calcium perovskite depends on the overall lithology and bulk composition. In pyrolitic and harzburgitic lithogies, bridgmanite constitutes around 80% of the mineral assemblage, and calcium perovskite < 10%. In an eclogitic lithology, bridgmanite and calcium perovskite comprise ~30% each. Presence in diamonds Calcium silicate perovskite has been identified at Earth's surface as inclusions in diamonds. The diamonds are formed under high pressure deep in the mantle. With the great mechanical strength of the diamonds a large part of this pressure is retained inside the lattice, enabling inclusions such as the calcium silicate to be preserved in high-pressure form. Deformation Experimental deformation of polycrystalline MgSiO3 under the conditions of the uppermost part of the lower mantle suggests that silicate perovskite deforms by a dislocation creep mechanism. This may help explain the observed seismic anisotropy in the mantle.

Written by Paul Gégauff and Jean Valère, the film is about a beautiful Italian businesswoman who, after being swindled out of her fortune by her boyfriend, travels to Paris to kill him before killing herself. Plot A beautiful Italian businesswoman, Lucille Lombardi (Monica Vitti), discovers that her boyfriend and marketing director, Julien Auchard (Robert Hossein), has bankrupted her family business, cheated her out of her wealth, and left her penniless. Shocked by the betrayal, the loss of her villa in Nice, and feeling that all is lost, Lucille decides to sell her jewelry and binge on champagne and caviar before committing suicide. Her binge renders her intoxicated and leaves her daydreaming about revenge. At first she plans to leave François a note blaming him for her death, but realizing it would have little effect on him, she decides that revenge is the only course—that she must kill Julien before ending her own life. Knowing that Julien travels to Paris every Friday, Lucille decides to hold off on suicide for one week until she has a chance to kill the man who ruined her life. After arriving in Paris, Lucille buys an Austin Princess luxury car and sets about planning her revenge while continuing her lavish spending on designer clothing and food. Uncomfortable being alone, she invites a stranger named François (Maurice Ronet), a marine salvage expert, to have a romantic lunch with her at the Eiffel Tower. When Lucille reveals her intentions to end her life later that week, François shows genuine concern for her and states that he will not allow it—that he'll not leave her side. Lucille manages to elude him after lunch and he is unable to follow. In the coming days, François desperately tries to locate her as she continues her spending spree on fine clothes and expensive food and champagne while waiting for her ex-boyfriend to arrive in Paris. While posing as a Swiss journalist, Lucille becomes entangled with a New York News correspondent named John Bert (Claudio Brook), a shady Spaniard named Alberto de Villalonga (Albert Simono), and the drug-addled manager, Tom Sturges (Gérard Lartigau), of an English rock group named The Timothys who just appeared at London's Royal Albert Hall. She goes on a series of dates, continuing her extravagant spending during her final days. Meanwhile, François continues his desperate search for the woman he believes will kill herself on Friday. After receiving no help from the police, he tracks down all the Austin Princess owners in Paris, thinking it will lead him to Lucille. Despairing on not finding her, he resigns himself to his work, which involves a lucrative new salvage operation in Venezuela that will make him wealthy (from the shady Spaniard Alberto as it turns out). On Thursday night, Lucille wanders the streets of Paris alone. A man approaches her, mistaking her for a prostitute, and she goes back to his place to have sex, later giving away the 300 francs she was paid. On Friday, Lucille meets Julien at the Paris-Orly Airport pretending she has a wealthy investor who can buy back the company that Julien now owns. Interested in the deal, Julien accompanies her to her hotel room where she pulls her gun, demanding that she accompany him to his appointment in Chantilly. Intending to kill them both in an auto accident, Lucille has second thoughts just as they are about to crash into an electrical pole. \\"You disgust me so much that it will save your life,\\" she tells him, as she leaves at the roadside and drives away. Back in Paris, François spots Lucille's Austin Princess by chance and follows her to the Eiffel Tower, where she intends to end her life. At the top, Lucille considers jumping, but something prevents her. When François arrives at the top, he finds her eating dessert in the restaurant where they enjoyed their romantic lunch, and they smile at each other.

Prior to the incorporation by force of the Otavalo people into the Inca Empire in the late 15th or early 16th century, the region north of Quito near the border of present-day Colombia, an area long by the same width, consisted of several small-scale chiefdoms including the Otavalo, Caranqui, Cayambe, and Cochasquí. These chiefdoms appear to have been similar in artistic techniques, subsistence, settlement patterns, and language, probably all speaking Barbacoan languages.Bray, Tamara L. and Echeverría Almeida, José (2014), \\"The Late Imperial Site of Inca-Caranqui, Northern highland Ecuador at the End of Empire\\", Nampo Pacha, journal of Andean Archaeology, Vol. 34, No. 2, p. 182 The four chiefdoms collectively had an estimated pre-Inca population of 100,000 to 180,000.Newson, Linda A. (1995), Life and Death in Early Colonial Ecuador, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pp. 39–40 The Otavalo and other Andean people of northern Ecuador are often identified with the pre- Columbian Cara people and Cara culture and as descendants of the semi-mythical Quitu culture, whence comes the name of the Ecuadorian capital of Quito.Onofrio, Jan (1995), Dictionary of the Indian Tribes of the Americas, Vol. 1, 2nd edition, American Indian Publishers, pp. 220-221 The Otavalo area was densely populated. The Otavalo people practiced irrigation agriculture and constructed camelones or Waru Waru raised fields to regulate the supply of water for crops. Maize, potatoes and, at lower and warmer altitudes, coca and other tropical and sub-tropical crops were important products. Domesticated guinea pigs were an important source of animal protein, as was wild game such as deer.Newsom, pp. 33–36 Prior to the Incas, the Otavalo apparently did not possess domesticated llamas and alpacas as did Andean peoples further south in Peru and Bolivia.Salomon, Frank (1986), Native lords of Quito in the age of the Incas, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 81–82 The brief period of Inca rule apparently did not change Otavalo culture much. Contrary to Incan practice, few if any mitma (people forcibly resettled outside their homelands by the Incas) were moved into the Otavalo region. Also contrary to the Incas who used the vertical archipelago to exchange goods among regions, a class of long-range traders called mindaláes continued to operate among the Otavalo. The mindaláes appear to have operated outside the authority of the chiefdoms. They carried on trade with the people living in lower elevations on the western slopes of the Andes, especially in the Mira River valley, about north of the city of Otavalo. Products they brought to the highlands included cotton, coca, salt, and dried fish from the Pacific coast.Newsom, 34–37; Salomon 102 Spanish rule The Spanish conquered the Inca Empire in the 1530s and Spanish settlement began. The Inca and Spanish conquests and the Spanish rule of the Otavalo and other nearby chiefdoms, plus recurrent epidemics of European diseases, had a profound impact on the population. By 1582, the population of the northern Ecuador Andean region was estimated to have declined by 80 percent to an estimated 30,000. The Spanish put heavy demands on the Otavalo people for labor. One-fifth of the Otavalo were required to work, essentially as slave labor, for the Spanish, often in hot tropical climates to which they were not accustomed. Vineyards owned by the Dominican Order of the Catholic church were characterized as \\"fields of blood\\" because of the Otavalo laborers who died working there.Newsom, pp 38–40, 163–164 Present day Unlike many others the Otavalo survived as a distinct ethnic group, but sometime after the 16th century they lost their original language and henceforth spoke Kichwa, the Quechua dialect spoken in Ecuador, and Spanish. In 1990, the number of Otavalo people was estimated at 45,000 to 50,000 in the Otavalo area with another 5,000 to 8,000 living elsewhere in Ecuador or other countries.  Economy  Most Otavalo are subsistence farmers who cultivate crops like potatoes but also raise livestock. Some work in the textile industry where many traditional Otavalo- styled textiles (woven with alpaca or llama wool) are exported to North America. A few Otavalo are businessmen or women who run some of these textile operations. Tourism is another significant source of revenue as these outsiders are attracted to the area because of the culture and local dress of the people.

History In 1885 Kelly's Directory noted Moulton Chapel as a chapelry of Moulton, with a small octagonal chapel, erected in 1722. The living was a perpetual curacy.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 584 The 1722 chapel of St James, by William Sands senior of Spalding, was a rebuild of an earlier chapel, and was enlarged in 1886. In 1896 Moulton Chapel became a separate ecclesiastical parish under the name of Moulton St James.Cox, J. Charles (1916) Lincolnshire p. 233; Methuen & Co. Ltd. Pevsner notes the church as a red-brick octagon with a chancel added in 1886, and a domed interior. The style is Dutch, influenced by late 17th- century fen drainers. There is a marble font, and a west gallery probably from the 19th century.Pevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire p. 608; Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press.

The Plot  Chapters 1 - 4 Pan Gideon and his ward, Panna Anulka, are travelling by coach and are rescued from a wolf attack in the forest by Stanislav Tsyprianovitch and his companions – the Bukoyemski brothers. They are invited back by the latter to Yedlinka – a forest farm – and are welcomed by Pan Serafin, Stanislaw’s father and a wealthy retired merchant. They discuss the coming war with the Ottoman Turks. Pan Yatsek Tachevski, a young impoverished noble, is discovered to have been in a pine tree all night thinking about Anulka, his childhood sweetheart. On their way to Belchantska, the Bukoyemski brothers provoke Tachevski and the party spends the night at Pan Grothus’s house. Over mead the latter suggests that Pan Gideon marry his ward in order to pass on his estates and avoid family squabbles. Yatsek has to spend the night with the Bukoyemskis and eventually challenges the 'road-blockers' to a duel for their insulting behaviour. Yatsek goes to his patron, Father Voynovski, and a great former soldier the next day and says he will probably die. However, Yatsek fights Stanislav and the brothers and wounds them all. Voynovski treats their wounds, assisted nobly by Yatsek, which alters the attitude of his 'enemies'. They return to Pan Gideon’s house and he is furious with Yatsek and treats him dishonourably and is rejected by Anulka. The lovers quarrel and Yatsek vows never to see her again. Chapters 5 - 8 Yatsek is assisted by Voynovski to go into the world. Anulka feels guilty and sends a servant, Voitushko, to Vyrambki to tell Tachevski she is sorry. Yatsek, however, has gone to Radom to buy equipment for a warrior. Voynovski worries how he will be able to finance his expedition but Pan Serafin loans him money as a mortgage on Vyrambki, Tachevski’s property. Voynovski receives a letter from Pan Gideon which insults Tachevski, and all believe Anulka prompted him to write it. Chapters 9 –14 Father Voynovski writes a rude reply to Gideon and Anulka reads and is angered by it. However, she weeps tears of remorse over Yatsek but believes he will never return to Belchantska. Pan Gideon learns from the Bukoyemskis that Yatsek and Stanislav have both joined the Hussars. Pan Gideon meets his old friend, the prelate Tvorkovski, in whom he confides that he wishes to marry Anulka and asks him to put his case to her. Back at Gideon’s house the prelate speaks to Anulka and she accepts Gideon’s hand in marriage. Guests come to Belchantska for the engagement including his relatives. Pan Krepetski and his son, Martsian, nicknamed 'Pniak' (stump), a relative whom Gideon previously threw out of his house for making eyes at Anulka. At the engagement feast dark omens are observed and Pan Gideon collapses and dies in his chamber. Martsian and his father take over the house and the son confides that he plans to marry Anulka for whom he lusts. His sisters gradually start to dominate Anulka and steal her wedding trousseau. Chapters 15 - 19 Pan Serafin confides his worries over Anulka’s situation to Voynovski who is unsympathetic because of her treatment of Yatsek. The Bokoyemskis appear at Yeklinka one evening and confide they have lost all their horses and wealth through gambling in Warsaw. Lukasz slashed Podarski, their deceiver, in the face near the King’s palace, a capital crime, and was forced to flee. Pan Serafin is angry with them and they all go to Voynovski’s house. Serafin and Voynovski learn from Vilchopolski, Gideon’s former factor and now the manager of Vyrambki, how Anulka defended Gideon’s serfs from the rod. Martsian is resolved to have Anulka, even by force, and she fears his love even more than the hatred of his old maid sisters. He tells her he wants her as his wife but she spurns him and he beats her. Martsian’s butler tears him away and, after getting him back to his room where he gets drunk and spirits Anulka away to Pan Serafin’s who takes her in. The Bokoyemskis decide to exact revenge. The older Krepetski comes to Serafin to ask for Anulka back but he refuses. Their conversation is interrupted by shouting – the four Bokoyemskis are chasing Martsian and his horse and they have been tarred and feathered. The father aids his son and they return to Bhlchantska. Chapters 20 – 25 Pan Serafin resolves that all will travel to Cracow to see Stanislav and Yatsek and Pan Serafin wishes to join the army against the (dog-believer) Turk. Anulka will be left with the prelate in Radom. On the road they fear an ambush from Martsian but believe their party is strong enough to fend off an attack. They reach Radom safely and stay there for the first night of the journey. The next evening they encounter a roadblock and face an ambuscade. Father Voynovski takes charge but sees they are outnumbered – the Bukoyemskis charge their opponents and are about to be cut down when the latter start to withdraw and Voynovski is heartened to see Yatsek and Stanislav come to the rescue with their regiment. Yatsek sees Anulka but faints from his wounds. From the prisoners they learn that Martsian paid the brigands to make the attack and resolve to bring him to trial in Cracow. Anulka tends Yatsek in a covered wagon and they make up and are cheered by the regiment, 'Vivant! Crescant! Floreant!’ Chapters 25 – 28 Lodgings are found in Cracow and Stanislav resolves that Yatsek and Anulka should have some time together after their marriage before he joins the campaign. The Bokoyemski’s disappear but return and give Voynovski Martsian’s ear who berates them for behaving like savages. The wedding takes place and all are overcome by Anulka’s virginal beauty and modesty. King Sobieski and his wife are present and together leave the city two days later to march to Vienna. Standing on a hill, the troops march in splendour past their valiant king and Pani Tachevski sees her husband for the last time, 'all in iron and winged armour, the ear pieces of his helmet hid his cheeks altogether ... Yatsek turned his iron-covered head toward his wife and moved his lips as if whispering ... he was giving her the last \\"Fare thee well!”. The prince bishop of Cracow blesses the troops holding the cross and relics above his head and twenty thousand men raise their anthem to God. Historical background The book is set on the eve of the second siege of Vienna which was crushed in 1683 by Sobieski and the firmness of his allies. Had the Polish king not appeared, the Sultan would have triumphed, hence Sobieski and his troops were hailed as the saviours of Vienna and Sienkiewicz's novel reflects the enthusiasm of the time for the Polish king, and his queen Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien ('Marysienka', whom he married in 1665), which was tremendous. According to the translator, Jeremiah Curtin, the Polish character in most of its main traits is represented in this historical novel, developed from Polish experience with Germany, Russia, Rome, Byzantium and with the Turks and Tartars. As he states in his introduction, 'Through this great host of enemies and allies, and their own special character, came that incisive dramatic career which at last met a failure so crushingly manifest', (a probable reference here to the eventual dividing of Poland into the three partitions). Battle of Vienna Sobieski was in joint command of Polish, Austrian and German troops, against the invading Turks under Kara Mustafa. Upon reaching Vienna, Sobieski had planned to attack on September 13, but with the Turkish close to breaching the walls he ordered a full attack on September 12. At 4 a.m. the united army of about 81,000 men attacked a Turkish force of about 130,000 men. At about five o'clock in the afternoon, after observing the infantry battle from the hilltop, Sobieski led Polish husaria cavalry along with Austrians and Germans into a massive charge down the hillside. Soon, the Turkish battle line was broken and the Ottoman forces scattered in confusion. At 5:30 p.m. Sobieski entered the deserted tent of Kara Mustafa and the battle of Vienna ended.

Petricola is a left-handed batsman who bowls right-arm medium-fast. He was born at Melbourne, Victoria. While in Australia, Preticola played four matches for the Victoria Under-19s in December 2001. After a short spell in England in 2005, where he played club cricket for Loughborough Town in the Leicestershire Premier League, He later qualified to play for Italy, owing to his Italian heritage. His first appearance for Italy came against a Leinster Cricket Union President's XI in a warm up match for the 2008 European Cricket Championship Division One, in which Petricola played five matches. He was then selected as part of Italy's squad for the 2008 World Cricket League Division Four in Tanzania, making six appearances. He scored 81 runs during the tournament, at an average of 16.20, with a high score of 36. With the ball, he took 8 wickets at a bowling average of 17.75, with best figures of 3/21.

He was declared Man of the Tournament at its conclusion. In July 2011, Petricola played in the European T20 Championship in Jersey and Guernsey, which saw Italy end the tournament as runners-up to Denmark.

He made his Twenty20 debut during the tournament against Oman, with him making eight further appearances during the tournament, the last of which came against Kenya. In his nine matches, he scored 191 runs at an average of 23.87, with a high score of 39 not out. With the ball, he took just a single wicket, costing him 106 runs from thirteen overs bowled.

Definition “Oral narratives of the Lucumí faith, religious stories [are] known to practitioners as patakís.”Lele, Ócháni. Diloggún Tales of the Natural World: How the Moon Fooled the Sun, and Other Santería Stories. Rochester, Vt: Destiny Books, 2011. Print. A patakí can be likened to a Christian parable. Santería initiates use the short fables to teach and illustrate a moral lesson to followers. The patakí is passed down orally through generations of Santería initiates. “Some patakís narrate the birth or death of an Orisha in human form. Others deal with relationships between Orishas.”Duncan, Cynthia. Personal Interview. 15 May 2012. These stories offer advice to followers on how to deal with life’s issues. The patakís also serve as creation stories on how the natural world came into being. The moral lessons of the patakí have a range of themes, such as respecting your elders, how to be humble and grateful for what you have, not underestimating your enemy, knowing who is your friend and who is not. Patakís are written in an artful narrative style. They are usually set in an ancient time when the Orishas were still in human form. Patakís are “part of this enormous mine of oral lucumí literature”.Dianteill, Erwan, and Martha Swearingen. \\"From Hierography to Ethnography and Back: Lydia Cabrera's Texts and the Written Tradition in Afro-Cuban Religions.\\" Journal of American Folklore. 116.461 (2003). Print. Oral tradition “Most babaaláwos are experts on the patakís and memorize a large corpus of them, although it is impossible to say how many patakís exist in an oral tradition that spans centuries. Some Santeros/as are also familiar with the patakís, but it is not a requirement for Santeros/as to memorize the stories in order to practice the religion. Where the patakí fits into this system is unique, because they are taught in Ilés and depending on the Ilé the same patakí might have slight variation. Newly initiated Babaaláwos are taught patakís and other secrets of the religion by Padrinos and for their first years study quite intensely. Aside from libretas, which are private religious notebooks used for passing down rituals and traditions, there is a slight distrust for things written in a book. Understanding the patakí Interpretation and use of patakí text by babaaláwos is based on a system of Odu. The original oral literature is kept intact but was applied to the marginality the Afro-Cuban faced in the New World. The esoteric nature in which the patakí is situated also allows for hidden meaning in the ‘writings’. Patakís may be written in libretas but many are memorized from oral transmission. There are many discrepancies on pronunciations, and written forms of some of the Yoruba words in Lucumí literature. Many words are Spanish. Because there is no standard format, many versions of words and some variation on the practices exist. \\"The existence of the word as something usable in utterances presupposes a collective understanding of its existence.\\" The entire religious community has acknowledged the practices, traditions and words of Santería and other divination elements such as the patakí and therefore it has become legitimate collective knowledge. The transculturation that created Santería and many other Afro-Cuban traditions has become a part of national identity. What is most important about the patakí is that the original idea, or moral of the story remain intact through translation and interpretation.

He is known for his investigative news and books on Turkish politics. He has been sued many times for his journalistic activities. He was imprisoned in 2011 and 2020 as part of these cases. Biography Barış Pehlivan graduated from Istanbul University Faculty of Communication, Department of Journalism. In 2004, Barış Pehlivan worked as a reporter at Kaçak Yayın Dergisi, an art magazine owned by the Leman Group. He worked as a project assistant, director’s assistant, and publisher respectively in the documentary programs named ‘Paranın Seyir Defteri’, ‘Şair Ceketli Çocuk: Kazım Koyuncu’, and ‘Nohut Oda Bakla Sofa’. He contributed to the program 5N1K with the stories ‘Land Sales to Foreigners’ and ‘Assassination of Shah Massoud’. Since 2007, Pehlivan is working as the executive editor for the online news website called OdaTV.com founded by the investigative journalist Soner Yalçın. He worked as a columnist in Karşı newspaper. He has faced many trials and has been imprisoned due to his news and books. He was awarded with Turkey's most important journalism awards. He is a Board Member of Nazım Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation. He has been the Editor-in-Chief of Odatv.com news site since 2007. Barış Pehlivan produced the political documentary Oradaydım for CNN Türk TV channel between the years 2005 and 2010. The series explain the stories of more than 250 events related to recent Turkish history. Pehlivan co-authored three investigation books Sızıntı: Wikileaks’te Ünlü Türkler (The Leak: The Popular Turks of Wikileaks), Mahrem and Metastaz with colleague Barış Terkoğlu. All three books were much debated at the time of their publication and remained on the bestseller list for a long time. Trials Throughout his career as a journalist, tens of lawsuits were filed against him with complaints by many, including names like Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or Fethullah Gülen. In an episode of “Oradaydım” broadcast on February 24, 2007, the documentary focused on the events of the 12th of September 1980 in a Diyarbakır prison. Pehlivan was put on trial as a producer and was accused of fomenting public discord. In 2008, he was acquitted. On February 14, 2011, the Turkish police took Pehlivan into custody following the search of his house and OdaTV office, and accused of being part of the Ergenekon organization - one a substantial number of journalists accused in relation to odatv. He was arrested and kept in detention at Istanbul’s Silivri Prison in connection with his work at odatv, accused of links to the Ergenekon organization. He was not brought before a judge and formally charged until more than nine months after his arrest, on November 22, 2011. In September 2012, he was released pending trial following an judicial report confirming that the evidence collected against the journalist have probably been digitally forged and sent using a trojan horse to infect his computer. Subsequent analysis of Barış Pehlivan’s OdaTV computer by digital forensics company Arsenal Consulting revealed local attacks, which required physical access, were responsible for delivery of the incriminating documents. In September 2012, he was released pending trial following an judicial report confirming that the evidence collected against the journalist have probably been digitally forged and sent using a trojan horse to infect his computer. On April 12, 2017, the 18th High Criminal Court acquitted all 13 defendants of the Odatv Case. The court also ruled for a criminal complaint be filed against those who set up the Odatv plot. It turned out that this operation against Oda TV was a conspiracy and carried out by FETÖ members infiltrated into the state. A lawsuit was filed against the police, prosecutors and judges who kept innocent journalists in prison. On March 3, 2020 an investigation has been initiated against him due to a news published in Odatv about the funeral of the martyr of National Intelligence Agency (MIT) in Libya. He was arrested on March 6, 2020 in Istanbul Çağlayan Courthouse, where he went to give his statement. In his defense, he stated that the real reason for his arrest, after 9 years, was his prior and new coming book. The indictment demands a prison sentence up to 19 years for 8 journalists, who were on trial with him. It turned out that he has been subjected to an assault in Silivri Prison where he was taken after his arrest. After camera footage of the incident was revealed, an investigation was initiated against those responsible. Due to growing concerns over the spread of coronavirus in the prisons, the Turkish government drafted a law that would release up to 100,000 prisoners. During these discussions in Parliament, lawmakers added an extra article stating that crimes committed involving MIT would effectively be excluded from the scope of the newly minted law; the six journalists were pointedly excluded in the lessening of the prison sentences. Organized crime bosses, convicted murderers and thieves, among other criminals, were freed from prison while journalists, lawyers and bloggers remained behind bars over so-called “terrorism” charges, as violations of the law as it pertains to MIT were removed from the “amnesty” regulation. This \\"personalized\\" change created a great public reaction. Odatv.com, where Barış Pehlivan is the Editor-in-Chief, was blocked by court decision after this new operation. Odatv, that has been Turkey's most influential news site for 13 years, continues its broadcasting through different web addresses. The first trial of six journalists who reported on the funeral of a National Intelligence Organization (MİT) officer who was killed in Libya was held on 24th of June 2020 at İstanbul. Three journalists released, three remain in jail after the trial. After the release of three journalists, Barış Pehlivan and two other colleagues (Murat Agirel and Hülya Kilinç) are kept in pre-trial detention until September 9 Bibliography *Sızıntı: Wikileaks’te Ünlü Türkler (2012), co-authored with Barış Terkoğlu, . *:Mahrem: Gizli Belgelerde Türkiye'nin Sırları (2015), co-authored with Barış Terkoğlu, . *:Metastaz (2019), co-authored with Barış Terkoğlu, .

As yeast consume the sugar in the must it releases alcohol and carbon dioxide (seen here as the foaming bubbles) as byproducts. The role of yeast in winemaking is the most important element that distinguishes wine from grape juice. In the absence of oxygen, yeast converts the sugars of wine grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide through the process of fermentation.Jeff Cox \\"From Vines to Wines: The Complete Guide to Growing Grapes and Making Your Own Wine\\" pgs 133–136 Storey Publishing 1999 The more sugars in the grapes, the higher the potential alcohol level of the wine if the yeast are allowed to carry out fermentation to dryness.D. Bird \\"Understanding Wine Technology\\" pg 67–73 DBQA Publishing 2005 Sometimes winemakers will stop fermentation early in order to leave some residual sugars and sweetness in the wine such as with dessert wines. This can be achieved by dropping fermentation temperatures to the point where the yeast are inactive, sterile filtering the wine to remove the yeast or fortification with brandy or neutral spirits to kill off the yeast cells. If fermentation is unintentionally stopped, such as when the yeasts become exhausted of available nutrients and the wine has not yet reached dryness, this is considered a stuck fermentation.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 778–780 Oxford University Press 2006 The most common yeast associated with winemaking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has been favored due to its predictable and vigorous fermentation capabilities, tolerance of relatively high levels of alcohol and sulfur dioxide as well as its ability to thrive in normal wine pH between 2.8 and 4. Despite its widespread use which often includes deliberate inoculation from cultured stock, S. cerevisiae is rarely the only yeast species involved in a fermentation. Grapes brought in from harvest are usually teeming with a variety of \\"wild yeast\\" from the Kloeckera and Candida genera. These yeasts often begin the fermentation process almost as soon as the grapes are picked when the weight of the clusters in the harvest bins begin to crush the grapes, releasing the sugar-rich must.K. Fugelsang, C. Edwards Wine Microbiology Second Edition pgs 3–28 Springer Science and Business Media , New York (2010) While additions of sulfur dioxide (often added at the crusher) may limit some of the wild yeast activities, these yeasts will usually die out once the alcohol level reaches about 15% due to the toxicity of alcohol on the yeast cells physiology while the more alcohol tolerant Saccharomyces species take over. In addition to S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus is a species of yeast that can tolerate alcohol levels of 17–20% and is often used in fortified wine production such as ports and varieties such as Zinfandel and Syrah harvested at high Brix sugar levels. Another common yeast involved in wine production is Brettanomyces whose presence in a wine may be viewed by different winemakers as either a wine fault or in limited quantities as an added note of complexity.B. Zoecklein, K. Fugelsang, B. Gump, F. Nury Wine Analysis and Production pgs 281–290 Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York (1999) History French scientist Louis Pasteur discovered the connection between microscopic yeast and the process of fermentation. For most of the history of wine, winemakers did not know the mechanism that somehow converted sugary grape juice into alcoholic wine. They could observe the fermentation process which was often described as \\"boiling\\", \\"seething\\" or the wine being \\"troubled\\" due to release of carbon dioxide that gave the wine a frothy, bubbling appearance. This history is preserved in the etymology of the word \\"yeast\\" itself which essentially means \\"to boil\\".Douglas Harper \\"Yeast\\" Online Etymology Dictionary Accessed: May 31st, 2012 In the mid-19th century, the French scientist Louis Pasteur was tasked by the French government to study what made some wines spoil. His work, which would later lead to Pasteur being considered one of the \\"Fathers of Microbiology\\", would uncover the connection between microscopic yeast cells and the process of the fermentation. It was Pasteur who discovered that yeast converted sugars in the must into alcohol and carbon dioxide, though the exact mechanisms of how the yeast would accomplish this task was not discovered till the 20th century with the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 267 & 508 Oxford University Press 2006 The yeast species commonly known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae was first identified in late 19th century enology text as Saccharomyces ellipsoideus due to the elliptical (as opposed to circular) shape of the cells. Throughout the 20th century, more than 700 different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified. The difference between the vast majority of these strains are mostly minor, though individual winemakers will develop a preference for particular strains when making certain wines or working with particular grape varieties. Some of these difference include the \\"vigor\\" or speed of fermentation, temperature tolerance, the production of volatile sulfur compounds (such as hydrogen sulfide) and other compounds that may influence the aroma of the wine. Role in winemaking In the absence of oxygen, yeast cells will take the pyruvate produced by glycolysis and reduce it into acetaldehyde which is further reduced into ethanol \\"recharging\\" the NAD+ co-enzymes that is needed for various metabolic processes of the yeast. The primary role of yeast is to convert the sugars present (namely glucose) in the grape must into alcohol. The yeast accomplishes this by utilizing glucose through a series of metabolic pathways that, in the presence of oxygen, produces not only large amounts of energy for the cell but also many different intermediates that the cell needs to function. In the absence of oxygen (and sometimes even in the presence of oxygenB. Zoecklein, K. Fugelsang, B. Gump, F. Nury Wine Analysis and Production pgs 97-114 Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York (1999) ), the cell will continue some metabolic functions (such as glycolysis) but will rely on other pathways such as reduction of acetaldehyde into ethanol (fermentation) to \\"recharge\\" the co-enzymes needed to keep metabolism going. It is through this process of fermentation that ethanol is released by the yeast cells as a waste product. Eventually, if the yeast cells are healthy and fermentation is allowed to run to the completion, all fermentable sugars will be used up by the yeast with only the unfermentable pentose leaving behind a negligible amount of residual sugar. Other compounds in wine produced by yeast If a Chardonnay has too much \\"buttery\\" diacetyl notes, winemakers may add fresh yeast to the wine to consume the diacetyl and reduce it to the more neutral- smelling fusel oil 2,3-Butanediol. While the production of alcohol is the most noteworthy by-product of yeast metabolism from a winemaking perspective, there are a number of other products that yeast produce that can be also influence the resulting wine. This includes glycerol which is produced when an intermediate of the glycolysis cycle (dihydroxyacetone) is reduced to \\"recharge\\" the NADH enzyme needed to continue other metabolic activities. This is usually produced early in the fermentation process before the mechanisms to reduce acetaldehyde into ethanol to recharge NADH becomes the cell's primary means of maintaining redox balance. As glycerol contributes increased body and a slightly sweet taste without increasing the alcohol level of the wine, some winemakers try to intentionally favor conditions that would promote glycerol production in wine. This includes selecting yeast strains that favor glycerol production (or allowing some wild yeast like Kloeckera and Metschnikowia to ferment), increased oxygen exposure and aeration as well as fermenting at higher temperatures. Glycerol production is also encouraged if most available acetaldehyde is made unavailable by binding with bisulfite molecules in the wine, but it would take a substantial amount of sulfur dioxide addition (far beyond legal limits) to prolong glycerol production beyond just these very nascent stages of fermentation.Dr. Yair Margalit, Winery Technology & Operations A Handbook for Small Wineries pgs 67–74 The Wine Appreciation Guild (1996) Other by-products of yeast include: *Methanol – Caused by the demethylation of pectins in the must by enzymes of the yeast. More commonly found in red wines than white but only in very small amounts between 20–200 mg/L. *Fusel oils – Formed by the decomposition of amino acids by the yeast. This includes 2,3-Butanediol which is formed by yeast-consuming diacetyl, the compound that gives Chardonnay and other wines a \\"buttery\\" aroma, reducing it first to acetoin and then to the more neutral-smelling 2,3-Butanediol. Many beer and winemakers who have a wine with too much \\"butteriness\\" will often \\"pitch\\" fresh yeast cultures into the no longer fermenting tank so that the yeast will consume the diacetyl and reduce the aroma.Brewing Science \\"Diacetyl: Homebrew Science\\" Brew Magazine November, 2002 *Succinic acid – Like glycerol, this is often formed early in fermentation. Usually found in concentrations of 500–1200 mg/L, it is a minor acid in the overall acidity of wine. *Acetic acid – Considered a main component of volatile acidity that can make a wine taste unbalanced and overly acidic. While acetic acid is the main volatile acid produced by yeast, trace amounts of butyric, formic and propionic acids can also be formed depending on the yeast strain. Most countries have wine laws setting the legal limit of volatile acidity, usually expressed as acetic acid, to 1200–2000 mg/L. Acetic acid can also lead to the development of the wine fault ethyl acetate which is characterized by a \\"nail polish remover\\" smell. However, small amounts of acetic acid are actually beneficial for the yeast as they use them to synthesis lipids in the cell membrane. The distinctive \\"aldehydic\\" notes of Sherry wines are caused by special yeast native to the Jerez wine region. *Acetaldehyde – While most of the acetaldehyde produce gets reduced to ethanol or is bound by sulfur dioxide, concentrations between 50–100 mg/L can remain in the wine. The flor yeast strains that produce the Spanish wine Sherry will produce higher amounts that contributes to the characterized \\"aldehydic\\" aromas of Sherries. In the presence of oxygen, yeast can convert some of the ethanol presence in the wine back into acetaldehyde creating oxidized aromas. *Hydrogen sulfide – Often produced by yeast during fermentation because of a nitrogen deficiency in the must. This can be done by a reduction of sulfates or sulfites available in the must or by the decomposition of dead yeast cells by other yeast that releases sulfur-containing amino acids that are further broken down by the yeast. The latter often happens with wines that sit in contact with their lees for long periods of time between rackings. In the presence of alcohol, hydrogen sulfide can react with ethanol to form ethyl mercaptans and disulfides that contribute to off aromas and wine faults. Some commercial yeast strains, such as Montrachet 522 are known to produce higher levels of hydrogen sulfides than other strains, particularly if the must has some nutrient deficiencies. *Pyruvic acid – Along with acetaldehyde, this compound can react with anthocyanins extracted from contact with grape skins to create a more stable color pigment (pyranoanthocyanin) that can enhance the color of some red wines. *Various esters, ketones, lactones, phenols and acetals. Lees The lees left over from the secondary fermentation of sparkling wine can be seen on the bottom side of this bottle being inspected. Eventually this wine will go through riddling to collect the lees in the neck, where it will be removed prior to corking. When yeast cells die, they sink to the bottom of the fermentation vessel where they combine with insoluble tartrates, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the gross lees as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the autolysis (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 398–399 Oxford University Press 2006 The process of leaving the wine to spend some contact with the lees has a long history in winemaking, being known to the Ancient Romans and described by Cato the Elder in the 2nd century BC. Today the practice is widely associated with any red wines that are barrel fermented, Muscadet, sparkling wine Champagne as well as Chardonnay produced in many wine regions across the globe. Typically when wines are left in contact with their lees, they are regularly stirred in order to release the mannoproteins, polysaccharides and other compounds that were present in the yeast cell walls and membranes. This stirring also helps avoid the development of reductive sulfur compounds like mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide that can appear if the lees layer is more than 10 cm (4 inches) thick and undisturbed for more than a week. Most of the benefits associated with lees contact deals with the influence on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the autolysis of the yeast cells. Composed primarily of mannose and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with hydrophobic aroma compounds that become volatilized as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to tartrate and protein stability, help enhance the body and mouthfeel of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and astringency of tannins. Secondary fermentation The production of Champagne and many sparkling wines requires a second fermentation to occur in the bottle in order to produce the carbonation necessary for the style. A small amount of sugared liquid is added to individual bottles, and the yeast is allowed to convert this to more alcohol and carbon dioxide. The lees are then ricked into the neck of the bottle, frozen, and expelled via pressure of the carbonated wine. Types of yeasts used in winemaking Film yeast on the surface of wine in a barrel of Vin jaune from the Jura wine region of France. Yeast taxonomy includes classification of yeast species depending on the presence or absence of a sexual phase. Therefore, some winemaking yeasts are classified by their asexual anamorph (or \\"imperfect\\" form) while others may be classified by their sexual teleomorph (or \\"perfect\\" form). A common example of this is Brettanomyces (or \\"Brett\\") that is usually referenced in wine and viticulture text under its asexual classification though some scientific and winemaking texts may describe specific species (such as Dekkera bruxellensis) under its sporulating sexual classification of Dekkera. Unless otherwise noted, this article will commonly refer to the asexual form of wine yeast. The most common yeast generally associated with winemaking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is also used in bread making and brewing. Other genera of yeast that can be involved in winemaking (either beneficially or as the cause of potential wine faults) include: *Brettanomyces (Teleomorph Dekkera) *Candida (Teleomorphs for different species from several genera including Pichia, Metschnikowia, Issatchenkia, Torulaspora and Kluyveromyces) *Kloeckera (Teleomorph Hanseniaspora), usually the most common \\"wild yeast\\" found in the vineyard. Some species are known as \\"killer yeast\\" that produce inhibitory levels of ethyl acetate and acetic acid that can kill off sensitive strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae *Saccharomycodes *Schizosaccharomyces, the only wine yeast that reproduced by fission whereas most wine yeast reproduce by budding. *Zygosaccharomyces, very alcohol-tolerant and can grow in wines up to 18% v/v. Additionally this yeast can survive in extremely high sugar levels (as much as 60% w/w or 60 Brix) and is very resistant to sulfur dioxide. *Aureobasidium, particularly the \\"black yeast\\" species of Aureobasidium pullulans found in moist cellars that can contaminate aging wine in barrels. Saccharomyces Saccharomyces cerevisiae as seen under a Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscope. The yeast genus Saccharomyces (sugar mold) is favored for winemaking (for both grapes as well as other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars. In addition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other species within the genus Saccharomyces that are involved with winemaking include: *Saccharomyces bayanus *Saccharomyces beticus *Saccharomyces fermentati *Saccharomyces paradoxus *Saccharomyces pastorianus *Saccharomyces uvarum Influences of different strains on fermentation While some strains of yeast may influence the sensory characteristics and aromas of young wine, these differences seem to fade as the wine ages. In 1996, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the first single-celled, eukaryotic organism to have its entire genome sequenced. This sequencing helped confirm the nearly century of work by mycologists and enologists in identifying different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are used in beer, bread and winemaking. Today there are several hundred different strains of S. cerevisiae identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains that are, there is debate among winemakers and scientists about the actual magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive difference when compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the wines age. Some distinct difference among various strains include the production of certain \\"off-flavor\\" and aromas that may be temporary (but producing a \\"stinky fermentation\\") or could stay with the wine and either have to be dealt with through other winemaking means (such as the presence of volatile sulfur compounds like hydrogen sulfide) or leave a faulty wine. Another difference includes the \\"vigor\\" or speed of fermentation (which can also be influenced by other factors beyond yeast selection) with some yeast strains having the tendency to do \\"fast ferments\\" while others may take longer to get going. Another less measurable difference that are subject to more debate and questions of winemakers preference is the influence of strain selection on the varietal flavors of certainly grape varieties such as Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. It is believed that these wines can be influenced by thiols produced by the hydrolysis of certain cysteine-linked compounds by enzymes that are more prevalent in particular strains. Other aromatic varieties such as Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Muscat may also be influenced by yeast strains containing high levels of glycosidases enzymes that can modify monoterpenes. Similarly, though potentially to a much smaller extent, other varieties could be influenced by hydrolytic enzymes working on aliphatics, norisoprenoids, and benzene derivatives such as polyphenols in the must. In sparkling wine production some winemakers select strains (such as one known as Épernay named after the town in the Champagne wine region of France and California Champagne, also known as UC-Davis strain 505) that are known to flocculate well, allowing the dead yeast cells to be removed easily by riddling and disgorgement. In Sherry production, the surface film of yeast known as flor used to make the distinctive style of fino and manzanilla sherries comes from different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though the commercial flor yeast available for inoculation is often from different species of Saccharomyces, Saccharomyces beticus, Saccharomyces fermentati and Saccharomyces bayanus. Wild yeasts and natural fermentation Fruit flies are a common vector that transports ambient or \\"wild\\" yeast strains within wineries. In winemaking, the term \\"wild yeast\\" has multiple meanings. In its most basic context, it refers to yeast that has not been introduced to the must by intentional inoculation of a cultured strain. Instead, these \\"wild yeasts\\" often come into contact with the must through their presence on harvest equipment, transport bins, the surface winemaking equipment and as part of the natural flora of a winery. Very often these are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have taken residence in these places over the years, sometimes being previously introduced by inoculation of prior vintages. In this context, these wild yeasts are often referred to as ambient, indigenous or natural yeast as opposed to inoculated, selected or cultured yeast. Wineries that often solely rely on these \\"in-house\\" strains will sometimes market their wines as being the product of wild or natural fermentations. The (c. 304) Nanfang Caomu Zhuang has the earliest description of winemaking using \\"herb ferment\\" (cǎoqū 草麴) wild yeast with rice and various herbs, including the poisonous Gelsemium elegans (yěgé 冶葛).Joseph Needham and Huang Hsing-Tsung (2000), Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 6 Biology and Biological Technology, Part 5: Fermentations and Food Science, Cambridge University Press, p. 183.Li Hui-Lin (1979), Nan-fang ts'ao-mu chuang: a fourth century flora of Southeast Asia, The Chinese University Press, p. 59. Another use of the term \\"wild yeast\\" refers to the non-Saccharomyces genera of yeasts that are present in the vineyard, on the surface of grapevines and of the grapes themselves. Anywhere from 160 to 100,000 colony forming units of wild yeasts per berry could exist in a typical vineyard. These yeasts can be carried by air currents, birds and insects through the vineyard and even into the winery (such as by fruit flies). The most common wild yeasts found in the vineyard are from the genera Kloeckera, Candida and Pichia with the species Kloeckera apiculata being the most dominant species by far. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, itself, is actually quite rarely found in the vineyard or on the surface freshly harvested wine grapes unless the winery frequently reintroduced winery waste (such as lees and pomace) into the vineyard. Unlike the \\"ambient\\" Saccharomyces wild yeast, these genera of wild yeasts have very low tolerance to both alcohol and sulfur dioxide. They are capable of starting a fermentation and often begin this process as early as the harvest bin when clusters of grapes get slightly crushed under their own weight. Some winemakers will try to \\"knock out\\" these yeasts with doses of sulfur dioxide, most often at the crusher before the grapes are pressed or allowed to macerate with skin contact. Other winemakers may allow the wild yeasts to continue fermenting until they succumb to the toxicity of the alcohol they produce which is often between 3–5% alcohol by volume and then letting either inoculated or \\"ambient\\" Saccharomyces strains finish the fermentation. Wineries that wish to cultivate an \\"in-house\\" ambient yeast strain will often recycle the leftover pomace of previous vintages as compost in the vineyard. The use of both \\"ambient\\" and non-Saccharomyces wild yeasts carries both potential benefits and risk. Some winemakers feel that the use of resident/indigenous yeast helps contribute to the unique expression of terroir in the wine. In wine regions such as Bordeaux, classified and highly regarded estates will often tout the quality of their resident \\"chateau\\" strains. To this extent, wineries will often take the leftover pomace and lees from winemaking and return them to the vineyard to be used as compost in order to encourage the sustained presence of favorable strains. But compared to inoculated yeast, these ambient yeasts hold the risk of having a more unpredictable fermentation. Not only could this unpredictability include the presence of off-flavors/aromas and higher volatile acidity but also the potential for a stuck fermentation if the indigenous yeast strains are not vigorous enough to fully convert all the sugars. It is virtually inevitable that non-Saccharomyces wild yeast will have a role in beginning the fermentation of virtually every wine but for the wineries that choose to allow these yeasts to continue fermenting versus minimizing their influence do so with the intent of enhancing complexity through bio-diversity. While these non-Saccharomyces ferment glucose and fructose into alcohol, they also have the potential to create other intermediates that could influence the aroma and flavor profile of the wine. Some of these intermediates could be positive, such as phenylethanol, which can impart a rose-like aroma. However, as with ambient yeasts, the products of these yeasts can be very unpredictable — especially in terms of the types of flavors and aromas that these yeasts can produce. Inoculated yeast Some winemakers favor the use of freeze-dried cultured yeast (left) and yeast nutrients (right) because of their relative predictability in beginning and completing a fermentation. When winemakers select a cultured yeast strain, it is largely done because the winemaker wants a predictable fermentation taken to completion by a strain that has a track record of dependability. Among the particular considerations that are often important to winemakers is a yeast's tendency to: *Quickly begin fermentation, out-competing other \\"wild yeasts\\" for nutrients in the must *Completely utilize all fermentable sugars with a predictable sugar-to-alcohol conversion rate *Have an alcohol-tolerance up to 15% or even higher depending on the winemaking style *Have a high sulfur dioxide tolerance but low production of sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide or dimethyl sulfide *Produce a minimum amount of residual pyruvate, acetic acid and acetaldehyde *Produce minimum foaming during fermentation which may create difficulties for cap management during maceration or cause bungs to pop out during barrel fermentation. *Have high levels of flocculation and lees compaction that makes racking, fining and filtering of the wine easier. Inoculated (or pure cultured) yeasts are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have been identified and plated from wineries across the world (including notable producers from well-known wine regions such as Bordeaux, Burgundy, Napa Valley and the Barossa Valley). These strains are tested in laboratories to determine a strain's vigor, sulfur dioxide and alcohol tolerance, production levels of acetic acid and sulfur compounds, ability to re-ferment (positive for sparkling wine but a negative attribute for sweet late-harvest wines), development of surface film on the wine (positive for some Sherry styles but a negative attribute for many other wines), enhancement of a wine's color or certain varietal characteristics by enzymes in the yeast cells and other metabolic products produced by the yeast, foaming and flocculation tendencies, yeasticidal properties (a trait known as \\"Killer yeast\\") and tolerance for nutritional deficiencies in a must that may lead to a stuck fermentation. Re-hydrating freeze dried yeast cultures Preparing a yeast starter culture and gradually cooling the culture down to the must temperature by adding some wine. Pure culture yeasts that are grown in a lab are often freeze dried and packaged for commercial use. Prior to their addition into must, these yeasts need to be re-hydrated in \\"starter cultures\\" that must be carefully monitored (particularly in regards to temperature) to ensure that the yeast cells are not killed off by cold shock. Ideally winemakers want to add enough inoculum to have a viable cell population density of 5 million cells per milliliter. The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1 gram per gallon (or 25 grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added. Similarly, re-hydration procedures will also vary depending on the manufacturer and winery. Yeast is often inoculated in a volume of water or grape must that is 5–10 times the weight of the dry yeast. This liquid is often brought to temperature of 40 °C (104 °F) prior to the introduction of the yeast (though some yeast strains may need temperatures below 38 °C (100 °F)) to allow the cells to disperse easily rather than clump and sink to the bottom of the container. The heat activation also allows the cells to quickly reestablish their membrane barrier before soluble cytoplasmic components escape the cell. Re-hydration at lower temperatures can greatly reduce the viability of the yeast with up to 60% cell death if the yeast is re-hydrated at 15 °C (60 °F). The culture is then stirred and aerated to incorporate oxygen into the culture which the yeast uses in the synthesis of needed survival factors. The temperature of the starter culture is then slowly reduced, often by the graduated addition of must to get within 5–10 °C (9-18 °F) of the must that the culture will be added to. This is done to avoid the sudden cold shock that the yeast cells may experience if the starter culture was added directly to the must itself which can kill up to 60% of the culture. Additionally, surviving cells exposed to cold shock tend to see an increase in hydrogen sulfide production. Nutritional needs of wine yeast Diammonium phosphate (or DAP) is a common additive that provides two necessary nutrients for yeast to have a healthy and sustained fermentation—nitrogen and phosphate. In order to successfully complete a fermentation with minimum to no negative attributes being added to the wine, yeast needs to have the full assortment of its nutritional needs met. These include not only an available energy source (carbon in the form of sugars such as glucose) and yeast assimilable nitrogen (ammonia and amino acids or YAN) but also minerals (such as magnesium) and vitamins (such as thiamin and riboflavin) that serve as important growth and survival factors. Among the other nutritional needs of wine yeast: *Phosphate – used for the production of nucleic acids, phospholipids (an important component of the cell membrane) and ATP (Adenosine triphosphate which the cell uses for transferring energy for metabolism). *Potassium – important for the uptake and utilization of phosphate *Biotin – involved in the synthesis of proteins, fatty acids and nucleic acids. *Pantothenic acid – involved in the metabolism of sugars and lipids. A deficiency of this vitamin could lead into increase hydrogen sulfide production with off-aromas in the resulting wine. *Nicotinic acid – involved in the synthesis of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a co-enzyme that is important in maintaining the redox balance of the cell as well as in the process of ethanol fermentation itself. *Inositol – involved with the secondary messenger molecules that facilitate cell division. *Trace amounts of calcium, chlorine, copper, iron, manganese and zinc for healthy cell function. One traditional way of providing nutrients for the yeast is the ripasso method where the leftover grape skins and pomace (pictured) from a previous fermentation is added to a newly fermenting wine. Many of these nutrients are available in the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover pomace from the pressing of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can assimilate nitrogen from both inorganic (ammonia and ammonium) and organic forms (amino acids, particularly arginine). As yeast cells die, enzymes within the cells begin autolyzing by breaking down the cell, including the amino acids. This autolysis of the cell provides an available nitrogen source for the still- fermenting and viable yeast cells. However, this autolysis can also release sulfur-link compounds (such as the breakdown of amino acid cysteine) which can combine with other molecules and react with alcohol to create volatile thiols that can contribute to a \\"stinky fermentation\\" or later development into various wine faults. The role of oxygen Yeasts are facultative anaerobes meaning that they can exist in both the presence and absence of oxygen. While fermentation is traditionally thought of as an anaerobic process done in the absence of oxygen, early exposure of the yeast to oxygen can be a vital component in the successful completion of that fermentation. This is because oxygen is important in the synthesis of cell \\"survival factors\\" such as ergosterol and lanosterol. These sterols are important in maintaining the selective permeability of the yeast cell membrane which becomes critical as the yeast becomes exposed to increasing osmotic pressure and levels of alcohol in the wine. As a waste product of its own metabolism, alcohol is actually very toxic to yeast cells. Yeast with weak survival factors and lacking sterols may succumb to these conditions before fermenting a wine to complete dryness, leaving a stuck fermentation. Cultured yeasts that are freeze-dried and available for inoculation of wine must are deliberately grown in commercial labs in high oxygen/low sugar conditions that favor the development of these survival factors. One of the reasons that some winemakers prefer using inoculated yeast is the predictability of fermentation due to the high level of survival factors that cultured yeast are assured of having without necessarily needing to expose the wine to additional levels of oxygen. Winemakers using \\"ambient\\" yeasts that are resident in their winery may not have this same assurance of survival factors and may need to compensate with other winemaking techniques. Wild non-Saccharomyces yeasts often need a much greater exposure to oxygen in order to build up survival factors which is why many of these yeasts are often found living oxidatively as \\"film yeast\\" on the surface of wines in tanks or barrels. Wine faults related to yeast Film yeast like Candida (pictured) and Pichia can cover the surface of a wine with a film layer that not only consumed most of the free sulfur dioxide available to protect the wine but also produces high levels of acetic acid that will contribute to volatile acidity in a wine. Either directly or indirectly, wine yeast can be a culprit behind a wide variety of wine faults. These can include the presence of \\"off flavors\\" and aromas that can be the by-product of some \\"wild yeast\\" fermentation such as those by species within the genera of Kloeckera and Candida. Even the common wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be behind some wine faults with some strains of the yeast known to produce higher than ideal levels of acetic acid, acetaldehyde and volatile sulfur compounds such as thiols. Also any yeast can have a low tolerance to nutritional deficiencies, temperature fluctuation or extremes and excessive or low sugar levels that may lead to a stuck fermentation. In the presence of oxygen several species of Candida and Pichia can create a film surface on top of the wine in the tank of barrel. Allowed to go unchecked, these yeasts can rapidly deplete the available free sulfur compounds that keeps a wine protected from oxidation and other microbial attack. The presence of these yeasts is often identified by elevated levels of volatile acidity, particularly acetic acid. Some strains of Pichia will metabolize acetic acid (as well as ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate that may also be produced) with the side-effect of substantially decreasing the titratable acidity and shifting the pH of wine upwards to levels that make the wine prone to attack by other spoilage microbes. Commonly called \\"film yeast\\", these yeasts are distinguished from the flor sherry yeast that are usually welcomed by winemakers in producing the delicate fino-style wines. Growth of many unfavorable wild yeasts is generally slowed at lower cellar temperatures, so many winemakers who wish to inhibit the activities of these yeasts before the more favorable Saccharomyces yeast kick in, will often chill their must, such as the practice of \\"cold soaking\\" the must during a pre-fermentation maceration at temperatures between 4–15 °C (39–50 °F). Though some species, such as Brettanomyces, will not be inhibited and may even thrive during an extended period of cold soaking. Brettanomyces While some wine regions view the influence of Brettanomyces on the wine, in limited amounts, as added complexity, many winemakers view the presence of Brettanomyces species such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis (pictured) in their wineries as a negative influence that needs to be controlled. The wine yeast Brettanomyces (or \\"Brett\\") produces very distinctive aroma compounds, 4-Ethylphenol (4-EP) and 4-Ethylguaiacol (4-EG), that can have a wine being described as smelling like a \\"barnyard\\", \\"wet saddle\\" or \\"band-aid\\". To some winemakers and with some wine styles (such as Pinot noir from Burgundy), a limited amount of these compounds could be considered a positive attribute that adds to the complexity of wine. To other winemakers and with other wine styles (such as Riesling from the Mosel), the presence of any Brett will be considered a fault.M. Baldy The University Wine Course pg 80 The Wine Appreciation Guild Third Edition 2009 Fruit flies are common vector in the transfer of Brettanomyces between tanks and even nearby wineries. As a fermentation yeast, Brettanomyces can usually ferment a wine up to 10-11% alcohol levels before they die out. Sometimes Brettanomyces already present in a wine that has been inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae will out compete the Saccharomyces strain for nutrients and even inhibit it due to the high levels of acetic acid, decanoic acid and octanoic acid that many strains of Brettanomyces can produce. Once Brett is in a winery, it is very difficult to control even with strict hygiene and the discarding of barrels and equipment that has previously come into contact with \\"Bretty\\" wine. This is because many species of Brettanomyces can use a wide variety of carbon sources in wine and grape must, including ethanol, for metabolism. Additionally, Brett can produce a wide range of by- products that could influence the wine beyond just the 4-EP and 4-EG compounds previously discussed. Many of these compounds, such as the \\"footprints\\" of the 4-EP and 4-EG, will still remain in the wine even after yeast cells die and are removed by racking and sterile filtration.

Character=Creation Kyle Killen conceived of Michael and the rest of the family and series in 2011 after a report that NBC had purchased the series from the creator Killen, under the original name REM. Killen had been called in to pitch a new drama for NBC, after Jennifer Salke, the president of the entertainment division of NBC, encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a new drama television series after the cancellation of Lone Star on the Fox network. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. \\"It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her,\\" recalled Korman. \\"I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work\\". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox. Michael made his debut with the rest of the Britten family on March 1, 2012, in \\"Pilot\\" on NBC. Casting Kyle Killen created Michael after developing Lone Star for the Fox network. In February 2011, Jason Isaacs obtained the role of the character. Executive producer Howard Gordon summated the premise of the character: \\"He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he’s with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. And so — and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes.\\" Series creator Kyle Killen thought that the premise behind the series would be relatable to audiences, making it easier to broader his fanbase. \\"I think there were aspects of Lone Star that were more difficult to get a wider, broader audience interested in,\\" he articulated. \\"[The main character] was somebody that you couldn’t decide if you liked or hated, and I think that Britten's dilemma is something that we’re not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win.\\" Personality Michael develops a routine to help him maintain the illusions of control. He is also disorganized and sometimes exhibits odd behavior, due to living in two realities. Michael gets confused often and suffers from a sleeping disorder. He refuses treatment because he does not wish to accept one reality while rejecting the other, as he wants the opportunity to be with both his wife and son, albeit separately. One example is when Michael does not hand in a permission form for Rex's field trip to the museum. In \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\", Michael is unable switch to the \\"green reality\\" (where Rex is alive), for unknown reason, which Dr. Lee says is progress. Michael finds out he could not switch because it was his subconscious telling him he needed to uncover the truth behind his car crash. He eventually discover Detective Ed Hawkins caused the accident in an attempt to kill Michael. Reception=Analysis Jason Issacs's performance as Michael Britten was met with praise from television commentators. Jason Isaacs's role of Michael Britten has met with praise from most television commentators. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was keen to Isaacs' acting in the episode. \\"It helps enormously to have Isaacs playing the lead. This actor knows how to convey a gravity that contrasts well with the series' airy concept, but he avoids becoming heavy and morose.\\" West summated that the cast \\"really couldn't be better on this series\\"; \\"Isaacs [delivered] a stellar performance as the intelligent detective, and loving father and husband who's just trying to make sense of what's going on and probably not entirely regretful to be experiencing a split reality. Both Wong and Jones are fantastic as the curious therapists. I already wish there were some way we could see these two on screen together.\\" The Paste Magazine, IGN, and TV Fanatic argued that Issacs's performance deserves an Emmy. Duguay of the Montreal Gazette thought that Isaacs evoked a reservedness and ambiguity that attracted viewers to his character.

Early life and education Simon Baruch, the son of Jewish parents Bernard and Theresa (Green), was born in Schwersenz. He attended the Royal Gymnasium in Posen-West Prussia. In 1855 he emigrated to South Carolina at 15 years old to live with the Manus Baum family five years after their arrival in America. Baruch worked for Manus Baum as a bookkeeper before beginning to study medicine in 1859. Baruch attended lectures at the Medical College of the State of South Carolina, and enrolled at the Medical College of Virginia (MCV), (now Virginia Commonwealth University) in Richmond, Virginia, where he received a medical degree in 1862. Baruch began his career as a surgeon in the American Civil War; serving in the Confederate States Army and reportedly entering the service \\"without even having lanced a boil.\\" He initially accepted a commission as assistant surgeon of the 3rd South Carolina Battalion on April 4, 1862, and in August of that same year, he transferred to the 13th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, in the position of surgeon. During the war, Baruch gained considerable surgical experience. After the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg in July 1863, he stayed on to treat the wounded for six weeks. Afterwards, he was imprisoned at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, and he returned to his unit in December 1863. Following a period of ill health, he returned to the 13th Mississippi Regiment 6 months later, and he served until the end of the war. After the war, Baruch remained in the South during the Reconstruction Era, where he practiced medicine and authored a widely read pamphlet on \\"Bayonet Wounds.\\" In 1865, Baruch went to New York City, where he worked for one year in a postgraduate position as an attending physician to the Medical Polyclinic of the North-Eastern Dispensary in the Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan district of Manhattan – a bastion of poor and working-class people. There, Baruch tended to patients who were suffering from communicable infection, most of whom lacked access to clean bath water, fresh air, and sunshine. A year later, Dr. Baruch returned to Camden, South Carolina, in 1867.  Medical career  For 16 years Baruch practiced medicine in South Carolina. He also advocated for the smallpox vaccination for the children of the state, and he helped to reactivate the South Carolina State Medical Association, serving as president. He held a position on the faculty of the South Carolina State Medical College, and he was chairman of the Board of Health, later renamed South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. However, Baruch grew increasingly dissatisfied with the indiscriminate use of unproven medical remedies. He studied the healing philosophies of Austrian physician Vincent Priessnitz (1799–1852), and in particular, the success of a therapeutic spa in the Silesian Foothills. The remedies were largely predicated upon frequent bathing and irrigation of the gastrointestinal tract; an alternative form of medicine called hydrotherapy. Patients recuperated in a restful, calm environment, ate a prudent diet, eliminated alcohol and tobacco, and engaged in physical activity. Later, Baruch also credited Wilhelm Winternitz for his pioneering work in hydrotherapy.Simon Baruch. Hydrotherapy. A System of practical therapeutics. v. 1. (Hobart Amory Hare, editor), pp. 361-428, Lea Bros., 1901; Baruch would go on to introduce medicinal spring therapies, known as balneology, and hydrotherapy to the United States of America. In 1881, Baruch took up residence in New York City with his wife Belle, and their four sons, Hartwig (\\"Harty\\") Nathaniel (1868–1953), Bernard Mannes (1870–1965), Herman Benjamin (1872–1953), and Sailing Wolfe (1874–1963). He became known as an active public health advocate and medical writer. He also gained professional credibility for diagnosing the first case of perforating appendicitis successfully operated on, and in the widely publicized \\"child cruelty\\" case involving the musical prodigy Josef Hofmann, Baruch was the consulting physician.BARUCH, SIMON jewish encyclopedia.com, English, accessed on 15th July 2010 After examining Hofmann, Baruch recommended the boy musician rest and resume the lifestyle of a child. In 1892, Baruch became a fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine. As a physician and scholar, Baruch's enduring interest in hydrotherapy guided many his professional and civic pursuits. He published the standard texts, \\"The Uses of Water in Modern Medicine\\" (1892), \\"Therapeutic reflections: a plea for physiological remedies\\" (1893), and \\"The Principles and Practice of Hydrotherapy\\" (1898). From 1903 to 1913, he taught a course in hydro-therapeutics, or methods of using water to treat various diseases, at New York Post Graduate Medical School and Hospital of the University of the State of New York. He resigned when hydrotherapy was made an elective subject of study. In 1910, Baruch wrote \\"Lessons of half a century in medicine.\\" In 1920, he authored \\"Epitome of hydrotherapy for physicians, architects and nurses.\\" Notably, Baruch's interest in hydrotherapy led to his role as the country's foremost municipal bath advocate. Ever since his trip in the 1880s to study the public bath system of Germany, Baruch was a tireless advocate for free public baths in New York City, during a period of immigration in American history when newcomers flooded cities. After he studied hydrotherapy, and understood the utility of fresh water to the prevention of infection. Baruch worked tirelessly to educate public officials and the medical community about the importance of water to public health. For many years, the general public and civic leaders were skeptical about the debilitating effects of poor sanitation on physical health; pessimistic Mayor Hugh J. Grant (1852–1910) declared, \\"The people won't bathe.\\" Despite decades of opposition, Baruch managed to convince three successive mayors of the utility of water, and in particular, the importance of a public bath system to the population health of the urban working class and poor. He wrote numerous journal and newspaper articles on the medical utility of water, including first article published in America on public baths for the Philadelphia Medical Times and Register on August 24, 1889. He reported on the structure, functioning, and health benefits of a public bath systems to the New York's Committee on Hygiene, in his role as chairman. Baruch also delivered addresses on the topic to medical and scientific societies. Moreover, Baruch was medical editor at the New York Sun, from 1912 to 1918, and he covered all the major health concerns of the period, and wrote articles on a variety of topics, from the common cold to malarial fevers. Public bathhouses Report on public baths and public comfort stations by the Mayor's committee of New York City (1897) (14591088910) Free Public Baths 538 East 11th Street Asser Levy Recreation CenterAlthough Baruch met with continual resistance, by 1895, he successfully persuaded the State Legislature to pass a law to obligate cities exceeding a population of 50,000 to establish and maintain free bathhouse facilities, and an order from the local Board of Alderman to construct a public bath in the City of New York. In 1897, 9 Centre Market Place People's Baths, located between Centre and Mulberry Streets, served as a prototype public bathhouse. Financed by private contributions from the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (AICP), and built on land owned by the City Mission and the Tract Society, the facility provided more than 100,000 people a year with a bath, soap, and a towel for five cents.\\"Report on Public Baths and Public Comfort Stations\\", April 9, 1897, The Mayor's Committee of New York City. In 1901, Baruch and his colleagues, Deputy Commissioner of Health of the City of New York Fowler and Dr. Van Santvoord, presided over the opening of the first free public bathhouse, Rivington Street municipal bath, located at 326 Rivington, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The bathhouse facility featured indoor and outdoor bathing pools, 45 showers and five soaking tubs for men, and 22 showers for women. Other public baths of the period, credited to the advocacy of Baruch, include the Clarkson Street Bathhouse, located at 83 Carmine Street in Greenwich Village, which provided showers, tubs, and a gymnasium complex on two floors, as well as an open-air classroom on the rooftop for children in poor health. The facility has since become part of the Tony Dapolito Recreation Center. In 1904, several more free public baths opened in Manhattan, including the Milbank Memorial Bath, located on 325–327 East 38th Street, a gift to the City of New York by a Borden (company) heiress, which had the capacity to hold 3,000 people. That same year, the City opened West 60th Street Bathhouse, now Gertrude Elderle Recreation Center, providing 49 showers for men and 20 for women. In 1905, The Public Baths, designed by prominent architect Arnold W. Brunner, opened at 538 East 11th Street, between Avenues A and B, in the Alphabet City area of the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan; the building is also on the List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street. Asser Levy Public Baths opened in 1906, at the corner of Asser Levy Place and East 23rd Street, in the Kips Bay area. Also designed by architect Arnold W. Brunner and Martin Aiken, the facility has since become part of the Asser Levy Recreation Center, and the building is a designated historic landmark. In 1912, Dr. Baruch was appointed the founding president of the American Association for Promoting Hygiene and Public Baths, a position he held until his death. Baruch said he had \\"done more to save life and prevent the spread of disease in my work for public baths than in all ... work as a physician.\\" Family In 1867, Simon Baruch married Isabelle (\\"Belle\\") Wolfe (1850–1921), daughter of cotton farmer Sailing Wolfe of Winnsboro, South Carolina. Their son Bernard M. Baruch went on to a successful career on Wall Street and a financial advisor to U.S. Presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman; his substantial fortune afforded him the opportunity to endow university chairs, medical school facilities, and public buildings in his father's name. Herman B. Baruch followed his father's footsteps to become a physician, and then a diplomat, and president of the Simon Baruch Foundation. Hartwig Baruch was an actor, and Sailing Baruch was a banker and stockbroker. Legacy Simon Baruch is the namesake of civil monuments, educational entities, and academic departments in New York City, and throughout the country, many of which were established by his son Bernard M. Baruch, including Simon Baruch Houses, a public housing complex in Manhattan, as well as buildings, halls, and academic chairs at Columbia University, Clemson University, New York University College of Medicine, and the Medical College of Virginia/ VCU. New York City Department of Education's Middle School 104 is named Simon Baruch Middle School, along with an adjacent Simon Baruch Playground and Garden, under the auspices of the New York City Department of Parks.A Short History of Simon Baruch Middle School on schools.nyc.gov, retrieved on 15 July 2010Baruch Playground to nycgovparks.org, retrieved on 15 July 2010 In 1933, the Simon Baruch Research Institute of Balneology at Saratoga Springs Spa, Saratoga Springs, New York was established. In 1940, Bernard M. Baruch endowed in honor of Simon Baruch, the Simon Baruch Auditorium building on the campus of the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Virginia Commonwealth University as well as the university's Egyptian Building, designed by architect Thomas Somerville Stewart, now a National Historic Landmark.

Views on human sexuality  Nesterenko is a proponent of antisexualism and is one of the founders of the International Antisexual Movement (IAM). Теория невероятности. Жизнь без секса (a documentary) The IAM advocates for ending sexual relations throughout the world. It was Yuri Nesterenko who established the first Antisexual Society in Russia (1995) Since then, he has taken a leading role in the IAM. The main venue of the society is the \\"Anti-sexual Stronghold\\" website created by Nesterenko. The group accepts the minimum amount of sexual activity necessary to maintain population, but the founder hasn't updated it in quite a while. Nesterenko is an atheist and his pro-chastity views do not come from religious belief. According to him, sexual drive is similar to drug addiction because a common addictive element is present in the two behaviours. Nesterenko calls upon every person to make use of his own reason and to see that it is necessary to reject sexual relations.Yuri Nesterenko. The FAQ section of the Antisexual Stronghold website . Translated from Russian A. Yanovsky. Any sex other than that strictly for reproduction places animal passions over the development of the highest powers human possesses. That is why Nesterenko opposes it. He is not opposed to all emotions. There is nothing bad in feeling satisfaction from, for instance, a well-done job, either admiring or producing artwork, or intellectual communication. But emotions that originate in primitive instincts and fog the mind really must not exist. Yu. L. Nesterenko's attitude to David Jay presents special interest. His own ideas had already been formed in the main when AVEN's website was launched in 2002. On the whole he highly appreciates Jay's work, ascribing to him the credit of having set forth with the idea that sexual indifference is not in need of medical treatment. Later, however, there began to be serious disagreements. Nesterenko's stance is, first of all, much more radical than Jay's. When comparing the IAM and asexual people, Russian journalists give particular emphasis to the difference that the ideological position of the IAM's leader is militantly anti-sexual. Nesterenko not only considers asexuality a normal state, but also condemns all the forms of hedonistic sexual activity. In contrast to a conciliatory character of AVEN's attitude to the LGBT community, Nesterenko's efforts as an anti-sexual ideologist are not directed to looking for a fourth way between the three sexual orientations, viz., heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. He stresses in every way possible that the IAM is not a new variety of sexual minorities just as anti-fascists do not constitute a particular stream in fascism. When asked the question \\"But you're a minority, aren't you?\\" Nesterenko said: \\"If we take a psychiatric hospital, we find that medical staff is a minority there, too.\\" In the middle of the 2000s, the moulding of the IAM attracted the attention of Russian and foreign mass media. Nesterenko was interviewed by journalists and bloggers, articles about his anti-sexual views appearing in central newspapers and magazines of Russia and the CIS.As examples, take: Also he was featured on Russian television shows including TV programmes of Channel One and NTV. Nesterenko himself is not very happy with these shows. He says that they give a superficial and tendentious survey of the IAM. In his opinion, these attempts at a description of asexual people's ways of life (always with an obvious pro-sexual twist) are preconceived and not objective, with his real views being a bit distorted. Comments on ORT's documentary \\"Life without Sex\\" (ru.antisex archives)  Views on race  Nesterenko is an open proponent of racism. He defends his stance in the article entitled \\"Racism is bad? Can you prove it\\"?,Юрий Нестеренко. \\"Расизм - это плохо? А доказать?\\" where he defines racism as a \\"concept, according to which (human) races are not equal by certain significant (biologically ground) properties which can be objectively assessed in 'better - worse' terms\\" (e.g., on average, blacks are better in some kinds of sports while whites are better in intellectual tasks). Nesterenko states that this definition is just \\"an acknowledgement of the fact\\" and does not automatically justify any hatred or aggression against the race with worse properties. Among other things, he claims racism can be scientifically proven to be rational because of the low IQ of blacks, higher black criminality and lack of great civilizations (equal to the ones created by white and yellow races) built by blacks. He names a racist booklet \\"Whites & Blacks. 100 FACTS (and one Lie)\\", which he has on his site, as one of his sources.

It is located on Burlington Heights, a high sand- and gravel isthmus that separates Hamilton's harbor on the east from Cootes Paradise on the west. Historically, the cemetery consists of three, separate burial grounds over 100 acres: Burlington Heights Cemetery, the Christ Church Grounds, and the Church of Ascension Grounds. It has been a contentious issue whether a flood, around the 1860s inundated the city, necessitating the re-collecting of gravestones to be amassed in one place. From 1850 until 1892, each burial ground was administered separately, but by the beginning of the 1890s, the church wardens were encountering difficulty paying for the maintenance-and upkeep of their areas of the grounds.

The film takes its inspiration from the Persian poem Farhad and Shirin by Nizami Ganjavi, itself based on a story found in the Shahnameh. Plot Farhad Pastakia (Boman Irani) has a dream job as a bra-and-panty salesman. Except that he is a 45-year-old Parsi bachelor still living with his overbearing mother and grandmother. But it’s not like he’s stopped trying. Desperate to get him married, Farhad’s mother drags him to see women and even to embarrassing Parsi matrimony services. In the midst of all the daily humdrum, Farhad meets the woman of his dreams: Shirin Fugawala (Farah Khan), who drops by his store. Shirin, who works at the Parsi Trust, hits it off with Farhad from the start. Everything seems to be perfect and Farhad gets ready to introduce Shirin to his mother. But mummy becomes the villain in their story when she discovers that Shirin is the devious Parsi Trust Secretary who got the illegal water tank in their home demolished. The water tank being the 'aakhri nishaani' of Farhad’s late father doesn’t help matters. The ups and downs in Shirin-Farhad’s relationship and how the two try to make it work is the rest of the journey.

Anaelle (2006) Hand drawn, digitally transferred, finished as 35mm film print. This animation follows Gruber's account of a magical encounter involving resurrecting drowned ladybugs. Fantasy Pleasure Complex (2001–2010) This project is the collective title of a giant collection of short digital animation experiments by Stefan and guests and updated bi-yearly. Thought City (2000) Hand drawn punched paper animated film shot on Oxberry 16mm. Armies of commuters go about their routine, abstract and near-nonsensical business, within an ever-shifting cement block world. Occasionally, they get literally consumed by their own news, and they wage war against small, not entirely defenseless birds. Leashlessness (1999) Hand drawn flipbook animated film shot on Oxberry 16mm. In this animated clip, two dogs go into sensory overload, and it's up to a good Samaritan to liberate the four-legged friends from their oppressive leash-holders. Comics=Viking Eggling (2008) This twelve-page, full color comic is part of the SOS comic anthology.http://meathaus.com/read/meathaus-sos-preview-page/ In this comic, a Birdman rises up in ranks in some unusual outer space jobs. Duck Lessons (2003) Twelve-page mini comic about a person trying to get wisdom from a duck who never talks to him. Kometes (2002) Twelve-page mini comic about two people trying to start a radical garden. Some Sonic Nurturing in Washington's Mystic Bayou (2001) In this ten-page full color comic in the anthology Kramers Ergot #4, two mountainside dwellers find inspiration for new musical styles based on their encounter with legendary cryptozoological creature, Jake the Alligator Man. Gain Way (2000) This story consists of several one-page stories in Kramers Ergot #3 Performance Art=Lead Bunny (2012) Evaporation animation techniquehttp://vimeo.com/m/37219994 was invented for this show, and dancers modeled their movements to be sampled into a 5-minute piece that accompanied the live modern dance performance at Hedreen Gallery in 2012. Psychic Portraiture (2009) The purpose of this performance is to create and perform a show in which the artist paints portraits of audience members with animated light on a stage arranged with a large-sized canvas. Symbols from the life of the model materialize to decorate the portrait. In banter with the model and audience, psychic details are intuited. Real Time Comic (2008–2010) This project was started to navigate a way of improvising with animation in the company of musicians and dancers. Three shows, at OKOK, Velocity, and On the Boards were staged. Ongoing. Cuckoo Crow (2006) This was a sold out show at the Moore Theatre featured experimental performers Degenerate Art Ensemble with several animations projected onto experimental screens, such as an animated caged bird on the underside of a dress, slot machine animations on an ice cream truck, and 4 foot tall egg shapes that slowly dropped down from the 3 story tall rigging, filled with the movements of animated birds. Relatively Real (2005) On the Boards featured Lingo Dance Co and Gruber's animation projected onto mobile, wheeled 'sails' which could be arranged live by the dancers to form several sets. Abstract animations based on the dancer's movements were created alongside the practice times leading up to the performance. Slide Rule (2003–2010) Slide Rule Digital Players hosts a community of comics makers who want their comics to be experienced as performance. Gruber and fellow comic makers built Powerpoint presentations with live dialogue and scores. Adaptations include versions of the mini comics Duck Lessons, Viking Eggling, Kometes and many more. Flipbooks In 2010, Gruber drew six different 102 page tape bound hand assembled Flipbooks. They continue to sell these at their performances and showcases. Murals Both Worlds is a triptych mural installation in Seattle's Cal Anderson Park, painted in the summer of 2012 for the Sound Transit Art Program (STart).

A group meets regularly in Seattle to playtest the game.http://stefangruber.com/hi/ Gruber invented 3 Way Soccer at The Nova Project in 2005. The game is an unorthodox sports workshop with continuously evolving rules, only loosely resembling soccer. Each game is one hour in length, during which the first forty minutes, the ball is in play, and the remaining twenty minutes are used to decide how the rules of the game should change for the next game. In each game, three teams are formed on a circular field, and a large yoga ball is used instead of a soccer ball. The interactions of three opposing teams creates what Gruber describes as a \\"dance-related trajectory\\".

Chase The Chase Court (1864-1873) issued thirty-five opinions in criminal cases over nine years, at a significantly higher rate than the Marshall Court or Taney Court before it. Notable such cases include Ex parte Milligan (1866), Pervear v. Massachusetts (1866), Ex parte McCardle (1867, 1869), Ex parte Yerger (1868), and United States v. Kirby (1868). An array of Reconstruction-era statutes created new federal crimes and new sources of federal jurisdiction to hear criminal cases--both by removal and writs of habeas corpus. Background During the tenure of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, the fundamental structure of the federal criminal system-- arising from the Judiciary Act of 1789--underwent several legislative modifications. According to Wiecek, \\"[i]n no comparable period of our nation's history have the federal courts, lower and Supreme, enjoyed as great an expansion of their jurisdiction as they did in the years of Reconstruction, 1863 to 1876.\\"Wiecek, 1969, at 333. First, in 1866, Congress authorized the removal of criminal cases from state courts to federal courts in certain situations (known as \\"civil rights removal\\").Act of Apr. 9, 1866, §3, 14 Stat. 27, 27. The act provided: :That the district courts of the United States, within their respective districts, shall have . . . cognizance . . . , concurrently with the circuit courts of the United States, of all causes, civil and criminal, affecting persons who are denied or cannot enforce in the courts or the judicial tribunals of the State or locality where they may be any of the rights secured to them by the first section of this act; and if any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, affecting persons who are denied or cannot enforce in the courts or the judicial tribunals of the State or locality where they may be any of the rights secured to them by the first section of this act . . . . Second, in 1867, Congress broadened the authority of the federal courts to hear habeas petitions, and authorized the Supreme Court to hear direct appeals from the adjudication of those petitions in the lower federal courts (as an alternative to original habeas).Act of Feb. 5, 1867, 14 Stat. 385. Most notably, the 1867 act extended the power of the federal courts to hear habeas petitions from state prisoners (although the Chase Court heard no such cases).Van Alstyne, 1973, at 233-35. Further, by explicitly providing for appeals from habeas petitions in lower federal courts, the act abrogated the Supreme Court's decision in Barry v. Mercein (1847),Barry v. Mercein, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 103 (1847). Barry was not a criminal case, but rather involved child custody. which held that such appeals could not be maintained as writs of error under § 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.Van Alstyne, 1973, at 235. The following year, while Ex parte McCardle was pending before the Supreme Court, Congress repealed the portion of the act that authorized the Supreme Court to hear habeas appeals from the circuit courts.Act of Mar. 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 44. Third, the Judiciary Act of 1869, also known as the Circuit Judges Act, created full-time judges to sit on the circuit courts.Judiciary Act of 1869, 16 Stat. 44. While the act did not eliminate the obligation of Supreme Court justices to \\"ride circuit,\\" or sit as circuit judges, it reduced the practice and accordingly reduced the availability of certificates of division in criminal cases. Fourth, the United States Department of Justice was created in 1870. Fifth, in 1872, Congress modified the procedure for adjudicating certificates of division.Act of June 1, 1872, § 1, 17 Stat. 196, 196 (codified at Rev. Stat. 650-652, 693, 697). In civil suits, the amendment provided that the opinion of the presiding judge (the Supreme Court justice) would prevail in the interimRev. Stat. 650. and that the Supreme Court would not decide the certified question of law until the circuit court entered a final decision in the matter.Rev. Stat. 652, 693, 697. But, in criminal case, the procedure remained essentially the same as it had been under the Judiciary Act of 1802.Rev. Stat. 651, 697. Sources of jurisdiction=Writ of errorCircuit courts= The Marshall Court had held that it lacked the jurisdiction to consider writs of error to the circuit courts in criminal cases.United States v. More, 7 U.S. (3 Cranch) 159 (1805). The Taney Court had not heard any such cases. But, in Blyew v. United States (1871), the Court heard a writ of error from a criminal action removed to the circuit court under the criminal rights removal provision.Blyew v. United States, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 581 (1871). The opinion in Blyew does not discuss the jurisdictional question, but the reporter does note that: \\"Some discussion not material to be reported, was also had at the bar by the counsel on both sides, as to whether the case was properly brought here by writ of error . . . .\\"Blyew, 80 U.S. at 589 (oral argument). Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 had explicitly authorized appeals in removed cases.Judiciary Act of 1789, § 22, 1 Stat. 73, 84. Over the dissent of Justices Bradley and Swayne, the Court held that civil rights removal was improper on the grounds that the criminal defendant wished to call an African- American witness who were regarded as incompetent to testify under state law. =State courts= The Chase Court heard ten writs of error from criminal convictions in the state courts (as authorized by § 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and its progeny). Three such cases found that § 25 authority lacking without reaching the merits. In Rankin v. Tennessee (1870), the Court for the first time rejected a criminal appeal under § 25 due to a lack of finality of the state court judgment.Rankin v. Tennessee, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 380 (1870). And, in Ward v. Maryland (1870), the Court held that the advancement of such cases on the Court's calendar was purely discretionary.Ward v. Maryland, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 163 (1870). And, in Aicardi v. Alabama (1873), the Court held that it could not review a state court's interpretation of the state's criminal statutes or the consistency of such criminal statutes with the state's constitution.Aicardi v. Alabama, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 635 (1873). Nevertheless, In McGuire v. Massachusetts (1865)McGuire v. Massachusetts, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 387 (1865). See also McGuire v. Massachusetts, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 382 (1865). and Pervear v. Massachusetts (1866),Pervear v. Massachusetts, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 475 (1866). the Court held that a federal liquor license does not grant immunity from prosecution under state liquor laws. And, in Cummings v. Missouri (1866), the Court reversed the conviction of a Catholic priest who had refused to take an anti-Confederacy loyalty oath as required by the Missouri constitution.Cummings v. Missouri, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277 (1866). But, in Klinger v. Missouri (1871), the Court permitted the exclusion of a criminal juror who had refused to take that oath; because the juror professed that he still supported the rebellion, that was reason enough to exclude him, and thus the failure to take the unconstitutional oath was not the reason for his exclusion.Klinger v. Missouri, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 257 (1871). =Territorial courts= Like the Taney Court before it, the Chase Court entertained criminal appeals from the federal territorial courts. In United States v. Hart (1867), the Court held that a statute empowering a territorial court to hear revenue cases did not authorize the Court to try a criminal prosecution for treason.United States v. Hart, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 770 (1867). And, in Snow v. United States (1873), the Court held that the Attorney General of Utah, not the federal district attorney, had the authority to prosecute crime in the Utah territory.Snow v. United States, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 317 (1873). Habeas appeals The Supreme Court never had an opportunity to exercise the authority to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts. In Ex parte McCardle (1867), the first such case, the Court denied a motion to dismiss, finding that it had such jurisdiction.Ex parte McCardle, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 318 (1867). See also Van Alstyne, 1973, at 237-38. William H. McCardle had been arrested by a military commission for violating the Military Reconstruction Act by publishing anti-Reconstruction editorials in the Vicksburg Times.Van Alstyne, 1973, at 236. Before the Court could reach the merits, Congress repealed said jurisdiction.Van Alstyne, 1973, at 239-41. In Ex parte McCardle (1869), the Court held that the repeal was a valid exercise of Congress's Exceptions Clause power.Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506 (1869). Original habeas In Ex parte Yerger (1868), the Court held that the jurisdiction strip at issue in McCardle did not revoke the Court's authority to hear original habeas petitions under § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789.Ex parte Yerger, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 85 (1868). Other than Yerger, the Court only had one additional opportunity to hear such an original habeas case. Certificates of division The military commission that convicted Milligan Lambdin P. Milligan Despite intervening statutory developments that decreased the likelihood of division in the circuit courts, the Chase Court heard seventeen of its thirty-six criminal cases on certificates of division. In Ex parte Milligan (1866), the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could be a source of certified questions to the Supreme Court.Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2 (1866). But, in United States v. Rosenburgh (1868)United States v. Rosenburgh, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 580 (1868). and United States v. Avery (1871),United States v. Avery, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 251 (1871). the Court held that a motion to quash an indictment could not be so certified, even if the motion calls into question the jurisdiction of the circuit court. Prerogative writs In Ex parte Robinson (1873), on a petition for a writ of mandamus, the Court held that fines and imprisonment are the only punishments authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789 for contempt of court. Thus, where attorney misconduct took place before a criminal grand jury, the Court held that the attorney could not be disbarred for contempt.Ex parte Robinson, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 505 (1873). Defining federal crimes=Alien crew members In United States v. Tynen (1870), the Court overturned a conviction under a statute that required vessel owners to only employ U.S. citizen crew members. The Court held that a new statute which did no more than increase the punishment operated as an implied repeal of the first statute, and thus a conviction under the first statute was invalid.United States v. Tynen, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 88 (1870). Counterfeiting In United States v. Howell (1870), the Court held that a counterfeiting statute was not void for repugnancy, distinguishing United States v. Cantril (1807), a decision of the Marshall Court interpreting a nearly identical statute.United States v. Howell, 78 U.S. (11 Wall.) 432 (1870). Draft obstruction A Civil War-era statute prohibited obstruction of the draft or the enrollment of members in the armed forces.Act of Mar. 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 735. The Court repeatedly upheld a strict division between the two prohibitions, holding that the draft obstruction provision did not apply to enrollment obstruction and vice versa.United States v. Scott, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 642 (1865); United States v. Murphy, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 649 (1865). Embezzlement In United States v. Hartwell (1867), a prosecution for embezzlement of government funds under the Sub-Treasury Act, the Court held that the prohibition applied even to a relatively low level government official.United States v. Hartwell, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 385 (1867). See also United States v. Cook, 154 U.S. 555 (1868). Liquor In United States v. Holliday (1865), the Court upheld a criminal prohibition on selling liquor to Indians under the Indian Commerce Clause and held that the offense did not require that the sale take place on a reservation.United States v. Holliday, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 407 (1865). See also United States v. Mayrand, 154 U.S. 552 (1867). In the License Tax Cases (1866), the Court upheld a federal tax on liquor licenses (which was enforced by criminal prosecution).License Tax Cases, 72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 462 (1866). Naptha mixing In United States v. Dewitt (1869), the Court held that the federal naptha mixing prohibition was unconstitutional (except in areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction) because it infringed on the police power of the states.United States v. Dewitt, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 41 (1869). Obstruction of the mail In United States v. Kirby (1868), the Court held that the arrest of a mail carrier under a bench warrant was not prohibited by the mail obstruction statute.United States v. Kirby, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 482 (1868). Criminal procedure=Constitutional issues ;Double jeopardy In Ex parte Lange (1873), the Court held that double jeopardy was violated by the imposition of a fine and imprisonment under a statute that authorized either fine or imprisonment.Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873). Since the defendant had already paid the fine, the Court held that the lower court could no longer even alter the sentence to mere imprisonment. ;Ex post facto law In Gut v. Minnesota (1869), the Court held that a retroactive change to Minnesota's criminal venue statute was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law.Gut v. Minnesota, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 35 (1869). ;Incorporation In Pervear v. Massachusetts (1866), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment did not apply to the state governments, and--in the alternative, assuming that it did--a fine of $50 and three months hard labor was not an excessive punishment for bootlegging. And, in Twitchell v. Pennsylvania (1868), the Court held that the criminal procedure provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not apply to the state governments.Twitchell v. Pennsylvania, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 321 (1868). Other ;Sufficiency of an indictment In United States v. Cook (1872), the Court held that--where a criminal statute both defines an offense and its exceptions--a criminal indictment must plead facts taking the case out of the exceptions if and only if the exception is inseparable from the definition of the offense. The Court held that the embezzlement statute at issue contained no such exceptions, and that the Crimes Act of 1790's statute of limitations was not such an exception.United States v. Cook, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 168 (1872). ;Special verdicts In United States v. Buzzo (1873), a prosecution for tax evasion, the Court held that where the jury is instructed to deliver a special verdict, the element of intent must be specifically included within the special verdict.United States v. Buzzo, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 125 (1873). ;Statutory venue In United States v. Arwo (1873), a prosecution for assault with a deadly weapon on the high seas, the Court found that the statutory venue provision-- providing for venue in the first judicial district into which the defendant is brought--was satisfied.United States v. Arwo, 86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 486 (1873). NotesReferences *William W. Van Alstyne, A Critical Guide to Ex Parte McCardle, 15 229 (1973). *William M.

It was introduced in 1948 by Cyril Burt who referred to it as unadjusted correlation. It is also called Tucker's congruence coefficient after Ledyard Tucker who popularized the technique. Its values range between -1 and +1. It can be used to study the similarity of extracted factors across different samples of, for example, test takers who have taken the same test.Lorenzo-Seva, U. & ten Berge, J.M.F. (2006). Tucker’s Congruence Coefficient as a Meaningful Index of Factor Similarity. Methodology, 2, 57–64.Jensen, A.R. (1998). The g factor: The science of mental ability. Westport, CT: Praeger, pp. 99–100.Abdi, H. (2007). RV Coefficient and Congruence Coefficient. In Neil Salkind (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics. Thousand Oaks (CA): Sage. Definition Let X and Y be column vectors of factor loadings for two different samples. The formula for the congruence coefficient, or rc, is then :r_c= \\\\frac{ \\\\sum{XY}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum{X^2}\\\\sum{Y^2}} Interpretation Generally, a congruence coefficient of 0.90 is interpreted as indicating a high degree of factor similarity, while a coefficient of 0.95 or higher indicates that the factors are virtually identical. Alternatively, a value in the range 0.85–0.94 has been seen as corresponding to a fair similarity, with values higher than 0.95 indicating that the factors can be considered to be equal. The congruence coefficient can also be defined as the cosine of the angle between factor axes based on the same set of variables (e.g., tests) obtained for two samples (see Cosine similarity). For example, with perfect congruence the angle between the factor axes is 0 degrees, and the cosine of 0 is 1. Comparison with Pearson's r The congruence coefficient is preferred to Pearson's r as a measure of factor similarity, because the latter may produce misleading results. The computation of the congruence coefficient is based on the deviations of factor loadings from zero, whereas r is based on the deviations from the mean of the factor loadings.

Euenius was one of the most distinguished citizens of Apollonia; and one night, when he was tending the sacred sheep of Helios, which the noble Apolloniatae had to do in turns, the flock was attacked by wolves, and sixty sheep were killed. Euenius said nothing of the occurrence, but intended to purchase new sheep, and thus to make up for the loss. But the thing became known, and Euenius was brought to trial. He was deprived of his office, and his eyes were put out as a punishment for his carelessness and negligence. Hereupon the earth ceased to produce fruit, and the sheep of Helios ceased to produce young. Two oracles were consulted, and the answer was that Euenius had been punished unjustly, for that the gods themselves had sent the wolves among the sheep, and that the calamity under which Apollonia was suffering should not cease until Euenius should have received all the reparation he might desire. A number of citizens accordingly waited upon Euenius, and without mentioning the oracles, they asked him in the course of their conversation, what reparation he would demand, if the Apolloniatae should be willing to make any. Euenius, in his ignorance of the oracles, merely asked for two acres of the best land in Apollonia and the finest house in the city. The deputies then said that the Apolloniatae would grant him what he asked for, in accordance with the oracle. Euenius was indignant when he heard how he had been deceived; but the gods gave him a compensation by bestowing upon him the gift of prophecy. The account of Conon is generally the same, only it uses the name \\"Peithenius\\" instead of \\"Euenius\\", makes no mention of the citizens' intent to deceive him, and hints that his prophetic abilities were inherited by his descendants. Indeed, Herodotus writes of Euenius's son Deiphonus who was said to have been raised in Corinth and was a seer for the Greek army during the Greco-Persian wars; yet Herodotus adds that some believed Deiphonus to have falsely claimed descent from Euenius.Histories, 9. 95 ReferencesSources * Ancient Greek seers ","title":"Evenius"},{"id":"36029917","text":"McNall is a surname.

Series protagonists Dean and Sam Winchester attempt to help Prometheus break his curse by summoning Zeus- reasoning that mankind owes Prometheus for giving them fire and the ability to stand against the dark- but in the end Prometheus is forced to sacrifice himself to kill Zeus with the aid of Artemis, thus sparing Oliver from having to endure his curse. * Prometheus is the name of a space exploration ship and the title of a 2012 science- fiction film directed by Ridley Scott.

Chaboillez Square in Montreal was named for his nephew, The Hon. Louis Chaboillez, in 1813. Early life He was the eldest son of fur trader Charles Chaboillez (1706-1757), and his wife Marie-Anne (1711-1778), the daughter of another well-known fur trader, Jean-Baptiste Chevalier (1677-1746).Genealogy of the Chaboillez family After his father's death, his mother returned to Montreal and purchased a spacious house on Rue Saint-Paul for 9,000 livres. From 1751, Chaboillez with his brothers was active in the fur trade between Michilimackinac, Grand Portage and Montreal. By 1769, he had already amassed a personal fortune of some 30,000 livres and the following year an investment of £2,550 in the fur trade put him in the forefront of Canadian investors. Fur Trade Chaboillez was a client of Montreal merchant Jean Orillat and he was supplied from Michilimackinac by John Askin. He maintained business relations with Benjamin Frobisher, who went surety for him in 1778 and again in 1783. That year, Frobisher and Chaboillez guaranteed an expedition costing £3,500 which Benjamin and his brother Joseph Frobisher sent to Grand Portage. In 1785, he went into partnership with other Montreal outfitters and merchants at Michilimackinac, one being Étienne-Charles Campion, to form the General Company of Lake Superior and the South. The objective of the 'General Society', was to engage in the fur trade in the upper Mississippi region for a period of three years. In 1786, Chaboillez joined with McTavish, the Frobisher brothers, James McGill and others merchants to ask Sir John Johnson to establish peace among the Indian tribes in the upper Mississippi region. During the winter of 1792–93 Chaboillez was in partnership with George Edme Young, and they engaged 42 men to go to Michilimackinac and the Mississippi.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Farming and Militia Chaboillez acquired several farms around Montreal, including one on the Côte de Liesse on Montreal Island and another on the Seigneury of Châteauguay, both purchased in 1779. In 1788, he was in possession of three islands on the Hochelaga Archipelago, including Île à l'Aigle, which he turned into a livestock farm. He was churchwarden of the parish of Sainte-Anne-de- Michillimakinac and was appointed Captain in Montreal's 2nd Militia Battalion and in 1799 he was promoted major, retiring in 1802. Final Years Chaboillez had held an important place in the Canadian fur trade. In 1778, John Askin wrote to Benjamin Frobisher commenting on him: \\"I know no person so well off in the North Trade as he is.\\"Dictionary of Canadian Biography In 1802, he was appointed storekeeper for the Indian Department at St. Joseph Island in Upper Canada. He returned to Montreal in 1807, where he died the following year, however, his fortune had vanished. His business hit serious difficulties in the 1790s from which he never recovered, and at his death he was heavily in debt by many thousands. Much of his debt (some £5,000) was owed to his son-in-law, Simon McTavish, who had predeceased him. By McTavish's will, all debts owed to him by Chaboillez were to be cancelled and McTavish's generosity had then gone one step further by providing his father-in-law with an annuity of £150 a year. Family In 1769, at Montreal, Chaboillez married Marguerite Larchevêque (1749-1798), daughter of merchant Jacques Larchevêque, dit La Promenade. As her dowry, his wife brought 40,000 livres in the form of a lot with house, furnishings, silverware, and cash. Mrs Chaboillez's sister, Mrs Charlotte (Larchevêque) Jobert, was the mother of Charlotte Jobert who married Joseph Frobisher of Beaver Hall. The Chaboillezs were the parents of nine children, but only five survived infancy: *Charles Chaboillez (1772-1812), of Terrebonne, the second of four Canadiens to be made a partner in the North West Company. He married Jessy Dunbar Selby Bruyères Bruce (1792-1857), daughter of Captain John Bruce. After his death, at Montreal his widow remarried Lt.-General Sir Robert Bartley (1789-1843) K.C.B., grandfather of Sir Edmund Bartley-Denniss. *Marie-Marguerite Chaboillez (b.1775), married (1) Simon McTavish, senior partner of the North West Company (2) William Smith Plenderleath, recognised son of General Gabriel Christie and his mistress Rachel Plenderleath. *Adélaïde Chaboillez (1781-1847), married Joseph Bouchette, Surveyor-General of the Canadas *Marie-Charlotte Chaboillez (1784-1805), became a nun at the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal. *Marie-Louise-Rachel Chaboillez (1786-1853), married The Hon.

The album was released in 2012 through non-profit record label Come&Live;!. Cancer was produced by Rich Veltrop, who had previously co- produced Showbread's albums No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical, Age of Reptiles, The Fear of God and Who Can Know It?. This is the band's second album to be funded completely by fans and released as a free download without the assistance of a major record label. Concept The album and story takes place in the near future, over the years 2014 to 2016, and is told through the journal of main character Kimo which is included in the free download. The journal is divided into four parts, with the story told through entries and clippings. I: Cycle of Disenchantment (Institution of Principalities) The first part of Kimo's journal outlines history, beginning with a spaceship crashing on earth, then showing pictures of multiple events - including the death of every firstborn in Egypt as told through the Bible, and the Pilgrims' journey to America - with figures shaped as winged and fanged aliens performing actions in those events. Songs in this part: \\"You Were Born In A Prison\\" and \\"Sex with Strangers\\" II: Cycle of Oppression and Revolt (Rise of Protozoa) In part two, Kimo is revealed as a member of underground punk rock band The Protozoa, who are an alter ego of Showbread. Pictures of the band performing are that of Showbread performing, and The Protozoa's \\"anti-music\\" logo is similar to that of Showbread's. After performing for a long time, The Protozoa are signed to media giant Audio Empire's record label in January 2015. In February, one of the band members leaves, citing Kimo's latest lyrics as \\"disrespectful, un-american(sic) and sacrilegious\\". Despite this, the band begins to rise in popularity, revealing a new logo - the \\"anti-music\\" logo that, instead of a full circle, is a letter \\"C\\", which listeners believe stands for \\"Cancer\\", which is a derogatory term for the Principalities, who are the main party in the U.S. government. The band names their newest release \\"Cancer\\" in March. Before the Principality National Convention, graffiti in the shape of the band's logo is discovered on a building in Atlanta. In a response, in April, Audio Empire decides not to release the Protozoa's album on their label or fund their tours. Despite this, Kimo calls his booking agent and books a tour of very small venues to promote their rebellious message, wanting to \\"keep the label's fingers out of this one\\". The band tours from July to September, and hides digital copies of their album in each venue, which are discovered and shared online for free. Songs in this part: \\"I'm Afraid that I'm Me\\" and \\"Anarchy!\\" III: Cycle of Inner Grief and Lament (Schism of Kimo) A confused and distressed Kimo makes amends with Audio Empire and performs with the Protozoa on a live broadcast in October after the U.S. Treason of the Arts Act of 2015 is passed and their album is banned. They start promoting a pro-Principality message for the next month, changing their logo to reflect it. Kimo, torn between his beliefs and fame, packs up everything in his house in November and performs one last show with the Protozoa using the old logo and an anti-Principality message. The band is arrested while on stage. Songs in this part: \\"Germ Cell Tumor\\", \\"Two-Headed Monster\\", and \\"Escape From Planet Cancer\\" IV: Eschaton Cycle (Glory of the King) In an Internet chatroom in December, it is revealed that the Protozoa are currently incarcerated by the Principalities. Online, the word \\"Cancer\\" has been banned, and users are being forced to use forms such as \\"c a n c e r\\" and \\"ca nc er\\" to get around it. The chat also reveals that many people believe that the arrest was a marketing gimmick; many others are throwing out all their Protozoa gear in order to break all associations with the band. \\"Cancer\\" graffiti with the band's logo is found in an art gallery in a photo taken after the band's arrest. In January 2016, a man who comes to clean up Kimo's now empty house finds a flash drive, which is thought to contain a copy of \\"Cancer\\" on it. The liner notes end here with a \\"thank-you\\" section to the fans, who are listed, humorously, as \\"violators of the Treason of Arts Act\\". After the credits, one final message is found taped in the journal, that reads: \\"The cancer of death is defeated by you.\\", followed by the band's logo. Songs in this part: \\"You Will Die In A Prison\\" and \\"You Will Not Die In A Prison\\" Track listing # \\"I'm Afraid That I'm Me\\" - 6:56 # \\"Sex With Strangers\\" - 4:30 # \\"Anarchy!\\" - 4:51 # \\"You Were Born In A Prison\\" - 3:52 # \\"Germ Cell Tumor\\" - 4:26 # \\"Two-Headed Monster\\" - 5:55 # \\"Escape From Planet Cancer\\" - 4:02 # \\"You Will Die In A Prison\\" - 9:39 # \\"You Will Not Die In A Prison\\" - 5:01 Personnel *Josh Dies - story, lyrics and music, art direction, vocals, guitar *Garrett Holmes - synthesizer, piano, vocals *Patrick Porter - bass guitar, vocals, additional story development *Drew Porter - drums *Rich Veltrop - co-production, engineering, mixing, mastering Reception Cancer has received positive reviews. Indie Vision Music said of the album: \\"'Cancer' is possibly the most refined effort from Showbread to date. Although they span so many genres, most even in the same song, the changes never come off as too much.\\". Tyler Hess of CMZine wrote: \\"The music is back to where Showbread belongs, with in your face punk and hardcore inspired raw rock.\\". Jesus Freak Hideout also wrote a glowing review, saying: \\"Cancer is Showbread at the top of their game. They've accumulated years of experience in a variety of genres and managed to cram all of that into nine wonderful songs. It's not often you get to listen to an album and feel all the pieces clicking perfectly into place as you do so. That's what Cancer does. The songwriting is flawless and it's fascinating. The instrumentation is diverse and very accomplished. The lyrics are challenging and thoughtful.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official Showbread website 2012 albums Showbread (band) albums Albums free for download by copyright owner Rock operas Science fiction concept albums ","title":"Cancer (Showbread album)"},{"id":"36030086","text":"Adrián Bertolini (born 9 August 1978) is an Uruguayan basketball player, currently playing for Cader in the Uruguayan second division.

The best films in the eco-kill subgenre use nature's revenge as subtext, but Brandon pushes it full- tilt into the foreground and the result is a real bore.\\" Billboard reviewed the film in March 1994 as part of the \\"Marquee Values\\" section, created as a guide to the lesser-known rental-priced films of the time, saying, \\"While taking baby steps toward humor, this mightily confused fright flick should have gone for Tremors-like laughs and upped its special effects budget.

Commonwealth's attorney Garrett served as an Assistant Attorney General under Virginia Attorney General Bob McDonnell. In 2007, he was elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Louisa County. State Senate After the General Assembly redistricted the State Senate as required by the Virginia Constitution in 2011, Garrett decided to run for an open seat. The 22nd District was open due to the incumbent Republican Ralph K. Smith's home in Roanoke being drawn into another district. In the Republican primary, Garrett came in first in a five-person field with nearly 26% of the vote and a margin of fewer than 200 votes. During his time in office, he served on the General Laws and Technology, Courts of Justice, Education and Health, and Privileges and Elections committees. United States House of Representatives2016 election= In May 2016, after three ballots at the Republican nominating convention, Garrett won the Republican nomination for U.S. Representative in Virginia's 5th congressional district. In the November 2016 general election, Garrett defeated Democratic nominee Jane Dittmar, the former chairwoman of the Albemarle County board of supervisors. Garrett won with 58.2% of the vote to Dittmar's 41.6%. =115th Congress= In January 2017, Garrett was named to the House Committees on Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Education and the Workforce. He is also a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, though he told voters during the campaign that he would not join the hard right group. Garrett is a member of the Republican Study Committee. In March 2017, Garrett posed for a photo with Jason Kessler, one of his constituents who was an organizer of the Unite the Right rally, a far-right rally held in August 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. The rally became the site of violent clashes leaving about 30 people injured, followed shortly by an incident in which a white supremacist rammed his car into a crowd, killing a woman and injuring another 19 other people. Following the violence at the rally, Garrett disavowed the organizer and said he was unaware of Kessler's role in the rally when they initially met. =2018 election= In the spring of 2018, reports surfaced that Garrett and his wife, Flanna, used his congressional staff for personal use, leading his chief of staff to abruptly resign. Personal use of the staff time included running errands, house sitting, chauffeuring his kids and cleaning up after their dog.

As of April 2018, Garrett was outraised by multiple Democratic opponents. In light of these fundraising numbers, the Cook Political Report moved the race from \\"likely Republican\\" to the more competitive \\"leans Republican.\\" Democrats went on to nominate former investigative journalist Leslie Cockburn.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the appointment of one of the two sitting MPs for the constituency, Winston Churchill, as Minister of Munitions. Under the Parliamentary rules applying at the time, members appointed to ministerial posts had to resign their seats and fight a by- election. At that time Dundee was represented by Churchill as a Liberal with Alexander Wilkie holding the other seat for Labour.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1885-1918; Macmillan, 1974 p496 Churchill’s return to government Churchill’s appointment to the government represented a political comeback, one of many in his career. Closely associated with the military fiasco of the Gallipoli landings on the Dardanelles and the dreadful loss of life of Allied personnel, Churchill had been replaced as First Lord of the Admiralty and given a lesser appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster This was apparently one of the Conservative demands for joining the first Coalition government of the First World War under prime minister H H Asquith and may have had as much to do with settling old scores against their former rising star as their reservations about Churchill’s skills as a military strategist.Paul Addison, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill; Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-12 In November 1915 Churchill resigned from the government and went to the Western Front on active service as a battalion commander.Pat Thane, Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill in Cassell’s Companion to Twentieth Century Britain; Cassell & Co, 2001 p93 In December 1916 David Lloyd George, Churchill’s former close colleague in Asquith’s radical reforming administration between 1908-1914, became prime minister. By July 1917, now secure in his position vis-a-vis his Conservative coalition partners, Lloyd George was ready to recall Churchill to the Cabinet, perhaps to strengthen its Liberal composition even further.Richard Toye, Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness; Macmillan, 2007 p182 A report into the Dardanelles disaster published in March 1917 had concluded that Churchill was neither solely nor principally responsible and Churchill was beginning to re-establish himself as an effective Westminster performer. One source even suggests that Lloyd George feared Churchill could emerge as a new leader of the opposition if the war continued to go badly.Paul Addison, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill; Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-12 But Lloyd George clearly wanted his talented old ally as a support in difficult timesRoy Jenkins, Churchill; Macmillan, 2001 p324 and despite widespread criticism of Churchill’s recall Lloyd George announced Churchill’s appointment as Minister of Munitions on 18 July.The Times, 19 July 1917 p7 Electoral truce During the First World War there was an electoral truce between the main political parties by which it was agreed that all by-election vacancies would be filled unopposed by the party holding the seat. The Unionists were reported to be closely observing the party truce and the Labour Party in Dundee also passed a resolution against the adoption of a Labour candidate.The Times, 21 July 1917 p3 However Churchill was not to face an uncontested election. Candidates opposing Churchill On 24 July 1917, The Times reported that the Hon. Stuart Erskine, one of the sons of the 5th Baron Erskine had been planning a candidacy against Churchill but had decided to withdraw, although it is not clear upon what platform Erskine was proposing to contest the election.The Times, 24 July 1917 p3 More importantly as it transpired, it was also reported that Churchill would face opposition from Edwin Scrymgeour as an advocate of alcohol prohibition and as representative of organised labour.The Times, 24 July 1917 p3 Scrymgeour represented a serious challenge. He was a well-known local man from a prominent Dundee family and in total contrast to Churchill stood for fundamentalist religious views, extreme temperance and left-wing socialism. He was an elected member of the Burgh Council, having first been elected to the parish council, the body in charge of Dundee's poorhouses and poor relief as a representative of the Independent Labour Party as long before as 1895.John Kemp, \\"Edwin Scrymgeour\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-12 He also had Parliamentary election experience having stood against Churchill on three previous occasions.Chris Wrigley, Winston Churchill: A Biographical Companion; ABC-CLIO, 2002 p204 Scrymgeour’s candidature was not however endorsed by the Labour Party, as noted above, with Alexander Wilkie formally announcing there should be no contest and defending Churchill from Scrymgeour’s criticisms.The Times, 25 July 1917 p3 The campaign At an early stage Churchill set out his stall as the government candidate who was putting aside party political argument at a time of national emergency. At a meeting in Lochee on 27 July, Churchill said the sole issue the electors had to consider was “....the prosecution of a righteous war to an unmistakable victory.” Despite saying that he refused to be drawn into any kind of electioneering or bickering, he straightway attacked Scrymgeour, who had been formally nominated as the candidate of the Scottish Prohibition Party, for seeking peace with Germany in order to suppress the Scottish liquor trade.The Times, 25 July 1917 p3 Later in the campaign Churchill appealed to the voters not to defeat him as the government candidate as this would in effect send a message to Britain’s enemies that the country was weakening in its desire to win the war.The Times, 30 July 1917 p4 Scrymgeour was indeed opposed to the war and said so openly, in the same way that he had also spoken out against the Boer War and he also stood up for the rights of conscientious objectors.Chris Wrigley, Winston Churchill: A Biographical Companion; ABC-CLIO, 2002 p204 Despite Churchill’s patriotic stance and appeals for an absence of party politicking, and no doubt because of the local status and strong opinions of Scrymgeour, the election has been characterised as a stormy campaign. As a minister Churchill was often detained in London on government business, whereas Scrymgeour was able to be a full-time candidate and it often fell to Churchill’s wife, Clementine to address meetingsMary Soames, Winston and Clementine:The Personal Letters of the Churchills; Mariner Books, 2001 p204 which could be rowdy.The Times, 25 July 1917 p3 In contrast however The Times reported that polling day itself was quiet with no vehicles for the conveyance of voters to the polls and very little election literature.The Times, 31 July 1917 p7 The result The result was a hold for the government party with Churchill taking nearly 80% of the poll and a majority 5,266 votes. Despite this apparently overwhelming endorsement however, one historian has warned against seeing the Dundee result as the clear-cut vindication of government policy it seemed. Churchill won because he got support from all the parties supporting the government, Liberal, Conservative and Labour and he received a personal vote from the Irish/Catholic population.Brock Millman, Managing Domestic Dissent in First World War Britain; Frank Cass, 2000 p147 Scrymgeour went on to fight Churchill at Dundee twice more, eventually beating him in 1922. He remains the only person ever to be elected to the House of Commons on a prohibitionist ticket.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow,1969 p577 The votesReferencesSee also * List of United Kingdom by-elections * United Kingdom by-election records *1908 Dundee by-election *1924 Dundee by-election 1917 elections in the United Kingdom 1917 in Scotland 1910s elections in Scotland 20th century in Dundee By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Scottish constituencies By- elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Dundee constituencies Ministerial by-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom July 1917 events ","title":"1917 Dundee by-election"},{"id":"36030313","text":"Holy Water (Hard Times) is a 2009 Irish comedy film directed by Tom Reeve and starring John Lynch, Linda Hamilton, Cornelius Clarke and Lochlainn O'Mearain.

The algorithm is used to evaluate the values within a regional span and grouped together based on the merging criteria, resulting in a smaller list. Some useful examples are creating a group of generations within a population, or in image processing, grouping a number of neighboring pixels based on their shades that fall within a particular threshold (Qualification Criteria). For example, with 10 values of x (1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 3.2, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, 5.6, 9, 10) within a range of 0 < x < 10, there can be a statistical region-merging algorithm that defines a merging criteria that can be applied to merge the given values into a smaller number of values. For the given values, if the merging criterion is merely a threshold check which states that the distance of the selected values should be within 0.3 range and an average should be applied, then the result of the above values of x will be: (1.7 + 1.8 + 1.9) / 3 = 5.4 / 3 = 1.8 3.2 = 3.2 / 1 = 3.2 4.9 = 4.9 / 1 = 4.9 (5.1 + 5.2 + 5.3) / 3 = 15.6 / 3 = 5.2 5.6 = 5.6 / 1 = 5.6 9 = 9 / 1 = 9 10 = 10 / 1 = 10 Thus, the resultant set will be 1.8, 3.2, 4.9, 5.2, 5.6, 9, 10. Note the result on SRM varies, based on the order in which the values are evaluated by the algorithm. A major use of SRM is in image processing where higher number color palettes in an image are converted into lower number palettes by merging the similar colors' palettes together. The merging criteria include allowed color ranges, minimum size of a region, maximum size of a region, allowed number of platelets, etc. There are several implementations available of SRM for color image segmentation: Java, Matlab, Python, and a demo applet.

(2020). MolluscaBase. Paraflabellina ischitana (Hirano & T. E. Thompson, 1990). Accessed on 2020-08-27. Etymology The name ischitana means from Ischia, the island from where this nudibranch was first named. Distribution Flabellina ischitana from Elba This species is found in Mediterranean waters around Spain in such locations as Costa Brava, and in the Tyrrhenian Sea, especially around Ischia (hence the species Latin name).Sylvain Le Bris, Michel Péan « Flabellina ischitana Hirano & Thompson, 1990 » Habitat Paraflabellina ischitana usually can be found in shallow water, but it can also reach depths of 35 m. Description This species can grow to a length of approximately 4 cm and is mostly purple-violet in colour. It has opaque white-tipped certa, rhinophores, and oral tentacles. The rhinophores are annulate. Due to the somewhat transparent skin of the ceras, the branches of the digestive gland are visible, and appear as red-orange.Manuel Ballesteros, Enric Madrenas, Miquel Pontes et al.,«Flabellina ischitana (Hirano & Thompson, 1990)» Similar species Paraflabellina ischitana is often confused with Flabellina affinis, but can be distinguished as follows: *Paraflabellina ischitana: the ceratal surface has no purple-violet colouration and is translucent; *Flabellina affinis: the digestive gland is not visible as the area beneath the subapical white ring is opaque; Paraflabellina ischitana is also similar to Edmundsella pedata, but they can be distinguished on the basis of their rhinophores:Nembro *Paraflabellina ischitana has annulate rhinophore *Edmundsella pedata has smooth or papillate rhinophores Biology This nudibranch likely eats hydroids of the genus Eudendrium (Eudendrium racemosum and Eudendrium glomeratum) as its main food source. Like other nudibranchs, this species is hermaphrodite. Mating occurs in late spring. The egg case is whitish or reddish, with thousands of eggs of about 70 microns. The nudibranch places the egg case on the branches of hydrozoa.  Bibliography  * Egidio Trainito, Nudibranchi del Mediterraneo.

Early career Berlin was built in 1908 by AG Weser of Bremen for the North German Lloyd shipping line, and saw service on the Genoa to New York City route prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914 Berlin was at Bremerhaven undergoing repairs, and was taken over by the Imperial German Navy for service as an auxiliary cruiser.Schmalenbach p46 Service history Berlin was intended for use as a fast minelayer and also to operate as a commerce raider. This was part of Germany’s kleinkrieg campaign, to wear down Britain’s numerical advantage by using mines and other devices to sink warships, or to divert them from fleet operations into trade protection. Berlin was converted for the role at Kaiserliche Werft ( KWW ) in Wilhelmshaven and equipped with minelaying equipment and 200 mines. She also carried two 105mm guns, and several heavy machine guns. Commissioned in October 1914 under the command of KzS Hans Pfundheller, the ship's first mission was laying a mine field off the north-west coast of Ireland against British trade. This she succeeded in doing, laying 200 mines on 23 October off Tory Island. By chance the Grand Fleet had evacuated Scapa Flow under the threat of U-boat attacks (the Flow being undefended at that time) and were stationed temporarily at Lough Swilly.Halpern p33 On 27 October vessels of the Grand Fleet sailed into Berlin’s minefield; the new dreadnought battleship was struck and damaged, sinking later as efforts were made to tow her to safety. The trans-Atlantic liner was also in the area, with a full complement of passengers, but she escaped hitting any of Berlin’s mines, thus avoiding a further tragedy and a major diplomatic incident.Hawkins p64 Berlin sought to return to Germany, but put in at Trondheim with storm damage. Having outstayed her 24 hours grace and unfit to leave port, she was interned by the Norwegians on 18 November 1914. Despite her short career Berlin was one of the more successful of Germany’s raiders, accounting for the single most grievous loss to the Royal Navy’s strength in the early kleinkrieg campaign. Aftermath Berlin remained in Norway for the duration of the war. In 1919 she was transferred to Britain as war reparations and put into service as the British liner . In 1931 she was discarded and broken up for scrap.

Theater History  Vista Theatre opened on October 9, 1923, as a single-screen theater. In addition to screening films, the theater also showed vaudeville acts on stage. Originally known as Lou Bard Playhouse on opening day in 1923, the cinema played the film Tips with Baby Peggy. The original seating capacity in the auditorium held space for 838 seats. The owners later removed every other row to allow for increased legroom, reducing the number of seats to 400. It is one of the remaining historic structures from the 1920s, when Hollywood was first built up and began attracting residents to its new suburban homes from areas near downtown Los Angeles and East Los Angeles, at the time middle and wealthy class sections of Los Angeles. Until its refurbishment by Thomas Theaters in 1980, the theatre showed soft-core porn, then to hard-core porn and finally gay porn for 20 years. It also showed gay-oriented non- pornographic films, including the local premiere of The Times of Harvey Milk. The theater is a local landmark. It has been renovated to play new release movies, and retains its historic architecture. In a manner reminiscent of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the theater's forecourt features cement handprints and footprints of notable film figures. However, the handprints and footprints at the Vista Theatre tend to include more icons of independent and cult films such as Barry Bostwick, Spike Jonze, John C. Reilly and Martin Landau, among many others. It is used in the 3am portion of Pharrell Williams's song \\"Happy\\" as part of the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack, and also appears on the album cover of 1990's Lights...Camera...Revolution! by Suicidal Tendencies.

Theater Today  The Vista is now a first run theater, meaning they screen new movies. They are operated by the same “Vintage Cinemas” company that owns and operates the vintage Los Feliz 3 Cinema in Los Angeles. The venue pays homage to their vintage architecture and history by playing vintage commercials like this one or playing vintage interviews with celebrities that could be related to the current screening. The Vista has drawn many famous actors and directors to attend, host, or sometimes surprise audiences at screenings of their movies there. Anne Hathaway, Taika Waititi, Lupita Nyongo, John Cho, Zoe Kravitz, Chris Hemsworth, and Tessa Thompson are just a few who have attended screenings of their films at the Vista since 2018. In addition to catering to the celebrity cinephile scene, the Vista’s Simplex 35mm Film Projection System draws many niche LA movie screening clubs to rent out the theater space during off hours.

He worked at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR, Medical Research Council) in Hampstead and Mill Hill, where his work on steroids included contributions to the isolation and characterisation of vitamin D, and the synthesis of cortisone from naturally occurring steroids. After he retired from the NIMR in 1966 he worked on insect pheromones at Rothamsted Experimental Station (now Rothamsted Research) until 1971. Early life and education Kenneth Callow was born 15 February 1901 in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England. His father, Cecil Callow (1865–1912), was an electrical engineer. Kenneth's mother, Kate Peverell (1868–1955), became the head of the Peverell household in Gateshead in 1885 after her parents died, when she was 17 years old with two younger sisters. After 1891 she moved to London. In 1896 she married Cecil Callow. Kenneth attended City of London School (1911–1919), on a scholarship after his father died in 1912. He was awarded a senior science scholarship in 1916, that allowed him to continue at school. In 1919 he went up to Christ Church, Oxford as an exhibitioner, to study chemistry. For part II chemistry his supervisor was Nevil Sidgwick, FRS. After a time at British Celanese (1924–1927) he returned to Oxford as a Research Scholar of Christ Church, synthesising alkaloids and attempting to isolate taxine, a toxic alkaloid of yew. He submitted his D.Phil. thesis in 1929. Vitamin D In 1929 he was invited by R.B. Bourdillon at NIMR in Hampstead to join him in work on vitamin D. The structure of vitamin D was unknown at that time, and the structure of steroids in general was a matter of debate. A meeting took place with J.B.S. Haldane, J.D. Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that sterol molecules were flat, not as previously proposed by Adolf Windaus. In 1932 Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance. The loose association between Bourdillon, Rosenheim, King and Callow was very productive and led to the isolation and characterisation of vitamin D. At this time the policy of the MRC was not to patent discoveries, believing that results of medical research should be open to everybody. The team working on vitamin D included Bourdillon, a physical chemist with a medical degree; T.C. Angus, a physician; F.A. Askew, a chemist; Hilda Bruce, a biologist, Kate Fischmann, a biologist, J. St.L. Philpott, a physical chemist, and T.A. Webster, a biologist. Collaborative work Callow became involved with a variety of problems related to the work on vitamin D, including the claim that rickets was produced by the action of certain cereals. This was shown to be due to interference with calcium absorption (working with Hilda Bruce). He also worked closely with Alan ParkesAlan Parkes who was working on the physiology of reproduction, and C.W. Emmens. Steroids In the 1930s Callow became interested in the structure and action of sex hormones and identifying steroids in urine. In a 1936 paper, written with Frank Young, a footnote states \\"The term steroids is proposed as generic name for the group of compounds comprising the sterols, bile acids, heart poisons, saponins and sex hormones.\\" Callow claimed that this was the first use of the term \\"steroids\\". He showed that androgens were excreted in the urine in similar amounts in men, women and eunuchs, which at the time was surprising. His conclusion was that these substances were produced by the adrenal cortex as well as by the gonads. This conclusion was supported by findings made jointly with A.C. Crooke, working at the London Hospital, that patients with Cushing's syndrome, caused by a tumour of the adrenals, had very high levels of androgenic substances in the urine. War service 1940 – 1945 Despite being in a reserved occupation, he joined the Royal Air Force in 1940. He became an armaments officer and spent much of the war in the NW Frontier area of India (Waziristan, now in Pakistan) defusing unexploded bombs. He was mentioned in dispatches for activity in the relief of Datta Khel.http://www.heritagepontiac.ca/RKC-Kohat.htm Extracts of letters from Kohat, 1942. Later in the war he worked for the Inter-Services Research Bureau, a cover name for Special Operations Executive (SOE), an organisation responsible for sabotage in enemy-occupied territory, with A.G. Ogston, under the leadership of E. Gordon Cox, applying plant and medical chemistry, and developing unusual equipment. Cortisone In 1945 he returned to the NIMR, and worked with John Cornforth on a commercially attractive way of synthesising cortisone from naturally occurring steroids. (Merck & Co had a long and complex synthesis from bile acids, the only known source of cortisone in quantity.) One possible source was sarmentogenin, found in extracts of arrow poisons (heart poisons) from Strophanthus seeds, but there was confusion about which species. During the course of this work Callow went to Nigeria at the invitation of Ibadan University, for six months with R.D. Meikle, a botanist from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to collect arrow poison material. S. sarmentosus was found to contain sarmentogenin but it was not easy to cultivate or to produce in sufficiently large quantities. Another possible source was hecogenin from Agave sisalana, a plant native to Mexico, grown commercially in Kenya. This was a less direct way of producing cortisone, but the successful extraction and purification of hecogenin from the sisal plant, and its availability made it a suitable commercial source. Glaxo Laboratories cooperated with Cornforth and Callow to devise a production process for cortisone from hecogenin. In this case the work done by NIMR staff was patented and sold to Glaxo Labs. Callow was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1958. Honeybee pheromones Callow became interested in the structure and action of \\"queen substance,\\" produced by the queen honeybee, after hearing a talk by Dr. Colin G. Butler on honeybee behaviour at NIMR. Queen substance controls queen-rearing by honeybees, as well as being the sex pheromone attracting drones to a queen on her nuptial flights. Callow isolated and identified this as 9-oxodec-trans-2-enoic acid in 1959. This work led to a general interest in the biochemistry of insects. After he retired from the NIMR in 1966, Callow joined the staff at Rothamsted Experimental Station in the insecticide department. Using a mass spectrometer, he carried out work in the field of insect pheromones until 1971. Editorial and other work Kenneth Callow was a member of the editorial board of the Biochemical Journal from 1946 until 1953. Later he was chairman of Biological and Medical Abstracts Ltd. He was a member of the Council of the Bee Research Association from 1962 to 1974, being chairman 1963–68, and later Vice-President. Personal life In his work on oestrone he was assisted by Nancy Newman (1913–1989), whom he married in 1937. He was the father of John Callow (1944–2000) a merchant navy officer and arboriculturalist, and \\"Mo\\" Callow (Mo Laidlaw), an ergonomist at Bell Northern Research in Ottawa from 1978 to 1987. He died 12 April 1983 in Maughold, Isle of Man where he had moved in 1980, in pursuit of his Manx ancestors. His grandfather Edward Callow wrote a history of the Isle of Man: From King Orry to Queen Victoria, Elliot Stock, 1899.

The film was released in 1994. Background The film stars Colin Firth as Ross Talbert/Michael Condren and Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris. Others in the film included John Getz as Eddie, Jeff Perry as Allen, Arthur Taxier as Detective Chassman, Dean Norris as Detective Marconi, Belinda Waymouth as Angie and Diane Robin as Terry. Originally, producer Peter Samuelson saw two people standing on a corner holding a sign \\"looking for money for movie\\" to turn their screenplay into a feature film. Their story was used as a basic for the Playmaker screenplay. Playmaker commenced production in August 1993, many months and several re-writes after the initial screenplay was obtained by Samuelson. With the exception of a few scenes, the film was shot almost entirely in one location in Chatsworth, slightly north of Los Angeles, in a house once owned by the popular 1970s singing team Captain & Tennille. Since the film's release, Firth has expressed his dislike for the film. In an August 1994 interview for the UK newspaper The Sun, Firth stated \\"My son happened to be in Los Angeles at the time. It was a three-week job and it paid extremely well. It's a rather silly story about an acting coach who trains an actress by psychologically torturing her. I knew it would be complete rubbish and I sincerely hope no one ever sees it.\\" In a 1997 interview with The Weekly News, he stated \\"I was desperate to see my son Will after doing six months of theatre in Britain so I said yes to the movie. But it was a terrible film and I hope it sinks without a trace.\\" In February 1997, Firth spoke of the film again during an interview with Radio Times. He stated \\"If I want to buy a house, or am about to go bankrupt, and someone comes along with a hefty pay cheque for a ridiculous job, I'd do it. I've made a couple of pieces of crap, although when one is working one takes it seriously. Its embarrassing appearing in rubbish, so you con yourself it's worth while, even though the third eye knows full well it isn't. But I do have a child to support.\\" The film remains on out-of-print VHS in America to date, while a DVD version exists as a Dutch import release. The film's main tagline reads \\"Passion. Seduction. Betrayal.\\", while the two other taglines read \\"Its all part of the art.\\" and \\"An erotic thriller with a killer ending.\\" Dutch DVD cover of \\"Playmaker\\" Plot Talented young Jamie Harris is a struggling actress who is trying to win a role in an upcoming film called Playmaker. Eager to gain advantage on the competition, Harris' friend Eddie says that he can arrange an introduction with Ross Talbert, an acting teacher with a reputation for grooming top talent. Talbert agrees to tutor Harris for $5,000; she scrapes up the money, only to discover that his lessons are mainly exercises in psychological abuse. Harris learns that a number of Talbert's students who didn't respond to his techniques have turned up dead, and she spies an \\"F\\" next to her name in his grade book shortly before he attacks her with a knife; she grabs a gun and kills him. The police determine that Jamie acted in self-defense - but the man who she's been taking lessons with wasn't the real Ross Talbert. As the police arrive at the scene a different corpse is lying dead on the ground, which seems to be the real teacher. As a result, she tries to find the false teacher, and discovers that he was just an actor like herself, named Michael Condren, and that she is just a puppet on a string in a perverse and bizarre story.

History In 1978, the Canadian Coast Guard (at the time under the federal Minister of the Department of Transport) established the Canadian Marine Rescue Auxiliary (CMRA) across Canada in order to involve volunteers in a structured way to provide marine rescue assistance and rescue prevention education. This national auxiliary program provided funding for volunteer operations, such as reimbursement of fuel costs and insurance coverage, when volunteer boats and crews were formally tasked to respond to marine incidents by the Victoria (Joint) Rescue Co-ordination Centre (JRCC) of the Department of National Defence (DND). Guidance in volunteer training and provision of some specialized rescue and life saving equipment were also provided under this program. The CMRA underwent a name change to Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary in 1997. In the Pacific Region of the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, under which the Canadian Coast Guard (Special Operating) Agency now falls, the CCGA-Pacific underwent a rebranding doing business under the name Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue or RCMSAR, effective May 2012. The Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue Inc., became the legal name of the organization in 2017. Volunteers have been an integral part of marine rescue response services along the British Columbia coast for more than 100 years, initially as part of the Canadian Life Saving Service (CLSS). The Canadian Coast Guard was formally established in 1962 and shortly thereafter engaged volunteers called Volunteer Search Masters (who operated suitable boats equipped with VHF radio communication) and Volunteer Marine Rescue Agents (who were local coastal contacts for Coast Guard Rescue Officers and who established \\"posts\\" in coastal communities for providing information and communications related to search and rescue incidents in the nearby waters). RCMSAR Unit 14 patrolling British Columbia pacific waters  Operations  About 1,000 volunteers operate more than 30 rescue stations on the west coast and in the British Columbia interior in support of federal marine search and rescue and provincial emergency management mandates. Collectively they respond to an average of about 800 missions per year, or about a third of all marine emergencies in B.C. A small paid staff at the RCMSAR Headquarters and Training Centre near Victoria supports operations, training and volunteer members. RCMSAR receives funding for missions and on- water training from the Canadian Coast Guard through a Contribution Agreement in support of the Coast Guard's marine search and rescue mandate. Funding is provided by the Province of British Columbia through Community Gaming Grants for vessels and equipment. RCMSAR also welcomes corporate and private donations. In 2017, RCMSAR signed a memorandum of understanding with the Province of British Columbia to allow local authorities and provincial agencies to request assistance from RCMSAR directly in times of emergency specifically related to their jurisdictions. Marine search and rescue in federal waters remains RCMSAR's core operation and primary support function. In 2017, RCMSAR also signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a relationship with the 4th Canadian Ranger Patrol Group for the purpose of training and operational collaboration.  Resources = Equipment  RCMSAR is equipped with a variety of vessels ranging from rigid hull inflatables to large enclosed-cabin waterjet-powered boats. RCMSAR also operates a training simulator featuring a full-scale enclosed cabin vessel, large screen, digital projectors and sound.

Boyle was born in Newport, County Mayo, Ireland, in 1832. In 1844 he and his family emigrated to the United States, moving two years later to Toronto, Canada. From the early 1850s he worked as a printer at the Globe - then run by George Brown - and afterwards for the Catholic Citizen. He worked briefly at his trade in New York and New Orleans but had returned to Canada at the start of the American Civil War. In January 1863 Boyle launched the Irish Canadian, a response to contact with the Irish nationalist paper, Phoenix, sectarianism in Toronto between Irish emigrants, and his personal fury at British colonialism in Ireland. The Irish Canadian was held to be a mouthpiece of the Hibernaian Benevolent Society of Canada, a working-class association of which Boyle was secretary. He agitated for Home Rule, the political advancement of Irish Catholics in Canada, as well as Irish rights in Canada and in Ireland. In 1892 it had the largest circulation of any Catholic newspaper in Ontario. Despite his sympathies for the Fenian movement, Boyle, through his paper, opposed any Irish invasion of Canada. His failure to fully distance himself from the movement led to a break between him and Irish- Canadians headed by Thomas D'Arcy McGee, James George Moylan, and Archbishop John Joseph Lynch. Jim O'Neill's Fenian invasion in 1866 led to further tensions, not improved by Boyle's assumption of the presidency of the Hibernians after the arrest of Michael Murphy. Boyle was arrested in April 1868 in the aftermath of the assassination of D'Arcy McGee, remaining in jail for three months with his brother-in-law and co-publisher, James E. Hynes. The failure of the Fenian cause led him in 1872 to align with John O'Donohoe and the cause of Reform. Yet his criticism of clerical interference in politics led to verbal blows with Archbishop Lynch, a withdrawal of support from the Liberals, and by 1878 backing of the Conservatives. By 1887 Boyle had ceased backing the Conservatives in the aftermath of their 1886 'no popery' campaign. From then on he left religious questions alone, seeking purely political objectives. Nevertheless, 1888 saw further hostilities erupt between Boyle and Lynch, who died in May before a resolution of the matter. Boyle died in Toronto in 1901, survived by his unmarried daughter, Harriet. A fund was set up for her by both friends and long-time rivals.

Although they probably lacked a toothcomb, a specialized dental structure found in living lemuriforms (lemurs and lorisoids), they are thought to be a related stem group. The one recognized species, Djebelemur martinezi, was very small, approximately . Djebelemur is one of five genera of djebelemurids, others including 'Anchomomys' milleri, a fossil primate formerly thought to be related to other members of the genus Anchomomys, a group of Eocene European adapiform primates. Following its discovery and description in 1992, Djebelemur was thought to be either a relative of European adapiforms or an early simian, mostly due to the fragmentary nature of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars that may not belong with the jaw. By 2006, it was viewed as a stem lemuriform.  Etymology  The name \\"Djebelemur\\" derives from the mountainous outcrops in which the first specimens were found: Arabic djebel means \\"mountain\\". The species was named in honor of geologist C. Martinez, who was the guide and host for the field party that made the discovery.  Evolutionary history  The fragmentary remains of Djebelemur martinezi are morphologically similar to those of 'Anchomomys' milleri, a fossil primate originally described as a type of cercamoniine (early adapiforms found in the northern continents). Despite significant differences in age, with D. martinezi dating to the late early or early middle Eocene (~52–46 million years ago) and ‘A.’ milleri dating to the late Eocene (36 million years ago), they form a clade and are both grouped under the family Djebelemuridae. Both djebelemurids appear to be a primitive sister group to lemuriforms and the more closely related Plesiopithecus, all of which form an Afro-Arabian clade that excludes the adapids or notharctids from the northern continents. Both are considered stem lemuriforms because despite sharing a number of traits, it is suspected that they lacked a toothcomb, a dental feature unique to lemuriforms. The confirmed presence of djebelemurids in Eocene Africa is important because it proves that lemuriforms evolved their toothcomb in Africa and differentiated there. This Afro-Arabian clade of stem lemuriforms are thought to have arrived in Africa too early to have descended from the Holarctic adapiforms. All dental similarities between the Afro-Arabian clade and European anchomomyins may be due to convergent evolution because the traits appear in the early Eocene (Ypresian stage) in the relatively poor fossil record of Africa long before they appear in the fossil-rich deposits of Europe during the mid-Lutetian. This ancient stem lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa possibly descended from an early Asian branch of adapiforms such as a primitive branch of cercamoniines predating Donrussellia (one of the oldest European adapiforms).  Taxonomy  Djebelemur martinezi was first described in 1992 by Hartenberger and Marandat. The description was based on a lower jaw fragment and two isolated upper molars found in Tunisia at the Chambi locality, which date to the late early or early middle Eocene. It was described as an adapiform, possibly related to the cercamoniine branch, with the informal suggestion that it might merit its own subfamily, \\"Djebelemurinae\\". This interpretation was based on their support of the hypothesis favored by paleoanthropologist Philip D. Gingerich and others that simians (monkeys, apes, and humans) were descended from African adapids, which in turn were descended from the adapids of Europe. They based their assumptions of simian relations on the two isolated upper molars, which are now seen as being incompatible with the lower dentition on the jaw. The upper molars were highly bunodont (having cusps that are separate and rounded)—a trait seen in simians—whereas the lower molars were crested. No definitive upper teeth for Djebelemur are known, but could yield surprises if found. In 1994, paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot described Djebelemur as an early simian, along with Algeripithecus, once considered a basal simian, but now considered to be a distant stem lemuriform (lemurs and lorisoids). Godinot saw similarities between Djebelemur and early simians, as well as cercamoniines, but also noted issues of premolar and molar compaction that set it apart from European adapiforms. In 1997, Hartenberger continued to favor adapiform affinities, while in 1998, Godinot considered affinities with lemuriforms (\\"crown strepsirrhines\\") while still favoring simian affinities, particularly with oligopithecids. By 2006, Godinot accepted Djebelemur as a stem lemuriform, admitting that he was misled by the lack of a toothcomb—a distinguishing dental feature of living lemuriform primates—despite other dental similarities. He also noted that the lower molars of lemuriforms and simians can be difficult to distinguish. As of 2010, Djebelemur is still considered a stem lemuriform in the family Djebelemuridae, although its infraorder is unnamed.  Anatomy and physiology  Djebelemur martinezi was a tiny primate, weighing approximately . It was thought to lack a toothcomb since its canine teeth were only moderately reduced.

It is written by Jeremy Doner and directed by Ed Bianchi. In the episode, the detectives gain access to the casino's tenth floor, which only causes them to elude the police; and both Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) and Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) make decisions that affect their futures. Plot Picking up where the last episode finished, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) still insists to Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) that they must retrieve the City Hall keycard from the casino's tenth floor. He reminds her that they need a federal search warrant. At City Hall, they ask Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman) to obtain a warrant through her senator father. Gwen agrees after Linden insists that any action can change how the city is run. Gwen later asks her father (Alan Dale) to obtain a search warrant for the casino from the attorney general. Senator Eaton points out that casino manager Nicole Jackson is one of his biggest political supporters. Gwen threatens to publicize that he knew Mayor Adams kissed her when she was only 14. In his office, Mayor Lesley Adams (Tom Butler) watches the online video of Richmond playing basketball. Benjamin Abani (Colin Lawrence) reminds him half of Seattle still thinks Richmond is a killer. He then tells the Mayor that Jamie's ex-girlfriend at the district attorney's office leaked information to the Richmond campaign and that he plans to go speak with her. Mayor Adams visits Richmond at his office, to say he knows about the suicide attempt, and gives him a time limit to withdraw or he will hold a press conference about Richmond's cowardice. Janek Kovarsky (Don Thompson) and his men, including Alexi Giffords (Tyler Johnston), approach Stan in his garage. Janek sends the men outside and threatens to harm the Larsen family, unless Stan agrees to kill Joseph Nowak for talking to the police. Alexi returns inside in time to overhear Stan reply that he killed Alexi's father for Janek as part of their deal for Stan to leave the mob. Holder tells Linden the warrant has been secured and they enter the casino with a team of FBI agents. Roberta Drays (Patti Kim) and her security team stands in their way, but Holder gives her the warrant. On the tenth floor of the casino, an FBI agent (Todd Thompson) asks Chief Jackson (Claudia Ferri) for access to security camera footage while Linden orders other agents to tear up the newly installed floor. Back in Seattle, Richmond tells Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) and Gwen about his suicide attempt and decides to withdraw from the race. Jamie thinks the news can be used to help the campaign, but Gwen agrees with Richmond, saying that Richmond would still have a political future if he withdrew now. At the park, Stan asks Terry (Jamie Anne Allman) to take care of the boys should anything happen to him, then leaves without further explanation. He drives to a neighborhood search for Nowak's house. Finding it, he parks a block away and retrieves a gun from the glove compartment. Drays tells the search team that their warrant expires in ten minutes. After looking beneath the floorboards, Linden and the team leave the room apparently empty-handed. Later, Linden reveals to Holder that she found the keycard, but advises against him submitting it into evidence. In the security room, Drays shows Chief Jackson footage of Linden holding up the keycard and smiling at the security camera in the elevator. Furious, Jackson shoves Drays out of the room and then crushes Drays' fingers in the door as she slams it shut behind her. Jackson then makes a phone call to tell someone the police has their keycard. Mayor Adams hangs up his phone after criticizing someone's promise that \\"this wouldn't come back\\" to him. When Lt. Carlson (Mark Moses) enters his office, Adams orders him to arrest Linden in exchange for a possible promotion to police commissioner. Linden and Holder later realize they are being followed by police, and he runs a red light to escape. At the station, an officer informs Lt. Carlson that they lost Linden and Holder but traced her location via her cell phone. Stan sneaks up as Nowak (Brad Kelly) attempts to start his car but stops when he sees a baby in the back seat. Nowak sees Stan and tries to fight, but is quickly overpowered. Stan tells him that Janek knows and orders him to leave town, threatening to kill Nowak should he return. Elsewhere, Janek gets into his own car, where Alexi is hiding in the backseat. Alexi aims a gun at his head, tells him \\"this is for my father\\", and pulls the trigger. Stan later arrives home, where he finds his wife Mitch sitting at the kitchen table. That night, Richmond begins a campaign rally by thanking his supporters. Outside, Lt. Carlson stops Linden and Holder from entering City Hall but stands aside when Linden reveals the keycard.

This particular installment did none of that marking pretty much every moment with something rather significant and thoroughly absorbing. And in a way took things we might have predicted and spun them right around.\\" The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B-, saying \\"If it isn't obvious from all the whiplash, The Killing is racing through this twisty, foggy road to a sudden end, caution to the wind. 'Bulldog' spends a good amount of time building the motivation to get off the couch and solve some crimes.\\" He added that the episode \\"is such a mess that the only semblance of control comes from the obvious manipulation of every plot point.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline called the episode \\"strong\\", adding, \\"For a political conspiracy series, 'Bulldog' is a pretty great episode of television, a few poorly conceived dramatic beats aside. But it's moved about as far away from its roots as possible by making Rosie Larsen feel unimportant in her own murder investigation. That's a bit of a tragedy, but at least things are picking up and, if you're as frustrated as I am, the season is nearly over.\\" Ratings The episode was watched by 1.67 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 0.5, marking a return to a normal seasonal ratings average.

He ran an inn in the village of Bieńczyce, on the outskirts of Kraków. Reportedly, the inn prospered, thanks to Ptak's entrepreneurship, outmatching the competitive Jewish innkeeper. Ptak began his political activity in the 1890s. He published peasant magazines, that he distributed in his inn, and became a member of the Polish People's Party (PSL). He held various positions in the PSL local structures, and ran for the deputy of the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria several times. He succeeded in 1908, when he was elected a representative of the rural communes of the Kraków poviat. His lack of success in the elections to the Austrian Imperial Council some years earlier was mentioned in the plot of The Wedding by Stanisław Wyspiański (1901), in one of the dialogues: So it's Ptak that you were taking on the position?. According to Young Poland's notable literary critic Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Ptak was to some extent a model persona of Czepiec, one of the protagonists of The Wedding. Alongside his wife, Ptak was a special guest at the world premiere of The Wedding in the Kraków Municipal Theater. From 1907, he was a member of the Supreme Council of the Polish People's Party. After the party split, he was a member of the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\" (1913–1924) and the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" (1924–1931). He co-financed the construction of the \\"Falcon\\" Polish Gymnastic Society House and the public school in his native village Bieńczyce, as well as in the construction of the Bonifratres Hospital in Kraków, and was friends with several artists, among them Włodzimierz Tetmajer. Ptak was known for his defiant character, great posture and pomp. Wincenty Witos recalled that Ptak was “a man with a face full of pride, contentment, self-confidence and disrespect for the people who surrounded him”, and that he was disliked by the neighbouring peasants, who were “unable to endure the boasting parvenu”.

Seated from the left: Zofia Norkowa née Ptak, Franciszek and Marcjanna Ptak and their son Wojciech (1917)  Early years  He was born to a peasant family, the son of Antoni Ptak, who owned seven acres, and Salomea née Włodek. The family name Ptak means a bird in Polish. Franciszek Ptak graduated from a peasant elementary school and was also a self-taught; he read a lot. He started with farming on his three acres. Periodically he was a wage worker in a mill. For nine years he charged a toll tax on the behalf of local authorities. In 1886 he married Marcjanna née Szafrańska (7 January 1864 – 4 August 1947). They had twelve children: five sons and seven daughters.  Innkeeper  He founded and ran an inn in the village Bieńczyce outside Kraków. As an innkeeper, he always took care of laying current editions of the folk press on the tables so that the guests could read them. Thanks to his own entrepreneurship and diligence he managed to outmatch the competitive Jewish innkeeper. He was a co-founder and editor of the magazines Wieniec (Wreath) and Pszczółka (Little Bee) that focused on rural issues. His farm was considered exemplary in the district. He promoted the latest achievements in farming and breeding. Wincenty Witos, a prominent politician of the Polish People's Party and later a prime minister of Poland, recalled Ptak in his memoir. Witos described, among others, the first time he met Ptak in 1895 in Bieńczyce. According to Witos, other peasants expressed unflattering judgements about Ptak, “unable to endure the boasting parvenu”. Witos, who served at the time in the Austro-Hungarian Army, moved with his troop to the fort in the village of Krzesławice, and one day he “learned from the peasants coming with the potatoes to the barracks that in the neighboring village of Bieńczyce there is a host and an innkeeper, Franciszek Ptak, who deals with politics and receives folk newspapers.” On the subsequent Sunday, which was a day off, Witos with a friend of his went to visit the tavern in Bieńczyce, as Witos recalled: “Already on the way we learned from the neighbor of Mr. Ptak, who went to the village, that Ptak is an extremely rich man, but also no less a speculator and flay-flint, that he earns money on masters and priests, and for that money he buys estates and lends usury, that peasants and laborers give him the last pennies, etc. stuff. He also said that Mr. Ptak, in addition to the tavern, has a large stone house, a steam mill, a few dozen acres of land, and yet he rents all tolls in the poviat, takes military and poviat supplies, not giving anyone a chance to earn a penny.” This “seemingly talkative and jealous” neighbor peasant, as Witos remarked, also said “that the current rich man, Mr. Ptak, although he comes from the beggar family, is himself worse than many a count. He considers peasants nothing, he only goes in with the masters, he travels to Vienna and Lviv for exhibitions, takes over his daughters around the world and introduces them to the great masters.” Finally, the peasant “expressed the hope that this Sodom would end, and God's punishment would not pass Mr. Ptak.” Witos commented that “although these details have discouraged him a bit and prejudiced him, he decided to go to the inn”, the more that he and his friend were only about fifty steps away from it. Then Witos goes on describing his first direct encounter with Franciszek Ptak. “Having entered a very large inn, we found there a crowd of workers sipping vodka and beer, smoking pipes and cigarettes, talking loudly to each other. At a separate table Mr. Ptak was sitting with only few older hosts. In front of them stood a large, yet unfinished glass of beer. We put ourselves in a corner, and started reading the paper Przyjaciel Ludu (Friend of the People), which just lay on the table in front of us, heavily crumpled and stained. Not to be thrown out of the inn, we ordered a small glass of beer. At one point Mr. Ptak got up and went to another table. I looked at him closer. He was a tall, upright, handsome man of good corpulence and posture, a perfect model for a painter, sculptor or even a poet. His face was full of pride, contentment, self-confidence and disrespect for the people who surrounded him. I tried to talk to him in vain, he pushed away the intervening waiter and did not even look at me. And no wonder. I did not belong to those who would impress him with their property or office, or those who would make him earn more. He did not recognize others. I remembered his neighbor's chatter and I could not refuse him right. Although I went out a bit resentful from Mr. Ptak's inn, I did not fail to go there every Sunday afternoon, to read a newspaper and drink a small glass of beer, this way saving myself from being thrown out the door. I did not try to communicate Mr. Ptak any more, he also did not turn to me, always having a more urgent engagement.”  Beginnings in the people's movement  Ptak went to politics, becoming a member of the Polish People's Party (PSL). He was associated with the Christian-folk movement of priest Stanisław Stojałowski. In 1892, unsuccessfully he stood for the supplementary election to the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria. From 1898 to 1902 he was an editor of the magazine Obrona Ludu (The Defend of the People) issued by the Stojałowski group in Kraków. Together with Witos, Ptak financially supported the construction of the Bonifratres Hospital at Trynitarska Street in Kraków. He was inscribed on the list of benefactors of the Order of Bonifratres. When he later did not want to stay in the hospital during his illness, the monks took care of him at home due to his services to the convent. He also contributed to the construction of a brick school in Bieńczyce, the first of its kind in the poviat, and to the construction of a parish house in Raciborowice, next to the gothic fifteenth century church of St. Margaret. Ptak was friends with several artists. Among them was Włodzimierz Tetmajer. The correspondence of the two was preserved. In one of his pastels, Włodzimierz Tetmajer depicted Ptak and other peasant Błażej Czepiec. Ptak, on the other hand, made his old house available to the painter Józef Krasnowolski, who found himself together with his family in a difficult financial situation. The guests in Ptak's house, apart from Tetmajer and Krasnowolski, included Stanisław Wyspiański, Lucjan Rydel, Henryk Uziembło and Wojciech Kossak.  The Wedding episode  In December 1900 Franciszek Ptak ran unsuccessfully to the Austrian Imperial Council. A reference to that event appeared in one of the dialogues of Stanisław Wyspiański play The Wedding (1901). According to Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, a notable figure of the Young Poland, the fictional figure of Czepiec brought to life by Wyspiański was modeled mainly after Błażej Czepiec, a peasant from the village of Bronowice, but in fact included some characteristics of both Błażej Czepiec and Franciszek Ptak. Boy-Żeleński pointed out that “Wyspiański, portraying Czepiec in several authentic situations of that wedding reception, strengthened his physiognomy with some of the features taken from another sub-Krakow peasant, Ptak. Mr. Ptak, even taller than Czepiec, a peasant of enormous strength, popular in the poviat, magnificent in his white coat, a figurehead on all “national parades” (...) also did not let others to push him around; when some kind of intellectual tried to offend his honor, Ptak said only: – Beware, sir, because I am of the Ptaks that beat in the face” (in Polish: of the Birds that beat in the face). Wyspiański invited Mr. and Mrs. Ptak to the premiere show of The Wedding in the Kraków Municipal Theatre. Author of the play was particularly interested in the opinion of Mrs. Marcjanna Ptak, whom he “valued for practical peasant reason”. A columnist, literary critic and wife of the then-director of the Municipal Theatre Lucyna Kotarbińska recalled: “Wyspiański wanted to check what impression would The Wedding make on the countrywoman who doesn't have any closer contact with our artistic and literary world. We have agreed that, following his wishes, we will invite a peasant from Tonie, near Kraków, Mr. Ptak, with his wife. Mr. Ptak was a wise peasant. Deputy. Editor of the magazine. The only one eager to help to make decorations during ceremonies. Indeed he made the Jew move out from the tavern in the village, but he took the tavern himself, and his wife traded well at the canteen. Apart from that, she was also very strict. So we go to them, on Sunday afternoon, with our sister Teofila Kotarbińska, who was staying at our place, and Włodzimierz Tetmajer. The host welcomed us like Piast. In a white sukmana with a loaf of bread, putting a jar of honey, which we liked so much that we forgot about the hour. And here's the show and we have to get on the train we just hear whistling. We run as if we were shot from a sling, as if we all had wings, trotting through the fields, with waving hands, handkerchiefs and screams, that the train stands in the middle of nowhere and takes us to Kraków. Well, that's when we invited Mr. and Mrs. Ptak to the lodge, in which Mrs. Ptak was the main subject of our observation. She behaved quite indifferently to the whole. She only reacted to one thing, namely, when in response to a long epistle of The Poet, Czepiec says: – Take a simple wife: much bliss, little cost. – If someone takes a simple wife, the costs are smaller, it's true, but that it gives much bliss – I do not believe it, judged Mrs. Ptak.”  Member of the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria  “Falcon” Polish Gymnastic Society House in Bieńczyce, constructed thanks to the financing of Franciszek Ptak Ptak collaborated with Jan Stapiński, a priest and co-organizer of the People's Party (SL) in Galicia. In 1897–1909, as a representative of the rural communes, he was a member of the Poviat Council of the People's Party in Kraków and the deputy member of the Poviat Department in Kraków. From 1904 he was a member of the Poviat Department of the People's Party in Kraków. From 1904 to 1910 he was a member of the District School Council in Kraków on behalf of the Poviat Council of the People's Party. On January 20, 1907, he was elected a member of the Supreme Council of the Polish People's Party. He resigned from candidacy for the benefit of Franciszek Wójcik before the elections to the Austrian Imperial Council in May 1907. In 1908, Ptak organised together with Władysław Bogacki a sizable live show in Vienna, titled The Cracovian Wedding. The show has been performed to the eyes of the Emperor of Austria Franz Joseph I to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of his accession to the Austrian throne. Ptak's daughter Zofia Ptak played the part of a bride, the painter Henryk Uziembło performed as the groom, while Wojciech Kossak played the starost. The performance sparked enthusiasm in Vienna and echoed widely in Galicia, in the latter also resulting in a wave of harsh criticism. Stanisław Szczepański referred to Ptak as “Kraków paradebauer”, pejoratively meaning a peasant or farmer making an empty and meaningless performance in a parade just for the sake of the government to avoid claims of excluding peasantry from the public life. On February 25, 1908 Ptak was elected a member of the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria (Sejm Krajowy), representing the rural communes of the Kraków poviat. In the Diet, he was a member of the petition committee and the commune committee. From 1910 he was also a member of the dearness committee. He spoke, among others, on the abolition of the national toll (October 1, 1908) and the establishment of a school of rural housewives in the poviat of Kraków (October 14, 1909), and was also a parliamentary auditor. He and his fellow Members made an urgent proposal to prevent hunger threatening populations throughout the country (March 19, 1913). On March 8, 1908, Ptak was re-elected a member of the Supreme Council of the Polish People's Party. In 1909 he founded a branch of the “Falcon” Polish Gymnastic Society in his village Bieńczyce. The “Falcon” House was built from the contributions of the residents of Bieńczyce on the plot given by Ptak. The construction work took place under his leadership and with his significant financial participation. He was a member of the Supervisory Board of the National Central Fund for Agricultural Companies in Lviv (1913–1914).  In the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\"  In the elections to the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria on June 30, 1913, Ptak did not receive re-election, losing his mandate to the benefit of Józef Serczyk of the People's Party. Ptak was a member of the Polish People's Party Supreme Council during its meeting in Tarnów on December 13, 1913. At the meeting the party has split into the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\", which gathered supporters of Stapiński; and the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\", led by Jakub Bojko and Wincenty Witos. Franciszek Ptak joined the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\" and was elected a member of its Supreme Council on April 5, 1914. On June 28, 1914, together with Franciszek Wójcik, he addressed the peasants with financial support for the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\".Przyjaciel Ludu, 26, 1914, p. 4. During World War I (1914–1918) Ptak did not serve in the army and remained at home. During the short-lived reunification of the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" and the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\", he was elected a member of the Central Board of the Polish People's Party at the congress in Tarnów on December 1, 1918. Wincety Witos in his memoir recalled a short conversation he had with Ptak in the spring of 1917. A resolution stating that the only pursuit of the Polish nation is to regain an independent, united Poland with access to the sea was then submitted to the Imperial Council in Vienna by Włodzimierz Tetmajer. Until then, territories of the former Polish Republic remained under foreign annexations, and ethnically Polish Galicia was a part of Austro-Hungary. Witos wrote: “In the evening, the Kraków peasants took up the deputy Tetmajer, proud of what had happened, satisfied with their chosen one. I saw Franciszek Ptak among them (...) and several others. Despite my will, I recalled all the galas and festivities in which they took part, appearing equally festive and having happy faces. The difference was that they were richly paid for imperial money there, and here they were the hosts. In a word, the Kraków peasants of that time were not the best. That's nothing surprising, however, because they were constantly demoralized, used for decorations and various decorative performances. They did not feel strong at that time, because when someone brought news that the police were to arrest the participants of the manifestation, they immediately remembered various urgent interests and began to leave alone. Franciszek Ptak, who was very defiant all the time, approached me and asked: – What do you think , Wicek, if Poland will rise, will it be a bit better for the peasants? Because I think that the governments of gentry and new serfdom will come. – Why do these thoughts come to you again? – I asked. – I know our masters – he said – they are taught to live through someone else's work and rush, and now they will be even worse, because they have less, and would like to use endlessly.”Witos, Wincenty (1981). Moje wspomnienia, p. 499. Witos also illustrated Ptak's parsimony with an episode that took place in the first months after the establishment of the Polish state, around 1919, when a Polish military detachment commandeered Ptak some oats. Poland was at the time in a war with the Soviet Union to the eastern border. “Mr. Ptak defended himself against giving away oats so much that they had to be overtaken by force. It resented and at the same time upset him so much that not only did he cover the soldiers with insults on the spot, but also in public.” In 1920 Ptak, outraged by the need to pay fines for not sending children to school, organized together with Franciszek Wójcik a meeting for about forty people and was to convince the gathered parents not to pay fines imposed by the District School Board. The School Board in the village of Krzesławice accused Ptak of anarchism. Ptak did not plead guilty, he replied, saying that he “did not announce that children should not be sent to school nor that the parents should not pay fines for not sending their children to school.” The case was discontinued.  In the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" – the final years  The grave of the Ptak family at the parish cemetery in Raciborowice The grave inscription In 1924, he left the Polish People's Party \\"Left\\" and joined the People's Party \\"Piast\\". In Bieńczyce he founded a branch of Kasa Stefczyka, a savings and loan cooperative created on the model of Raiffeisen cooperatives in several spots in Galicia, and served more than a dozen neighboring villages being a long-time president of the branch. In 1932, with the Banderia of Cracovians he welcomed Wincenty Witos who was going to nearby village of Pleszów. Witos described this event as follows. “Mr. Franciszek Ptak was this kind of person whose luck never leaves. His growth, beauty, and attitude were themselves simply an invaluable gift of God, which he did not waste at all. I did not know his origin, nor did I ever try to find out. On the other hand, the native serfs of Kraków, who knew him more closely, thought that he was nobody compared with them in this respect, and often maliciously told that it was Mr. Ptak that Wyspiański meant when writing about birds, eagles and shit. Maybe they did this out of envy, unable to endure the boasting parvenu. On the other hand, having gained a serious fortune, he threw himself into politics with panache and impudence typical for him, though he did not have much talent for it. Over the years, he passed almost all parties and tried to be their zealous follower. Not wanting to go against the trend, he even lost himself in the Socialist faction, and motivated a change of opinion saying that now the whole world is going to the left. (...) In spite of everything that happened, you can see that he did not lose his sentiment for me, because in 1932, when I was going to Pleszów through his village, not only did he, along with others, prepare a great honorary horse escort, but welcomed me very cordially, he did not fail to mention that he does so on the spot where Kościuszko rested, when he went to Racławice and expressed confidence that I would be given the completion of the work begun by Kościuszko and the assurance of freedom not only to Poland, but also to peasants who did not have it so far. I saw that he spoke honestly and powerfully, because the policeman, alarmed, had recorded his entire speech.” Franciszek Ptak died after long illness on July 29, 1936 at the Bonifratres Hospital in Kraków. He was buried at the parish cemetery in Raciborowice three days later, on August 1.  Family  Franciszek Ptak and Marcjanna née Szafrańska had twelve children: five sons and seven daughters. Among their grandchildren were Włodzimierz Ptak, an immunologist, and Wiesław Ptak, a chemist.  Commemoration and cultural references  One of the streets in Kraków, in the district Bieńczyce, was named after Franciszek Ptak. A few souvenirs of Ptak have been preserved, including a wide leather belt, richly decorated and studded with brass studs. Natural-size oil portraits of Franciszek and Marcjanna Ptak by Józef Krasnowolski were put into a deposit of the Regional Chamber of Culture Center of the then Vladimir Lenin Steelworks in 1973 by Władysław Ptak, the son of Franciszek and Marcjanna. Currently, the portraits are owned by the C. K. Norwid Culture Centre in Kraków (Ośrodek Kultury im. Cypriana Kamila Norwida w Krakowie). The old print depicting Franciszek Ptak is part of the decoration of the Eszeweria Café in Kraków at Józefa Street in the Jewish district Kazimierz.

Family He was born in the early 15th century as vice-ispán of Bács County, son of the captain of Srebrenik, Ladislaus Szilágyi and Catherine Bellyéni. The common noble family derived its name of Horogszegi from its estate in the county of Temes. His sister, Elisabeth, was John Hunyadi's wife. Life Michael Szilágyi began his career in his brother-in-law's service as vice-ispán (vicecomes) of Torontál County. He was the captain of the Belgrade fortress at the Ottoman siege in 1456. As Ban of Macsó, he acquired a place among the barons Hungarian Catholic Lexicon He is commemorated in the Serbian epic poetry as Mihajlo Svilojević or sometimes \\"crni ban Mihail\\", while Ottoman chronicles referred to him as \\"Kara Mihal. The coat-of-arms of the Szilágyi family Michael Szilágyi's governor signet On 20 January 1458, Matthias Corvinus was elected king by the Parliament. This was the first time in the medieval Hungarian kingdom that a member of the nobility, without dynastic ancestry and relationship, mounted the royal throne. Such an election upset the usual course of dynastic succession in the age. In the Czech and Hungarian states they heralded a new judiciary era in Europe, characterized by the absolute supremacy of the Parliament (dietal system) and a tendency to centralization. During his reign, Matthias reduced the power of the feudal lords, and ruled instead with a cadre of talented and highly educated individuals, chosen for their abilities rather than their social status. The Diet appointed Michael Szilágyi, the new king's uncle as regent, because of Matthias' young age. Throughout 1458 the struggle between the young king and the magnates, reinforced by Matthias's own uncle and guardian Szilágyi, was acute. But Matthias, who began by deposing Garai and dismissing Szilágyi, and then proceeded to levy a tax, without the consent of the Diet, in order to hire mercenaries, easily prevailed. Michael Szilágyi resigned the office of regent in August 1459 and was killed by the Ottomans after being captured by Ali Bey Mihaloğlu during the battle near Baziaş in 1460. Since he was considered a spy, he was tortured and sawed in half.

Early life  He was born as Franz Beck in Vienna, Austria to Friedrich and Edith Beck, a Jewish couple who worked in a family-owned business. At the age of 8, shortly before the outbreak of World War II he escaped to London, England with his mother. His father stayed behind, escaping to France, where he survived for three years before being sent to Auschwitz and killed. On arrival in England, Franz anglicized his name to Frank, and, like thousands of other children, was evacuated from London during hostilities. After leaving school, he was conscripted into the Royal Air Force where he worked as a wireless mechanic, and learned about electronics. When his National Service ended he worked at the GEC research labs while studying mathematics at Chelsea Polytechnic (now King’s College) and Birkbeck College. At this time he became interested in the emerging science of computer programming, and became a programmer on his employer’s HEC computer, a commercially available machine. He then moved to the Central Electricity Generating Board where he did engineering calculations on their English Electric DEUCE computer. In 1958 he married Margaret Louise Hammel (1934–2003, known as Louise). Frank and Louise's sons Simon and Stephen were born in 1961 and 1962.  CERN, Argonne and the Fermilab  In 1962, he was invited to apply for a position as a mathematician at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and the family moved there. In 1967 Beck was invited to work at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago in the United States, and the family moved to La Grange, Illinois . At Argonne Beck did some pioneering work on pattern recognition devices for bubble-chamber photographs. The machines for doing this involved interactive human interfaces. Activity at CERN in the meantime focussed on the construction of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), and in 1972 Beck was invited back to Europe to design and build the SPS control room and its hardware and software in the environment of a revolutionary multicomputer control system being constructed by a group under Michael Crowley-Milling. In 1973 he published a CERN document, along with his colleague Bent Stumpe, outlining the concept for a prototype touchscreen as well as a multi-function computer-configurable knob, both of which found their way onto the consoles of the finished control room. The CERN touchscreen was arguably the first practical device of its kind and used a matrix of transparent capacitative pads above a cathode-ray tube. Beck began post- graduate studies at the Université Louis-Pasteur in Strasbourg, France. His doctoral thesis, presented in 1976, was an expanded version of the 1973 CERN paper, this time also describing the control philosophy, which allowed skilled operators to design their own interface methods, and the various devices (including the knob and the touchscreen, the video wall, and a switchable pool of display devices). In 1983 he moved back to Illinois for two years, this time to work at the Fermilab in Batavia before returning once more to CERN.  Later life and retirement  He retired in the early 1990s and he and Louise returned to London. Frank had two sons and four grandchildren. He died of natural causes on February 3, 2020 aged 89.

He was foreman of the first grand jury of the new British province of Quebec, justice of the peace, and colonel of artillery in the British militia. Early life Johnston was christened at Stromness, February 25, 1724. He was the second son of John Johnston (1690−1757), 3rd Laird of Outbrecks on the Orkney Mainland, and his wife Marjorie Crafts (1695−1774), daughter of John Crafts who had been an ensign in Cromwell's army before becoming a ship-owner at London.Armorials of the County of Orkney The Johnstons/Johnstones of Outbrecks (sometimes spelt Outhrecks) were a prominent Orkney family and James' father - one of the principal merchants there - had added to their land by acquiring considerable property throughout the islands at Harray, Stenness and South Ronaldsay etc., owning one-third of the town of Stromness itself.Orcadian Families Johnston's elder brother, Joshua Johnston (1720-1794), married an heiress of the Halcro family and lived at Orphir House, becoming the first Laird of Coubister; they were the ancestors of Henry Halcro Johnston. James and Joshua's sister, Elizabeth, was the mother of James Irvine, of Quebec City. James Johnston was a cousin of Joseph Isbister (1710−1771), who in 1740 became the first Orkneyman to receive a governorship in the Hudson's Bay Company and settled in Quebec in 1760. Another of James's sisters, Katherine Johnston, had married George Geddes (1717−1791), great-grandson of Bishop George Graham. Geddes' father, David Geddes, aside from being Collector of Customs and owning a merchants bank and shipping business, also owned the first agency that supplied Orkney men for work in the Hudson's Bay Company, consisting of three quarters of their workforce in Canada.Scotland's Highlands & Islands (2006) by Richenda Miers Through these connections, Johnston and his brother-in-law were in Quebec with General James Wolfe at the British Conquest of New France in 1759. He probably returned home soon afterwards, but by 1761, Johnston was renting a house in Quebec City and in July, the following year, he established a business partnership with John Purss who was to remain his partner and closest friend up until his death. Public Life at Quebec From 1762, Johnston was appointed Captain of Artillery in the British Militia, retiring with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1764, William Conyngham appointed Johnston foreman of the first Grand Jury of the new British Province of Quebec. Conyngham was a rival of Governor James Murray, and Murray's ally Attorney General George Suckling described the 14 jurors as \\"malcontents\\". Johnston and his jury favoured the wants of the merchants and they vigorously opposed Murray and Suckling's initiatives and policies, with Johnston signing his name to a letter demanding that the governor be recalled. When Lord Dorchester was appointed Governor of Quebec in 1768, he recognised that Johnston had been \\"entering into Party against Mr Murray with too much warmth\\" but nonetheless recommended him to Lord Shelburne for a vacant seat on the Council of the Province of Quebec, remarking that Johnston was \\"a man of very excellent understanding, and likewise very fit\\". However, despite reiterating the recommendation again in 1769, it was not acted upon. At various times, Johnston made open his support of Governor Henry Hamilton, Sir James Monk and Chief Justice William Smith, notably in bringing about the change to Quebec's legal system that brought it into line with that of England, and favouring the merchants. In 1787, out of respect for Johnston, Lord Dorchester appointed him one of the commissioners to draw up plans, grant the land contracts and sales etc., for the construction of public buildings in Quebec City, but unfortunately for him they never came to the fore as the British authorities never approved Dorchester's ordinance. Business at Quebec Johnston and Purss pursued a number of business opportunities, trading between Quebec, the British West Indies (where their firm was represented by the brother-in-law of Johnston's wife) and Scotland. For a time they owned a share of the Saint- Maurice ironworks and shares in the Dorchester Bridge, but they mainly traded in furs, seal oil and wheat. They also engaged in the trade of \\"essence of spruce for making beer\\", the discovery of which was attributed to Quebec distiller (and another of Johnston's brothers-in-law) Henry Taylor. Through Johnston's connections with the previously mentioned Geddes and Isbister families, Johnston & Purss did considerable business with the Hudson's Bay Company, and in that capacity he brought his nephew, David Geddes (1751−1811), to Quebec in 1768. On the outbreak of the American Revolution Geddes was given the rank of Colonel and Paymaster of the Forces to General John Burgoyne, and with that army was taken prisoner after the Battle of Saratoga.Where a Man Can Go: Major General William Phillips, British Royal Artillery (1999), by Robert P. Davis The two partners of Johnston & Purss had good personal relationships with many of the other principal British merchants of Quebec, particularly with Mathew Macnider and his brother, the Lymburners, Jacob Jordan and George Allsopp. Their firm had enjoyed considerable success before the American Revolution, but was only relatively prosperous afterwards. At the time of Johnston's death, his will included real estate valued at £5,252 consisting of Johnston's house and four others; ten warehouses; two wharfs and a piece of land comprising two building sites bought in 1782 at Beauport. Family and Final Days In 1783, at Quebec City, James Johnston married the considerably younger Margaret MacNider (1764−1838), sister of John MacNider, 2nd Seigneury of Grand-Métis and Métis-sur-Mer; and a niece of The Hon. Mathew MacNider, Seigneur of Bélair, Grondines, Sainte-Croix etc. Mrs Johnston was an aunt of Mary MacNider (d. 1855), the mother of Félix-Gabriel Marchand, 11th Prime Minister of Quebec and President of the Royal Society of Canada. Johnston remained closely connected to his relatives in Orkney, and several generations later his great-grandchildren (and the Irvines) stayed as guests, and received in Quebec, his brother's descendants, the Johnstons of Coubister. In 1779, he sent his nephew (John Taylor, and afterwards his brother Henry), \\"for the best school education in England (at any expence) preparative to his becoming in time a good man and a compleat distiller,\\" adding the proviso that \\"none of his time be murdered in Latin\\". Mr and Mrs Johnston were the parents of two children, *John Purss Johnston (b. 1785) J.P. In 1806, he married Amelia/Amalie Gugy, sister of The Hon. Louis Gugy, Sheriff of Montreal. They were the parents of one son, James Bell Johnston, who died unmarried. *Ann Johnston (1788−1865). In 1806, she married her first husband Captain Abraham Paul (1782−1814) of the Royal Artillery, nephew of Sir Joshua Paul, of Paulville, Co. Carlow. They were the parents of three children, but only their daughter, Eliza Paul, married. She was the wife of Major Stephen Heward (1776–1828), brother-in-law of Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto. Secondly, in 1817, Mrs Ann (Johnston) Paul married her step-brother William Edward Holmes (1796−1825), a Quebec surgeon. They had four children, two of whom married: William Holmes (to a daughter of Colonel The Hon. Bartholomew Gugy, sister-in-law of Sir Æmilius Irving) and Sophia Holmes (wife of Chief Justice Sir William Collis Meredith). In 1807, after her husband's death, Mrs Margaret (MacNider) Johnston remarried William Holmes, Surgeon-General to the British Forces in the Canadas, and had by him one daughter, *Arabella Holmes (1808−1887), married Colonel The Hon. Sydney Robert Bellingham.History of the Cairnes family of Tyrone She inherited of land in the counties of Buckland and Bellechasse from her father that she used to help her husband's career in politics. They died without children at Castlebellingham in Ireland. Colonel Johnston died November 8, 1800, at his home on Rue Champlain, Quebec. After his death the firm of Johnston & Purss was dissolved and its property holdings were divided by lot between his widow, children (who were still minors) and Purss himself. As proof of the esteem in which Purss held Johnston, after the latter's death he cancelled a debt of £2,311 that Johnston owed him. Returning the favour, Mrs Johnston sold all Purss' household effects and furniture left by him to her in his will of 1803, raising a sum of £3,500, which she paid to his heirs in Britain.

Morris, The Culture of Pain (University of California Press, 1991), p. 203. He was born in Nancy and died in Paris. Life The Adam family home in Nancy Adam was the youngest of the three sons of the sculptor Jacob Sigisbert Adam of Nancy. His brothers Lambert-Sigisbert Adam and François Gaspard Adam were also sculptors. In 1757, Adam married Christine Lenoir, the daughter of a goldsmith in Nancy. They had two sons, the painter Jean Charles Nicolas Adam and the sculptor Gaspard Louis Adam. Nicolas Adam was blind when he died in 1778 in Paris. Career Adam studied first with his father, then with his elder brother Lambert, at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture). He failed to obtain the prix de Rome, but did receive funding to travel to Italy. Along the way, he stopped to work on the ornamental façade of the Château de la Mosson at Juvignac, near Montpellier, spending 18 months on the project. He finally arrived in Rome in 1726. His brother introduced him to the cardinal Melchior de Polignac, for whom he restored a number of ancient marbles. Adam returned to Paris in 1734, working in his elder brother's atelier. Soon he began to receive a number of commissions. With his brother, he worked on Le Triomphe de Neptune et d'Amphitrite (\\"The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite,\\" completed 1740), the large sculpture group in lead for the Neptune fountain at the Palace of Versailles. During the same period, he worked for the Rohan family at the Hôtel de Soubise, sculpting bas-reliefs for Amours des Dieux (\\"The Gods' Love Affairs\\", 1736) in the state chamber of the Princess. The Bâtiments du Roi commissioned him for work at the Courts of Accounts in Paris, at the Basilica of St. Denis, and on the royal chapel at Versailles. At the abbey he created a bas-relief Saint Maur Seeking the Aid of the Lord for the Healing of a Child. The fathers at the Oratory of Paris entrusted him with the decoration of the church portal. Prometheus Bound (1762), Adam's reception piece for the Academy His reception piece for the Academy in 1762 was Prometheus Bound (French Prométhée enchaîné) considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century sculpture. His most notable work, however, is the funeral monument of the queen Catherine Opalińska, wife of Stanislas Leszczyński, at the Notre-Dame- de-Bonsecours church in Nancy. It depicts the deceased kneeling, with her hands joined in an attitude of prayer. An angel takes her by the hand to guide her to Heaven. The base is of black marble. Executed with great elegance, the group is regarded as one of the most remarkable and genuinely moving funeral monuments of the 18th century. Nicolas Adam, like his brother Lambert, was influenced by the Italian Baroque. He ranks with him as one of the most refined and subtle sculptors of his time.

Purss was born in Elgin, Scotland in 1732, the son of a merchant there. He moved to Quebec after the British victory and, in 1762, entered into a business partnership with fellow Scot James Johnston. Their business traded wheat, iron, and seal furs and oil. The businessmen partnered with Jean-Baptiste Bouchette in 1765 to take advantage of his trading post and Gulf of Saint Lawrence fishery. They also bought a share of an ironworks in 1767, although they sold it a few years later. In 1770 they entered into a long term lease for the King’s Wharf in Quebec, a vital resource for commerce in the city. In the 1780s the firm entered into a partnership with Johnston's brother-in-law, Henry Taylor, to run a distillery on Rue Champlain. With four stills, four boilers and eight evaporation tubs, the distillery produced spirits, beer and an invention of Taylor's called \\"essence of spruce for making beer\\", which was exported to New York and the West Indies. By the end of the 1780s the partners owned shares in the Dorchester Bridge and owned a number of houses which they leased. Their fortunes seemed to decline in the subsequent decades as they sold property and the distillery, sublet the King's Wharf, borrowed money and sold their shares in the bridge. The partnership ended with Johnston's death in 1800. The firm's assets were split between Purss and Margaret Macnider, Johnston's widow. Purss played a role in the city's public life. He was an important figure in the Quebec Fire Society. In 1787 Purss became a lieutenant in the militia and was promoted to captain around 1799. He served as assessor in 1797. Purss died on 8 April 1803. Having never married, his estate was left to relatives in Britain and to his partner's widow.

Smith, 558 U.S. 87 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court decision on seizure of property by the Chicago Police Department, however the case was declared moot by the Court as the parties agreed that there was no longer contention over the property seized..  Background  Under the Illinois Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act (DAFPA) moveable personal property used in a drug crime is subject to forfeiture and allows the police to seize property without a warrant. In addition it allows the state to keep the property for five months before judicial proceedings begin. The respondents, all who had had property seized under the law, sued claiming that the State had failed to provide a speedy hearing to reclaim property thus violating Due Process. The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois dismissed the cases based on Seventh Circuit precedent. Respondents appealed to the Seventh Court of Appeals on the grounds that Mathews v. Eldridge. requires a hearing before the seizure of real property. The Appeals Court overruled its precedent and held that DAFPA did not provide the adequate mechanisms for owners to challenge the seizure of their property. The Court reasoned that the length of time (97 to 187 days maximum) was too long. The Seventh Circuit remanded the case back to the District Court and ordered it to devise a mechanism by which an owner can contest the seizure of his property.  Opinion of the Court  The Court declined to answer the question. In oral argument the court learned that the parties no longer disputed ownership of the property in question. Therefore, the majority opinion, written by Justice Breyer, declared the case moot and vacated the judgment of the Seventh Circuit. Justice Stevens filled a separate opinion, agreeing with Parts I and II of the Majority (which declared the case moot) however opposed Part III which declared the judgment of the Appeals Court vacated. Stevens believed judgments should not be vacated when \\"the party seeking relief from judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action,\\"Alvarez, 558 U.S. at 98 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). citing U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v.

Baptised Honoria, she was the daughter of Michael Conway and Eleanor McCarthy, her father serving with the militia during the Napoleonic Wars. She was born at Dover Castle, England. The family, of modest means, resettled in Ballinasloe, County Galway, where Honoria and her two siblings were taught in a private Catholic school. Two of her maternal uncles, James and Charles McCarthy, settled in Digby County, Nova Scotia. In 1831 Margaret Conway, Honoria's elder sister, married widower Hugh Donnelly of Athlone, a wool draper. In 1833 he went to Saint John where he became successful enough in business that he brought out his family in 1837, Honoria and her widowed mother being part of the household. Due to a reversal in business, Donnelly retired in 1838 and relocated to Nova Scotia. Honoria and her mother resided at Salmon river, near Meteghan, with Charles McCarthy, where Mrs. Conway died in 1845. The Donnelly's moved to Rhode Island in 1848. It is thought that during these years \\"she became involved in the efforts of Catholic charitable groups to address the needs of an expanding Irish population.\\" In 1854 she took vows as a Sister of Charity in New York, taking the name Mary Vincent. She was one of four volunteers who travelled to Saint John - under the direction of Bishop Thomas Louis Connolly - and was appointed mother general.

Shanagolden is located on the East Fork Chippewa River northwest of Butternut. History In 1901 the newly formed Nash Lumber Company bought 40,000 acres of timber in southern Ashland and Sawyer county. In 1902 and 1903 they selected a site along the Chippewa River and built a sawmill, a boarding house, a store which later housed the post office, homes for workers, a schoolhouse, and a four-mile railroad branch which connected to the Wisconsin Central line at Glidden. The plant consisted of a sawmill, a planing mill and a shingle mill. The little mill town in northern Wisconsin was named \\"Shanagolden\\" after the fishing village in County Limerick, Ireland from which the Nashes' ancestors came. Unusual for the time, the Nashes preserved virgin timber around town for the looks. And they let workers buy lots and build their own homes as they chose, so the two streets weren't lined with identical boxes. The Nashes themselves had the Milwaukee architect Alexander Eschweiler design one of their homes and the meeting house/reading room of the Shanagolden Improvement Club, a women's club. Recreation included picnics, fairs, parties, fishing, hunting, baseball, trap shooting, card parties, and covert drinking at the livery stable. (The town was officially dry.) In the winter of 1905-06 Nash had six camps with about 600 men logging in the surrounding forests. The mill employed 250 men and 300 to 350 people lived in the town. But despite glowing accounts of the operation in the newspapers, it was losing money. In June 1907 the sawmill burned. The people saved the planing mill and the wood piles. There was talk of rebuilding, and that summer the company improved some of its buildings, but the sawmill was not rebuilt and most employees were laid off in November. After a couple years the Mellen Lumber Company bought the mill at Shanagolden and much of the surrounding timber. They built a new shingle mill and resumed reduced operations. Then in 1912 the Mellen Company consolidated, moving the operations from Shanagolden into Glidden. Most of the workers moved too, and some of the homes were moved to Glidden on railcars and on horse-drawn sleighs in winter. In 1916 the Ashland Farm Land Company bought the Nash buildings and 40,000 acres of surrounding cutover land, planning to sell the land to Bohemian farmers from Iowa and Illinois. They sold some 40 to 160 acre farms, going for $5 to $7 per acre, but the land was hard to farm. Major logging ended in 1919, the Soo Line abandoned the rail line to Glidden by 1925, and the town gradually withered.

The movement to include children and youth with disabilities into mainstream society has led to new approaches on the part of authors, as well as educators. In the United States, 10% of the population has a physical, cognitive, mental or health disability, a rate that is consistent worldwide. Disabilities may also include sensory or learning difficulties, and may range from severe to mild. The approach of children and youth literature (collectively called \\"juvenile literature\\") can have a significant impact on the children reading it, whether they personally have experienced disability or not; literature \\"has proven to be an agent capable of influencing attitudes and acceptance of impairments\\". From 1940 to 1970, around 311 books for children were published in the United States that included characters with disabilities. Some of these books romanticized the disability, some were infantilized, while others portrayed the disabled characters as avoiding the world. One example is the classic children's book Heidi. It portrays the character Clara as a spoiled and insulated child, who regains the ability to walk after befriending Heidi and overcoming a vague and unexplained psychological problem, the apparent cause of her physical paralysis, which in reality would be medically unlikely. Another oddity is that the portrayal of blind individuals was in excess of their actual numbers in the real population. Blindness was noted as being the most common disability among African-American characters in children's fiction, used as a plot device to represent the ability to see beyond racial prejudices, making the disability secondary to its significance as a plot device. Beginning in the 1970s, the United States Congress passed several Acts to legally protect the right of children and adults with disabilities to be included in schools and the workforce, first with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and then the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. In 1986, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion of children with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. Barbara Holland Baskin and Karen H. Harris conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study Notes from a Different Drummer (1977), followed by More Notes from a Different Drummer (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since. The evolution of the portrayal of disability can be seen in the books written since the 1970s. Judy Blume shows the experience of a teenage girl diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis in Deenie (1973). The protagonist, Deenie, faces the challenges brought by having to wear a body brace during her treatment, which impacts her perceptions of herself and those of her family and fellow students. Deenie does not overcome the disability by the end of the story, nor is she defeated by it; the conclusion more realistically shows her continuing to face challenges and learning to adjust to them. A trend in current juvenile fiction is the portrayal of characters with \\"hidden disabilities\\" that have become more common diagnoses in recent decades. Examples include Petra Mathers' Sophie and Lou, about extreme shyness that is an emotional and social disability, and Caroline Janover's The Worst Speller in Jr. High (1995) about a boy with dyslexia. In fiction for older youth, disability has recently been dealt with in complex situations with nuanced techniques such as multiple- perspective narrative; an example is Erika Tamar's Fair Game (1993), about a group of male students who repeatedly sexually assault an intellectually disabled girl at their school. Bibliographer Debra Robertson, who wrote Portraying Persons with Disabilities: An Annotated Bibliography of Fiction for Children and Teenagers (1992), pointed out in the early 1990s that not every disability has to be a \\"metaphor for a protagonist's development\\", and the tendency of writers to romanticize or stigmatize medical conditions in this way is a persistent problem in juvenile literature. More recent studies have indicated that educators may improve student understanding of disability with \\"follow-up discussion or activities and stories that portray characters with disabilities accurately, realistically, and positively\\".

Janet Tyler OAM is an Australian Registered Nurse who was a member of the medical team selected to care for Australian athletes at the 1968 Summer Paralympics, Israel. She specialised in spinal nursing and rehabilitation at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre annex of Royal Adelaide Hospital, throughout the forty three years of her nursing career. Tyler was Senior Registered Nurse from 1964-1977, Clinical Nurse Coordinator from 1977-1986, Acting Nurse Manager at the Hampstead Centre from 1986-1994, Life Member of the Registered Nurse Association since 1951, Life Member of the Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association of South Australia since 1977 and Justice of the Peace for over 30 years. Personal Sister Tyler born in 1933, at Qambi Hospital, Adelaide in South Australia, lived with her parents J.C.S. Tyler an English Army Officer, mother Natalie Tyler at Kensington Gardens a suburb of Adelaide, and was educated at Woodlands Church of England Girls Grammar School Glenelg. Her love of nursing began at the Resuscitation Clinic (the Blood Bank) of Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1951. Career The completion of Tyler's formal nursing education at Royal Adelaide Hospital from 1952 to 1955, led to her involvement in establishing the acute and rehabilitation Spinal Cord Injury Service in South Australia in 1958, now known as the South Australian Spinal Cord Injury Service (SASCIS). Responsible for setting up the (acute) phase 1, the 10 bed spinal unit for patients in Grey Ward of Royal Adelaide Hospital in 1961, Sister Tyler later commissioned the first spinal injury rehabilitation ward, phase 2 (long-term rehabilitation) in the Morris Wards at the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre, sanctioned by the Director General of Medical Services Dr J.W. Rollinson in 1962. She officially closed the Morris Wards when the long-awaited new Spinal Injury Unit and new Hydrotherapy Pool opened within the new Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in 1994. Not supported by theory, nursing practice was gained by unique practical experience in special units of the hospital. Tyler's initial experience was obtained over a two-year period at the Department of Paraplegia, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia in 1961. This unit was pioneered by Australian Orthopaedic Surgeon Sir George Bedbrook, where sport played an important role in rehabilitation South Australian Paralympian Kevin Munro and Janet Tyler reminisce at a reunion of the South Australian members of the 1968 Australian Paralympic team in Adelaide in June 2013. Tyler was instrumental in gaining financial support for the construction of the first Hydrotherapy Pool at the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre from Dame Ruby Litchfield of the Telethon Charities in 1972. This was granted and the pool opened in 1973. She was Senior Nurse and Assistant Manager for the Inaugural South Australian National Spinal Games held at the Hampstead Centre in 1964, Senior Nurse at the Asia Pacific Games Tokyo, in 1972, and organised the National Paralympic Games, interstate, every two years. Appointed a member of the medical team at the 1968 Summer Paralympics, Tel Aviv, Israel, Tyler gave her professional support and care to the 32 athletes of the Australian team, many of whom had a disability from a spinal injury, winning 32 medals from 7 sports to finish fourth on the medal tally. This was the first team to include South Australia athletes at the Paralympic Games which, at that time, only catered for wheelchair athletes. Tyler said Looking after my boys and girls, my Para Quads, was my life, at an interview on being awarded the medal OAM, the Order of Australia, in recognition of a long and distinguished career particularly in the field of spinal injury rehabilitation. Tyler's 'boys and girls' include Australian Paralympians Kevin Munro, Richard Oliver, Troy Andrews, Neil Lillecrapp, Kevin Bawden, Libby Kosmala Tyler was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for her contributions to nursing and spinal cord injury rehabilitation.

Kruger v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others2009 (1) SA 417 (CC). is an important case in South African law, heard in the Constitutional Court (CC) on 19 February 2008, with judgment handed down on 2 October. The judges were Langa CJ, O'Regan ADCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, Nkabinde J, Skweyiya J (who composed the majority judgment), Van Der Westhuizen J, Yacoob J, Jafta AJ and Kroon AJ. Counsel for the applicant was G. Budlender. There was no appearance for the first respondent, but Wim Trengrove SC (with A. Cockerell) appeared for the second and (with S. Budlender) for the third respondent. The applicant's attorneys were Kruger & Co.; the State Attorney represented the second respondent, while the third respondent's attorneys were Brugmans Inc. The first question was one of constitutional practice: specifically the requirements for direct access to the Constitutional Court, in order to challenge the constitutionality of legislation. For that purpose, an expanded definition was adopted of the phrase \\"direct and personal interest.\\" If the party in question has a direct and personal interest (on this definition) where the legislation in question is # of direct and central importance to the field in which he or she operates; and # in interests of the administration of justice, the court will be required to determine the validity of the legislation. Central to the case was an amendment to the Road Accident Fund. The implementation of the amending legislation was to be staggered by the issuance of a presidential proclamation putting into effect certain amending sections before others. When the President executed on this requirement, however, he selected sections comprising an arbitrary assortment of both administrative and substantive amendments contained in the amending Act. His proclamation, therefore, was on face of it irrational, and the doctrine of objective invalidity rendered it void ab initio. Furthermore, the proclamation issued to correct the errors in the first proclamation was also void. The court thus considered also the power of the State President to issue a proclamation correcting an error made in an earlier proclamation. Although the court found that the President was empowered to withdraw the offending proclamation, it held that he may not amend a proclamation issued in error where the original proclamation was void ab initio.  Facts  Kruger, the applicant, an attorney specialising in personal injury law, approached the CC under section 172(2)(a) of the Constitution for confirmation of a High Court order declaring Proclamation R27 of 2006 (issued by President Thabo Mbeki (the first respondent) in terms of section 13 of the Road Accident Fund Amendment Act,Act 19 of 2005. and purporting to bring into operation sections 4, 6, 10, 11 and 12 of the Amendment Act, with effect from 31 July 2006) to be \\"null and void and of no force and effect.\\" Because of the alleged uncertainty created by the High Court's declaration of invalidity, the Road Accident Fund (the third respondent) sought direct access to the CC for an order declaring Proclamation R32 of 2006, issued by the President in substitution for the first proclamation, before 31 July 2006, to have brought lawfully into operation sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Amendment Act with effect from 31 July 2006. The second proclamation had been issued to correct a bona fide error in the first proclamation regarding which of the sections in the Amendment Act were to come into operation on 31 July, and was worded as \\"amending\\" the first proclamation. The first and second respondents objected in limine that the applicant had no locus standi to bring the application.  Judgment  As to the applicant's standing to bring the application, the court held that, although he might not have had standing at common law, the present case called for an expanded understanding of what constituted a \\"direct and personal interest.\\"Para 24. If the practitioner was able to establish both * that a proclamation was of direct and central importance to the field in which he or she operated; and * that it was in the interests of the administration of justice that the validity of that proclamation be determined by a court, then he or she could approach a court to challenge the validity of the proclamation. In the present case, the court found, the applicant met both requirements and accordingly had standing to pursue the application.Para 25. As to the application for direct access, the court found that it had a discretion on whether or not to grant direct access, but it would only do so in exceptional cases and when it was in the interests of justice in the light of the facts of the particular case.Para 29. The circumstances in the application for direct access were indeed, in the present case, exceptional. It was in the interests of justice, too, that the validity of the two proclamations be considered together.Para 34. As to the validity of the first proclamation, the court held that section 4, listed in both the first and the second proclamation, belonged to the cluster of the administrative amendments which were listed in the second proclamation. The effect of the first proclamation was literally to put into operation an arbitrary selection of one of the administrative amendments (section 4) and four of the substantive amendments (sections 6, 10, 11 and 12) made by the Amendment Act.Para 50. Because it was based on an arbitrary selection, it followed that the first proclamation was objectively irrational. Under the doctrine of objective invalidity, the first proclamation was a nullity from the outset. It was invalid and void ab initio, and therefore had no effect in law. Furthermore, if the first proclamation remained in effect, it would create a number of legal and practical problems.Para 52. As to the validity of the second proclamation, the court held that section 13 of the Amendment Act, read with section 81 of the Constitution, conferred the narrow power on the President to issue a proclamation determining the date on which legislation would come into operation. Properly construed, those provisions necessarily implied a power to withdraw a proclamation issued in error, if the withdrawal was executed before the relevant legislation came into force. The power to withdraw accorded with the nature of the power to issue and publish proclamations, the lawful exercise of which power would not be harmful to the rule of law. The President did not, however, have the power to amend a proclamation issued in error where the original proclamation was void from its commencement, as in the case of the second proclamation. A nullity could not be amended but could, of course, be withdrawn.Paras 60-61. The court held further that the President could, on the facts of the present case, have lawfully withdrawn the first proclamation once he realised his mistake, as long as he did so in unambiguous terms, and before July 31.Para 63. That was not, however, what had happened: The President had issued the second proclamation in which he purported to \\"amend\\" the invalid first proclamation. The President did not have the power to amend a nullity. Moreover, the second proclamation did not withdraw the first proclamation; nor, on the face of it, could the legal position with regard to the Amendment Act be determined. No commencement date was to be found in the text of the second proclamation. One had to rely on the doctrine of incorporation by reference and consider the text of the void first proclamation to give the second proclamation meaning. The second proclamation was thus unclear, inconsistent with the rule of law and invalid.Paras 64, 67. In framing an order that was just and equitable, cognisance had to be taken of the fact that Minister of Transport Jeff Radebe (the second respondent, who also signed the proclamations, as required), together with the Fund, the courts and the claimants, had since July 31, 2006, operated on the understanding that sections 1 to 5 of the Amendment Act were in operation, and that a finding to the contrary would be devastating to all concerned.Paras 68-69, 72. The court made, accordingly, the following order: * The application for leave to appeal had to be granted; * the High-Court order was invalid with effect from 31 July 2006; * Proclamation R32 of 2006 was invalid with effect from 31 July 2006; * the President had to issue a proclamation bringing sections 1 to 5 of the Road Accident Fund Amendment Act into operation, with effect from 31 July 2006, within thirty days; * the Fund could continue to act for thirty days from the date of the order as if section 1 to 5 of the Amendment Act had been brought into force on 31 July 2006; * everything that had been done by the Fund since 31 July 2006 on the basis that sections 1 to 5 had been brought into force would ** not be invalid on the ground that the first and second proclamations had been declared to be invalid; and ** be deemed valid as if sections 1 to 5 of the Amendment Act had been lawfully brought into force on 31 July 2006.Para 79.

In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice. Notable cases include United States v. Cruikshank (1875), United States v. Reese (1875), Reynolds v. United States (1878), Wilkerson v. Utah (1879), the Trade-Mark Cases (1879), Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), Pace v. Alabama (1883), United States v. Harris (1883), Ex parte Crow Dog (1883), Hurtado v. California (1884), Clawson v. United States (1885), Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886), United States v. Kagama (1886), Ker v. Illinois (1886), and Mugler v. Kansas (1887). The Waite Court decided many issues of first impression, both new crimes and new doctrines of criminal procedure and criminal investigations. For example, the Waite Court was the first to hear cases regarding the federal anti-polygamy statutes, the Reconstruction-era civil rights crimes, extortion under color of office, fraud on the United States, and mail fraud. Further, the Waite Court was the first to interpret the Confrontation Clause and the Grand Jury Clause, the criminal procedure implications of the Equal Protection Clause, and the application of the Fourth Amendment to criminal proceedings. The Waite Court decided several issues involving the interaction between the federal courts and the courts of the various states, such as civil rights and federal officer removal, criminal jurisdiction in Indian country, and federal habeas review of state criminal convictions. Background Despite the massive increase in the criminal case load before the Supreme Court, the statutory structure of the federal criminal system was not substantially changed during the Waite Court. In 1874 and 1878, the criminal statutes were codified in Title LXX of the Revised Statutes of the United States.Act of Jan. 27, 1866, ch. 7, 14 Stat. 8 (codified at Rev. Stat. tit. LXX (1877)). Title LXX occupied only 41 pages.Rev. Stat. §§ 5323-5550. Sources of jurisdiction=Writs of errorState courts= The Waite Court heard twenty-five criminal writs of error from the state courts (as authorized by § 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and its progeny). Several of these cases involved the compatibility of state criminal laws with the Dormant Commerce Clause (and its counterweight, the police power). In Welton v. Missouri (1875), the Court reversed a conviction for selling goods without a license.Welton v. Missouri, 91 U.S. (1 Otto) 275 (1875). In Turner v. Maryland (1883), the Court upheld a statute that required inspection of exported tobacco packed at a different place from where it is grown.Turner v. Maryland, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 38 (1883). Barbier v. Connolly (1884) upheld a ban on laundries.Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27 (1884). Presser v. Illinois (1886) upheld a ban on militias.Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252 (1886). Walling v. Michigan (1886) invalidated a tax on out-of-state liquor wholesalers (which did not apply to in-state liquor wholesalers).Walling v. Michigan, 116 U.S. 446 (1886). Smith v. Alabama (1888) upheld a locomotive licensing scheme.Smith v. Alabama, 124 U.S. 465 (1888). Others involved the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Strauder v. West Virginia (1880)Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 303 (1880). and Bush v. Kentucky (1883)Bush v. Kentucky, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 110 (1883). reversed convictions because of racial exclusion in the jury system. In Pace v. Alabama (1883), the Court upheld an adultery prohibition that punished inter-racial fornication more than same-race fornication.Pace v. Alabama, 106 U.S. (16 Otto) 583 (1883) Pace was overruled by McLaughlin v. Florida (1964). Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) struck down a discretionary laundry permitting system that disadvantaged Asians.Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) Hayes v. Missouri (1887) rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute authorizing the prosecution more peremptory challenges in large cities.Hayes v. Missouri, 120 U.S. 68 (1887). Mugler v. Kansas (1887) upheld a state liquor prohibition under substantive due process.Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887). The Waite Court was several times called upon to decide issues related to the interaction of the state and federal criminal systems. In Coleman v. Tennessee (1878), the Court held that a state court had no jurisdiction to try a Civil War-era murder by a soldier, which at the time was subject to courts martial jurisdiction (and where in fact the defendant had previously been tried and convicted).Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 509 (1878). But, in Robb v. Connolly (1884), the Court permitted a state court to issue a writ of habeas corpus against the state officer who administers extradition to the state from other states.Robb v. Connolly, 111 U.S. 624 (1884). And, in Kurtz v. Moffitt (1885), the Court held that—as habeas is a civil proceeding and the federal diversity jurisdiction removal statute required an amount in controversy—state habeas proceedings could not be removed to federal court under this provision.Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U.S. 487 (1885). Natal v. Louisiana (1887) declined to issue a writ of supersedes, finding that the state's initiation of a civil suit while a writ of error was pending before the Supreme Court was not contemptuous.Natal v. Louisiana, 123 U.S. 516 (1887). Royall v. Virginia (1886) struck down a misdemeanor conviction for unauthorized practice under the Contract Clause.Royall v. Virginia, 116 U.S. 572 (1886). Royall's case repeatedly reached the Waite Court through various jurisdictional means, and ultimately Royall was denied relief.In re Royall, 125 U.S. 696 (1888). =Territorial courts= LDS Apostle George Q. Cannon The Waite Court heard nine criminal appeals from the territorial courts, the majority of them arising from prosecutions of Mormon polygamists in the courts of the Utah Territory. Reynolds v. United States (1878) rejected six challenges to a polygamy conviction: that the territorial grand jury statute provided for fewer members that grand juries in the circuit courts; that it violated the Impartial Jury Clause to seat a juror opposed to polygamy; that for cause challenges were improperly granted to the prosecution; that testimony violated the Confrontation Clause; that polygamy was protected by the Free Exercise Clause; and that it was improper for the judge to comment on the social ills of polygamy.Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 145 (1878). Miles v. United States (1880) also rejected several challenges to a polygamy conviction. The Court held that bigamy could be proved by testimony (as opposed to, for example, a wedding certificate); that the question of whether the evidence established guilty beyond a reasonable doubt could not be raised de novo in the Supreme Court; that the judge could exclude jurors for-cause who believed polygamy was compelled by God; that it was too late post-conviction to complain for the first time that the wives were not named in the indictment; that there was no invalid variance from the indictment between the names \\"Caroline Owens\\" and \\"Caroline Owen Maile\\"; that wearing a wedding dress and attending a church known for polygamous weddings were competent evidence of marriage; that incompetent testimony (proof of the first marriage given by the second wife) could be given at the voir dire.Miles v. United States, 103 U.S. (13 Otto) 304 (1880). In another such case, Clawson v. United States (1885), the Court held that there was no right to bail on appeal where a defendant had been sentenced to imprisonment (there was such a right where the only punishment was a fine).Clawson v. United States, 113 U.S. 143 (1885). Reaching the merits that same year, the Court held that the Congressional statute permitting for-cause challenges of jurors who believed that polygamy was divinely compelled applied to grand juries as well as petit juries, and that the marshall could call a second venire if the 200-person venire was exhausted before a full jury was seated.Clawson v. United States, 114 U.S. 477 (1885). In Cannon v. United States (1885), the Court rejected two further challenges. First, the Court held that an indictment for the polygamy offense (which only applied to male defendants) need not allege the gender of the defendant. Second, the Court held that it was no defense that the defendant had ceased having sexual relations with his additional wives.Cannon v. United States, 116 U.S. 55 (1885). An 1885 statute governing appeals from the territorial court reduced the possibility of such appeals.Act of Mar. 3, 1885, § 2, 22 Stat. 443. In Snow v. United States (1886), the Court rejected a polygamy appeal on the grounds that the statute granted jurisdiction in criminal appeals only if the validity, existence, or jurisdiction of the territorial courts was called into question.Snow v. United States, 118 U.S. 346 (1886). The statute did not preclude jurisdiction to hear appeals from denials of habeas corpus by the territorial courts. In Ex parte Snow (1887), the Court for the first time granted relief to a polygamy defendant, holding that the crime was a continuing offense, and thus the prosecutor could not increase the number of counts in the indictment by charging the same conduct over different time periods.Ex parte Snow, 120 U.S. 274 (1887). The Court also heard a few non-polygamy territorial appeals. In Smith v. United States (1876), the Court for the first time dismissed an appeal pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.Smith v. United States, 94 U.S. (4 Otto) 97 (1876). In Wilkerson v. Utah (1879), the Court held that execution by firing squad was not cruel and unusual punishment.Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. (9 Otto) 130 (1879). In Ex parte Reggel (1885), the Court held that the territorial extradition statute—referring to \\"treason, felony, or other crime\\"—included misdemeanors.Ex parte Reggel, 114 U.S. 642 (1885). Original habeas ;Federal confinement The Waite Court heard twenty-four original habeas petitions in criminal matters. Many of these rulings held that the original habeas jurisdiction did not extend to the type of case presented. The general rule, articulated in several cases, was that there could be no post-conviction original habeas jurisdiction unless the court below was totally without jurisdiction (for example, if the criminal statute were unconstitutional).See, e.g., Ex parte Carll, 106 U.S. (16 Otto) 521 (1883); Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. (16 Otto) 371 (1882); Ex parte Rowland, 104 U.S. (14 Otto.) 604 (1881); Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 371 (1879); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 339 (1880). Thus, in several cases, the Court found the alleged error too insubstantial to consider via original habeas. In Ex parte Parks (1876), the Court held that it had no original habeas jurisdiction to free a defendant convicted in a United States district court, even though no appeal was possible from the district court to the circuit court, and even though the petitioner alleged that the district court had been entirely without jurisdiction to try the offense charged.Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S. (3 Otto) 18 (1876). Similarly, in Ex parte Rowland (1881), the Court held that it had no original habeas jurisdiction to examine a contempt of court conviction arising from the disregard of a writ of mandamus.Ex parte Rowland, 104 U.S. (14 Otto.) 604 (1881). And, in Ex parte Bigelow (1885), the Court held that there could be no review of a double jeopardy determination of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.Ex parte Bigelow, 113 U.S. 328 (1885). In Ex parte Harding (1887), the Court held that the composition of a grand jury (i.e. whether an alien sat) could not be so reviewed.Ex parte Harding, 120 U.S. 782 (1887). But, in several cases, the Court did find original habeas jurisdiction and reached the merits. In Ex parte Karstendick (1876), the Court held that a federal court had no statutory authority to sentence a defendant to hard labor at a state prison outside of its territorial jurisdiction.Ex parte Karstendick, 93 U.S. (3 Otto) 396 (1876). In Ex parte Jackson (1877), the Court considered several constitutional issues, including the Postal Power, the application of the First Amendment to mail-order gambling, and the application of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to the mail.Ex parte Jackson, 96 U.S. (6 Otto) 727 (1877). In Ex parte Lothrop (1886), the Court found that the Arizona territorial courts were properly constituted.Ex parte Lothrop, 118 U.S. 113 (1886). In In re Sawyer (1888), the Court granted the writ to state judges imprisoned by a federal judge for violating an injunction.In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200 (1888). In Ex parte Clarke (1879), the Court held that a habeas petition filed with a single justice would be referred to the entire Court.Ex parte Clarke, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 399 (1879). ;State confinement In Ex parte Royall (1886), for the first time, the Court was petitioned to grant an original writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner in state custody.Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 254 (1886). The Court held that, assuming it had such a power, it should not be exercised except in special circumstances: > It is sufficient to say that if this court has power, under existing > legislation, and upon habeas corpus, to discharge the petitioner, who is in > custody under the process of a state court of original jurisdiction, for > trial on an indictment charging him with an offense against the laws of that > state,-upon which it is not necessary to express an opinion,-such power > ought not, for the reasons given in the other cases just decided, to be > exercised in advance of his trial.Royall, 117 U.S. at 255. In Ex parte Fonda (1886), the Court denied leave to file an original habeas petition, citing Royall.Ex parte Fonda, 117 U.S. 516 (1886). In Ex parte Ayers (1887), the Court denied a state-prisoner petition on the merits, finding that the state tax law did not violate the Contracts Clause.Ex parte Ayers, 123 U.S. 443 (1887). Habeas appeals During the Chase Court-era, Congress had stripped the Court of the authority to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts.Act of Mar. 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 44. In Ex parte Royall (1884), the Waite Court dismissed such an appeal, holding that the jurisdiction had never been restored.Ex parte Royall, 112 U.S. 181 (1884). But, the Court did retain jurisdiction over habeas appeals in a limited subset of cases. For example, in Wales v. Whitney (1885), the Court affirmed the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia's denial of a habeas petition on the meits, holding that it had no power to review a navy courts martial.Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564 (1885). Similarly, in Roberts v. Reilly (1885), the Court affirmed a denial of habeas corpus on the merits, but held that it had jurisdiction to consider such appeals under the Extradition Act.Roberts v. Reilly, 116 U.S. 80 (1885). In 1885, Congress restored the authority of the Supreme Court to hear appeals from habeas petitions in the circuit courts.Act of Mar. 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 437. In Ex parte Royall (1886), the first case heard under the new statute, the court affirmed a habeas denial, holding that the lower federal courts had discretion to grant or deny habeas relief while the petitioner had not exhausted potential state court remedies.Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241 (1886). In Mali v. Keeper of the Common Jail of Hudson County (1887), the Court denied another such appeal, holding that the consular treaty with Belgium had not deprived New Jersey of its power to punish a murder committed on a docked foreign vessel.Mali v. Keeper of the Common Jail of Hudson County, 120 U.S. 1 (1887). But, in Baldwin v. Franks (1887), the Court granted the writ on appeal, holding that the Reconstruction-era civil rights crime statute applied only to those who deprived U.S. citizens (and not foreign nationals) of their rights.Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U.S. 678 (1887). Certificates of division In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 amendments to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court-era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered.Ex parte Tom Tong, 108 U.S. 556 (1883). In United States v. Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed its earlier holdings that certificates could not issue from motions to quash an indictment.United States v. Hamilton, 109 U.S. 63 (1883). Prerogative writs The Waite Court heard two criminal cases under the prerogative writ of mandamus (habeas corpus is also a prerogative writ). In Virginia v. Rives (1879), the Court used mandamus to order a criminal cases removed to federal court under the civil rights removal statute to be remanded back to state court, finding that the statute did not authorize federal jurisdiction because the bar on African-Americans serving on juries was not codified by statute or state constitution.Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 313 (1879). In Ex parte Wall (1883), the Court denied a writ of mandamus, finding that it was proper to remove an attorney who participated in a lynch mob from a case.Ex parte Wall, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 265 (1883). Defining federal crimes=Bankruptcy fraud In United States v. Fox (1877), the Court held that the criminal bankruptcy fraud statute exceeded Congress's powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause.United States v. Fox, 95 U.S. (5 Otto) 670 (1877). Civil rights In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Court overturned a conviction under the civil rights crime statute, holding that the First and Second Amendment were not incorporated against the states and the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state action.United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. (2 Otto) 542 (1875). In United States v. Reese (1875), the Court overturned another civil rights conviction for depriving African-Americans of the right to vote, holding that the statute was void for vagueness as applied to voter suppression.United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. (2 Otto) 214 (1875). In United States v. Harris (1883), known as the Ku Klux Case, the Court invalidated as unconstitutional the civil rights crime statute that applied to conspiracies to deprive state-law rights and privileges.United States v. Harris (Ku Klux Case), 106 U.S. (16 Otto) 629 (1883). But, in United States v. Gale (1883), the Court upheld a statute that punished state officers for misconduct in federal Congressional elections.United States v. Gale, 109 U.S. 65 (1883). And, in United States v. Waddell (1884), the Court upheld a criminal civil rights law as applied to the rights of Homesteaders.United States v. Waddell, 112 U.S. 76 (1884). In Ex parte Virginia (1880)Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 339 (1880). and Ex parte Siebold (1879),Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 371 (1879). the Court held that the civil rights crime statute was a valid exercise of Congress's power under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. In The Ku Klux Cases (1884), the Court upheld a conviction for a conspiracy to prevent voters from voting for federal officials, finding a relevant constitutional right.The Ku Klux Cases, 110 U.S. 651 (1884). Counterfeiting In United States v. Carll (1881), the Court defined the mens rea required under the counterfeiting statute.United States v. Carll, 105 U.S. (15 Otto) 611 (1881). In Ex parte Carll (1883), the Court held that the offense of counterfeiting was stated where the name of the original payee had been erased and replaced.Ex parte Carll, 106 U.S. (16 Otto) 521 (1883). In United States v. Arjona (1887), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a prohibition on counterfeiting the notes of foreign banks and corporations under the Foreign Commerce Clause and the law of nations power.United States v. Arjona, 120 U.S. 479 (1887). Embezzlement In United States v. Britton (1883), the Court issued four opinions on the subject of the misapplication of public funds.United States v. Britton (Britton IV), 108 U.S. 199 (1883); United States v. Britton (Britton III), 108 U.S. 193 (1883); United States v. Britton (Britton II), 108 U.S. 192 (1883); United States v. Britton (Britton I), 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 655 (1883). In United States v. Smith (1888), the Court held that the clerk of the Collector of Customs was not a public officer and thus was not indictable for embezzlement.United States v. Smith, 124 U.S. 525 (1888). Extortion under color of office Section 12 of the Crimes Act of 1825 punished extortion under color of office: > Every officer of the United States who is guilty of extortion under color of > his office shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500, or by > imprisonment not more than one year, according to the aggravation of his > offence.Crimes Act of 1825, § 12, 4 Stat. 115, 118. In United States v. Germaine (1878), the Court held that § 12 applied only to defendants who were officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause of Article Two of the United States Constitution. Because Germaine (a surgeon appointed by the Commissioner of Pensions) was not appointed by the President, a court of law, or a head of a department, the Court held that he was not covered by the statute.United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. (9 Otto) 508 (1878). The key dispute was whether the Commissioner of Pensions was a head of a department. Germaine held that the phrase \\"Heads of Departments\\" in the Appointments Clause had the same referent as the phrase \\"principal Officer\\" in the Opinions Clause of Article Two.Germaine, 99 U.S. at 511. Further, the Court held the definition of \\"inferior Officer[]\\" turned on \\"tenure, duration, emolument, and duties [that] were continuing and permanent, not occasional or temporary.\\"Germiane, 99 U.S. at 511-12. Fraud on the United States An 1873 statute punished fraud in connection with claims against the United States.Act of Mar. 3, 1873, § 31, 17 Stat. 575. In United States v. Hall (1878), the Court upheld the conviction of a ward who had withheld from a guardian the proceeds of such a claim.United States v. Hall, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 343 (1878). In United States v. Benecke (1878), the Court held that the statute did not apply to money withheld before its passage.United States v. Benecke, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 447 (1878). In United States v. Irvine (1878), a prosecution concerning a lawyer who withheld money from a client, the Court held that the crime was not a continuing offense was thus was susceptible to the statute of limitations.United States v. Irvine, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 450 (1878). In United States v. Hirsch (1879), the Court held that the crime was subject to a 5-year statute of limitations, rather than the 3-year statute of limitations under the revenue laws.United States v. Hirsch, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 33 (1879). Mail fraud In Ex parte Henry (1887), the Court held that each mailing can form the basis for a separate count of mail fraud.Ex parte Henry, 123 U.S. 372 (1887). Perjury In United States v. Curtis (1883), the Court held that a false oath taken before a notary public could not be the basis for a perjury conviction because a notary has no power to issue such an oath.United States v. Curtis, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 671 (1883). But, in United States v. Ambrose (1883), the Court held that an accounting of services given to a clerk of court is a \\"certification\\" covered by the statute.United States v. Ambrose, 108 U.S. 336 (1883). Private money In United States v. Van Auken (1877), the Court held that the offense of circulating private legal tender did not apply to the circulation of a bill which stated that it was payable in goods only.United States v. Van Auken, 96 U.S. (6 Otto) 366 (1877). Revenue laws In United States v. Norton (1875), the Court held that the embezzlement of postal money orders was not an offense under the revenue laws.United States v. Norton, 91 U.S. (1 Otto) 566 (1875). In United States v. Spiegel (1886), the Court held that possession of an uncancelled stamp for imported liquors was not a crime unless it had been intentionally removed.United States v. Spiegel, 116 U.S. 270 (1886). Trademark In the Trade-Mark Cases (1879), a criminal prosecution under the new trademark law, the Court found the act unconstitutional under the Copyright Clause.Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 82 (1879). Federal jurisdiction ;Indian country Crow Dog In United States v. McBratney (1881), the Court held that the federal government had failed to reserve criminal jurisdiction over Indian country in Colorado upon its admission as a U.S. state. Thus, it had no jurisdiction to try the murder of a non-Indian by a non-Indian on the Ute reservation.United States v. McBratney, 104 U.S. (14 Otto) 621 (1881). In Ex parte Crow Dog (1883), the Court held that the Nonintercourse Act of 1834's exception for Indian-on-Indian crimes had not been repealed by the \\"bad men\\" clause of a treaty, and that therefore there was no federal jurisdiction to try such a crime.Ex parte Kan-gi-shun-ca (Crow Dog), 109 U.S. 556 (1883). Congress responded by passing the Major Crimes Act. In United States v. Kagama (1886), the Court upheld the Major Crimes Act.United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886). ;Federal officer removal In Tennessee v. Davis (1879), the Court upheld the federal officer removal component of the Reconstruction-era removal statute (the civil rights removal component of which had come before the Chase Court).Tennessee v. Davis, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 257 (1879). Davis v. South Carolina (1883) concerned an attempt by a state court to continue criminal proceedings in spite of an effected federal officer removal. On the merits, the Court held that an assistant U.S. Marshall was entitled to official immunity. Further, the Court held that bail could not be forfeited for failing to appear in state court after the removal.Davis v. South Carolina, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 597 (1883). ;Courts-martial In Ex parte Reed (1879), the Court held that the clerk of the navy postmaster could permissible be tried by courts martial.Ex parte Reed, 100 U.S. (10 Otto) 13 (1879). In Ex parte Mason (1881), the Court held that courts martial jurisdiction extended to a military prison shooting and that the courts martial had the power to add a dishonorable discharge onto the maximum sentence authorized by Congress.Ex parte Mason, 105 U.S. (15 Otto) 696 (1881). Criminal procedure=Constitutional issues ;Confrontation Clause Reynolds v. United States (1878) was the first Supreme Court case where the defendant raised a Confrontation Clause issue. The Court held that the defendant's right to confront the witnesses (the alleged multiple wives) was forfeited by the wrongdoing of the defendant in procuring their absence. ;Cruel and unusual punishment In Wilkerson v. Utah (1879), the Court held that execution by firing squad was not cruel and unusual punishment. ;Double Jeopardy Clause In Kring v. Missouri (1883), the Court held that it violated double jeopardy for a statute to attempt to abrogate the rule that a guilty plea to second degree murder is an implied acquittal for first-degree murder.Kring v. Missouri, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 221 (1883). In Bohanan v. Nebraska (1886), without reaching the merits (but only deciding a motion to dismiss), the Court held that it had the authority to consider whether a second murder conviction in state court constituted double jeopardy.Bohanan v. Nebraska, 118 U.S. 23 (1886). ;Due process In Brooks v. Missouri (1888), the Court held that a state rule requiring a new trial motion within four days of the verdict did not violate the Due Process Clause.Brooks v. Missouri, 124 U.S. 394 (1888). ;Equal protection and jury selection An all- white jury Strauder v. West Virginia (1880) and Bush v. Kentucky (1883) reversed convictions because of racial exclusion in the jury system. Hayes v. Missouri (1887) rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute that provided the prosecution 8 peremptory challenges in small towns and 15 in large cities. ;Ex post facto law In Kring v. Missouri (1883), the Court also found that the statute violated the Constitution's prohibition against ex post facto laws (the plea was entered before the state constitutional amendment was passed). This alternative holding was overruled by Collins v. Youngblood (1990). ;Grand Jury Clause In Ex parte Wilson (1885)Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417 (1885). and United States v. Petit (1885),United States v. Petit, 114 U.S. 429 (1885). the Court held that hard labor is an infamous punishment and therefore that the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment attached. In Mackin v. United States (1886), the Court held that an authorized sentence of two years imprisonment (even without hard labor) was sufficiently infamous to require a grand jury.Mackin v. United States, 117 U.S. 348 (1886). In Ex parte Bain (1887)Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1 (1887). and Parkinson v. United States (1887),Parkinson v. United States, 121 U.S. 281 (1887). the Court held that an authorized sentence of one year in the penitentiary was sufficiently infamous. In Hurtado v. California (1884), the Court held that the Grand Jury Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884). Hurtado remains good law, and—along with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment—the Grand Jury Clause remains the only criminal procedure provision of the Bill of Rights not to be incorporated. Other ;Sufficiency of an indictment In United States v. Simmons (1877), the Court assessed the sufficiency of an indictment charging the production of untaxed alcohol. The Court held that an indictment must either name the defendant or state that the defendant's name is unknown.United States v. Simmons, 96 U.S. (6 Otto) 360 (1877). In United States v. Hess (1888), the Court held that a mail fraud indictment was insufficient where it merely parroted the words of the statute. Rather, the Court required a more specific description of the scheme and the fraud.United States v. Hess, 124 U.S. 483 (1888). ;Fugitive disentitlement In Smith v. United States (1876) and Bonahan v. Nebraska (1887),Bonahan v. Nebraska, 125 U.S. 692 (1887). the Court dismissed appeals pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. ;Objections to grand juries In United States v. Gale (1883), the Court held that a challenge to the composition of a grand jury (specifically, the disqualification of Confederate veterans) was waived after the defendant entered a plea. ;Corporate officer liability In United States v. Northway (1887), the Court upheld the conviction of a bank president for a crime committed by his organization.United States v. Northway, 120 U.S. 327 (1887). ;Costs In United States ex rel. Phillips v. Gaines (1880), the Court held that it had no power to award costs in criminal cases.United States ex rel. Phillips v. Gaines, 1880 WL 18566 (U.S. 1880). ;Diplomatic immunity In Ex parte Hitz (1884), the Court found that a Swiss consul indicted for embezzlement had no diplomatic immunity because he had resigned before the indictment.Ex parte Hitz, 111 U.S. 766 (1884). Criminal investigations ;Fourth Amendment Ex parte Jackson (1877) was perhaps the first criminal Fourth Amendment case to reach the Supreme Court. The Court held that a warrant was required to open mail. In Ex parte Spies (1887), the Court held that a Fourth Amendment claim was waived because the facts establishing the legality of the search did not appear in the record.Ex parte Spies, 123 U.S. 131 (1887). ;Foreign extradition In United States v. Rauscher (1886), the Court vacated the conviction of a defendant who had been extradited from Great Britain to the United States, but not in conformity with the extradition treaty between the two countries. Justice Gray concurred, and Chief Justice Waite dissented.United States v. Rauscher, 119 U.S. 407 (1886). But, in Ker v. Illinois (1886), involving a defendant apprehended in Peru—a country which also had such a treaty but which had recently experienced a coup that interfered with the extradition process—the Court held that a defendant could raise no objection to the legality of his capture.Ker v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436 (1886). FootnotesNotesReferences Waite Court United States Supreme Court criminal cases by Chief Justice ","title":"Criminal law in the Waite Court"},{"id":"36032050","text":"The Waite Court refers to the Supreme Court of the United States from 1874 to 1888, when Morrison Waite served as the seventh Chief Justice of the United States. Waite succeeded Salmon P. Chase as Chief Justice after the latter's death. Waite served as Chief Justice until his death, at which point Melville Fuller was nominated and confirmed as Waite's successor. The Waite Court presided over the end of the Reconstruction Era, and the start of the Gilded Age. It also played an important role during the constitutional crisis that arose following the 1876 presidential election, as five of its members served on the Electoral Commission that Congress created to settle the dispute over who won the Electoral College vote. During the Waite's tenure, the jurisdiction of federal circuit courts (as against that of the State courts) was expanded by the Jurisdiction and Removal Act of 1875, which gave the federal judiciary full jurisdiction over federal questions. As a result of the change, caseloads in the federal courts grew considerably. Membership The Waite court began with the appointment of Morrison Waite by President Ulysses S. Grant to succeed Chief Justice Salmon Chase. Grant had previously nominated Attorney General George Henry Williams and former Attorney General Caleb Cushing, but withdrew both nominations after encountering opposition in the Senate. The Waite Court began with eight holdovers from the Chase Court: Nathan Clifford, Noah Haynes Swayne, Samuel Freeman Miller, David Davis, Stephen Johnson Field, William Strong, Joseph P. Bradley, and Ward Hunt. Clifford, Miller, Field, Strong, and Bradley served on the 1877 Electoral Commission. Davis resigned from the court in 1877 to serve in the United States Senate, and President Rutherford B. Hayes successfully nominated John Marshall Harlan to replace him In 1880, Hayes successfully nominated William Burnham Woods to replace the retiring Strong. In 1881, President James Garfield nominated Stanley Matthews to replace the retiring Swayne. President Chester A. Arthur added Horace Gray and Samuel Blatchford to the court, replacing Clifford and Hunt. Woods died in 1887, and President Grover Cleveland appointed Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II to the court. Timeline=Rulings of the Court Notable rulings of the Waite Court include: *United States v. Reese (1875): In a 7-2 decision delivered by Chief Justice Waite, the court held that the Fifteenth Amendment does not prevent states from using ostensibly race-neutral limitations on voting rights such as poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and literacy tests. The decision played a major role in allowing states to effectively disenfranchise African-Americans. *Minor v. Happersett (1875): In a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Waite, the court held that the Constitution did not grant women the right to vote. The ruling was effectively overturned by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. *United States v. Cruikshank (1875): In a 5-4 decision delivered by Chief Justice Waite, the court overturned indictments arising from the Colfax massacre. The court held that the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause only apply to state action, and that the Fourteenth Amendment had not incorporated the First or Second amendments to apply to the states. The decision was a major blow to the power of the Enforcement Acts and the federal government's ability to protect the rights of African-Americans in the South. Later decisions, including Gitlow v. New York (1925), would incorporate most of the Bill of Rights to apply to states. *Reynolds v. United States (1878): In a decision delivered by Chief Justice Waite, the court upheld the conviction of George Reynolds. Reynolds, a member of the LDS Church, had been convicted of bigamy under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. The court held that the banning of bigamy did not conflict with the Establishment Clause. *Pennoyer v. Neff (1878): In a decision written by Justice Field, the court held that a state can exert personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the defendant is served notice while physically present in a state. *Strauder v. West Virginia (1880): In a 7-2 decision delivered by Justice Strong, the court held that the Equal Protection Clause bans exclusionary policies that lead to all-white juries. The decision overturned the conviction of Taylor Strauder, an African-American convicted of murder in West Virginia by an all-white jury. Strauder was the first time that the Court reversed a state criminal conviction for a violation of a constitutional provision concerning criminal procedure.Michael J. Klarman, The Racial Origins of Modern Criminal Procedure, 99 48 (2000). *Pace v. Alabama (1883): In a unanimous decision delivered by Justice Field, the court upheld Alabama's anti-miscegenation laws. Pace was later overruled by Loving v. Virginia (1967) on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause. *The Civil Rights Cases (1883): In an 8-1 decision delivered by Justice Bradley, the court struck down part of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, holding that the Equal Protection Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment do not protect against racial discrimination by private actors. The decision has not been overturned, and most future legislation against private discrimination (such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964) was passed on the basis of the Commerce Clause. *Elk v. Wilkins (1884): In a 7-2 decision delivered by Justice Gray, the court held that the Citizenship Clause does not automatically grant citizenship to Native Americans born on Indian reservations. The case was effectively overruled by the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924. *The Railroad Commission Cases (1886): In a 6-2 decision delivered by Chief Justice Waite, the court upheld state fixation of railroad prices as a permissible exercise of police power. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota (1890) later limited the effect of this ruling. *Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois (1886): *Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. (1886): *Presser v. Illinois (1886): In a decision delivered by Justice Woods, the court affirmed its decision in Cruikshank, saying that the First and Second Amendments do not apply to state governments. The decision overturned the conviction of Herman Presser, a member of Lehr und Wehr Verein, a Chicago-based socialist military organization. *The Telephone Cases (1888): In a series of court cases related to the invention of the telephone, the court upheld Alexander Graham Bell's patents against the claims of Western Union. The court split, 4–3, on the ruling, and Chief Justice Waite delivered the majority opinion. Judicial philosophy The Waite Court confronted constitutional questions arising from the Civil War, Reconstruction, the expansion of the federal government following the Civil War, and the emergence of a national economy linked together by railroads. The Waite Court issued several major decisions, including Cruikshank, that denied the federal government the power to protect the civil rights of African Americans. However, historian Michael Les Benedict notes that the civil rights decision were made during the era of dual federalism, and the Waite Court was sincerely concerned with maintaining the balance of power between the federal government and state governments. While the Waite Court struck down civil rights laws, it upheld many economic regulations, in contrast with the Fuller Court.
