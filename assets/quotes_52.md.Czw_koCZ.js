The climate of Hungary is characterised by its position. Hungary is in the eastern part of Central Europe, roughly equidistant from the Equator and the North Pole, more than from either and about 1,000 kilometres from the Atlantic Ocean. Its climate, like its whole geography, is as the result of environmental changes during the Holocene Era. Hungary's climate is the result of the interaction of two major climate systems: the continental climate and the Oceanic climate. The influence of both these systems are felt across the country at different times, which means, that the weather is very changeable. Influencing factors The two most important factors influencing the climate of Hungary are its distance from the Atlantic and the prevailing westerly winds. The continental character of the Hungarian climate is far from being as extreme as in Eastern Europe. The degree of continentality can be illustrated by the following example: if the Atlantic coast is taken as zero and Verkhoyansk in Siberia as 100, then Sopron (Western Hungary), Putnok (Northern Hungary) and T√≥tkoml√≥s (South-Eastern Hungary), would be 27.3, 30.4 and 34, respectively. The depressions of the temperate zone follow in the path of the westerly winds and bring heavy rains to the country. The country's situation within the geographical region of the Carpathian Basin is also important. The surrounding mountain ranges modify the impact of winds and other climatic forces progressing towards the country. Hungary's climate is influenced by two more or less permanent action centres of the temperate zone, the Icelandic Low and the Azores High. Depressions originating from the Iceland zone travel across the country bringing cool weather and rain. When the Azores high gains the ascendancy, the weather is bright and dry, in winter and summer alike. Beside the permanent ones there is an important seasonal action centre too, the Siberian High, which exerts its influence from time to time in winter, when the cold air masses over Siberia and Eastern Europe are driven across the Carpathian mountains and settle for some time over the Carpathian Basin. Sunshine From north to south, Hungary differs by only about 3 degrees of latitude. The seasonal variance in the angle of incidence of the Sun's rays is, therefore, about 3¬∞. The annual total insolation of the surface of the country varies between . The seasonal distribution of sunshine varies between in summer and in winter. It varies a little by longitude, from in the west to in the south-east. The average hours of sunshine vary between 1,700 and 2,100 a year (at Sopron 1,700 hours, in Szeged 2,068 hours). The maxima at both are in July. The annual average of completely overcast days varies between 70 and 190. The actual hours of sunshine - that is, any sunshine on a day - reaches almost the half of that possible - 46%. (London, by comparison, has about 33 percent a year). Temperature Even in Hungary, the temperature is warmer than, for example, neighbouring Austria, because of the south flow over the Alps of the Gulf Stream. This aberration or anomaly can be as much as . Towards the east, this gradually diminishes. The average temperature in Hungary is . The difference between the north and the south is only , because of the relatively small distance between south and north. For instance, the mean temperature in Southern England, Massif Central in France and Switzerland is the same, but in Hungary there are much greater extremes from summer to winter. Agronomy The heat total during Hungary's growing season rises above over much of the country, which is very favourable to agriculture in Hungary. But, frosts in May can represent a serious hazard to crops. The soil surface temperature fluctuates between even wider extremes than that of the air; in the soil the annual temperature range may exceed . below the surface this fluctuation ceases, and the temperature is constant at . The average depth of surface frosts is . Wind The wind exerts a strong influence on the other climatic elements by its velocity, direction and ability to mobilize the air masses. At an altitude independent of relief effect, about 4,000 m, westerly currents predominate over the country. Closer to the surface, over the greater part of the country, north-westerly winds predominate, but east of the Tisza river northerly winds prevail. As regards wind velocity, the mean annual value varies between 1,5 and 2,5 on the Beaufort scale (2 and 3\\" 5 m/s) over the whole country. The changes of atmospheric pressure are not very significant. Precipitation The average annual precipitation across the country is . The driest parts of the country are in the east, where for example in the Hortob√°gy the annual precipitation remains below . The maximum of rain, nearly , falls at Hungary's western borders. As is characteristic of the continental climate, the most precipitation occurs in late spring and early summer. In the south-western region a second maximum occurs during October under influences of the Mediterranean climate. The number of rainy days is over 100 in the south-western borderland, as well as in the area of the M√°tra and B√ºkk mountains; but less than 80 along the middle section of the Tisza . Low precipitation, heat, and strong evaporation make the Great Hungarian Plain very dusty in summer. Thunderstorms and gales are common, particularly in the summer months. In winter, from the end of November to the beginning of March, precipitation falls partly in the form of snow. The snow cover varies considerably. The thinnest snow cover is found in the eastern region of the Great Plain (with the annual average being ). Often winter corn remains open to the elements, when farmers do not expect any hard frost. Humidity In Hungary the air humidity is much higher in summer than in winter. The annual average water vapour content is at a hydrostatic pressure of . The highest relative water vapour content (over 75%) is found in the western borderland. Terrain The surface of the country and the hydrology of Hungary also affects the climate. Their general influence on the macroclimate is negligible, but they have an effect on the meso- and microclimates. A good example is the microclimate of the surroundings of the great lakes, especially that of the Lake Balaton. But bare sandy surfaces, hills (of calcium carbonate such as dolomite) such as the hills surrounding Buda and even the kind of vegetation also have an influence on the meso- and microclimates. The relief energy of Hungary, that is, the differences in altitude in the country (in other words its hydroelectric potential) is relatively small, but the difference in altitude between the Great Hungarian Plain and the shallow northern mountain ranges is enough to produce clear differences in the climates of the two areas.

Severe Tropical Cyclone Alison A tropical depression formed on 6 November 1998 near Cocos Island. The tropical depression rapidly strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Alison on the same day. Alison was 130 miles northeast of Cocos Island and was moving southeast. Alison passed only 25 miles south of Cocos bringing gale-force winds to the island. On 11 November, Alison encountered wind shear which weakened the storm and by 13 November the storm dissipated. Severe Tropical Cyclone Billy Billy formed on 1 December 1998 off the northwestern Australia coast. The storm moved nearly due south before making landfall near Onslow, Western Australia. Damage estimates from Australia are unavailable. Severe Tropical Cyclone Thelma On 3 December a tropical depression formed in the Arafura Sea, 250 miles east-northeast of Darwin. The system drifted southwestward, strengthening into Tropical Cyclone Thelma on 6 December. Thelma continued to intensify as it turned to the south- southwest, reaching Category 5 strengthen on the Australian cyclone scale as it brushed the Tiwi Islands. Cyclone Thelma reached a peak of 140 mph with a minimum pressure of 925 mbar on the 8th, and made landfall on the western Australian coastline on the 10th. After making landfall, the storm paralleled the coastline, and rapidly weakened to a tropical storm. Favorable conditions aloft allowed it to remain a tropical storm until the 15th, when the storm dissipated near Port Hedland. Thelma was responsible for moderate rainfall and downed trees, but caused no casualties due to the sparse population of where it hit. Tropical Low On 3 December, an area of concentrated convection developed from a monsoon trough over the Indian Ocean. The next day RSMC La Reunion issued one advisory on this system, labeling it \\"A3\\". Over the next few days the area drifted eastward into the Australian region and slowly organized. The warning center at Perth initiated bulletins on the tropical low on 7 December when the system was located 175 nm west-northwest of Cocos Island. The low remained essentially stationary for the next 48 hours while slowly weakening. Perth discontinued bulletins on the 8th, but continued to track the low for the next few days. The remnants of the low drifted eastward to a point about 150 nm north-northwest of Cocos. There is a significant possibility that this low is the same persistent one that developed into Tropical Cyclone Cathy. Tropical Cyclone Cathy This storm developed near Cocos Island. Tropical Low A tropical disturbance was first noted by JTWC over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 25 December. The system deepened as it moved slowly westward over the next two days. The disturbance continued to intensify over the Northern Territory, until it stalled over the border of Queensland for a couple of days. On 30 December the system moved over water and began to develop further, prompting TCWC Brisbane to issue a Tropical Cyclone Watch for portions of the southern Gulf coast. The low turned south- southeast shortly afterwards, and warnings were canceled when it became apparent that the center moved back inland. The system weakened over northwestern Queensland and dissipated on 2 January. The low brought heavy rains to the state of Queensland, with many centers reporting 24-hour totals over 150 mm. This rainfall activity was enhanced by an upper-level trough which brought showers as far south as Sydney on 1 January. Widespread flooding caused some of river systems which feed into Lake Eyre to reach flood stage. At least one death was indirectly attributed to the storm, when heavy rain and fog caused a car to drive off a road north of Brisbane. Tropical Cyclone Olinda Tropical Cyclone Olinda existed from 20 to 21 January. Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien‚ÄìBirenda Severe Tropical Cyclone Damien‚ÄìBirenda existed from 21 to 28 January. Tropical Cyclone Pete Tropical Cyclone Pete existed from 21 to 23 January. Tropical Low 16P An elongated monsoon trough spread across northern Australia in late January. On 22 January the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began mentioning a disturbance in the Gulf of Carpentaria in their daily Tropical Weather Outlooks. The disturbance drifted eastward from the north of Arnhem Land into the northern Gulf. The TCWC at Darwin begin issuing warnings on 24 January and a cyclone watch was posted for portions of the southern Gulf Coast. JTWC issued a Formation Alert early that day and began issuing warnings on the 25th. The system drifted slowly in a south-southwesterly direction over the next couple of days. According to JTWC estimates, the system strengthened into a tropical storm at 1200 UTC on 25 January. Conditions deteriorated on 26 January when the system ran into some vertical wind shear and weakened. The JTWC noted that a second circulation appeared to the east of the warning position and that dry air entrainment had led to decreased organization of the depressions. When the low was about 125 nm east of Alyangula, Darwin issued the last gale warning, and ceased advices on the slow-moving system 24 hours later. Tropical Low 18S A tropical low numbered 18S existed from 31 January to 14 February. Severe Tropical Cyclone Rona Rona formed in the Coral Sea and crossed the Queensland coast on 11 February causing major flooding between Cairns and Townsville with extensive crop damage. It eventually reformed into Severe Tropical Cyclone Frank in the South Pacific. Tropical Low (26S) A tropical low numbered 26S existed from 7 to 14 March. Severe Tropical Cyclone Elaine Making landfall on 20 March, this cyclone devastated the small town of Moora, where houses and commercial properties in the town were inundated by the floodwaters and approximately 1000 people were evacuated. Severe Tropical Cyclone Vance A tropical depression formed in the Timor Sea on 16 March 1999. The storm lingered before being upgraded to cyclone status and was named Vance. By 19 March, Cyclone Vance had reached Category 3 status as it neared the Australian coast. On 20 March, Vance became a Category 5 Australian cyclone as it made landfall near Exmouth. Moving southward, the interaction with land weakened Vance and by 24 March, the storm dissipated before reaching Victoria, Australia. Vance caused significant flooding and property damage but there were no deaths. Severe Tropical Cyclone Vance devastated the northwest town of Exmouth. A measured wind gust of 267 km/h, recorded at 11.50 am (WST) 22 March, at Learmonth Meteorological Office, is the highest wind speed ever recorded on mainland Australia. The Bureau's Regional Director Len Broadbridge said that Vance was one of the most severe cyclones in Australia's history. \\"The wind speeds experienced at Exmouth are possibly the strongest experienced by an Australian town or city in recorded history.\\" Tropical Low Another tropical low existed from 20 to 21 March. Severe Tropical Cyclone Frederic‚ÄìEvrina This cyclone moved into Reunion area of responsibility on 1 April. Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda Cyclone Gwenda was another category 5 cyclone, the strongest of the season and the most powerful cyclone in this region on record. It formed on 4 April, and fortunately weakened before making landfall near Port Hedland, Australia on 7 April. Damage was minimal. Tropical Low Another tropical low existed from 16 to 19 April. Tropical Cyclone Hamish This cyclone moved into Reunion area of responsibility on 21 April at tropical cyclone intensity. However, it was designated F1 and not named. Storm names Tropical cyclones are assigned names by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or Papua New Guinea. Tropical cyclones are named if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale developing over warm waters, or if Dvorak intensity analysis indicate the presence of gale force or stronger winds near the centre. Therefore, tropical systems with gales in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre, are not named. All names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially. Only the names used during this cyclone season are listed below. The complete list of names for each basin are found in the World Meteorological Organization's official lists. Each Australian Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane) maintains a list of names arranged alphabetically and alternating male and female. Tropical cyclones that develop in the South-East Indian Ocean are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Perth. This region includes the areas east of 90¬∞E, south of the Equator, and west of 125¬∞E. Tropical cyclones that develop south of the Equator between 125¬∞E and 141¬∞E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Darwin, Northern Territory. This area includes most of the cyclones that form in the Arafura Sea and Western Gulf of Carpentaria. Tropical cyclones in the Coral Sea and Eastern Gulf of Carpentaria between 141¬∞E and 160¬∞E and south of 10¬∞S are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane, Queensland.

Harrewijn was a preacher who was a member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN). He was strongly committed to helping people in the lowest ranks of society: the homeless, social security claimants and addicts. He was active in the CPN at the municipal and provincial level. On 1 February 1995 Harrewijn became partijvoorzitter (chairman) of the GreenLeft Party, which had emerged after a merger of the CPN, the Christian left Evangelical People's Party and Political Party of Radicals and the left-socialist Pacifist Socialist Party in 1991. He remained in that position until the 1998 elections when he was elected to the House of Representatives of the Netherlands. Here he focused on defence and social affairs. This earned him the nickname \\"General Ab\\". As GreenLeft defence spokesperson, he was a member of the temporary committee on decision- making procedures for military operations. Harrewijn stood again in the 2002 elections. However, a few days before the 15 May election date he suffered a massive stroke, which ended his life two days before the election (the stroke may have been induced by the stress of the 6 May 2002 announcement of the murder of Pim Fortuyn). The Leftwing Cheek, the GreenLeft platform for religion and politics, instituted an Ab Harrewijn Prize in his honour, for creative, small initiatives for people in the lowest ranks of society. The National Client Council organizes a yearly lecture in his honour. In 2006 the Harrewijn Law was adopted. This was based on an initiative of Harrewijn and fellow GreenLeft MP Paul Rosenm√∂ller, which seeks to inform works councils of the salaries of the top levels of management and its Board of directors.Wet Harrewijn, ORnet.nl.

The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Builder and Queen Tamar the Great, and fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant to the Timurid Empire. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian (Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar) domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief bid for independence with the Democratic Republic of Georgia of 1918‚Äì1921, Georgia was part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic from 1922 to 1936, and then formed the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991. The first president Zviad Gamsakhurdia stoked Georgian nationalism and vowed to assert Tbilisi's authority over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Gamsakhurdia was deposed in a bloody coup d'√©tat within the same year and the country became embroiled in a bitter civil war, which lasted until 1995. Supported by Russia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia achieved de facto independence from Georgia. The Rose Revolution forced Eduard Shevardnadze to resign in 2003. The new government under Mikheil Saakashvili prevented the secession of a third breakaway republic in the Adjara crisis of 2004, but the conflict with Abkhazia and South Ossetia led to the 2008 Russo‚ÄìGeorgian War and tensions with Russia remain unresolved. The history of Georgia is inextricably linked with the history of the Georgian people.David Marshal Lang: The Georgians OriginsWilliam Edward David Allen: A History of the Georgian People From the Beginning Down to the Russian Conquest in the Nineteenth Century Prehistoric period Evidence for the earliest occupation of the territory of present-day Georgia goes back to c. 1.8 million years ago, as evident from the excavations of Dmanisi in the south-eastern part of the country. This is the oldest evidence of humans anywhere in the world outside Africa. Later prehistoric remains (Acheulian, Mousterian and the Upper Palaeolithic) are known from numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The earliest agricultural Neolithic occupation is dated sometime between 6000 and 5000 BC.Aruchlo: An Early Neolithic Tell Settlement of the 6th Millennium BC Deutsches Arch√§ologisches InstitutGeorgia:History and Culture American Chamber of Commerce in GeorgiaGeorgia - History Century Travel known as the Shulaveri- Shomu culture, where people used local obsidian for tools, raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grew crops, including grapes.Anatolia and the Caucasus, 8000‚Äì2000 B.C. Numerous excavations in tell settlements of the Shulaveri-Shomu type have been conducted since the 1960s. Early metallurgy started in Georgia during the 6th millennium BC, associated with the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. From the beginning of the 4th millennium, metals became used to larger extend in East Georgia and in the whole Transcaucasian region.Thomas St√∂llner, Irina Gambaschidze (2014) THE GOLD MINE OF SAKDRISI AND EARLIEST MINING AND METALLURGY IN THE TRANSCAUCASUS AND THE KURA-VALLEY SYSTEM In the 1970s, archaeological excavations revealed a number of ancient settlements that included houses with galleries, carbon-dated to the 5th millennium BC in the Imiris-gora region of Eastern Georgia. These dwellings were circular or oval in plan, a characteristic feature being the central pier and chimney. These features were used and further developed in building Georgian dwellings and houses of the 'Darbazi' type. In the Chalcolithic period of the fourth and third millennia BC, Georgia and eastern Asia Minor were home to the Kura-Araxes culture, giving way in the second millennium BC. to the Trialeti culture. Archaeological excavations have brought to light the remains of settlements at Beshtasheni and Ozni (4th‚Äì3rd millennium BC), and barrow burials (carbon dated to the 2nd millennium BC) in the province of Trialeti, at Tsalka (Eastern Georgia). Together, they testify to an advanced and well-developed culture of building and architecture. Kingdom of Diauehi.

Between 2100 and 750 BC, the area survived the invasions by the Hittites, Urartians, Medes, Proto-Persians and Cimmerians. At the same period, the ethnic unity of Proto-Kartvelians broke up into several branches, among them Svans, Zans/Chans and East-Kartvelians. That finally led to the formation of modern Kartvelian languages: Georgian (originating from East Kartvelian vernaculars), Svan, Megrelian and Laz (the latter two originating from Zan dialects). By that time Svans were dominant in modern Svaneti and Abkhazia, Zans inhabited modern Georgian province of Samegrelo, while East-Kartvelians formed the majority in modern eastern Georgia. As a result of cultural and geographic delimitation, two core areas of future Georgian culture and statehood formed in western and eastern Georgia by the end of the 8th century BC. The first two Georgian states emerged in the west known as the Kingdom of Colchis and in the east as the Kingdom of Iberia. Antiquity Early Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia Early Georgian States of Colchis and Iberia. A second Georgian tribal union emerged in the 13th century BC on the Black Sea coast under the Kingdom of Colchis in western Georgia.Braund, D., Georgia in antiquity: a history of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC ‚Äì AD 562, Oxford University Press, 1996Oliver Wardrop, The Kingdom of Georgia: Travel in a Land of Women, Wine and Song (Kegan Paul Library of History and Archaeology) The kingdom of Colchis, which existed from the 6th to the 1st centuries BC is regarded as the first early Georgian state formation and the term Colchians was used as the collective term for early Georgian-Kartvelian tribes such as Mingrelians, Lazs and Chans who populated the eastern coast of the Black Sea.Modern Hatreds, Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War, Stuart J.

Starting around 2000 BC, northwestern Colchis was inhabited by the Svan and Zan peoples of the Kartvelian tribes. Another important ethnic element of ancient Colchis were Greeks who between 1000 and 550 BC established many trading colonies in the coastal area, among them Naessus, Pitiys, Dioscurias (modern Sukhumi), Guenos, Phasis (modern Poti), Apsaros, and Rhizos (modern Rize in Turkey). In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th‚Äì4th centuries BC, which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300 BC by Parnavaz I, the first ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd Ed, Ronald Grigor Suny, p 13 Between 653 and 333 BC, both Colchis and Iberia survived successive invasions by the Iranian Median Empire. The case is different for the Achaemenid Persians however. According to Herodotus (3.97), Achaemenid power extended as far as the Caucasus mountains, but the Colchians are not included in his list of the twenty Persian satrapies. Nor are they referred to in the lists of Achaemenid lands (dahyƒÅva) given in the Old Persian inscriptions of Darius and his successors. In Xenophon‚Äôs Anabasis (7.8.25; probably an interpolation) the tribes of Colchis and East Pontus are referred to as independent (aut√≥nomoi). On the other hand, Herodotus mentioned both the Colchians and various Pontic tribes in his catalogue (7.78-79) of approximately fifty-seven peoples who participated in Xerxes‚Äô expedition against Greece in 481-80 b.c.e. As the Encyclopaedia Iranica states, it is thus probable that the Achaemenids never succeeded in asserting effective rule over Colchis, though local tribal leaders seem to have acknowledged some kind of Persian suzerainty. The Encyclopaedia Iranica further states, whereas the adjoining Pontic tribes of the nineteenth satrapy and the Armenians of the thirteenth are mentioned as having paid tribute to Persia, the Colchians and their Caucasian neighbors are not; they had, however, undertaken to send gifts (100 boys and 100 girls) every five years (Herodotus 3.97). At the end of the 4th century BC southern Iberia witnessed the invading armies of Alexander the Great, who established a vast Greco-Macedonian empire to the south of the Caucasus. Neither Iberia nor Colchis was incorporated into the empire of Alexander or any of the successor Hellenistic states of the Middle East. However, the culture of ancient Greece still had a considerable influence on the region, and Greek was widely spoken in the cities of Colchis. In Iberia Greek influence was less noticeable and Aramaic was widely spoken. Between the early 2nd century BC and the late 2nd century AD both Colchis and Iberia, together with the neighboring countries, became an arena of long and devastating conflicts between major and local powers such as Rome, Armenia and the short-lived Kingdom of Pontus. Pompey's campaign in 65-66 annexed Armenia and then he headed North the Kura river and then West down the Rioni river to the Black Sea.History of Georgia, translated to English; and many other sources. In 189 BC, the rapidly growing Kingdom of Armenia took over more than half of Iberia, conquering the southern and southeastern provinces of Gogarene, Taokhia and Genyokhia, as well as some other territories. Between 120 and 63 BC, Armenia's ally Mithridate VI Eupator of Pontus conquered all of Colchis and incorporated it into his kingdom, embracing almost all of Asia Minor as well as the eastern and northern Black Sea coastal areas. The Roman‚ÄìIranian rivalry and the Roman conquest of Colchis Kingdom of Lazica This close association with Armenia brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC) by the Roman general Pompey, who was then at war with Mithradates VI of Pontus, and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King Pharnavaz II to join their campaign against Caucasian Albania.Braund, D., Georgia in Antiquity: A History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC ‚Äì AD 562, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 36 Ashot Kurapalates, first Bagrationi King of Georgia, 829 AD During this time Armenia and Pontus were actively expanding at the expense of Rome, taking over its Eastern Mediterranean possessions. However, the success of the anti-Roman alliance did not last long. As a result of the Roman campaigns of Pompey and Lucullus from the west, and the Parthian invasion from the south, Armenia lost a significant part of its conquests by 65 BC, devolving into a Roman-Parthian dependency. At the same time, the Kingdom of Pontus was completely destroyed by the Romans and all its territory including Colchis were incorporated into the Roman Empire as her provinces. The former Kingdom of Colchis became the Roman province of Lazicum ruled by Roman legati. The following 600 years of Georgian history were marked by struggle between Rome and neighboring Persia (Iran) ruled subsequently by the Parthians and Sassanids who were fighting long wars against each other for the domination in Western Asia including Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Albania, and Iberia. While the Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, Caucasian Iberia freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at Mtskheta speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58‚Äì106) as \\"the friend of the Caesars\\" and the king \\"of the Roman-loving Iberians.\\" Emperor Vespasian fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Armazi for the Iberian kings in 75 AD. In the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King Pharsman II who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia. In the early 3rd century, Rome had to give up Albania and most of Armenia to Sassanid Persia. The province of Lazicum was given a degree of autonomy that by the end of the century developed into full independence with the formation of a new Kingdom of Lazica-Egrisi on the territories of smaller principalities of the Zans, Svans, Apsyls, and Sanyghs. This new Western Georgian state survived more than 250 years until 562 when it was absorbed by the Byzantine Empire. In the 3rd century AD, the Lazi tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of Lazica, locally known as Egrisi. Colchis was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the Eastern Roman/Byzantine and Sassanid empires, culminating in the Lazic War from 542 to 562. Iberia became a tributary of the Sasanian state during the reign of Shapur I (241‚Äì272). Relations between the two countries seem to have been friendly at first, as Iberia cooperated in Persian campaigns against Rome, and the Iberian king Amazasp III (260‚Äì265) was listed as a high dignitary of the Sasanian realm, not a vassal who had been subdued by force of arms. But the aggressive tendencies of the Sasanians were evident in their propagation of Zoroastrianism, which was probably established in Iberia between the 260s and 290s. However, in the Peace of Nisibis (298) while the Roman empire obtained control of Caucasian Iberia again as a vassal state and acknowledged the reign over all the Caucasian area, it recognized Mirian III, the first of the Chosroid dynasty, as king of Iberia. Adoption of Christianity as state religion David III of Tao, a Georgian prince of the Bagrationi dynasty, 10th century. King Mirian III established Christianity in Georgia as the official state religion in 324. Before Christianization, the cult of Mithras and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Iberia from the 1st century. The cult of Mithras, distinguished by its syncretic character and thus complementary to local cults, especially the cult of the Sun, gradually came to merge with ancient Georgian beliefs.GOCHA R. TSETSKHLADZE \\"Georgia\\" Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, Columbia University retrieved July 2, 2007 The eastern Georgian Kingdom of Iberia became one of the first states in the world to convert to Christianity in 327,Theodor Dowling, Sketches of Georgian Church History, New York, 1912, p 37Charles Burney and David Marshal Lang, The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus, p. 22Allen, W.E.D.: A History of the Georgian People, 1932, p. 64 when the King of Iberia Mirian III established it as the official state religion. However, the date varies based on numerous accounts and historical documents, which indicate Iberia adopting Christianity as a state religion in 317,History of the Christian Church in Georgia, Besiki Sisauri, p. 34 319,The Church Triumphant: A History of Christianity Up to 1300, E.

By the middle of the 4th century though, both Lazica (formerly the Kingdom of Colchis) and Iberia adopted Christianity as their official religion. This adoption of Christianity tied the kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, which exerted strong cultural influence over it. However, after the emperor Julian was slain during his failed campaign in Persia in 363, Rome ceded control of Iberia to Persia, and King Varaz-Bakur I (Asphagur) (363-365) became a Persian vassal, an outcome confirmed by the Peace of Acilisene in 387. However, a later ruler of Kartli, Pharsman IV (406-409), preserved his country's autonomy and ceased to pay tribute to Persia. Persia prevailed, and Sassanian kings began to appoint a viceroy (pitiaxae/bidaxae) to keep watch on their vassal. They eventually made the office hereditary in the ruling house of Lower Kartli, thus inaugurating the Kartli pitiaxate, which brought an extensive territory under its control. Although it remained a part of the kingdom of Kartli, its viceroys turned their domain into a center of Persian influence. Sasanian rulers put the Christianity of the Georgians to a severe test. They promoted the teachings of Zoroaster, and by the middle of the 5th century Zoroastrianism had become a second official religion in eastern Georgia alongside Christianity. During the 4th and most of the 5th centuries, Iberia (known also as the Kingdom of Kartli) was under Persian control. At the end of the 5th century though, Prince Vakhtang I Gorgasali orchestrated an anti-Persian uprising and restored Iberian statehood, proclaiming himself the King. After this, the armies of Vakhtang launched several campaigns against both Persia and the Byzantine Empire. However, his struggle for the independence and unity of the Georgian state did not have lasting success. After Vakhtang's death in 502, and the short reign of his son Dachi (502‚Äì514), Iberia was reincorporated into Persia as a province once again The Kingdom of Iberia however was abolished in 580 AD by the Persian authorities at that time ruled by Hormizd IV (578-590), most precisely after the death of King Bakur III, and Iberia became now a Persian province ruled by a marzpan (governor). However this time the Iberian nobility were granted the privilege of electing the governors, who in Georgian were called erismtavari. Georgian nobles urged the Byzantine emperor Maurice to revive the kingdom of Iberia in 582, but in 591 Byzantium and Persia decisively agreed to divide Iberia between them, with Tbilisi to be in Persian hands and Mtskheta to be under Byzantine control. By the late 7th century, the Byzantine-Persian rivalry for the Middle East had given way to Arab conquest of the region and subsequent invasions to ensure Arab hegemony in the Caucasus. Medieval Georgia Unification of the Georgian state First King of United Georgia Bagrat III of Georgia from the royal Bagrationi dynasty. Bedia Cup of King Bagrat III of Georgia, 999 AD In struggle against the Arab occupation, Bagrationi dynasty came to rule over Tao-Klarjeti and established Kouropalatate of Iberia as a nominal dependency under the Byzantine Empire. The restoration of the Georgian kingship begins in AD 888, when Adarnase IV took the title of \\"King of Iberians\\". However, the Bagrationi dynasty failed to maintain the integrity of their kingdom which was actually divided between the three branches of the family with the main branch retaining Tao and another controlling Klarjeti. At the end of the 10th century Curopalate David of Tao invaded the Earldom of Iberia (Kartli) and gave it to his foster-son Bagrat III and installed Gurgen as his regent, who was later crowned as \\"King of Kings of the Iberians\\" on the death of Bagrat the Simple (994). Through his fortunate bloodlines Bagrat was destined to sit upon two thrones. Furthermore, through his mother Gurandukht, sister of the childless Abkhazian king Theodosius III, Bagrat was a potential heir to the realm of Abkhazia. Three years later, after the death of Theodosius III, Bagrat III inherited the Abkhazian throne. In 1008, Gurgen died, and Bagrat succeeded him as \\"King of the Iberians\\", becoming thus the first King of a unified realm of Abkhazia and Iberia. After he had secured his patrimony, Bagrat proceeded to press a claim to the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti and annexed it in or around 1010, after two years of fighting and aggressive diplomacy. Bagrat‚Äôs reign, a period of uttermost importance in the history of Georgia, brought about the final victory of the Georgian Bagratids in the centuries-long power struggles. Anxious to create more stable and centralized monarchy, Bagrat eliminated or at least diminished the autonomy of the dynastic princes. In his eyes, the most possible internal danger came from the Klarjeti line of the Bagrationi. Although seem to have acknowledged Bagrat‚Äôs authority, they continued to be styled as Kings, and Sovereigns of Klarjeti. To secure the succession to his son, George I, Bagrat lured his cousins, on pretext of a reconciliatory meeting, to the Panaskerti Castle, and threw them in prison in 1010. Bagrat‚Äôs foreign policy was generally peaceful and the king successfully manoeuvred to avoid the conflicts with both the Byzantine and Muslim neighbours even though David's domains of Tao remained in the Byzantine and Tbilisi in the Arab hands.  Between Seljuqs and Byzantines  The construction of Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was initiated in the 1020s by George I. The major political and military event during George I‚Äôs reign, a war against the Byzantine Empire, had its roots back to the 990s, when the Georgian prince Curopalate David of Tao, following his abortive rebellion against Emperor Basil II, had to agree to cede his extensive possessions in Tao and the neighbouring lands to the emperor on his death. All the efforts by David‚Äôs stepson and George‚Äôs father, Bagrat III, to prevent these territories from being annexed to the empire went in vain. Young and ambitious, George launched a campaign to restore the Kuropalates‚Äô succession to Georgia and occupied Tao in 1015‚Äì1016. Byzantines were at that time involved in a relentless war with the Bulgarian Empire, limiting their actions to the west. But as soon as Bulgaria was conquered, Basil II led his army against Georgia (1021). An exhausting war lasted for two years, and ended in a decisive Byzantine victory, forcing George to agree to a peace treaty, in which he had not only to abandon his claims to Tao, but to surrender several of his southwestern possessions to Basil, and to give his three-year-old son, Bagrat IV, as hostage. Georgia during the Roman Empire, 1045 AD The young child Bagrat IV spent the next three years in the imperial capital of Constantinople and was released in 1025. After George I's death in 1027, Bagrat, aged eight, succeeded to the throne. By the time Bagrat IV became king, the Bagratids‚Äô drive to complete the unification of all Georgian lands had gained irreversible momentum. The kings of Georgia sat at Kutaisi in western Georgia from which they ran all of what had been the Kingdom of Abkhazia and a greater portion of Iberia; Tao had been lost to the Byzantines while a Muslim emir remained in Tbilisi and the kings of Kakheti-Hereti obstinately defended their autonomy in easternmost Georgia. Furthermore, the loyalty of great nobles to the Georgian crown was far from stable. During Bagrat‚Äôs minority, the regency had advanced the positions of the high nobility whose influence he subsequently tried to limit when he assumed full ruling powers. Simultaneously, the Georgian crown was confronted with two formidable external foes: the Byzantine Empire and the resurgent Seljuq Turks. The Seljuk threat prompted the Georgian and Byzantine governments to seek a closer cooperation. To secure the alliance, Bagrat‚Äôs daughter Mart‚Äôa (Maria)married, at some point between 1066 and 1071, the Byzantine co-emperor Michael VII Ducas. = Great Seljuk invasion = The second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the Seljuq Turks, who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast empire including most of Central Asia and Persia. The Seljuqs made their first appearances in Georgia in the 1060s, when the sultan Alp Arslan laid waste to the south-western provinces of the Georgian kingdom and reduced Kakheti. These intruders were part of the same wave of the Turkish movement which inflicted a crushing defeat on the Byzantine army at Manzikert in 1071. Although the Georgians were able to recover from Alp Arslan's invasion by securing the Tao (Theme of Iberia), a frontier region which had been a bone of contention between Georgia and the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine withdrawal from Anatolia brought them in more direct contact with the Seljuqs. Following the 1073 devastation of Kartli by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan, George II successfully repelled an invasion. In 1076, the Seljuk sultan Malik Shah I surged into Georgia and reduced many settlements to ruins. Harassed by the massive Turkic influx, known in Georgian history as the Great Turkish Invasion, from 1079/80 onward, George was pressured into submitting to Malik-Shah to ensure a precious degree of peace at the price of an annual tribute. King David IV the Builder and Georgian Reconquista David the Builder, one of Georgia's greatest kings. Kingdom of Georgia during King David the Builder in 1124. The struggle against the Seljuq invaders in Georgia was led by the young King David IV of the Bagrationi royal family, who inherited the throne in 1089 at the age of 16 after the abdication of his father George II Bagrationi. Soon after coming to power, David created the regular army and peasant militia in order to be able to resist Seljuq colonization of his country. The First Crusade (1096‚Äì1099) and the Crusaders' offensive against the Seljuq Turks in Anatolia and Syria favored David's successful campaigns in Georgia. By the end of 1099 David had stopped paying tribute to the Seljuqs and had liberated most of the Georgian lands, with the exception of Tbilisi and Hereti. In 1103 he reorganized the Georgian Orthodox Church and closely linked it with the state by appointing as Catholicos (Archbishop) a Crown Chancellor (Mtsihnobart Ukhutsesi) of Georgia. In 1103‚Äì1105 the Georgian army took over Hereti and made successful raids into still Seljuq-controlled Shirvan. Between 1110 and 1118 David took Lori, Samshvilde, Rustavi and other fortresses of lower Kartli and Tashiri, thus turning Tbilisi into an isolated Seljuq enclave. Flag of Georgia during the reign of David the Builder In 1118‚Äì1119, having considerable amounts of free, unsettled land as a result of the withdrawal of Turkish nomads, and desperately needing qualified manpower for the army, King David invited some 40,000 Kipchak warriors from North Caucasus to settle in Georgia with their families. In 1120 the ruler of Alania recognized himself as King David's vassal and afterwards sent thousands of Alans to cross the main Caucasus range into Georgia, where they settled in Kartli. The Georgian Royal army also welcomed mercenaries from Germany, Italy, and Scandinavia (all those westerners were defined in Georgia as \\"the Franks\\") as well as from Kievan Rus. Queen Tamar of Georgia and her father King George III of Georgia (restored fresco from the Betania monastery) In 1121, the Seljuq Sultan Mahmud declared Jihad on Georgia and sent a strong army under one of his famous generals Ilghazi to fight the Georgians. Although significantly outnumbered by the Turks, the Georgians managed to defeat the invaders at the Battle of Didgori, and in 1122 they took over Tbilisi, making it Georgia's capital. Three years later the Georgians conquered Shirvan. As a result, the mostly Christian-populated Ghishi-Kabala area in western Shirvan (a relic of the once prosperous Albanian Kingdom) was annexed by Georgia while the rest of already Islamicized Shirvan became Georgia's client-state. In the same year a large portion of Armenia was liberated by David's troops and fell into Georgian hands as well. Thus in 1124 David also became the King of Armenians, incorporating Northern Armenia into the lands of the Georgian Crown. In 1125 King David died, leaving Georgia with the status of a strong regional power. In Georgia, King David is called Agmashenebeli (English: the builder). David Agmashenebeli's successors (Kings Demeter I, David V and George III) continued the policy of Georgia's expansion by subordinating most of the mountain clans and tribes of North Caucasia and further securing Georgian positions in Shirvan. However, the most glorious sovereign of Georgia of that period was Queen Tamar (David's great-granddaughter). Queen Tamar the Great and the Golden Age (1184‚Äì1213) Queen Tamar of Georgia, titled as \\"Mepe\\" (King). The reign of Queen Tamar represented the peak of Georgia's might in the whole history of the nation. In 1194‚Äì1204, Tamar's armies crushed new Turkish invasions from the south-east and south and launched several successful campaigns into Turkish-controlled Southern Armenia. As a result, most of Southern Armenia, including the cities of Karin, Erzinjan, Khelat, Mu≈ü and Van, came under Georgian control. Although it was not included in the lands of the Georgian Crown, and was left under the nominal rule of local Turkish Emirs and Sultans, Southern Armenia became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Georgia. Kingdom of Georgia during its Golden Age. Georgian Empire The temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 to the Crusaders left Georgia and Bulgarian Empire as the strongest Christian states in the whole East Mediterranean area. The same year Queen Tamar sent her troops to take over the former Byzantine Lazona and Paryadria with the cities of Atina, Riza, Trebizond, Kerasunt, Amysos, Cotyora, Heraclea and Sinopa. In 1205, the occupied territory was transformed into the Empire of Trebizond, which was dependent on Georgia. Tamar's relative Prince Alexios Komnenos was crowned as its Emperor. In the immediate years after, Georgian armies invaded northern Persia (modern day Iranian Azerbaijan) and took the cities of Marand, Tabriz (1208), Ardabil (1208), Zanjan, Khoy (1210), and Qazvin (1210), placing part of the conquered territory under a Georgian protectorate. This was the maximum territorial extent of Georgia throughout her history. Queen Tamar was addressed as \\"The Queen of Abkhazians, Kartvels, Rans, Kakhs and Armenians, Shirvan-Shakhine and Shakh-in-Shakhine, The Sovereign of the East and West\\". Georgian historians often refer to her as \\"Queen Tamar the Great\\". The period between the early 12th and the early 13th centuries, and especially the era of Tamar the Great, can truly be considered as the golden age of Georgia. Besides the political and military achievements, it was marked by the development of Georgian culture, including architecture, literature, philosophy and sciences. Mongol invasion and decline of the Georgian Kingdom Luarsab II In the 1220s, the South Caucasus and Asia Minor faced the invasion of the Mongols. In spite of fierce resistance by Georgian-Armenian forces and their allies, the whole area including most of Georgia, all Armenian lands and Central Anatolia eventually fell to the Mongols. In 1243, Queen Rusudan of Georgia signed a peace treaty with the Mongols in accordance with which Georgia lost her client-states, ceded western Shirvan, Nakhichevan and some other territories and agreed to pay tribute to the Mongols as well as to let them occupy and de facto rule more than half of the remaining territory. Although Mongol-occupied Tbilisi remained an official capital of the kingdom, the Queen refused to return there and stayed in Kutaisi until her death in 1245. In addition to all the above hardships, even the part of the kingdom that remained free of the Mongols started disintegrating: The Crown started losing control over the warlords of Samtskhe (southern provinces of Georgia) who established their own relations with the Mongols and by the year 1266 practically seceded from Georgia. The period between 1259 and 1330 was marked by the struggle of the Georgians against the Mongol Ilkhanate for full independence. The first anti- Mongol uprising started in 1259 under the leadership of King David Narin who in fact waged his war for almost thirty years. The Anti-Mongol strife went on under the Kings Demeter II (1270‚Äì1289) and David VIII (1293‚Äì1311). Finally, it was King George the Brilliant (1314‚Äì1346) who managed to play on the decline of the Ilkhanate, stopped paying tribute to the Mongols, restored the pre-1220 state borders of Georgia, and returned the Empire of Trebizond into Georgia's sphere of influence. In 1386‚Äì1403, the Kingdom of Georgia faced eight Turco- Mongolic invasions under the leadership of Tamerlane. Except in Abkhazia and Svaneti, the invasions devastated Georgia's economy, population, and urban centers. Early modern period Ottoman and Iranian domination Georgian Kingdom just before fragmentation, 1460 In the 15th century the whole area changed dramatically in all possible aspects: linguistic, cultural, political, etc. During that period the Kingdom of Georgia turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, a relic of the faded East Roman epoch surrounded by a Muslim, predominantly Turco-Iranian world. During the three subsequent centuries, the Georgian rulers maintained their perilous autonomy as subjects under the Turkish Ottoman and Iranian Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar domination, although sometimes serving as little more than puppets in the hands of their powerful suzerains. By the middle of the 15th century, most of Georgia's old neighbor-states disappeared from the map within less than a hundred years. The fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 sealed the Black Sea and cut the remnants of Christian states of the area from Europe and the rest of the Christian world. Georgia remained connected to the West through contact with the Genoese colonies of the Crimea. As a result of these changes, the Georgian Kingdom suffered economic and political decline and in the 1460s the kingdom fractured into several kingdoms and principalities:Suny, pp. 45‚Äì46 *3 Kingdoms of Kartli, Kakheti and Imereti. *5 Principalities of Guria, Svaneti, Meskheti, Abkhazeti and Samegrelo. Georgia after the dissolution of the unified state, 1490 By the late 15th century the Ottoman Empire was encroaching on the Georgian states from the west and in 1501 a new Muslim power, Safavid Iran, arose to the east. For the next few centuries, Georgia would become a battleground between these two great rival powers and the Georgian states would struggle to maintain their independence by various means. Ottoman and Safavid Iranian encroachments started for the Ottomans in the late 15th century, and for the Safavids in the earliest 16th century in which the latter managed to make eastern Georgia a vassal in 1500. In 1555, the Ottomans and the Safavids signed the Peace of Amasya following the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1532‚Äì55), defining spheres of influence in Georgia, assigning Imereti in the west to the Turks and Kartli-Kakheti in the east to the Persians. The treaty however, was not in force for long as the Ottomans gained the upper hand and launched campaigns during the next Ottoman-Safavid war threatening to end the Persian domination in the region. The Safavid Persians reestablished their hegemony over all lost regions some two decades later including full hegemony over most of Georgia in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1603‚Äì18).Prof.Ya≈üar Y√ºcel-Prof Ali Sevim:T√ºrkiye tarihi vol.III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1991, 43-44 After the Ottomans utter failure to gain permanent foothold in the eastern Caucasus, Iranians immediately sought to strengthen their position and finally subject the rebellious Kingdoms of Eastern Georgia and making them integral parts of the empire. During the next 150 years as Persian subjects, various Georgian kings and nobles rose into rebellion, while at many other times political activity was nothing but dormant, and many kings and aristocrats fully accepted Persian overlordship and converted to Islam as well, for greater boons from their Iranian Shahs. On the maternal side of the Safavid (also Qajar) and the Ottoman Turkish dynasty, many members were from Georgian aristocratic or different lines.Aptin Khanbaghi (2006) The Fire, the Star and the Cross: Minority Religions in Medieval and Early. London & New York. IB Tauris. , pp. 130-1 In the early 17th century Shah Abbas I made a punitive campaign into his Georgian territories after being informed that Teimuraz I of Kakheti with a couple of Christian citizens assaulted the Karabakh governor and killed him. Shah Abbas decided to confront him but Teimuraz I fled to Georgia towards Ahmed I, in order to shelter from Safavid forces. This event brought an end to the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha signed between the Ottomans and the Safavids. In 1616, Abbas I dispatched his troops to Georgia. He aimed to suppress the Georgian revolt in Tbilisi, however the Safavid soldiers met heavy resistance by the citizens of Tbilisi. Enraged, Shah Abbas ordered a massacre of the public. A large number of Georgian soldiers and people were killed and as many as between 130,000Eskandar Beg, pp. 900-901, tr. Savory, II, p. 1116 and 200,000Malek≈°ƒÅh ·∏§osayn, p. 509 Georgians from Kakheti were deported to Persia.Stalin and the Turkish Crisis of the Cold War, 1945-1953, by Jamil Hasanli, 2011, p.167 During the same conflict, Teimuraz sent the Queen mother, Ketevan, as a negotiator to Abbas, but in an act of revenge for the recalcitrance of Teimuraz, he ordered the queen to renounce Christianity, and upon her refusal, had her tortured to death.Suny, pp. 46‚Äì52 By the 17th century, both eastern and western Georgia had sunk into poverty as the result of the constant warfare. The economy was so bad that barter replaced the use of money and the populations of the cities declined markedly. The French traveller Jean Chardin, who visited the region of Mingrelia in 1671, noted the wretchedness of the peasants, the arrogance of the nobles and the ignorance of the clergy.Suny p.52 The various rulers in Georgia were thus often split between acknowledging Ottoman or Iranian overlordship (which often entailed nominal conversion to Islam) or making a bid for independence. The emergence of a third imperial power to the north, Christian Russia, made the latter an increasingly tempting choice. The 18th and 19th century: from a mainly Iranian-centred theatre to Russian annexation Solomon I In the early 18th century, Kartli, the most politically dominant region of all Georgian areas, saw a partial recovery under Vakhtang VI, who instituted a new law code and tried to improve the economy. His reign saw the establishment of the first Georgian-language printing press in 1709.Assatiani and Bendianachvili p.209 King Erekle II Following a civil war and the resulting chaos that happened in the whole Safavid Empire after its disintegration and overthrow, the Ottomans and Russians decided to divide large parts of Persia in the Treaty of Constantinople (1724). Georgia got divided by the two. Following Persia's quick resurgence under Nader Shah of Iran, the Ottomans were ousted from Kakheti and the rest of Georgia in 1735 by Nader after two years of rule, which resulted in the quick reestablishment of Persian rule over this time almost all of Georgia. Teimuraz sided with the Persians and was installed as a Persian wali (governor) in neighboring Kartli. However, many Georgian nobles refused to accept the new regime and rose in rebellion in response to heavy tribute levied by Nader Shah upon the Georgian provinces. Nonetheless, Teimuraz and Heraclius remained loyal to the shah, partly in order to prevent the comeback of the rival Mukhrani branch, whose fall early in the 1720s had opened the way to Teimuraz‚Äôs accession in Kartli. He then served as a lieutenant to his father and assumed the regency when Teimuraz was briefly summoned for consultations in the Persian capital of Isfahan in 1744. In the meantime, Heraclius defeated a coup attempt by the rival Georgian prince Abdullah Beg of the Mukhrani dynasty, and helped Teimuraz suppress the aristocratic opposition to the Persian hegemony led by Givi Amilakhvari. As a reward, Nader Shah granted the kingship of Kartli to Teimuraz and of Kakheti to Heraclius, and also arranged the marriage of his nephew Ali-Qoli Khan, who eventually would succeed him as Adil Shah, to Teimuraz‚Äôs daughter Kethevan. Yet, both Georgian kingdoms remained under heavy Persian tribute until Nader Shah was assassinated in 1747. Teimuraz and Heraclius took advantage of the ensuing political instability in Persia to assert their independence and expelled Persian garrisons from all key positions in Georgia, including Tbilisi. In close cooperation with each other, they managed to prevent a new revolt by the Mukhranian supporters fomented by Ebrahim Khan, brother of Adel Shah, in 1748. They concluded an anti-Persian alliance with the khans of Azerbaijan who were particularly vulnerable to the aggression from Persian warlords and agreed to recognize Heraclius‚Äôs supremacy in eastern Transcaucasia. In 1752, the Georgian kings sent a mission to Russia to request 3,000 Russian troops or a subsidy to enable them to hire Circassian mercenaries in order to invade Persia and install a pro-Russian government there. The embassy failed to yield any results, however, for the Russian court was preoccupied with European affairs. In 1762, Teimuraz II died while on a diplomatic mission to the court of St. Petersburg, and Heraclius succeeded him as King of Kartli, thus uniting eastern Georgia politically for the first time in three centuries. Erekle II, king of unified Kartli-Kakheti from 1762 to 1798, managed to unify east Georgia politically for the first time in three centuries. He turned towards Russia for protection against Ottoman and most notably Persian attacks. The Russian empress Catherine the Great was keen to have the Georgians as allies in her wars against the Turks, but sent only meagre forces to help them.Suny pp.57-58 In 1769-1772, a handful of Russian troops under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben fought against Turks in Imereti. The Russian troops retreated before a clash against the Turks. In 1783 Erekle signed the Treaty of Georgievsk with Russia, according to which Kartli-Kakheti got established as a protectorate of Russia, which guaranteed Georgia's territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagrationi dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs.Anchabadze, George, Ph.D. History of Georgia. Georgia in the Beginning of Feudal Decomposition. (XVIII cen.). Retrieved 5 April 2012. The treaty therefore confirmed that Georgia abjured any form of dependence on Persia (who had been the suzerains of most of Georgia for centuries) or another power, and every new Georgian monarch would require the confirmation and investiture of the Russian tsar, and have no diplomatic communications with other nations without Russia's prior consent. But when another Russo- Turkish War broke out in 1787, Erekle maintained diplomatic contacts with Ottoman liege Suleiman pasha from Akhaltsikhe and signed a separate treaty with him. This treaty was ratified by the sultan in the summer of 1787. Therefore, the Russians withdrew their troops from the region for use elsewhere, leaving Erekle's kingdom unprotected. In 1795, the new Persian shah, Agha Mohammed Khan, infuriated with the Treaty of Georgievsk which he saw as an act of treason, invaded the country and captured and burnt the capital, Tbilisi, to the ground,Suny, pp. 58‚Äì59 reestablishing Persian rule over Georgia. In spite of failure to honour the terms of the Treaty of Georgievsk, Georgian rulers felt they had nobody else to turn to. After Erekle's death, a civil war broke out over the succession to the throne of Kartli-Kakheti and one of the rival candidates called on Russia to intervene and decide matters. On January 8, 1801, Tsar Paul I of Russia signed a decree on the incorporation of Georgia (Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire,Gvosdev (2000), p. 85Avalov (1906), p. 186 which was confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on September 12, 1801.Gvosdev (2000), p. 86Lang (1957), p. 249 The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg, Garsevan Chavchavadze, reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor Alexander Kurakin.Lang (1957), p. 251 In May 1801 Russian General Carl Heinrich Knorring dethroned the Georgian heir to the throne David Batonishvili and deployed a government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lasarev.Lang (1957), p. 247 By this, Persia officially lost control over the city and the wider Georgian lands it had been ruling for centuries. A part of the Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until April 1802 when General Knorring compassed the nobility in Tbilisi's Sioni Cathedral and forced them to take an oath on the imperial crown of Russia. Those who disagreed were arrested temporarily.Lang (1957), p. 252 In the summer of 1805 Russian troops on the river Askerani and near Zagam defeated the Qajar Persian army during the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) led by Fath-Ali Shah Qajar who sought to regain full control over Georgia and Dagestan, saving Tbilisi from its attack. Russian suzerainty over Persia's traditionally eastern and southern Georgian ruled territories were nominally finalized in 1813 in the Treaty of Gulistan. In 1810, the kingdom of Imereti (Western Georgia) was annexed by the Russian Empire after the suppression of King Solomon II's resistance.Anchabadze (2005), p. 29 From 1803 to 1878, as a result of numerous Russian wars against Turkey and Persia, several formerly Georgian territories were annexed to the Russian Empire. These areas (Batumi, Artvin, Akhaltsikhe, Poti, and Abkhazia) now represent the majority of the territory of the present state of Georgia. Georgia was reunified for the first time in centuries but had lost its independence. Modern history Russian Empire Georgian noble family The Russian and Georgian societies had much in common: the main religion was Orthodox Christianity and in both countries a land-owning aristocracy ruled over a population of serfs. The Russian authorities aimed to integrate Georgia into the rest of their empire, but at first Russian rule proved high-handed, arbitrary and insensitive to local law and customs, leading to a conspiracy by Georgian nobles in 1832 and a revolt by peasants and nobles in Guria in 1841.Suny pp. 70‚Äì73 Things changed with the appointment of Mikhail Vorontsov as Viceroy of the Caucasus in 1845. Count Vorontsov's new policies, alleged by himself, won over the Georgian nobility, who became increasingly eager to abandon Islamic influences that had been forced upon Georgia in the preceding centuries and pursued, after the example of Russian nobility, a long-sought process of Europeanisation. Life for Georgian serfs was very different, however, since the rural economy remained seriously depressed. Georgian serfs lived in dire poverty, subject to the frequent threat of starvation. Few of them lived in the towns, where what little trade and industry there was, was in the hands of Armenians, whose ancestors had migrated to Georgia in the Middle Ages. Serfdom was abolished in Russian lands in 1861. The tsar also wanted to emancipate the serfs of Georgia, but without losing the loyalty of the nobility whose revenues depended on peasant labour. This called for delicate negotiations before serfdom was gradually phased out in the Georgian provinces from 1864 onwards. =Growth of the national movement= Prince Ilia Chavchavadze, leader of the Georgian national revival in the 1860s. The emancipation of the serfs pleased neither the serfs nor the nobles. The poverty of the serfs had not been alleviated while the nobles had lost some of their privileges. The nobles in particular also felt threatened by the growing power of the urban, Armenian middle class in Georgia, who prospered as capitalism came to the region. Georgian dissatisfaction with Tsarist autocracy and Armenian economic domination Stephen Jones, Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy 1883‚Äì1917, p. 8 led to the development of a national liberation movement in the second half of the 19th century. A large-scale peasant revolt occurred in 1905, which led to political reforms that eased the tensions for a period. During this time, the Marxist Social Democratic Party became the dominant political movement in Georgia, being elected to all the Georgian seats in the Russian State Duma established after 1905. Josef Vissarionovich Djugashvili (more famously known as Joseph Stalin), a Georgian Bolshevik, became a leader of the revolutionary (and anti- Menshevik) movement in Georgia. He went on to control the Soviet Union. Prince Akaki Tsereteli, prominent Georgian poet and national liberation movement figure. Many Georgians were upset by the loss of independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The Russian clergy took control of Georgian churches and monasteries, prohibiting use of the Georgian liturgy and desecrating medieval Georgian frescos on various churches all across Georgia.Dowling, Sketches from Georgian Church History, London 1912 Between the years of 1855 to 1907, the Georgian patriotic movement was launched under the leadership of Prince Ilia Chavchavadze, world-renowned poet, novelist and orator. Chavchavadze financed new Georgian schools and supported the Georgian national theatre. In 1866 he launched the newspaper Iveria, which played an important part in reviving Georgian national consciousness. His struggle for national awakening was welcomed by the leading Georgian intellectuals of that time such as Giorgi Tsereteli, Ivane Machabeli, Akaki Tsereteli, Niko Nikoladze, Alexander Kazbegi and Iakob Gogebashvili. The Georgian intelligentsia's support for Prince Chavchavadze and Georgian independence is shown in this declaration: The last decades of the 19th century witnessed a Georgian literary revival in which writers emerged of a stature unequalled since the Golden Age of Rustaveli seven hundred years before. Ilia Chavchavadze himself excelled alike in lyric and ballad poetry, in the novel, the short story and the essay. Apart from Chavchavadze, the most universal literary genius of the age was Akaki Tsereteli, known as \\"the immortal nightingale of the Georgian people.\\" Along with Niko Nikoladze and Iakob Gogebashvili, these literary figures contributed significantly to the national cultural revival and were therefore known as the founding fathers of modern Georgia. Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918‚Äì1921) Members of the National Council of Georgia, after declaring independence of Georgia, Tbilisi May 26, 1918 The Russian Revolution of October 1917 plunged Russia into a bloody civil war during which several outlying Russian territories declared independence. Georgia was one of them, proclaiming the establishment of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG) on May 26, 1918. The new country was ruled by the Menshevik faction of the Social Democratic Party, which established a multi-party system in sharp contrast with the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" established by the Bolsheviks in Russia. It was recognised by Soviet Russia (Treaty of Moscow (1920)) and the major Western powers in 1921 =Georgian‚ÄìArmenian War (1918)= The Democratic Republic of Georgia before its conquest by the Soviet Union. During the final stages of World War I, the Armenians and Georgians had been defending against the advance of the Ottoman Empire. In June 1918, in order to forestall an Ottoman advance on Tiflis, the Georgian troops controlled the Lori Province, which had an overwhelming Armenian population. After the Armistice of Mudros and the withdrawal of the Ottomans, the Georgian forces remained. Georgian Menshevik parliamentarian Irakli Tsereteli offered that the Armenians would be safer from the Turks as Georgian citizens. The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus in order to resolve the issue, which the Armenians rejected. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of Uzunlar in the Lori region. Within days, hostilities commenced between the two republics.Armenia: the Survival of a Nation, Christopher Walker pp. 267‚Äì268 The Georgian‚ÄìArmenian War was a border war fought in 1918 between the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the Democratic Republic of Armenia over the parts of then disputed provinces of Lori, Javakheti, which had been historically bicultural Armenian-Georgian territories, but were largely populated by Armenians in the 19th century. =Red Army invasion (1921)= In February 1921, the Red Army invaded Georgia and after a short war occupied the country. The Georgian government was forced to flee. Guerrilla resistance in 1921-1924 was followed by a large-scale patriotic uprising in August 1924. Colonel Kakutsa Cholokashvili was one of the most prominent guerrilla leaders in this phase. Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (1921‚Äì1990) Georgian SSR in 1957‚Äì1991, including Abkhazian Autonomous SSR, Adjara ASSR, and South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. During the Georgian Affair of 1922, Georgia was forcibly incorporated into the Transcaucasian SFSR comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia (including Abkhazia and South Ossetia). The Soviet Government forced Georgia to cede several areas to Turkey (the province of Tao-Klarjeti and part of Batumi province), Azerbaijan (the province of Hereti/Saingilo), Armenia (the Lore region) and Russia (northeastern corner of Khevi, eastern Georgia). Soviet rule was harsh: about 50,000 people were executed and killed in 1921-1924, more than 150,000 were purged under Stalin and his secret police chief, the Georgian Lavrenty Beria in 1935-1938, 1942 and 1945-1951\\\\. In 1936, the TFSSR was dissolved and Georgia became the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. Reaching the Caucasus oilfields was one of the main objectives of Adolf Hitler's invasion of the USSR in June 1941, but the armies of the Axis powers did not get as far as Georgia. The country contributed almost 700,000 fighters (350,000 were killed) to the Red Army, and was a vital source of textiles and munitions. However, a number of Georgians fought on the side of the German armed forces, forming the Georgian Legion. During this period Stalin ordered the deportation of the Chechen, Ingush, Karachay and the Balkarian peoples from the Northern Caucasus; they were transported to Siberia and Central Asia for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. He abolished their respective autonomous republics. The Georgian SSR was briefly granted some of their territory until 1957. Stalin's successful appeal for patriotic unity eclipsed Georgian nationalism during the war and diffused it in the years following. On March 9, 1956, about a hundred Georgian students were killed when they demonstrated against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinization. The decentralisation program introduced by Khrushchev in the mid-1950s was soon exploited by Georgian Communist Party officials to build their own regional power base. A thriving pseudo-capitalist shadow economy emerged alongside the official state-owned economy. While the official growth rate of the economy of the Georgia was among the lowest in the USSR, such indicators as savings level, rates of car and house ownership were the highest in the Union,Gregory Grossman, \\"The 'Second Economy' of the USSR\\", Problems of Communism, vol. 26 no. 5, 1977, quoted from Cornell, Svante E., Autonomy and Conflict: Ethnoterritoriality and Separatism in the South Caucasus ‚Äì Case in Georgia . Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Report No. 61. p. 149. University of Uppsala, . making Georgia one of the most economically successful Soviet republics. Corruption was at a high level. Among all the union republics, Georgia had the highest number of residents with high or special secondary education. Although corruption was hardly unknown in the Soviet Union, it became so widespread and blatant in Georgia that it came to be an embarrassment to the authorities in Moscow. Eduard Shevardnadze, the country's interior minister between 1964 and 1972, gained a reputation as a fighter of corruption and engineered the removal of Vasil Mzhavanadze, the corrupt First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze ascended to the post of First Secretary with the blessings of Moscow. He was an effective and able ruler of Georgia from 1972 to 1985, improving the official economy and dismissing hundreds of corrupt officials. Photos of the April 9, 1989 Massacre victims (mostly young women) on billboard in Tbilisi Soviet power and Georgian nationalism clashed in 1978 when Moscow ordered revision of the constitutional status of the Georgian language as Georgia's official state language. Bowing to pressure from mass street demonstrations on April 14, 1978, Moscow approved Shevardnadze's reinstatement of the constitutional guarantee the same year. April 14 was established as a Day of the Georgian Language. Shevardnadze's appointment as Soviet Foreign Minister in 1985 brought his replacement in Georgia by Jumber Patiashvili, a conservative and generally ineffective Communist who coped poorly with the challenges of perestroika. Towards the end of the late 1980s, increasingly violent clashes occurred between the Communist authorities, the resurgent Georgian nationalist movement and nationalist movements in Georgia's minority- populated regions (notably South Ossetia). On April 9, 1989, Soviet troops were used to break up a peaceful demonstration at the government building in Tbilisi. Twenty Georgians were killed and hundreds wounded and poisoned. The event radicalised Georgian politics, prompting many‚Äîeven some Georgian communists‚Äîto conclude that independence was preferable to continued Soviet rule. Independent Georgia =Gamsakhurdia presidency (1991‚Äì1992)= Leaders of Georgian independence movement in late 80s, Zviad Gamsakhurdia (left) and Merab Kostava (right) Opposition pressure on the communist government was manifested in popular demonstrations and strikes, which ultimately resulted in an open, multiparty and democratic parliamentary election being held on 28 October 1990 in which the Round Table/Free Georgia bloc captured 54 percent of the proportional vote to gain 155 seats out of the 250 up for election, while the communists gained 64 seats and 30 percent of the proportional vote. The leading dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia became the head of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia. On March 31, 1991, Gamsakhurdia wasted no time in organising a referendum on independence, which was approved by 98.9% of the votes. Formal independence from the Soviet Union was declared on April 9, 1991, although it took some time before it was widely recognised by outside powers such as the United States and European countries. Gamsakhurdia's government strongly opposed any vestiges of Russian dominance, such as the remaining Soviet military bases in the republic, and (after the dissolution of the Soviet Union) his government declined to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Gamsakhurdia was elected president on May 26, 1991, with 86% of the vote. He was subsequently widely criticised for what was perceived to be an erratic and authoritarian style of government, with nationalists and reformists joining forces in an uneasy anti-Gamsakhurdia coalition. A tense situation was worsened by the large amount of ex-Soviet weaponry available to the quarreling parties and by the growing power of paramilitary groups. The situation came to a head on December 22, 1991, when armed opposition groups launched a violent military coup d'√©tat, besieging Gamsakhurdia and his supporters in government buildings in central Tbilisi. Gamsakhurdia managed to evade his enemies and fled to the breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya in January 1992. =Shevardnadze presidency (1992‚Äì2003)= Eduard Shevardnadze, second President of Georgia (1995‚Äì2003) The new government invited Eduard Shevardnadze to become the head of a State Council‚Äîin effect, president‚Äîin March 1992, putting a moderate face on the somewhat unsavoury regime that had been established following Gamsakhurdia's ouster. In August 1992, a separatist dispute in the Georgian autonomous republic of Abkhazia escalated when government forces and paramilitaries were sent into the area to quell separatist activities. The Abkhaz fought back with help from paramilitaries from Russia's North Caucasus regions and alleged covert support from Russian military stationed in a base in Gudauta, Abkhazia and in September 1993 the government forces suffered a catastrophic defeat, which led to them being driven out and the entire Georgian population of the region being expelled. Around 14,000 people died and another 300,000 were forced to flee. Ethnic violence also flared in South Ossetia but was eventually quelled, although at the cost of several hundred casualties and 100,000 refugees fleeing into Russian North Ossetia. In south-western Georgia, the autonomous republic of Ajaria came under the control of Aslan Abashidze, who managed to rule his republic from 1991 to 2004 as a personal fiefdom in which the Tbilisi government had little influence. On September 24, 1993, in the wake of the Abkhaz disaster, Zviad Gamsakhurdia returned from exile to organise an uprising against the government. His supporters were able to capitalise on the disarray of the government forces and quickly overran much of western Georgia. This alarmed Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and units of the Russian Army were sent into Georgia to assist the government. Gamsakhurdia's rebellion quickly collapsed and he died on December 31, 1993, apparently after being cornered by his enemies. In a highly controversial agreement, Shevardnadze's government agreed that it would join the CIS as part of the price for military and political support. Shevardnadze narrowly survived a bomb attack in August 1995 that he blamed on his erstwhile paramilitary allies. He took the opportunity to imprison the paramilitary leader Jaba Ioseliani and ban his Mkhedrioni militia in what was proclaimed as a strike against \\"mafia forces\\". However, his government‚Äîand his own family‚Äîbecame increasingly associated with pervasive corruption that hampered Georgia's economic growth. He won presidential elections in November 1995 and April 2000 with large majorities, but there were persistent allegations of vote-rigging. The Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline project The war in Chechnya caused considerable friction with Russia, which accused Georgia of harbouring Chechen guerrillas. Further friction was caused by Shevardnadze's close relationship with the United States, which saw him as a counterbalance to Russian influence in the strategic Transcaucasus region. Georgia became a major recipient of US foreign and military aid, signed a strategic partnership with NATO and declared an ambition to join both NATO and the EU. In 2002, the United States sent hundreds of Special Operations Forces to train the Military of Georgia‚Äîa programme known as the Georgia Train and Equip Program. Perhaps most significantly, the country secured a $3 billion project for a Caspian- Mediterranean pipeline (Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline) A powerful coalition of reformists headed by Mikheil Saakashvili and Zurab Zhvania united to oppose Shevardnadze's government in the November 2, 2003 parliamentary elections. The elections were widely regarded as blatantly rigged, including by OSCE observers;\\"Georgian parliamentary elections marred by confusion over voter lists\\", OSCE, 3 November 2003; \\"Post-election interim report\\" , OSCE, 25 November 2003 in response, the opposition organised massive demonstrations in the streets of Tbilisi. After two tense weeks, Shevardnadze resigned on November 23, 2003, and was replaced as president on an interim basis by Burjanadze. These results were annulled by the Georgia Supreme Court after the Rose Revolution on November 25, 2003, following allegations of widespread electoral fraud and large public protests, which led to the resignation of Shevardnadze. =Saakashvili presidency (2004‚Äì2013)= Mikheil Saakashvili with George W.

The National Movement ‚Äì Democrats (NMD), the party supporting Mikheil Saakashvili, won 67% of the vote; only the Rightist Opposition (7.6%) also gained parliamentary representation passing the 7% threshold. On January 4, Mikheil Saakashvili won the Georgian presidential election, 2004 with an overwhelming majority of 96% of the votes cast. Constitutional amendments were rushed through Parliament in February strengthening the powers of the President to dismiss Parliament and creating the post of Prime Minister. Zurab Zhvania was appointed Prime Minister. Nino Burjanadze, the interim President, became Speaker of Parliament. ;First term (2004‚Äì2007) The new president faced many problems on coming to office. More than 230,000 internally displaced persons put an enormous strain on the economy. Peace in the separatist areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, overseen by Russian and United Nations peacekeepers in the framework of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, remained fragile. The Rose Revolution raised many expectations, both domestically and abroad. The new government was expected to bring democracy, ending a period of widespread corruption and government inefficiency; and to complete state-building by re-asserting sovereignty over the whole Georgian territory. Both aims were very ambitious; the new ruling elite initiated a process of concentration of power in the hands of the executive, in order to use the revolutionary mandate to change the country. In fact, the Saakashvili government initially achieved impressive results in strengthening the capacity of the state and toppling corruption.ESI, Georgia as a model, April 2010 Georgia's ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International improved dramatically from rank 133Corruption Perceptions Index 2004.

But such achievements could only result from the use of unilateral executive powers, failing to achieve consent and initiating a trade-off between democracy-building and state-building. After the Rose Revolution, relations between the Georgian government and semi-separatist Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze deteriorated rapidly, with Abashidze rejecting Saakashvili's demands for the writ of the Tbilisi government to run in Ajaria. Both sides mobilised forces in apparent preparations for a military confrontation. Saakashvili's ultimatums and massive street demonstrations forced Abashidze to resign and flee Georgia (2004 Adjara crisis). Relations with Russia remained problematic due to Russia's continuing political, economic and military support to separatist governments in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russian troops still remained garrisoned at two military bases and as peacekeepers in these regions. Saakashvili's public pledge to resolve the matter provoked criticism from the separatist regions and Russia. In August 2004, several clashes occurred in South Ossetia. On October 29, 2004, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) of NATO approved the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia (IPAP), making Georgia the first among NATO's partner countries to manage this task successfully. Georgia supported the coalition forces in Iraq War. On November 8, 2004, 300 extra Georgian troops were sent to Iraq. The Georgian government committed to send a total of 850 troops to Iraq to serve in the protection forces of the UN Mission. Along with increasing Georgian troops in Iraq, the US will train additional 4 thousand Georgian soldiers within frames of the Georgia Train-and-Equip Program (GTEP). In February 2005 Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania died, and Zurab Nogaideli was appointed as the new Prime Minister. Saakashvili remained under significant pressure to deliver on his promised reforms. Organisations such as Amnesty International have pushed serious concerns over human rights. Discontent over unemployment, pensions and corruption, and the continuing dispute over Abkhazia, have greatly diminished Saakashvili's popularity in the country. In 2006 Georgia's relationship with Russia was at nadir due to the Georgian‚ÄìRussian espionage controversy and related events. In 2007, a political crisis led to serious anti-government protests, and Russia allegedly led a series of airspace violations against Georgia. ;2007 crisis Since the weakening of the democratic credentials of the Saakashvili cabinet after the police crackdown of the 2007 protests, the government has put the stress on his successful economic reforms. Kakha Bendukidze was pivotal in the libertarian reforms launched under Saakashvili, including one of the least restrictive labour codes, the lowest flat income tax rates (12%) and some of the lowest customs rates worldwide, along with the drastic reduction of necessary licenses and permits for business. The objective of the Georgian elite switched to the aim of \\"a functioning democracy with the highest possible level of economic liberties\\", as expressed by the prime minister Lado Gurgenidze. Saakashvili called new parliamentary and presidential elections for January 2008. In order to contest the presidential election, Saakashvili announced his resignation effective 25 November 2007, with Nino Burjanadze becoming acting president for a second time (until the election returned Saakashvili to office on 20 January 2008). ;Second term (2008‚Äì2013) In August 2008 Russia and Georgia engaged in the 2008 South Ossetia war. Its aftermath, leading to the 2008‚Äì2010 Georgia‚ÄìRussia crisis, is still tense. ;The 2012 parliamentary elections In October 2011 famous georgian tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili admitted his entrance to politics of Georgia. In December he established opposition political movement Georgian Dream and announced his desire to take part in the 2012 parliamentary elections. In February 2012 they formed coalition with Republican Party of Georgia, Free Democrats, National Forum and Industry Will Save Georgia. Tensions rose during pre-election campaign, whereas many leaders of opposition were arrested. 54% of electorate voted in favor of the newly-formed coalition, thus Georgia Dream obtained 65 seats in parliament. In October 2012, Saakashvili admitted defeat for his party in parliamentary elections. In his speech he said that \\"the opposition has the lead and it should form the government ‚Äì and I as president should help them with this\\". This represented the first democratic transition of power in Georgia's post-Soviet history. =Margvelashvili presidency (2013‚Äì2018)= On 17 November 2013, Giorgi Margvelashvili won the Georgian presidential election, 2013 with 62.12% of the votes cast. With this, a new constitution came into effect which devolved significant power from the President to the Prime Minister.Margvelashvili Sworn-in as New President. Civil Georgia. November 17, 2013.

He was a master copper plate engraver and engraved some fine maps for local Edinburgh firms, such as street maps for Lizars, others for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and for some educational publishers like A & C Black. He was commissioned to engrave the map of Treasure Island for Robert Louis Stevenson. John Sr. was the ideal person to inaugurate what became one of the most admired cartographic institutions in the world. A man of high standards, as were his successors; he was an accomplished engraver, engraving becoming the foundation of the firm; lithography would follow later. He also had the vision to recognise the potential for the firm. He was a shy man, holding back from public life. In 1832‚Äì1833 James was living at 4 East St James Street, since demolished. In 1859, shortly before he died, John Senior passed the business on to his son John Bartholomew Junior (1831‚Äì1893).

Background There is little known about the relationship that Johnson and Tyers shared, except that Johnson claimed that \\"Tyers always tells him something he did not know before\\"Hill 1897 p. 362 and was familiarly mentioned by Johnson to Johnson's friends.Boswell 1887 p. 308 However, Johnson, in The Idler, described Tyers, called Tom Restless, as \\"a circumstance\\" and says: > \\"When Tom Restless rises he goes into a coffee-house, where he creeps so > near to men whom he takes to be reasoners, as to hear their discourses and > endeavours to remember something which, when it has been strained through > Tom's head, is so near to nothing, that what it once was cannot be > discovered.

I see they will leave nothing untold that I laboured so long to keep secret; & I was so very delicate in trying to conceal his fancied Insanity.\\"Thrale 1897 p. 199 Regardless of what Thrale may have wanted, critics focused on Johnson's mental state from then after. In particular, John Wain emphasizes Tyers's description of Johnson as \\"like a ghost. He never speaks unless he is spoken to\\",Wain 1974 p. 246 which Wain considered a \\"bon mot\\".Wain 1974 p. 345 Likwise, Walter Jackson Bate relies on how Tyers was able to partly capture Johnson's \\"bisociative\\" ability to bring \\"together two different frames of experience\\".Bate 1977 p. 497 Tyers, when saying Johnson \\"said the most common things in the newest manner\\", describes Johnson's \\"unpredictability\\" and a > \\"further process of mind in which the original shuffling of perspectives, > already surprising us with elements we had overlooked or forgotten, is > joined by considerations drawn from other matrices of experience that can > only be described as 'moral,' that is, having to do with the condition of > man - with human hopes and fears; with values, purpose or aim; with the > shared sense, never forgotten, of the 'doom of man'; and with an unsleeping > practical urgency in considering concretely what to do and how to live.\\" Tyers concludes his work by saying: > \\"At the end of this sketch, it may be hinted (sooner might have been > prepossession) that Johnson told this writer, for he saw he always had his > eye and ear upon him, that at some time or other he might be called upon to > assist a posthumous account of him.

The Federaci√≥n Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales (FELGTB; ) is the main LGBT organisation in Spain. FELGTB is characterised by demanding LGBT rights, at times through controversial campaigns. Its current chairman is Uge Sangil. In June 2008, the United Nations Economic and Social Council granted consultative status to FELGTB and COC Netherlands. History In 1992 the National Federation of Gays and Lesbians (FELG; ) was founded, at the proposal of the Collective of Gays and Lesbienas of Madrid (COGAM) and other LGBT organisations based in Madrid following their separation from the historic organisation Coordinadora de Frentes de Liberaci√≥n Homosexual del Estado Espa√±ol (COFLHEE). In time, some groups from different parts of Spain joined the Federation, such as some from Granada and Barcelona, but very slowly. It was the late 1990s when some of the main organisations of the country (Gehitu of the Basque Country, Alega of Cantabria, Gam√° of the Canary Islands and the Colectivo Lambda of Valencia, among others) joined FELG in an attempt build unity to pressure for the approval of a law recognising common law partnerships. Currently, more than 30 associations of all types compose the FELGT. Beginning in 2003, the FELGT was led by Beatriz Gimeno. Previously, Pedro Zerolo and Armand de Fluvi√° had occupied that position. In March 2007, Beatriz Gimeno decided to begin collaborating with the university and Antoni Poveda came to hold the position of president of the FELGT. In the same meeting it was decided to add the \\"B\\" for bisexual to the acronym. 2007 the official name became FELGTB, including bisexual option in the name. Activism, campaigns, and polemics The FELGT, along with COGAM, convened the demonstration for same-sex marriage in Spain. The FELGTB demands legal equality and social respect for diversity, is a promoter and convener (along with COGAM) of the national demonstration on the International Day of LGBT Pride (June 28), and fosters the training of its member associations' activists. It has presented several controversial campaigns, such as VOTA ROSA (\\"VOTE PINK\\") and 2004 NO VOTES PP (\\"2004 DON'T VOTE PP\\"). Beatriz Gimeno justified this last slogan by pointing out the necessity of a political change to \\"advance our demands\\". Esperanza Aguirre, in response to this campaign, stated that sexual orientation doesn't necessarily determine political orientation, and noted that she was convinced that \\"the majority of gays are going to vote for Esperanza, and are going to vote PP\\". Ana Botella, number two on the list of the PP in Madrid, limited herself to saying that the demands of the FELGT don't come within the rivalries of the town council. During the negotiation of the same-sex marriage law in Spain, the FELGT criticized the performance of the PP at various times, especially for presenting as an expert the psychiatrist Aquilino Polaino, who claimed that homosexuality was a pathology. Parallelly, when the Pope visited Valencia, the FELGT participated in the Jornadas Internacionales de Diversidad Familiar (International Conference on Family Diversity) (subsidized by the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs) and signed up for the collective \\"Jo no t'espere\\" (\\"I don't wait for you\\"), which was criticized harshly by the Catholic media. Some of those organisations tried to take the FELGT to the attorney general for \\"the continuous offenses of gay activism\\". On April 20, 2007, the FELGT described as \\"incoherent\\" Mariano Rajoy's declarations about gay weddings, since he was claiming that if his son marries a man he will attend his wedding, while his party has appealed the same-sex marriage law as unconstitutional. On April 28, 2007, FELGT launched the campaign Ni un c√©ntimo para quien te discrimina (\\"Not one cent for anyone who discriminates against you\\"), coinciding with the income tax filings, encouraging citizens to mark the \\"social purposes\\" box instead of the box designated for the Catholic Church.

The film's screenwriter and director Hans Iveberg answered in Expressen by blaming the tradition in Swedish film making where sound almost resembles that of radio theatre.

It is the practice of charring the biomass resulting from the slashing, instead of burning it. The resulting residue matter charcoal can be utilized as biochar to improve the soil fertility. In that context, charcoal can be made by numerous and varied methods, from the simplest (an earth cover on the pile of wood, with strategically placed vents) to the most sophisticated (a modern equipment or plant that recuperates and processes strictly all exhaust gases into pyroligneous acid and syngas). Slash-and-char offers considerable benefits to the environment when compared to slash-and- burn. It results in the creation of biochar, which can then be mixed with biomass such as crop residues, food waste, or manure, and buried in the soil to bring about the formation of terra preta. Terra preta is one of the richest soils on the planet ‚Äì and the only one known to regenerate itself. It moreover sequesters considerable quantities of carbon in the safest and most beneficial fashion, as opposite to the negative effects of the slash-and-burn. Switching to slash-and-char can sequester up to 50% of the carbon in a highly stable form.

The family left Yorkshire in the early part of the fifteenth century, turning up in Cambridgeshire, located at Trumpington, Waterbeach & Girten and Cambridge itself. George is descended from the Girten branch. R.I., R.O.I, R.M.S, (24 July 1839 - 1924 London) was an English genre painter specialising in accurately drawn interiors with figures. He favoured the watercolour medium, although he also worked in oils, pencil and initially trained as a wood-engraver.Fisher, S. A Dictionary of Watercolour Painters, 1750-1900 (Foulsham, 1972). Life George Goodwin Kilburne, Watching the hunt, 1895 George Goodwin Kilburne Forewarned is forearmed \\"Enoch Arden\\" (watercolour painting by George Goodwin Kilburne ) The Music room George was born at Hackford near Reepham in Norfolk, the eldest of the three children of Goodwin Kilburne (1812‚Äì1887) and Rebeccca Button (1801‚Äì1880).Kilburne's father Goodwin Kilburne (1812-1887) - of Easton, then Hackford in Norfolk and then Hawkhurst in Kent - was a schoolmaster, who was not only a noted Science scholar, but also an amateur artist of considerable ability. His mother Rebecca Button (1801-1880) was from Burwash, Sussex. He had two siblings, a brother William Isaac Kilburne (1844-1874) a Bank Manager, who emigrated and died in Melbourne, Australia and a sister, Sarah Elizabeth Kilburne (1842-1934) an accomplished Painter on China, who never married, but frequently exhibited at the London Galleries. Kilburne was educated at Hawkhurst, Kent - his father's old school. On leaving at the age of 15, he went to London to serve a five-year apprenticeship as a wood engraver with the Dalziel brothers. He was highly regarded by his employers who described him as \\"industrious and constant\\" and \\"one of the most satisfactory pupils we ever had\\".Dalziel, G. & E. The brothers Dalziel: a record of fifty years' work in conjunction with many of the most distinguished artists of the period 1840-1890 (London: Methuen, 1901) pp 345-346. His time as an engraver served him well, allowing him to develop the accuracy and detail which would enhance his subsequent painting. He remained with the firm for a further year before leaving to take up watercolour and oil painting professionally, quickly becoming one of the most sought after and well-known artists in England. In June 1862, Kilburne married Janet Dalziel at Old Church, St. Pancras, London. She was the daughter of the painter Robert Dalziel, the brother of his former employers. They had three sons and two daughters - of these his eldest son, George Goodwin Kilburne Jnr., became a very well known painter of animals and figures, principally of sporting subjects. In 1881 the family were recorded as living in Hampstead, London.The 5 children were: George Goodwin Jnr (1863-1938), Charles Robert (1868-1954), William Richard (1866-1947), Florence Amy (1865-1944), and Mary Maud (born 1867). The family lived at Hawkhurst House, Steeles Road, Hampstead (1881 England Census). His daughter Florence, married Robert Allpress Walton, son of George Walton, the founder of Walton, Hassell & Port Ltd., Grocers and Provision Merchants, the first independent multiple food retailer in the U.K. Another son, Charles, an Accountant, went on to become a Joint Managing Director of the aforesaid Walton, Hassell & Port Ltd. William, also an Accountant became a Surveyor and Probate Valuer. Mary married Ernest Russell Woakes, a Mining Engineer. Janet died in 1882. In 1889 Kilburne married Edith Golightly (34 years his junior), with whom he had a further two children - Edith May (Born 1900) and Constance Ivy (born 1902). Kilburne was a keen sportsman and equestrian and involved himself in hunting, cycling and golf. He possessed a good collection of arms and armour, mainly swords, which often figured in his pictures. He was said to be very quiet and almost retiring in manner, yet very companionable and a friendly and a genial host. He lived for many years at Hawkhurst House, 39 Steeles Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead in London and was a member of the Artists' Society Club at Langham Chambers. At the time of his death, in 1924, he was living at 16 Albion Road, Swiss Cottage, London, but died at his daughter Florence's home, next door to his old house, 38 Steeles Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London. Work The New Spinet Maiden meditation (1866 - watercolour) Piano practice, by 1924 George's paintings often portrayed the upper classes and ultra-fashionable female beauties in opulent late 18th and early 19th-century settings. His depiction of this beauty was heightened by his attention to detail with dress, and richly decorated interiors. During the period his paintings would have been considered traditional, especially compared to the work of contemporaries such as James McNeill Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Kilburne travelled extensively in Italy around 1875, and painted in Rome for three months, besides working in Venice at that time, and also in 1876. He did a great deal of sketching in Normandy and Switzerland, besides visiting many parts of England and Wales for the same purpose. Shortly after the death of the Emperor Napoleon III, the Empress Eugenie commissioned Kilburne to paint several pictures for her. For this purpose he paid many visits to her at Chislehurst, Kent to paint pictures of the rooms used by the late Emperor, which had been kept, just as they were, during his lifetime. Towards the end of the 19th century he designed and executed a great number of greetings and Christmas cards for the firms of Raphael Tuck & Sons and De La Rue, the minute labour and work for which brought on a serious attack of gout in the eyes. He also contributed a large number of black and white pictures to The Graphic, The Illustrated London News and Cassell's Magazine. Many of his pictures became popular through prints. Kilburne was elected a member of the New Watercolour Society (RI) in 1866.Fisher, S. A Dictionary of Watercolour Painters. He became a member of the Royal Miniature Society in 1898 and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters (ROI) in 1883. In London, Kilburne exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1863‚Äì1918, at the Royal Society of British Artists (Suffolk Street), New Watercolour Society, Royal Miniature Society, Grosvenor Gallery, Dowdeswell Galleries and others.The Dictionary of British Artists 1880-1940 (Antique Collectors Club) In the regions he exhibited at Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, the Manchester City Art Gallery, the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. Kilburne's work can be seen in many public and private galleries including the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Manchester City Art Gallery and the Sheffield Art Gallery.

Virtual Lab Automation (VLA) solutions are available as on-premises packaged software or as a cloud service. History Akimbi pioneered the Virtual Lab Management market with its Slingshot product. VMware acquired Akimbi in 2006. VMLogix LabManager was launched in 2006 as well; followed by a virtual lab solution on the Amazon public cloud in 2009. Skytap and CloudShare (originally named IT Structures) introduced the first cloud-based virtual lab automation services in 2008. voke research describes the evolution of virtual automation as follows. The first generation of solutions focused on Virtual Lab Management (VLM) only. The second generation expanded to the cloud. The third generation, lifecycle virtualization, covers VLM, virtual cloud platforms, service virtualization, defect virtualization, and device virtualization. Solutions Virtual labs are used for sales, testing, demos, training, development and certification of software and hardware solutions. The main potential business benefits are reduced labor and hardware costs, faster response times to customers and channels, improved testing reliability and simple access to complex configurations. Virtual lab management software is used in educational institutes and universities as well in orchestrating virtual training labs and in education IT. Capabilities A virtual lab automation solution typically includes the following capabilities: Resource Pooling and Provisioning Resource pooling enables processing power, storage and networking infrastructure to be shared between different teams and individuals, increasing utilization and availability of resources, and reducing costs. In conjunction with resource pooling, an orchestration and provisioning process allocates and releases resources as needed. Complex Multi-Machine Configurations Virtual labs are usually targeted to complex enterprise scenarios and support complex networking topologies such as multiple networks, bridging, routing and multi-tier apps. Some solutions enable integration of virtual machines, physical machines, network appliances and hypervisors to reflect current enterprise setups. Virtual machine images are the containers that enable operating systems and applications to be isolated from physical resources. A group of virtual or physical images or that define a complete system, including network and storage characteristics, is defined as a configuration. For instance, a configuration could consist of multiple Windows Vista client machines, an Oracle database server and a WebSphere application server. Configurations can be easily created by combining machines through a user interface. A configuration is a very useful concept for QA teams because it allows a whole system to be defined and isolated in a test environment. Virtual networking enables copies of the same environment to be run in parallel and the emulation of production environments during the test process. Configuration Library A configuration library allows a team to manage and organize virtual images and configurations. Standard builds and images can be created and made available to development and QA teams to save hours of set-up time and environment configuration. Additionally, the library is used to store new configurations that are cloned or created as part of a test. Life cycle Management The ability to suspend a complete state of a multi-machine configuration and make a snapshot (a copy at a point in time) is a major benefit of virtualization. This is especially useful for application development teams because when a bug is found a configuration snapshot to be taken at the point of failure and a link to the configuration added to a defect report. Instead of a developer spending hours to reproduce the defect, he or she can restore the configuration and start debugging the issue within minutes. The ability to control the life cycle automatically is beneficial for web based service. For example, an environment can run for two hours and than automatically be archived to disk. This reduces the costs of running the environments and allows for multiple business scenarios. Scheduling and Reservations Many in-house virtual lab implementations have a fixed pool of resources for teams to share. Scheduling and reservation functionality allows the resolution of resource conflicts and test environments to be reserved ahead of time. Reporting and Monitoring Reporting modules allow users and administrators to manage usage and quotas and determine whether the system resources are being used optimally. Monitoring enables the system health to be diagnosed, including CPU utilization, storage performance and network usage. Automation API Automating a test lab almost always involves integrating tools and test processes. An automation API enables teams to automatically create test environments as part of the build process and initiate automated test runs once a new build has been deployed. An automation API is typically made available through a web services interface. Some products like VMLogix LabManager and Citrix LabManager has inbuilt automation capabilities which would provide out of the automation inside the VMs. In such cases, you don't need to write scripts to call these automation APIs as it can be easily done through the GUI. Security Security features include access and roles management, permissions and authentication. Some services allow dynamic roles assignment (for example, vendor and channel) or hierarchy (manager and employee). Since replicated guests have identical user names and passwords, those need customization for public services. Remote Access and Visualization Remote access to the system (for instance for an outsourced vendor) is usually managed through secure connections via encrypted protocols and virtual private networking. Access to identical copies of configurations over the internet requires a method to authenticate traffic at the application level while guarantees it is tunneled only to the relevant environment. Typically the lab environments are visualized over the web to demonstrated the multi-server topologies and logical relationship. Administration  Administration features often include project creation, quota management, billing, auditing and customization. Vendors Virtual lab automation solutions are available as on-premises packaged software or as a cloud service. VMware, Surgient and VMLogix launched in 2006 to provide packaged software solutions. CloudShare (originally named IT Structures) and Skytap launched in 2008. and offer virtual lab automation as a cloud service. VMBed is another cloud-based service.

Facts Shepherd tossed a squib into a crowded market in the town of Milborne Port in Somerset, where it landed on the table of a gingerbread merchant named Yates. Willis, a bystander, grabbed the squib and threw it across the market to protect himself and the gingerbread. Unfortunately, the squib landed in the goods of another merchant named Ryal.

The marine park extends from Caloundra south to the southern tip of South Stradbroke Island. The marine park's border extends up to the highest tidal mark and covers a total of 3,400 km2. The marine park provides protection to sensitive reef sites near Tangalooma and Flinders Reef. It includes waterways such as Coombabah Lake, mangrove forests, swamps, marshes, tidal mudflats, sandflats and seagrass beds. It is a temporary home to migrating shorebirds that inhabit wetlands. Dugongs, whales and turtles swim in the waters of the bay. The marine park is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. In 1971, a total of 18 countries signed a Convention on Wetlands of International Significance. It was signed in Ramsar, a city in Iran, and came to be known as the Ramsar Convention, which aimed at stopping global loss of wetlands, and conservation and sustainable management of the remaining wetlands. Moreton Bay is among Australia's largest sites which is listed under the Ramsar Convention. Marine Park Zoning Plan From 1 March 2009, activities in the marine park are designated under the Marine Park Zoning Plan. 16% of the bay is protected in green zones or marine national park zones. This leaves 84% of the marine park available to anglers. The marine national park zones are classed as (IUCN Category II) while the remainder is classed as IUCN Category VI. The Queensland Government has spent AU2$ million to create three artificial reefs within the marine park. A free user guide is widely available in bait and boat shops in the region as well as online. Zones Jacobs Well, 2014 There are four zones in Moreton Bay Marine Park. These are the Marine national park zone (green) which contain areas of high conservation value, Conservation park zone (yellow) allowing limited fishing and crabbing, Habitat protection (dark blue) zone for sensitive habitats with no trawling allowed and General use zone (light blue) allow activities such as trawling. The zones are patrolled by rangers. Fines of up to A$500 for fishing in the green zone have been issued. Designated areas There are nine types of designated areas in the marine park. These areas have been set aside so that specific issues that occur at specific locations can be properly managed. Examples of designated areas include Go slow areas to protect dugongs and turtles, No anchoring areas to protect sensitive reefs and Grey nurse shark areas designed to conserve the endangered shark species.

The series was created in 2007 by satirist/filmmaker Dan Speerin of the sketch comedy group Cynically Tested to satirize life as a Millennial and to mock the false perceptions of Generation Y. The series was co-produced by fellow Cynically Tested members Alan So and Aravinth Vince Kesavamoorthy. Twixters aired on Bite TV in Canada and Propeller TV in UK. The series also aired on Triangle Stratos in New Zealand. Twixters' success and the stance of its creator on Millennial Life was featured in the Toronto Star. Other media coverage for the series included Sun TV's Canoe Live, G4 Tech TV, and The Eye Weekly Magazine. The show's indie success is mainly due to its utilization of interactive social platforms as YouTube, Facebook, MySpace and Blogs. Part of their success is based on their rebuttal on YouTube to the piece on Millennials by 60 Minutes on CBS titled Twixters vs 60 Minutes Millennials, and Millennials Fight Back!. The latter video was covered by CBS Interactive‚Äôs BNET evoking greater discussion about the fairness of the coverage of the millennial generation by 60 Minutes.  In popular culture  The TV series and its various multiplatform components continues to be a part of the social lexicon when discussing the millennial generation, as it has been referred to by educational, technological, political, business and marketing platforms as well as university curriculum. Some such examples include Inside Higher ED, Future Majority, Workforce Management‚Äôs HR Capitalists, and h+ Magazine. Jerry Pattengale, the founder of Purpose-Guided Education has cited content of the series in his text. Dr. Scott Bryant of Montana State University has also utilized various content of the show as part of his course. As a testament to their success in provoking discussion in the subject matter, Twixters‚Äô creators and producers were invited to be guest panelists and speakers at the Millennials Conference Canada at Canadian Music Week 2008. Speerin and his team continue to be the voice of Generation Y as can be seen from the multi- page Ottawa Citizen print article in 2011.  Follow Up: The What Is!  The producers of Twixters continued their focus on providing a voice to the millennial generation with the creation of The What Is!, a television miniseries that aired on ichannel. A half-hour Federal Election Special, titled The What Is!: Election 2008, focusing on youth voter issues pertaining to the federal election, made its debut on October 11. This special also doubled as the pilot episode for the series. The co-creator, writer and host of The What Is!, Dan Speerin, has teamed with his producing partners from Twixters, Alan So and Vince Kesavamoorthy, to produce the series under their production company Not Like Us Productions. Guests of the series include Navdeep Bains, Patrick Sullivan (then-President of Workopolis), and Jack Layton & Olivia Chow. An interactive component of this series is also available on Not Like Us Productions‚Äô Cynically Tested Channel on MySpace, Facebook and YouTube and can be viewed at www.twixterstv.com. The show has been featured in various forms of media including The Toronto Sun, The Globe and Mail, Eye Weekly Magazine and Macleans on Campus. As a testament to the success of the series, The What Is! won a Television and Cable Productions Gold Remi award under the category Political Commentary at the 42nd Annual WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival. Others honored in this category included the Norddeutscher Rundfunk documentary Henry Kissinger ‚Äì Secrets of a Superpower. The series won its second Gold Remi in the same category the following year at the 43rd Annual WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.  Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup  Following the success of their half-hour satire, Cynically Tested's Truth From Here on CBC Television, Not Like Us Productions debuted a new HD television series titled Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup on Rogers TV Toronto (channel 10 & 63, HD channel 510) on October 6, 2010. The series is created and produced by Dan Speerin, Alan So and Vince Kesavamoorthy. Speerin is also the host of the series. Each episode of Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup features sketches from Cynically Tested Channel, musical performances by some of Canada's up and coming musical talent, roundtable discussions with Toronto's top young comedians and journalists (filmed at The Cadillac Lounge), as well as one-on-one interviews with some of the most interesting and successful Canadians (filmed at The Toronto Underground Cinema). The show addresses topics such as the legitimacy of online media, the state of Canadian film and television industry, Canadian culture versus American culture, advertising and its permeation of the social fabric, as well as the 2010 Toronto mayoral elections. The series featured one-one-one interviews with Colin Mochrie, Geoff Lapaire and Jarett Cale (the creators of the popular online series turned Showcase television series Pure Pwnage), mayoral candidates of Toronto's Mayor Elections 2010 George Smitherman and Joe Pantalone, Jennifer Hollett of CBC's Connect with Mark Kelley, Journalist with the Real News Network Jesse Freeston, artists and activists Posterchild and Sean Martindale, as well as then-Mayor of Toronto David Miller. Musical guests of the show included Hooded Fang and Anna Cyzon. Truth Mashup's coverage of the launch of Sun News Network and said network's right wing bias was covered by various media including The Grid Magazine (Toronto) and The Georgia Straight (Vancouver), TV-eh podcast and CIUT's Vibe Collective. The 2011 Federal Election was the first Canadian Federal Election since the social media boom. Truth Mashup's Dan Speerin is known as a social media savvy satirist. Speerin was consulted by many in the media including CBC's Connect with Mark Kelley and TVO's The Agenda with Steve Palkin. Speerin's humorous yet astute take on the role of social media in this federal elections appeared on CTV.ca. Truth Mashup's various response videos to the ethnic voter targeted political ad campaigns was featured in The Torontoist and was ranked as the top response by Vancouver's popular multicultural magazine Schema. Truth Mashup was also invited media guests at the NDP National Convention during the night of the elections. Despite its limited reach on the television platform, Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup continues to garner a national audience through its various online social platforms. This is rendered visible by the media coverage the show has received by various media outlets across Canada, and the interview, panel and musical guests the show has been able to attract. Dan Speerin's Truth Mashup also received a Gold Remi for Political/Social Commentary at the World Fest in Houston in 2011, the third such award for Speerin and his team.

They wear a big, floppy straw hat to hide the fact that they have no face except for a small mouth to speak with. Largely mischievous, they play pranks on people, raid gardens, and seem to enjoy leading children astray until they are thoroughly lost in the woods.  Origins  Trinidad and Tobago folklore is primarily of African foundation, with French, Spanish and English influences. Religious or semi-religious cults of African origin have undeniably contributed much to the Island's folklore. Many of the supernatural folklore characters are identical with those of African deities. It is exceedingly complicated to draw a line between the stern religious elements and what may be described as traditions. Nevertheless, in the African tradition, stories were meant to instill values in the children.Williams, Eric (1993). History of the People of Trinidad & Tobago,A&b; Publishers Group Based on the description of Trinidadian douen, it seems that this folklore may have originated from the Mayan folklore Tata Duende or the Latin-American folklore of duende.

The Duty to God program, which operated in various formats from 1954 until 2019, for young men was roughly equivalent to the Personal Progress program for the church's young women. History The award was created in 1954 to correlate the activities of Scouting with priesthood responsibilities. In 2002, the award's requirements and design were modified to focus young men on preparation for temple, missionary, and family goals.\\"Program ‚Äòwill improve their lives,‚Äô\\" Deseret News, October 27, 2001 (fee-based article) The award was further modified again in 2010. Although the Duty to God award never required participation in the Scouting programs of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), the BSA recognized it as evidence of a Scout's commitment to its principles. In May 2018, the LDS Church announced that in January 2020 it would launch a new worldwide initiative for children and youth. As a part of this change, the church will no longer be a BSA chartered organization. The new \\"Children and Youth Program\\" replaced all existing activity programs for girls and boys, young women and young men beginning in January 2020. Award requirements The most recent award program officially began in January 2002 and was revised in 2010. Aaronic Priesthood candidates would qualify for the Duty to God Award after completing specific requirements regarding priesthood duties. These were defined as involvement in family activities, participation in the church's quorum activities, the successful completion of a Duty to God service project, and reaching personal goals relating to education, spiritual and physical development, and social interactions.  Award name and design  The Duty to God Award as it appeared when used in conjunction with the Boy Scouts of America prior to 2002 The award and its qualifying program is named from a passage in the Book of Mormon: The award, a circular medallion, was designed by Douglas Coy Miles.

It is not known how many horses were killed in this manner between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, when a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation brought the horse killings to light, but the number is thought to be well over 50, and may have been as high as 100. In addition, in 1977, the heiress Helen Brach disappeared and was presumed by law enforcement agents to have been murdered by the perpetrators of these crimes, because she threatened to report their criminal activity to authorities; caselaw.lp.findlaw.com continuing investigations into Brach's death began to uncover the insurance fraud in the 1990s. The scandal has been called \\"one of the biggest, most gruesome stories in sports\\" as well as \\"the biggest scandal in the history of equestrian sports.\\" Thirty-six people were indicted and tried for insurance fraud, mail and wire fraud, obstruction of justice, extortion, racketeering, and animal cruelty in connection with the horse murders; 35 were convicted. Of the 23 people indicted in Chicago in July 1994, 20 pleaded guilty. The disappearance and murder of Helen Brach was never fully solved, although one man, Richard Bailey, is serving life in prison for soliciting her murder. Over the 20-year period during which the horse murders took place, several different motivations led horse owners and trainers, often affluent and well-respected people, to become involved in what ultimately became a widespread conspiracy. In some cases, the owner of a promising, or even prize-winning, horse was temporarily strapped for cash and decided to insure and then kill the animal; this was the situation in the 1982 murder of the show jumper Henry the Hawk. Sometimes people bought over-valued horses. Rather than take a loss on a poor investment, these owners chose to finance their next horse purchase by defrauding the insurance company that had insured the unwanted horse. Another aspect to the scandal went beyond insurance fraud and involved racketeering. This scheme, a form of confidence game, consisted of bilking wealthy widows of their money by encouraging them to invest in horses. The animals were usually over-valued or under-performing, and the conspirators killed the animals in order to prevent the owners from uncovering how much they had overspent. In some cases, before the women invested, these non-performing animals were first \\"bid up\\" in value by the co-conspirators, in an attempt to make them seem more desirable to the purchasers. In other cases, a shill buyer would offer to co-purchase the horse from a conspiring owner or trainer, with each buyer putting up half the stated purchase price. The check from the shill buyer would be destroyed and the two con artists would deposit and split the money paid by the wealthy woman buyer. If she began to suspect that the horse she had purchased was relatively valueless, it would be killed for the insurance money, which would soothe her financially, and if the conspirators still had her confidence, she would then be encouraged to invest in another co-owned horse, repeating the cycle. The men who worked this form of confidence game often acted as gigolos to the widows they bilked. It was one of these schemes which the wealthy widow Helen Brach uncovered that ‚Äî when she announced her intention to report the fraud that had been perpetrated on her ‚Äî led to her disappearance and murder. Famous cases Drucks' Henry the Hawk In 1981, 17-year-old Lisa Druck of Ocala, Florida (now known as Rielle Hunter) owned and rode a show horse named Henry the Hawk. Because Lisa (born June 6, 1964) was underage, her finances were controlled by her father, James Druck, an attorney and owner of Eagle Nest Farm. Druck's legal practice consisted of defending insurance companies against claims, and he knew that if a horse were electrocuted in a certain manner, it would be very difficult for a veterinary pathologist to find signs of foul play and the death would be chalked up to colic. According to ABC News, Lisa was \\"a prize-winning equestrian when her father was implicated in an insidious plot to electrocute horses for insurance money.\\" In the early 1990s, following James Druck's death, convicted horse-killer and FBI informant Tommy Burns told authorities and reporters that James Druck had first attempted to sell his daughter's horse for $150,000, but the highest offer he received was only $125,000. He then hired Burns and personally taught him how to electrocute horses, even going so far as to buy Burns' first set of electrocution tools. The first horse that Druck hired Burns to kill was Henry the Hawk, whose life insurance policy was worth $150,000. James Druck thus started Tommy Burns on a 10-year- long career as a \\"horse murderer\\". James Druck collected on a $150,000 insurance policy for arranging the killing of his daughter's horse in 1982, but he was under investigation by the FBI when he died of cancer in Tampa, Florida in 1990. Helen Brach The wealthy socialite Helen Brach was a human victim. Brach was a millionaire candy company heiress and animal lover who vanished in 1977 at the age of 65. While her body was never found, she was declared dead in 1984. Investigators suspected that she was murdered because she threatened to reveal what she knew about the over-valuing of horses, which would have led authorities to the string of horse killings perpetrated by Richard Bailey, a man who was later indicted for a role in her murder. The events surrounding Brach's murder were summarized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in adjudicating an appeal made by Richard Bailey: In 1984, seven years after she disappeared, Helen Brach was declared legally dead. In 1997, the connections between her death and the conspiracy involving socially prominent horse owners and their hired horse killers became the subject of a true crime book, Hot Blood: The Money, the Brach Heiress, the Horse Murders, written by Ken Englade. The horse killers Tommy Burns Tommy \\"The Sandman\\" Burns (a.k.a. Timmy Robert Ray) earned his nickname because he \\"put horses to sleep\\" for the conspirators. He traveled the show circuit, visiting stables with his athletic bag full of electrocution equipment and, for fees ranging from $5,000 to $40,000 -- generally for 10 percent of the insurance price on the horse -- he would kill horses for their owners, who would then pay him off from the money obtained by defrauding the insurers. Burns justified his destruction of the animals on the grounds that electrocution -- the technique that he had learned in 1982 from James Druck -- was quick and painless. In 1992, the investigative reporters William Nack and Lester Munson, writing for Sports Illustrated, interviewed Burns, who told them a great deal about how the conspiracy operated: Harlow Arlie In 1989, Burns was hired to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, who had once been a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already suffered from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar. By this time, the FBI had Burns under surveillance, and although the agents were too far away to prevent the fatal injury to Streetwise, they were able to capture Burns and Arlie after a short chase. The two men confessed to the crime, and Burns, in retaliation for being left without legal aid by his powerful former employers, turned FBI informant and revealed the names of dozens of people who had hired him. As a result of his confession, 36 people were arrested for animal cruelty and insurance fraud, of whom 35 were convicted. After testifying before the federal grand jury in Chicago investigating insurance fraud in the horse show industry, Harlow Arlie served eight months in jail for breaking Streetwise's leg. Burns, who revealed the names of many other conspirators, was sentenced to a year in jail for his crimes, including breaking Streetwise's leg; he served six months. He still resides in Florida, where he has legally changed his name to Tim Ray; he currently sells auto parts for a living. Richard Bailey Not only electrocution and leg-breaking were employed as methods to kill insured horses. When arson looked profitable, an entire stable could be burned to the ground, to collect on the building insurance as well as the horse insurance. Richard Bailey, who feuded with his brother, and Frank Jayne and his family, were said to have left \\"a trail of violence\\" in the horse-club world of the upper Midwest states of Illinois and Wisconsin over the course of decades. Richard Bailey pleaded guilty to racketeering, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering charges in 1995 and was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the murder of Helen Brach. The conspirators Paul Valliere Horse trainers also participated along with Burns in the conspiracy, including Paul Valliere, the owner of Acres Wild Farm in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. In 1994, Valliere admitted that he hired Burns to electrocute his show horse, Roseau Platiere, so that he could collect $75,000 in insurance money. Once he was apprehended, Valliere turned state's evidence. He wore a wire for a year, gathering information for the federal authorities who were investigating the conspiracy. Due to his cooperation with law enforcement, Paul Valliere was sentenced in 1996 to four years of probation and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine; he also was indefinitely suspended from participating in horse shows sanctioned by the American Horse Show Association. In 2006, Valliere attempted to gain reinstatement to the United States Equestrian Federation (formerly AHSA) causing outrage among those who recalled his crimes, and sparking an online campaign to have him permanently barred from participation in equestrian events.sportsillustrated.cnn.com Barney Ward One of Valliere's close friends, the Rhode Island-born trainer Barney Ward, who owned Castle Hill farm in Brewster, New York, also arranged horse-killings for wealthy owners; Burns said Ward arranged for Burns to commit 15 horse killings. Ward was charged in 1994 with arranging the killings of four horses. Although he claimed to be innocent of the charges, he pleaded guilty in 1996 to conspiring to kill four horses for their insurance payouts between 1987 and 1990: Charisma, Condino, Rub the Lamp and Roseau Platiere. In court papers he \\"admitted that he told the horse killer to keep quiet about the people who hired the killer to slaughter the horses, and, if he kept quiet about [Ward's] friends and business associates, [Ward] would pay him money. [and] that [Ward] later spoke with the horse killer and [...] said that he would kill the horse killer if he did anything to hurt [Ward].\\"American Horse Shows Assn. v. Ward, 718 N.Y.S.2d 593, 186 Misc.2d 571 (2000) Ward was sentenced to 33 months in prison, followed by three years of probation, and ordered to make restitution of $200,000 to one of the defrauded insurance companies. Upon his release, Ward sued the AHSA, which had barred him from attending its sanctioned shows. He claimed that it was his right, as a private citizen and no longer a member of the AHSA, to watch his son compete in equestrian events. In 2000, the Supreme Court of New York found that argument meritless, ruling that Ward's membership in AHSA at the time of his criminal conduct, plus his promise to be bound by the organization's rules, authorized the AHSA to discipline him, regardless of his current membership status. Donna Brown Donna Brown, the ex-wife of Paul Valliere's former associate Buddy Brown, was convicted of hiring Tommy Burns and Harlow Arlie to break Streetwise's leg. The aftermath In 1993 Jane F. Clark, president of the 60,000-member United States Equestrian Federation (USEF), then known as the American Horse Shows Association (AHSA), which sanctioned 2,500 equestrian events, told The New York Times that her organization was giving federal authorities its complete cooperation and noted that she was \\"eager to see the investigation completed and any guilty parties brought to justice.\\" By 1995, the AHSA (now USEF) had expelled a number of members who had been indicted for various crimes connected with the horse murders, including Marion Hulick, Barney Ward, and Paul Valliere. A literary parallel In 1988 -- long before the arrest of Tommy Burns and the subsequent unraveling of the horse murders conspiracy of silence -- \\"Brat Pack\\" novelist Jay McInerney based a roman √† clef novel, titled Story of My Life, on the young adulthood of his former girlfriend Lisa Druck, James Druck's daughter. McInerney's novel implies that the cause of protagonist Alison Poole's \\"party girl\\" behavior is her father's abuse, including the murder of her prize jumping horse. McInerney has said that he chose to write about Druck and her friends because he was both \\"intrigued and appalled\\" by their behavior, and the lead character, Alison Poole, who was closely modeled after Druck, was described as \\"an ostensibly jaded, cocaine- addled, sexually voracious 20-year old.\\" Story of My Life opens with Alison Poole's description of her father and her seemingly casual comment that she gave up riding when her horse -- called \\"Dangerous Dan\\" in the story -- suddenly \\"dropped dead,\\" details that closely parallel Lisa Druck's early life. In the novel, Allison Poole's horse is poisoned, not electrocuted, but at the end of the story, the orchestrator of the murder, just as in Druck's actual life, is revealed to have been the young woman's father: There was open speculation that Story of My Life was a roman √† clef novel when it first appeared; to New York Magazine's questions \\"Is it real? Did it happen?\\" McInerney replied, \\"I'm anticipating some of that kind of speculation, but I'm utterly confident of not having any lawsuits on my hands. The book is a fully imagined work of fiction. On the other hand, it's not to say that I didn't make use of ‚Ä¶ That's why I live in New York. Mine is not an autonomous imagination.\\" McInerney's references to the horse murder conspiracy went unremarked by sports journalists or the general media at the time of the novel's publication, because the scandal itself had not yet come to light in the national press, but the novel received renewed interest in the wake of the Edwards-Hunter extramarital affair. In August 2008, Vintage Books ordered an additional 2,500 copies of the book in the wake of the interest generated by the Hunter-Edwards scandal.

The lighthouse is owned by the U.S. Coast Guard and licensed to the American Lighthouse Foundation. It is the centerpiece of Owls Head State Park and was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Owls Head Light Station in 1978. History The town of Owls Head is located south of Rockland, and includes an eponymous peninsula that projects northeast into Penobscot Bay, with its tip roughly east of downtown Rockland. The light station is located at the eastern tip of this peninsula. The light station was established in 1825 with the construction of a round, rubblestone tower by Jeremiah Berry and Green & Foster. The tower was rebuilt in 1852. It is a cylindrical brick tower on a granite foundation standing on top a cliff. It has one of the last six Fresnel lenses in operation in Maine. The light is located above mean sea level. In 1854, a keeper's house was built separate from the lighthouse. The cottage now serves as the headquarters of the American Lighthouse Foundation. A fourth order Fresnel lens was installed in 1856. A generator house and an oil storage building were added in 1895. Renovations carried out in 2010 saw the tower restored to its 1852 appearance. In addition to repainting the tower, repairs were done to the bricks, the lantern's ironwork and windowpanes, and the parapet's floor.

The age of the steamer lasted nearly 150 years‚Äîfrom 1835 to 1980‚Äîand had lasting impacts on China, where river trade was essential to the economy due to the poor road network and few railways. First Opium War The first merchant steamer in China, the Jardine, was built to order for the firm of Jardine, Matheson & Co. in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between Lintin Island, Macao, and Whampoa. However, the Chinese, draconian in their application of the rules relating to foreign vessels, were unhappy about a \\"fire-ship\\" steaming up the Canton River. The acting Governor-General of Kwangtung issued an edict warning that she would be fired on if she attempted the trip. On the Jardine's first trial run from Lintin Island the forts on both sides of the Bogue opened fire and she was forced to turn back. The Chinese authorities issued a further warning insisting that the ship leave China. The Jardine in any case needed repairs and was sent to Singapore. Subsequently, Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary who personified gunboat diplomacy, decided mainly on the \\"suggestions\\" of William Jardine to wage war on China. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the Royal Saxon, the British started the first of the Opium Wars. British warships destroyed numerous shore batteries and enemy warships, laid waste to several coastal forts, indiscriminately bombarding town after town with heavy cannon fire, even pushing up north to threaten the Imperial Palace in Beijing itself. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military superiority was clearly evident during the armed conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the Nemesis) were not only virtually indestructible but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took Canton, they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been. In 1842 the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the Treaty of Nanjing signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to Queen Victoria. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports. The China Navigation Company was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after, and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. US involvement The USS Luzon The US, at the same time, wanted to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the USS Wachusett six-hundred miles up the river to Hankow about 1860. While the USS Ashuelot, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to Ichang in 1874. The first USS Monocacy, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first USS Palos, an armed tug, was on the Asiatic Station into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as Hankow, 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repaired damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. With the cessation of bloodshed with the Taiping Rebellion, Europeans put more steamers on the river. The French, eager to secure their share, engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of Vietnam. The Sino-French Wars of the 1880s emerged with the Battle of Shipu having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze. The Chinese had the Nanyang Fleet based at Shanghai and was harassed by French cruisers but saw little action. Boxer Rebellion A Chinese song From the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 sums up the Middle Kingdom's attitude to Europeans, Americans and the Japanese. > It will not be difficult to exterminate the foreign devils > then. > Push aside the railway track. > Pull out the telegraph poles ; > immediately after this destroy the steamers. The Boxer Rebellion was a disaster for China with more foreign involvement in the country. Most of the warring took place in Peking and thus far from the Yangtze River. Chinese ships on the Yangtze Wuhan steamers Yichang or Ichang, 1,600 km (1,000 mi) from the sea, is the head of regular navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to Hankow, a distance of almost 1,000 km (almost 600 mi) from the sea. For about 320 km (about 200 mi) inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level. Qing dynasty naval gunboat Nanchen (ÂçóÁêõ) The Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the Beiyang Fleet, which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese rebuilt its fleet, only to have it ravaged by another war with Japan in 1895, the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time. Commercial involvement The commercial firms of Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire, and Standard Oil had their own steamers on the river. Until 1881, the India and China coastal and river services were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., a public company under the management of Jardines. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardines established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. With the Treaty Ports, the European powers and Japan were allowed to float navy ships into China's internal waters. The British, US and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: Austro-Hungarians, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, and German navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The French Banque de l'Indochine was among the members of a western banking syndicate given control of China‚Äôs finances. French civil servants took control of China's postal service. In 1901 the French gunboat Orly was detached from the Far East Squadron for a cruise up the Yangtze Kiang, under the command of Lieutenant de Vaisseau Emile Hourst . The Olry was accompanied by the steam launch Takiang as far as Chunking which it reached on November 13, thus becoming the first French gunboat to reach the Upper Yangtze river. Subsequently, Lieutenant de Vaisseau Emile Hourst continued on in a vain search for an inland waterway linking Szechwan with Tonkin. The Olry very nearly was taken in a sinking in the Three Gorges in 1911. It hit the shore and damaged its rudder; out of control, it nearly foundered. However, excellent boatmanship and improvisation saved the day and the vessel. The Orly was followed by several French gunboats based in Shanghai and patrolling the Yangtze River up till the Second World War The Japanese engaged in open war with the Chinese twice, and Russians twice, over conquest of the Chinese Qing empire‚Äîin the First and Second Sino-Japanese War 1895, and 1905; and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. Incidentally, both the French and Japanese navies were heavily involved in running Vietnamese opium and narcotics to Shanghai, where it was refined into morphine. It was then trans- shipped by liner back to Marseilles and France (i.e. French Connection) for processing in Germany and eventual sale in the US or Europe. Izumo in Shanghai in 1937; she sank riverboats in 1941 Steamers came late to the upper river. The Three Gorges had 404 individual rapids and the strong 15 knot current hindered navigation. Archibald Little attempted a voyage with the Lee-Chuan, and the Kuling, delays and weak engines meant that he only succeeded in the first vessel in 1898. Little soon built the first truly successful boat, the Pioneer, in about 1899. In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to ChongqingShe plied the river for two more decades and was even the flagship for the Royal Navy on the China Station. There were a few commercial steamers on the upper river at the turn of the century and the Boxer Rebellion period. In 1909 the gunboat USS Samar changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to Nanking and Wuhu. Following anti-foreign riots in Changsha in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to Hankow and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the United States Asiatic Fleet that year, which had been re-established by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \\"American interests in the Orient.\\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on 1 July 1911. After staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to take on coal. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and Ichang in September, where she overwintered, owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at Wuchang in October 1911. Tensions eased, and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial warlords in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze river steamer that damaged her bow. The private China Merchants Shipping Company was founded by Hong Kong merchants and ran steamers on the river, as did the Yangtze Rapid Steamer Company after 1920. The seamen's strikes were staged by the seamen at Hong Kong and by the crews of the Yangtse River steamers early in 1922. The Hong Kong seamen held out for eight weeks. After a bitter and bloody struggle, the British imperialist authorities in Hong Kong were finally forced to raise wages, lift the ban on the Seamen's Union, release the arrested workers and indemnify the families of the martyrs. The crews of the Yangtze steamers went on strike soon afterwards, carried on the struggle for two weeks and also won victory. Increased US presence USS Isabel (SP-521) making smoke ca. 1919. (The photograph has also been identified as showing her on the Yangtze River in 1921). The Spanish built boats that we absorbed into the US Navy after the loss of the Philippines were replaced by newer vessels for US Navy service in the 1920s. Luzon and Mindanao were the largest, Oahu and Panay next in size, and Guam and Tutuila the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the twentieth century, was in low- grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the Nanking Incident in 1927 when the Communists and Nationalists broke into open war. Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of the Communists in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, US Marines with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second USS Palos protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Yichang and Chongqing throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army. HMS Ladybird was a large China gunboat and was attacked with the USS Panay by the Japanese. She served gallantly at Tobruk too. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An, and Mei Hsia on the river, in addition to many motor barges, launches, tugboats and other tankers. These three tankers, the largest in the oil company's fleet, operated on the river until 1937 when they were bombed by the Japanese in the USS Panay incident.Mender, P., Thirty Years a Mariner in the Far East, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, a Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, In the second half of 1934 Settle arrived in China, tasked with sailing USS Palos (PG-16) 1,300 miles (2,100 km) up the Yangtze River from Wusong to Chongqing. Palos, a gunboat stationed around Shanghai since 1914, had recently been refitted and over time became twice as heavy against her original displacement (340 vs. 180 tons), making her hardly capable of the upstream journey. In 1929 alone, of 67 Yangtze steamers three were totally destroyed by the rapids with 47 casualties; a thousand junk sailors perished every year. Royal Navy boats on the Yangtze River Of course, the Royal Navy had three generations of gunboats on the Yangtze River spanning fifty years. The first were the Heron-class river gunboats, of which HMS Nightingale [1897-98]; and HMS Robin, HMS Sandpiper, HMS Snipe served on Yangtze and West Rivers until 1914 and were sold in 1919. Later, in the Woodcock Class of gunboats came into service: these included the Woodcock, Moorhen, Teal and Widgeon. The Insect-class gunboats, built in Britain for service on the Danube in 1915, were moved to the China Station and the Yangtze River in the 1920s. Concomitant to the Insect class were the Dragonfly class of smaller boats‚ÄîDragonfly, Grasshopper, Locust and Mosquito. Unfortunately, most of these became casualties of war in 1942 with the Japanese attacks. In 1926 the Wanhsien incident, brought the attention of the perils of China. A local warlord seized the Swire steamer Wahsien and held ship and officers for ransom. British gunboats attended and fired. The officers escaped, and the gunboats shelled the shoreline, from where the Chinese were firing rifles and artillery at the boats. (See HMS Cockchafer (1915).) Japanese takeover On January 28, 1932, the Japanese attacked the Chinese nationalists around Shanghai. Around midnight, Japanese carrier aircraft bombed the city in the first major aircraft carrier action in the Far East. Three thousand Japanese troops proceeded to attack various targets, such as train stations, around the city. From 1931 to 1933, the cruiser Tenry≈´ was assigned to patrol the Yangtze River and was thus in combat during the January 28 Incident at Shanghai in 1932. The Battle of Shanghai of 1937 was the first of the twenty-two major engagements fought between the National Revolutionary Army, Republic of China and the Imperial Japanese Army, Empire of Japan during the Second Sino- Japanese War. It was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the entire war. On August 13, 1937, the Japanese and Chinese exchanged fire in Shanghai in the ongoing war. The Chinese 88th Division retaliated with mortar attacks. Sporadic shooting continued through the day until 4pm, when the Japanese headquarters ordered the naval ships of the Third Fleet, stationed in the Yangtze and the Huangpu River to open fire on Chinese positions in the city. In the late night of August 13, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Zhang Zhizhong to begin the Chinese offensive the next day. On August 22, the Japanese 3rd, 8th, and 11th Divisions made an amphibious assault under cover from naval bombardments and proceeded to land in Chuanshakou (Â∑ùÊ≤ôÂè£), Shizilin (ÁçÖÂ≠êÊûó), and Baoshan (ÂØ∂Â±±), towns on the northeast coast some fifty kilometers away from downtown Shanghai. Japanese landings in northeast Shanghai suburban areas meant that many Chinese troops, who were deployed in Shanghai's urban center, had to be redeployed to coastal regions to counter the landings. HMS Moth as captured IJN Suma in 1942 The Japanese navy shelled Shanghai from its warships. It used ships to support the Army in Shanghai and Nanking. A task force of over 100 ships was used to move forces upriver and take Hankow (now Wuhan) in the summer of 1938. Japanese aircraft sank two Chinese naval cruisers guarding the river during these actions. With the Japanese advance into the east coast of China in 1937, enterprises and numerous people withdrew from Wuhan to the west and Sichuan. The Kuomintang navy undertook the responsibility of defending the Yangtze River and covering the withdrawal. On 24 October, while patrolling the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou, in Wuchang (Jiangxia, Wuhan), the Zhongshan was bombed by six Japanese aircraft . The aircraft dived, strafed and bombed the Zhongshan. Despite shooting down two of the aircraft, the Zhongshan eventually sank due to the serious damage she had sustained. Twenty-five Chinese officers and soldiers were killed in the battle. The USS Panay Incident The most infamous incident was the Panay incident, when USS Panay and HMS Bee were dive-bombed by Japanese aircraft in late 1937 during the Rape of Nanking. The tanker Mei Ping was sunk in the same attack. After that outrage, much of the population and government of China fled inland to the wartime capital at Chungking, thousands of journeys were made by steamer. Whole factories, libraries, and households were picked up and moved up the perilous river. Even the National Palace Art Collection, the storied treasure of the Chinese Emperors, was boxed and moved inland. Junks, carts, and sampans were pressed into service, and cargoes kedged through the Three Gorge Rapids, with ropes and gangs of men. USS Panay sunk on the Yangtze River In 1939 the Japanese put further restrictions on foreign shipping on the lower Yangtze, trying to undo the near British Monopoly. The Europeans were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover of the Settlements in 1941. The Japanese sank HMS Peterel with naval gunfire. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. The Post War Period The Dollar Liner President Hoover was attacked by Chinese Nationalists at Shanghai by planes in 1937 After the Japanese surrender, the Communists and the Nationalists continued their civil war. The Americans and British tried to re- instate their presence as it had been before the war, but following the communist takeover in 1949, non-Chinese shipping companies ceased operations on the Yangtze. In 1949, the SS Shenking of the Butterfield and Swire Line made an epic rescue of stranded civilians from Shanghai, running them across the China Sea to Keelung, Formosa. One river ferry sank in 1947, drowning 400 people. Mao and the Chinese Communist Party journeyed upriver by steamer in 1959 to Lushan to the Lushan Conference to discuss the Great Leap Forward. However, little is known in the west about this period, as China became a closed country. Many retired North American steamers were sent to Japan or Taiwan for scrapping. Some were pressed into mainland china service. By the 1970s China embarked on its own ship and engine building programs, and steamers have since been replaced by diesel tugs, freighters and ferry boats.

Some areas on the northeast portion of the proposed reservation were excluded to allow mining in the headwaters of the Clarks Fork River. The land was, in effect, the first national forest. For the time being, it was placed under the same military administration that applied to Yellowstone Park proper. In 1902 lands were exchanged with the Teton Forest Reserve and the reserve was placed under civilian administration, with the first ranger station in the nation established at Wapiti on the Shoshone River. Artist and rancher Abraham Archibald Anderson was named as the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. On January 9, 1903 lands of the first Absaroka and Teton Forest Reserves were added, and on March 4, 1907 it became Yellowstone National Forest. In 1905 all federal forests were transferred to the U.S. Forest Service. On July 1, 1908 as part of a major reorganization, the forest was divided into Targhee, Teton, Wyoming, Bonneville, Absaroka, Shoshone and Beartooth National Forests, and the name was discontinued.

The first same-sex marriage in Spain to take place after the Roman Imperial era occurred on 8 June 1901. Two women, Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa S√°nchez Loriga, attempted to get married in A Coru√±a (Galicia, Spain). To achieve it Elisa had to adopt a male identity: Mario S√°nchez, as listed on the marriage certificate. It is the first attempt at same-sex marriage in Spain for which there is recorded evidence. It was performed by the Church, in the parish church of Saint George of the same city. The marriage certificate was never annulled. Their matrimonial union took place more than 100 years before same-sex couples were permitted to be married in Spain. The two worked as teachers at a time when the vast majority of the Galician population was illiterate. This event could be considered a precedent for same-sex marriage in Spain. News of their wedding was spread to all Spain and to various European countries. The couple escaped to Argentina. First encounter, separation and reunion Church of Saint George (Igrexa de San Xurxo), in A Coru√±a, where Elisa and Marcela got married. Marcela and Elisa met while studying in the Teacher-Training College for Teachers in A Coru√±a, where the future teachers of elementary education were educated. Their friendship gave way to a more intimate relationship. Marcela's parents, seeing that the friendship was growing beyond what was socially permitted and fearing a possible scandal, sent their daughter to Madrid. Time went by and both, one in A Coru√±a and the other in Madrid, finished their studies. They were reunited again when Elisa was appointed as a temporary teacher at Couso, a small parish of Coristanco in A Coru√±a. Nearby, in Vimianzo, in the village of Calo, Marcela established herself already as a superior teacher. As a consequence of the same, they decided to live together in Calo, where Elisa worked. In 1889, Marcela had to go to teach classes at Dumbr√≠a while Elisa remained in Calo, but they stayed in contact until Elisa moved to the town where Marcela lived. False identity and marriage In 1901, Elisa adopted a masculine appearance (with which she appeared in the Teaching College to apply for a certificate of study), fabricated a past, and was transformed into Mario. For this invented past, she took as reference a cousin of hers killed in a shipwreck. Furthermore, she made up that she had passed her childhood in London and that her father was an atheist. Considering this last circumstance, Father Cortiella, parish priest of San Jorge, baptized Mario on 26 May 1901 (furthermore, he received first communion), and subsequently married the couple on 8 June 1901 after the publication of the banns. The marriage ceremony was short; the sponsors bore witness to its validity; and the couple passed the night of the wedding in the boarding house Corcubi√≥n, on the street of San Andr√©s. Consequences La Voz de Galicia, 1901-06-30. Finally, the neighbours could not remain indifferent as before, with what was at the moment known as \\"a marriage without a man\\". The couple were exposed by Galician and Madrid newspapers and, as a consequence of this, both quickly lost their jobs, were excommunicated, and were issued an arrest warrant. It appears that, so that the excommunication could take place, the parish priest requested a doctor examine Mario to check if he was a man or a woman. Mario agreed. When the doctor issued his verdict, Mario attempted to pass for a hermaphrodite whose condition had been diagnosed in London. The Civil Guard pursued the couple to the town of Dumbr√≠as, where they both worked as teachers. There is evidence that they passed for Vigo and Oporto in their escape. The last that is known of them is that they managed to board a ship destined for South America (possibly Argentina, as so many other Spaniards of the era), where they spent their honeymoon and, finally, stayed to live. One of the cases that one of the courts took against them was closed. Several years later, some residents of Dumbr√≠a spread a rumour about the death of Elisa and the subsequent marriage of Marcela to a man. This rumour has not been confirmed. The wedding, according to the Diocesan Archive, is still valid, as neither the Church nor the civil registry annulled the marriage certificates, so this is the first recorded same-sex marriage in Spain. On 18 December 2008, the book Elisa e Marcela ‚Äì Al√©n dos homes (Elisa and Marcela ‚Äì Beyond men), by Narciso de Gabriel, was published in A Coru√±a. The 300-page book, written in Galician, tells the story of the two women from the time they fled Coru√±a in 1901 until 1904. It narrates the events in Porto, Portugal, where they were imprisoned, tried, and later released. They fled to Argentina after the Spanish government demanded their extradition from Portugal. Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa S√°nchez Loriga after their arrest Before leaving Porto for the Americas, Marcela gave birth to a girl. After they landed in Buenos Aires, Elisa (under the alias of Maria) married Christian Jensen, a wealthy immigrant from Denmark 24 years her senior, in 1903. Marcela, under the alias of Carmen, stayed there with his sister and her daughter. Elisa refused to consummate the marriage with Jensen. He grew suspicious and tried to have the marriage annulled on the grounds that Elisa wasn't, in fact, a woman. This claim was never substantiated: Three medical examinations confirmed that Elisa was a woman. Since the marriage was between a man and a woman, and therefore valid, no charges were brought against Elisa. After this time, there is no further record of Marcela and Elisa. Social and legal impact In current media the courage of these two women is emphasized, stressing that they went into history as the first gay marriage in Spain. Isa√≠as Lafuente (editor in chief of Cadena SER), in his book Agrup√©monos Todas, looks at the highlights of feminism in the twentieth century and indicates the story of Marcela and Elisa as one of the most significant events related to the movement occurring in Galicia (another is the figure of Emilia Pardo Baz√°n). The group Milhomes founded the Marcela and Elisa Award, which, with the help of the FELGTB, is already in its sixth edition. At that time, Milhomes was headed by Jose Carlos Alonso S√°nchez. They also claim a long street with their name in A Coru√±a, with little success so far. In 1902 the book La sed de amar, by the Extremaduran writer Felipe Trigo, was published in Spain. This was a book of great impact in that period. It includes the story of Marcela and Elisa, using the names of Rosa and Claudia, respectively. The profile of these two women and the story of their relationship is transcribed to the fiction of the book with almost total equivalence to the real story. Felipe Trigo's own footnotes in one edition of the book state that the story is real and happened in A Coru√±a in 1901. First documented marriage between people of the same sex in 1061 Nowadays this event is considered one of the oldest precursors to same- sex marriage in Spain. However, it may not actually have been the first. In the Middle Ages, a same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro D√≠az and Mu√±o Vandilaz in the Galician municipality of Rairiz de Veiga was recorded on 16 April 1061. They were married by a local priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova in Celanova, Ourense, from where they were transferred to the National Historical Archive of Madrid.Primer matrimonio homosexual en Galicia It is not known whether the priest was aware of the gender of both. 2005 legislation Same-sex marriage was legalized in Spain in 2005, by law 13/2005. The first same-sex marriage under that law took place on 11 July of that year, in Tres Cantos, Madrid, between Emilio Menendez and Carlos Baturin, who had lived as a couple for more than thirty years. The first marriage of two women under the law was 11 days later, in Barcelona. Representation in film The story of Marcela Gracia Ibeas and Elisa S√°nchez Loriga was the basis of the 2019 film Elisa & Marcela, directed by Isabel Coixet. R√∫a Marcela e Elisa. Today Recently, an Argentine lady, Norma Graciela Moure, discovered she is the great-granddaughter of Marcela who went by the name Marcela Carmen Garcia in Argentina. It is not known what happened to Elisa.

Formed in 2004, Dead Loretta got its start when songwriters Danny Boles and Marky Degz decided to expand their acoustic duo project \\"Bruce Lee's Grave\\" into a four- piece rock band. Heavily influenced by 1960s British Invasion and local pop heroes The Spinto Band, the original lineup consisted of Degz on lead vocals/guitar, Boles on lead guitar/vocals, Brian Lafferty on bass/harmonica, Andrew Kerstetter on drums, and Alex McGrellis on keyboards. History Dead Loretta played its first show in June 2005 at My Place Tavern in Dover, opening for the band She Slash He. Later that same year, the group released an EP entitled Bring A Date. The five song disc included a jangly pop number called \\"Miranda\\", which caught the ear of Vanstock Records owner Dwight Lyghtning, who immediately signed the band. Miranda enjoyed airplay in Delaware's 93.7 WSTW and New York's WECW 107.7. Shortly thereafter, as the band began work on their full-length album, Kerstetter departed and was replaced by Max Pressman. Alex McGrellis also left the band to pursue acting, eventually landing a role in Rocky VI. With a new drummer and a record deal, Dead Loretta began recording their full length self-titled album, with Brett Stewart of Deep Groove Studios. Degz penned the singles \\"Symphony of Wasted Youth\\" & \\"Brooklyn\\", while Boles contributed \\"Spain vs. Portugal\\" & \\"Dirt Bike\\". During this time, the band shared the stage with various international acts, including Pete Doherty's side project Littl'ans, legendary Smashing Orange front man Rob Montejo, Brian Jonestown Massacre collaborator Christopher Tucker, and Rolling Stone Magazine featured band The Singles. Despite Dead Loretta's progress, they were abruptly dropped from Vanstock Records after Degz and Dwight Lyghtning engaged in a heated altercation midway through a show at Mojo 13 in Wilmington in December 2007. Degz reportedly threw his guitar to the ground and stormed out of the club amidst a hailstorm of boos and heckling from rowdy audience members. This would be the band's final live performance. The full-length album, to this date, has not been released.

The hydropower project is also the biggest hydropower project of Nepal. The dam and headworks are situated on the Gandaki River at the confluence of the Andhikhola whereas the power house is located downstream, around a bend in the river, in Beltari (About 7 km towards the South-East of Mirmi). A long headrace tunnel connects the reservoir to the power station which contains three 48 MW Francis turbine-generators. Owner and operator of the power plant is Nepal Electricity Authority. It is a run-of- river type of project and currently is the largest power plant of any kind in Nepal with an installed capacity of 144 MW. Construction started in the year 1997 and was completed in the year 2002. The three turbine & generators Toshiba Make were commissioned in March, April and May 2002. It was constructed primarily to curb the ever increasing energy demand at that time and eliminate loadshedding prevalent due to the imbalance in demand and supply of energy. It was constructed with the financial aid of the Asian Development Bank with total costs reaching US$354.8 million (50 billion NPR (approx)). Hydrology and Sediments The Kali Gandaki River originates in the high Himalayas carrying high sediment load. The river generates a suspended sediment load of 43 Mt/yr, of which around 25 per cent consists of sand. This sand has a high concentration of highly abrasive angular quartz. About 95 per cent of this suspended sediment load is delivered during the monsoon, between late May and late September and is large enough to completely fill the reservoir in a single monsoon season. Data on discharge, suspended sand concentration in the river, and on the flow diverted into the turbines is shown in figure 3. The suspended sand concentration in the river and delivered to the turbines suddenly spikes in early June. This corresponds to the date that the reservoir level is lowered, thereby mobilising sand. The sand concentration drops again when the reservoir level is brought back up to its impounding level, reducing both the flow velocity through the reservoir and the rate of sand transport. This sluicing procedure has nearly stabilised reservoir capacity, producing a sediment balance across the reservoir. https://www.hydropower.org/case-studies/nepal-kali-gandaki Transmission line The power generated by the three turbines is evacuated to the central grid via a 132kV single circuit, a long transmission line to Pokhara, and a double circuit transmission line to Butwal. The electricity is sent to Lekhnath Municipality and Butwal (known as Butwal-1 and Butwal-2). A sub- station has been constructed in Lekhnath Municipality, Kaski district and the existing Jogikuti substation in Butwal has been upgraded.

The barge was completed converted to cable work for U.S. Army Signal Corps as the cable ship Col. William. A. Glassford supporting the Alaska Communications System in the shallow island waters of Alaska.The \\"prefix\\" USASPB associated with the vessel is an error. The Army's designation of self propelled barges was Barge, Self Propelled (BSP). Smaller vessels simply had the designation \\"U.S. Army\\" and a number without being named. Some vessels were named but also bore the usual Army identification. The use can be seen in this photo of Col. William. A. Glassford in which \\"U.S. Army\\" is followed by \\"B.S.P. 2008\\" with Glassford underneath on the hull. She was transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1947 as a miscellaneous auxiliary and assigned to cable- laying duties for the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The ship was sold to commercial interests in 1960 becoming United States Underseas Cable Corporation's Omega in 1961. Omega did cable work in the Navy's Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) and laid shore ends for part of the Air Force's Atlantic Missile Range and the Vietnam Coastal Network connecting coastal centers in Vietnam and a terminus in Thailand. In 1971 the ship, along with the company's larger cable layer were sold to a Liberian registered company set up to buy the two ships. Omega ceased cable operations after the sale and may have been scrapped in 1975. Construction The vessel built in 1943 as the Army self propelled barge BSP-2098 by the Seattle Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Corp., Seattle, Washington. The barge was one of two converted to a cable ship to be operated for the U.S. Army Signal Corps as Col. William A. Glassford.)BSP 2009 was converted to the cable ship Col. Basil O. Lenoir.Col. William A. Glassford was a career Army Signal Corps officer, father of Vice Admiral William A. Glassford. The two barges were completed as vessels suited to shallow water work in Alaska with triple screws, two cable tanks capable of holding 400 tons of cable, three bow sheaves, and a Sundfelt combined paying out-picking up cable machine. U.S. Army Col. William A. Glassford and Col. Basil O. Lenoir specialized in cable work in extreme shallow waters in the Alaskan islands. The ships supported the Alaska Communications System for the U.S. Air Force.Col. Basil O. Lenoir would remain in Alaska after the U.S. Air Force took over the cable system becoming an Air Force vessel until sold to RCA in 1973. The wartime cable work in Alaska was so urgent that cable machinery originally intended for the vessel was diverted to equip the cable ship Silverado which Col. William A. Glassford joined in Alaska on completion. U.S. Navy The ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy 20 June 1947; and commissioned as Nashawena (AG‚Äì142) the same day, Lt. William K. Bickenbach in command. Nashawena soon commenced cable laying and tending services in the 12th Naval District and in the 14th Naval District for the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory. Reclassified YAG‚Äì35, 9 September 1947, she continued to provide communications maintenance until decommissioned at Mare Island, her homeport 17 August 1953. She was then turned over to the Naval Station, Treasure Island, California, where she operated briefly with the status ‚Äúin service‚Äù before entering the Pacific Reserve Fleet at the end of the year. Commercial service Nashawena was sold to Anthony Zahardis, 1 June 1960 and towed from Treasure Island, 3 July, and subsequently struck from the Naval Register. In 1961 ship was owned by United States Underseas Cable Corporation, registered commercially with official number 285876 renamed Omega, and made available for charter. CS Omega was used for cable work in the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center. In 1962 the United States Underseas Cable Corporation won an Air Force contract to lay cable supporting the Atlantic Missile Range. Western Electric Company was responsible for the main range but Underseas Cable Corporation was to lay cable connecting Grand Turk to Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico with of cable with nineteen repeaters and a second stage of cable with twenty-one repeaters connecting Ramey with Coolidge Air Force Base, Antigua. Omega laid all the shore ends of these segments. Omega laid the shore ends of the Air Force Vietnam Coastal Network system in 1967 at Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Bay, Vung Tau, in Vietnam and then at Ban Sattahip, Thailand. In 1971 the ship was sold to International Marine Operations Inc., registered in Liberia, set up for the purchase of the two Underseas Cable Corporation vessels NeptunBuilt 1962 by Lubecker Flenderwerke A.G., as bulk carrier.

Dog grooming refers to both the hygienic care and cleaning of a dog, as well as a process by which a dog's physical appearance is enhanced for showing or other types of competition. A dog groomer (or simply \\"groomer\\") is a person who earns their living grooming dogs. Reasons for grooming Grooming a dog using a shedding blade. Grooming is a vital part in the well-being and healthiness of a dog, which can improve its quality of life. How much grooming a dog needs depends on its breed, age, and health. Regular grooming helps to ensure the dog is healthy and comfortable. While many dogs shed, others such as the poodle, do not shed as profusely and require grooming every 4-8 weeks. The main reasons for daily grooming include: * decreased chance of various health problems, such as thrush, scratches, and other skin problems * general cleanliness of the dog * monitoring of the dog's health by checking for cuts, hot spots, swelling, lameness, or changes in temperament, all of which could be indicative of illness * forging of a closer bond between dog and owner *reducing infestation load of external parasites on skin *avoid matting that can potentially cause health concerns like skin irritation or the entrapment of harmful bacteria in the coatA Haircut Could Save a Life: Preventing Your Pet's Coat from Matting. https://www.aspca.org/news/haircut-could-save-life- preventing-your-pets-coat-matting. Retrieved 22 February 2019 Tools and supplies Various types of currycombs Types of brushes and combs *Curry or curry brush: A tool made of rubber or plastic with short \\"teeth.\\" The tool is rubbed (or \\"curried\\") over the dog's coat to loosen dirt, hair, and other detritus, and stimulate the skin into producing natural oils. They are more commonly used on dogs that have large amounts of shedding, like German Shepherds. They are also used for untangling knots in certain parts of the dog's body, such as ears, paws, or tail. Using a currycomb must be done carefully, as the action of this type of tool can harm the skin of the dog if pulled too hard. A shedding blade *Shedding blade: A metal blade (or \\"sweat scraper\\") with short, dull teeth that is used to remove dead hair from certain types of harsh coats, as well as remove matted fur. The shedding blade is not used to cut the hair. *Slicker brush: A brush with fine, short wires close together on a flat surface. It is used on medium-to-long-haired or curly- haired dogs to remove mats. Slicker brushes are typically used after primarily brushing with a bristle or a wire pin brush. They are used to smooth the coat and to take out mats and tangles. They consist of fine wire pins that are secured to a flat base. The pins are bent at an angle approximately halfway down the pin. For heavier and thicker coats, it is recommended to use a brush with stiffer pins. This type of brush comes in a wide range of sizes and degrees of pin stiffness. *Rake: Brush designed to penetrate into a dog's thick coat and remove tangles and dead undercoat near the dog's skin. It is often shaped like a shaving razor and features one or two rows of tightly- spaced pins. Rakes are important grooming tools, especially for double-coated dogs, such as Newfoundlands or Siberian Huskies. *Bristle brush: One of the most widely used types of brushes due to its versatility. Typically, the bristle brush is used on dogs with long coats to finish the coat and to bring out the natural lustre and shine. It is commonly used in daily grooming, as it removes surface dust and dirt. It is important to note that bristle brushes are a finishing tool; they generally do not penetrate the coat. Dogs brushed with a bristle brush only will frequently appear well groomed but will be matted beneath the outer layer. As a general rule, longer and widely spaced bristles are suitable for dogs with longer coats, and shorter and tightly- packed ones are better to use on dogs with short hair. *Wire pin brush: Has an oval shape and metal bristles set in a flexible rubber base. Useful in separating and untangling the hair of long, wiry, wavy, and curly coated dogs. Some wire pin brushes have polished or coated pins, which prevent scratching the dog's skin during use. Because the coating or polish may wear off over time, the pins should be replaced periodically. Pin brushes come in a variety of sizes, textures, and fullness. *Combination pin/bristle brush: has two different sides - one with bristles, which can be successfully used for grooming the short hair areas of the coat, and another side with pins that can be used for long-coated and double-coated dogs. *Mat comb: Designed to 'cut' matted hair from the dog's coat without leaving a bald spot. A stainless steel comb to groom dogs with a coarse or fine coat *Stripping combs/knives: Tools used to help grab the longer hairs on a harsh coat and pull them out by the root. Helps maintain a proper coat in many terriers and schnauzers. Most often used on show dogs. Other supplies *Shears and clippers: Cutting tools used to remove/shorten hair on certain types of coats or from sensitive areas. Not all types of coats are suitable for clipping, i.e. double coats on breeds such as Border Collies, which should not be clipped unless the dog is matted. The typical pair of shears for dog grooming is between 6.5 and 9 inches long, longer than human hair dressing shears. Some are designed with a blunt tip to prevent any injuries due to movement. *Stand dryers, cage driers, and hand driers: Used to dry the dog's coat. Drying a dog with a dryer designed for humans is not recommended, as it may cause scalp irritation, dry skin, or skin sores. *Shampoos and conditioners: Owners are recommended to use only shampoos, conditioners, and rinses that are especially designed for dogs. *Grooming tables: Tables that provide a secure and productive environment for grooming, but many single dog owners can avoid this expense by simply using what is available in the home. They are normally used by professional groomers and owners who have dogs that enter competitive shows. Bathing Dogs can be bathed in a sink, walk-in shower, or bathtub; they can even be bathed outside using a garden hose, provided that the water is sufficiently warm enough to prevent hypothermia. Dogs should be bathed with warm water, as hot water can scald the skin. Dogs with a heavy or matted coat should never be bathed without first being completely brushed out or clipped of any mats. Many types of shampoos and conditioners formulated for dogs are available. For dense and double-coated dogs, pre-mixing the shampoo with water will help ensure a more even distribution of the shampoo. Do not lather the head, as grooming products can be irritating if they come in contact with the eyes. Additionally, excess water may become trapped in the ear canal, leading to secondary ear infections. Fully rinse the dog after shampooing, as residual chemicals may become irritating to the skin. Most dogs do not require frequent bathing; shampooing a coat too often can strip the coat of its natural oils, causing it to dry out. Dental care is very important and can be addressed while grooming. The dental kits available on the market include everything from special toothpaste to toothbrushes. Many models of toothbrushes include a flexible three-head design, which maintains the proper pressure on all surfaces of the tooth with every stroke. These brushes have side bristles set at 45-degree angles to reduce arm twisting and soft outer bristles for massaging the gums. Toothpaste designed to be used on dogs is usually sugar free toothpaste with different flavoring. Foaming or rinsing is not necessary. Finishing touches can be added with finishing supplies, including perfumed sprays, ribbons and many other accessories. Hair removal Slicker brush used for removal of loose hair and knots The coats of many breeds require trimming, cutting, or other attention. Styles vary by breed and discipline. While some hair removal has its origins in practical purposes, much is based on the taste of the owner, whether or not the dog will be shown, and what work the dog does. A six-month-old Lhasa Apso before and after a visit to a professional groomer. The rubber grooming gloves and dog brushes are intended to drag loose hair from the short-coated dogs and are some of the most popular grooming tools amongst pet owners. They are easy to use by massaging the coat in firm strokes, and have the advantage of being suitable for both wet and dry coats. Some breeds of dog, such as the Lhasa Apso, do not shed, but have hair that grows constantly. As such, the fur around the legs and belly can get very long and become matted, and the hair around the eyes can impair the dog's vision. In such circumstances, hair trimming can be performed to keep the eyes clear and keep the coat free of knots. Hand stripping The coats of Border Terriers must be stripped. Here an unstripped adult Border Terrier (left) is shown with a puppy. The body of this adult Border Terrier has been stripped. Stripping or hand-stripping is the process of pulling the dead hair out of the coat of a non-shedding dog, either by using a stripping knife or the fingers. A hard, wiry coat has a cycle where it starts growing and then sheds as it reaches maximum length. Hand-stripping coordinates the shedding and makes room for a new coat to grow. Stripping is the proper grooming method for most terriers, spaniels, and many other breeds. The hair is removed with either a stripping knife or stripping stone, with the top coat removed to reveal the dense, soft undercoat. If done correctly, the procedure is painless. Many dogs are reported to enjoy having their hair stripped, especially when they are introduced to it as puppies. Nail trimming  Nail trimming is essential for maintaining good health. If a dog's nails are allowed to grow, they will curl over into a spiral shape; walking will become increasingly painful. Uncut nails may curl so far that they pierce the paw pad, leading to infection and debilitating pain. Long nails can put pressure on the toe joints, even causing the joints of the forelimb to be realigned. This can cause the animal to have unequal weight distribution and be more prone to injuries. Longer nails are also more likely to be forcibly ripped or torn off, causing serious pain to the animal.Flaim, D. (2016). The Importance of Clipping Dogs' Nails. Whole Dog Journal, (April 2016). Retrieved August 24, 2019 from https://www.whole-dog- journal.com/issues/19_4/features/Nail-Clipping_21430-1.html It becomes increasingly difficult to maneuver nail clippers between the paw pad and tip of the nail as the nails grow longer. Owners may choose to trim nails themselves or may opt to take their pet to a groomer or veterinarian. Nail trimming is done with a nail clipper. In addition, handheld rotary tools are often used to smooth sharp edges caused by nail clippers. There are two main types of nail clippers: guillotine trimmers and standard scissor- and plier- style trimmers. Guillotine trimmers have a hole at the end through which the dog's nail is inserted; then, as the handles of the tool are squeezed together, an internal blade lops off the end of the nail. The scissor-style trimmer is most effective on nails that have grown too long and are now in the shape of a circle or coil. Creative  Additional options that some groomers provide include services such as colouring dogs' fur and painting dogs' nails. While traditional grooming achieves to conform with breed standards set by the official breed associations, creative grooming heads to the opposite direction, creating a unique, sometimes exquisite look. The lighter version of creative grooming is known as pet tuning and is more owner-oriented, adjusting the pets' visual appearance to their owners' amusement or life style, while the creative grooming is more of an art form, therefore more artist (groomer) oriented.

Short biography Stickelberger was born in Buch in the canton of Schaffhausen into a family of a pastor. He graduated from a gymnasium in 1867 and studied next in the University of Heidelberg. In 1874 he received a doctorate in Berlin under the direction of Karl Weierstrass for his work on the transformation of quadratic forms to a diagonal form. In the same year, he obtained his Habilitation from Polytechnicum in Zurich (now ETH Zurich). In 1879 he became an extraordinary professor in the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg. From 1896 to 1919 he worked there as a full professor, and from 1919 until his return to Basel in 1924 he held the title of a distinguished professor (\\"ordentlicher Honorarprofessor\\"). He was married in 1895, but his wife and son both died in 1918. Stickelberger died on April 11, 1936, and was buried next to his wife and son in Freiburg. Mathematical contributions Stickelberger's obituary lists the total of 14 publications: his thesis (in Latin), 8 further papers that he authored which appeared during his lifetime, 4 joint papers with Georg Frobenius and a posthumously published paper written circa 1915. Despite this modest output, he is characterized there as \\"one of the sharpest among the pupils of Weierstrass\\" and a \\"mathematician of high rank\\". Stickelberger's thesis and several later papers streamline and complete earlier investigations of various authors, in a direct and elegant way. Linear algebra Stickelberger's work on the classification of pairs of bilinear and quadratic forms filled in important gaps in the theory earlier developed by Weierstrass and Darboux. Augmented with the contemporaneous work of Frobenius, it set the theory of elementary divisors upon a rigorous foundation. An important 1878 paper of Stickelberger and Frobenius gave the first complete treatment of the classification of finitely generated abelian groups and sketched the relation with the theory of modules that had just been developed by Dedekind. Number theory Three joint papers with Frobenius deal with the theory of elliptic functions. Today Stickelberger's name is most closely associated with his 1890 paper that established the Stickelberger relation for cyclotomic Gaussian sums. This generalized earlier work of Jacobi and Kummer and was later used by Hilbert in his formulation of the reciprocity laws in algebraic number fields. The Stickelberger relation also yields information about the structure of the class group of a cyclotomic field as a module over its abelian Galois group (cf Iwasawa theory).

It explains the metaphysics of the universe in the frame of the tradition of Advaita Vedanta. In the Hindu mythology, Dakshinamurti is an incarnation of Shiva, the supreme god of knowledge. Dakshinamurti is an aspect of Shiva as a guru of all types of knowledge, and bestower of jnana. This aspect of Shiva is his personification as the supreme or the ultimate awareness, understanding and knowledge.* This form represents Shiva in his aspect as a teacher of yoga, music, and wisdom, and giving exposition on the shastras. Unlike most of the stotras of Hindu gods, which are in the form of description of anthropomorphic forms, or mythological deeds of those gods, Dakshinamurti Stotra takesform of conceptual and philosophical statements. Repeated chanting and/or meditating on the meaning of these verses is expected to help a spiritual practitioner of Advaita vedanta get thoroughly established in an Advaitic experience. The Dakshinamurti Stotra is arguably the most important small verse to be attributed to Adi Shankara. In a compilation of ten stanzas there is a concise and vivid description of the philosophical significance of the form of Siva, giving the very essence of the Indian idea of epistemology. It differs from every other attempt in a very basic sense, in that it is holistic rather than purely reductionist.

His father was an official of the East India Company and served in India for many years before retiring to Vache Park, Buckinghamshire and later to Goldington Grange, Hertfordshire. His actual mother is not yet known, although his step-mother was Harriet Montagu, daughter of the 5th Earl of Sandwich. Army career He joined the Army in 1797 and served 5 years in India with the 25th Regiment of Foot. He saw action at the Battle of Mallavelly, Siege of Seringapatam and at Doondia. At the storming of the fort of Turnioul, he volunteered and led the assault with fifty dismounted dragoons. Over the course of 3 years, he took part in the capture of more than 15 fortresses. By 1806, he was serving with the 21st Fusiliers during the Sicilian campaign, which concluded the War of the Third Coalition with the Battle of Maida. For 1807-1811, he returned to India with the 17th Light Dragoons. He returned to Europe in 1811 and joined the 18th Hussars, within the army under the Duke of Wellington. He saw action at the Battle of Toulouse and the Battle of Waterloo. He was promoted to Lieutenant- Colonel, with effect from the date of Waterloo.

Hepatitis B virus and Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus are the most frequently reported pathogens. Other viruses implicated are hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rotavirus, rubella virus, HIV, and parainfluenza virus. It is named for Ferdinando Gianotti and Agostino Crosti. Presentation Gianotti‚ÄìCrosti syndrome mainly affects infants and young children. Children as young as 1.5 months and up to 12 years of age are reported to be affected. It is generally recognized as a papular or papulovesicular skin rash occurring mainly on the face and distal aspects of the four limbs. Purpura is generally not seen but may develop upon tourniquet test. However, extensive purpura without any hemorrhagic disorder has been reported. The presence of less florid lesions on the trunk does not exclude the diagnosis. Lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly are sometimes noted. Raised AST and ALT levels with no rise in conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels are sometimes detectable, although the absence of such does not exclude the diagnosis. Spontaneous disappearance of the rash usually occurs after 15 to 60 days. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Gianotti‚ÄìCrosti syndrome is clinical. A validated diagnostic criteria is as follows: A patient is diagnosed as having Gianotti‚ÄìCrosti syndrome if: # On at least one occasion or clinical encounter, he/she exhibits all the positive clinical features, # On all occasions or clinical encounters related to the rash, he/she does not exhibit any of the negative clinical features, # None of the differential diagnoses is considered to be more likely than Gianotti‚ÄìCrosti syndrome on clinical judgment, and # If lesional biopsy is performed, the histopathological findings are consistent with Gianotti‚ÄìCrosti syndrome. The positive clinical features are: * Monomorphous, flat-topped, pink-brown papules or papulovesicles 1-10mm in diameter. * At least three of the following four sites involved ‚Äì (1) cheeks, (2) buttocks, (3) extensor surfaces of forearms, and (4) extensor surfaces of legs. * Being symmetrical, and * Lasting for at least ten days. The negative clinical features are: * Extensive truncal lesions, and * Scaly lesions. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnoses are: acrodermatitis enteropathica, erythema infectiosum, erythema multiforme, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura, Kawasaki disease, lichen planus, papular urticaria, papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome, and scabies. Treatment Gianotti-Crosti disease is a harmless and self-limiting condition, so no treatment may be required. Treatment is mainly focused on controlling itching, symptomatic relief and to avoid any further complications. For symptomatic relief from itching, oral antihistamines or any soothing lotions like calamine lotion or zinc oxide may be used. If there are any associated conditions like streptococcal infections, antibiotics may be required.

Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (8th Cir. 1968) was a case decided in 1968 on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States by then-judge Harry Blackmun. It abolished corporal punishment in the Arkansas prison system. Issue The issue in the case was how to apply the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment to the conditions within a prison.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 30. Background Arkansas rules authorized prison officials to beat inmates with a five-foot leather strap known as a \\"bull hide.\\"Greenhouse, Page 30. An earlier suit had resulted in a decision permitting the use of the strap, provided that \\"appropriate safeguards\\" were in place.Greenhouse, Pages 30-31. Blackmun's writings Few precedents had existed for applying the Eighth Amendment to prison conditions.Greenhouse, Page 31. In pre-opinion writings, Blackmun wrote that constitutional standards evolve, as opposed to remaining static; he noted that nearly every state had abandoned corporal punishment in prison.Greenhouse, Page 31. Blackmun supported banning corporal punishment in prisons entirely.Greenhouse, Page 31. Opinion Blackmun held that use of the strap in question is punishment that \\"runs afoul\\" of the Eighth Amendment.Greenhouse, Page 31. He wrote that \\"any so-called safeguard is entirely unworkable\\" and that the strap \\"is abhorrent to public opinion.\\"Greenhouse, Page 31.

The Forest was established on July 2, 1908, by an Executive Order (908) signed by President Theodore Roosevelt that consolidated two existing U.S. Forest Service units, the Guadalupe National Forest, established on April 19, 1907, to protect a part of the Guadalupe Mountains north of the Texas border, and the Sacramento National Forest, established on April 24, 1907, to preserve the heavily forested Sacramento Mountains east of Alamogordo. The new forest encompassed approximately 800,000 acres of public land and was divided into a number of Ranger districts, including the Carson Seep district in the former Guadalupe forest and the Fresnal, La Luz, Mayhill and Weed districts in the former Sacramento forest. The Forest boundaries were enlarged on March 2, 1909, by Presidential Proclamation when Roosevelt removed timber-rich land from the adjacent Mescalero Apache Reservation and added them to the forest.http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=76679 These lands were returned to the Mescalero Apache three years later on March 1, 1912, by an Executive Order (1481) signed by President William Howard Taft, who noted his desire to ‚Äúrestore the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation in all respects to the status existing prior to the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, as though the inclusion of the lands within the Alamo National Forest had not been ordered.‚Äù http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=76658 The final change of boundaries came on April 3, 1916, when President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation both adding to and eliminating lands from the forest area.http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=76676 A little over a year later the Alamo National Forest was disestablished by Executive Order (2633) and the forest‚Äôs lands transferred to the nearby Lincoln National Forest, a former Forest Reserve first established in 1902 to protect lands around Capitan and Lincoln. Under this new administration the Carson Seep Ranger District was renamed the Guadalupe Ranger District, and the Fresnal district was renamed the Cloudcroft district. The Mayhill and Weed districts retained their names until 1961 when the Cloudcroft, Mayhill, and Weed districts were consolidated into the current Sacramento Ranger District.

Under this new administrative scheme the former Sacramento National Forest was divided into a number of individual Ranger Districts within the Alamo National Forest, including Fresnal, La Luz, Mayhill, and Weed. On June 6, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson issued Executive Order 2633, which disestablished the Alamo National Forest and transferred all of its lands to the nearby Lincoln National Forest. As a result of this order, some areas of the former Sacramento National Forest, like La Luz Ranger District, lost their independent status, others were renamed, such as the Fresnal district, which became the Cloudcroft Ranger District, and others, like Mayhill and Weed, retained their original names and designations. In 1961, the Cloudcroft, Mayhill and Weed Ranger Districts were consolidated and given their current designation, the Sacramento Ranger District of the Lincoln National Forest.

Jolimont Yard was an array of railway lines and carriage sidings on the edge of the central business district of Melbourne, Australia. Located between Flinders Street station, Richmond Junction, the Yarra River and Flinders Street they were often criticised for cutting off the city from the river, being the site of many redevelopment proposals. The Princes Gate Towers (Gas and Fuel Buildings) were built over part of the yard in the 1960s, which themselves were replaced by Federation Square in the 1990s. The rail sidings themselves were progressively removed from the 1980s to the 1990s with only running lines today, but the area continues to be referred to as the 'Jolimont railyards' by Melburnians. History The area of the Jolimont Yards had long been a site of railway development. Flinders Street station was the terminal of the first railway in the city, running to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne). It was later joined by the independent Princes Bridge Station on the eastern side of Swanston Street, which served as the terminal for lines towards Richmond, South Yarra and Hawthorn. The two stations were not connected together until 1866, with Princes Bridge not reopening until 1879. As time continued, the area between Princes Bridge and Richmond stations developed into a major yard for the stabling of suburban carriage stock, as well as the servicing of the steam locomotives that hauled them. Freight traffic was based out of Melbourne Yard and most of the country carriage stock was serviced at the Dudley Street sidings, both adjacent to Spencer Street Station. The running lines were arranged into pairs (inbound and outbound for each destination) with multiple sidings located between them. In 1917 the Princes Bridge locomotive depot was closed, and replaced by the Jolimont Workshops. Built as part of the electrification of the Melbourne suburban network, it was the main storage, servicing and maintenance depot for the new fleet of suburban trains. The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenue, with the storage sidings located between the running lines. A footbridge ran from Flinders Street across the entire yard to provide access for train drivers. An electrical substation was also erected to the south of the yard, to feed power into the overhead wires. Of 18,000 kilowatt capacity, it was fitted with four 4500 kilowatt rotary converters and was the largest substation on the network until demolished in the early 1970s to make room for the City Loop portals for the Caulfield Group. Additional sidings were also provided in the triangle formed by the lines bound for Richmond and Jolimont. Located on the site of the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, the ground was acquired by the Victorian Railways and the Essendon Football Club played their final season there in 1921. The next major change was construction of the Richmond Flyover beginning in early 1970s. Part of the quadruplication works between Richmond and Burnley stations, it converts the up (inbound) ‚Äì down (outbound) ‚Äì up ‚Äì down track layout at Flinders Street to an up ‚Äì up ‚Äì down ‚Äì down track layout at Richmond and beyond. Completed in February 1973, it also permits a cross-platform interchange between City Loop and Flinders Street direct trains at Richmond on platforms 7/8 and 9/10. The flyover necessitated the reconstruction of a footbridge that linked Yarra Park to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Further changes occurred when the City Loop was built. In addition to the relocation of the electrical substation, numerous tracks at Richmond Junction needed to be relocated to make room for the ramps descending into the tunnel, and tracks in the yard itself were slewed as work progressed on the cut and cover tunnels. The Metrol train control complex was also constructed beside the yards on Batman Avenue, to control the loop as well as to replace the five Flinders Street signal boxes. During construction the public discovered that the building would block the view from Russell Street to the Botanic Gardens and Government House, and that it had occurred due to no planning permit being applied for. State Premier Rupert Hamer responded to public outrage and instructed the half built building to be demolished, and instructed all government departments that they must apply for planning permits, whether they were legally needed or not. The building was redesigned to be lower and resulting in completion being delayed until early 1980. Past elements Workshops The Jolimont Workshops were the main maintenance and repair facility for the Victorian Railways electric fleet, both multiple units and locomotives. Located on the south side of the yard, it was made up of a large brick carshed with tracks leading into if from both the east (Richmond) and west (Flinders Street) ends. In addition to the maintenance of the suburban multiple unit fleet, the E class suburban freight and L class mainline electric locomotives were maintained there until the 1960s. Signal boxes Five signal boxes controlled traffic into Flinders Street station. Later replaced by Metrol, four of them were located in Jolimont Yard: Flinders Street B was located at the Richmond end of Flinders Street platform 8/9 and controlled the southern tracks into and out of the station from Jolimont Yard. Constructed of brick it was of 'traditional' Victorian Railways design, and was demolished when the Federation Square Deck was built. Flinders Street C was located beyond the Richmond end of Flinders Street platform 4/5 and controlled the northern tracks into and out of the station from the yard. Constructed of brick it was of 'traditional' Victorian Railways design, and was demolished when the Federation Square Deck was built. Flinders Street D was located at the Richmond end of the Princes Bridge Station island platform (later renumber to Flinders Street 15/16). Of utilitarian brick construction it remains in place today just outside the Federation Square Deck, but is unused as a signal box. Flinders Street E was located at Richmond Junction, and controlled the junction as well as access into the Richmond end of the stabling sidings. Of utilitarian brick construction it remains in place today underneath the William Barak Bridge, but is unused as a signal box. Footbridges During the heyday of the yard only two footbridges crossed the yard: * The Botanical Gardens Footbridge, located west of Richmond station it links Yarra Park with the MCG. The central span was rebuilt with increased clearances when the Glen Waverley flyover was constructed underneath it in the 1970s, but the original lattice truss approach spans remain. * A second footbridge ran from Flinders Street, between Russell and Exhibition Streets, and ran south over the tracks. It was for railway use only, with stairs running down to the stabling sidings below. The access gate for the bridge remains evident in the Flinders Street fence today. Only the first bridge remains today, the other bridges being recent additions. Redevelopment plans Federation Square atop the railway lines Over the years, various redevelopment plans for Jolimont Yard have been proposed by various parties, including: 1925: Cathedral Square In 1925 a design competition was held by the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects for redevelopment of the rail yard. The winner was James Smith with his proposal set back from the street line, featuring a paved civic plaza and fountain, railway offices, tourist bureau and a concourse to Princes Bridge station. 1929: Metropolitan Town Planning Commission The Metropolitan Town Planning Commission was created in 1922 and was chaired by City of Melbourne councillor and architect Frank Stapley. The initial report included a city square over the yard between Flinders Street and Batman Avenue, running east from Princes Bridge, but was later dropped as unsuitable due to cost and traffic congestion. 1954: MMBW Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme The MMBW commenced their Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme in 1949. This scheme involved redeveloping the Yarra River frontage, partially roofing the rail yards, constructing a bridge from Russell Street to Batman Avenue, and building underpasses below Princes Bridge and Batman Avenue. 1958: Kenneth McDonald This plan was proposed by Kenneth MacDonald and Associates to the City of Melbourne, and proposed the roofing of the rail yards between Swanston and Spring Streets, with public space, shops, car parking, apartment and hotel towers, a theatre and an office tower built above. 1961: Matthew Flinders Square This proposal was put promoted by ex Lord Mayor William Lempriere and was prepared by architects Montgomery, King and Trengrove. It aimed to fix the \\"desecration of the city's southern gateway by the rail yards,\\" and the \\"'mid-Victorian monstrosity\\" of Flinders Street Station by roofing the rail yards and relocating the railway station underground. The open space on either side of Princes Bridge would be the home of a new Town Hall, a civic square, concert auditoriums, the railways administration, and other commercial buildings. 1963: Princes Gate Announced in 1963 by Premier Henry Bolte, the ¬£5 million project would roof part of the yard and build a plaza and two 15-storey buildings on this structure. Completed in 1967 and commonly known as the Gas and Fuel building, the Princes Gate towers were demolished in 1996‚Äì1997. 1973: Jolimont Pleasure Gardens A City of Melbourne proposal for roofing the yards and reconnect the city with the river and sports and arts precincts beyond. 1979: Landmark Competition Premier Rupert Hamer announced a $100,000 competition for designs to roof the remainder of Jolimont Yard. Over 2300 entries were submitted, with 48 finalists selected by a committee chaired by Ron Walker. No overall winner was chosen, a composite scheme with a tower in a garden setting recommended instead. Each of the finalists receiving a little over $2000 prize money, with designs including hanging gardens, an underwater gallery, a free-standing escalator, a series of 12 transparent arches, a solar-powered earth beam, a Freedom Bird Park, and a Time Tower. 1985: Denton Corker Marshall By the architecture firm, the Princes Plaza Proposal included demolition of one of the Princes Gate towers, and the construction of a large street level plaza stretching across the yards, and a new building to the east surrounding a formal garden. 1996: Federation Square A design completion for the site commenced in 1996, resulting in Federation Square that was opened in October 2002. Rationalisation Looking towards the city from Richmond today The first area of the yard to be removed was the 'Collingwood Sidings' in the northern corner, near the intersection of Wellington Parade South and Jolimont Road. The area was cleared of tracks during 1987 and 1988 and was offered for sale as a development site. Purchased by a company that later collapsed, it was not until the mid-1990s that the present apartment buildings have been built. High-rise apartments featured in the final stage, that ran into opposition in the early 2000s, but was approved in 2005. The State Government announced the Federation Square project in 1996, along with additional development of the sports and entertainment precinct and new parklands. Rationalisation of the yard was carried out in 1997‚Äì1998 to clear the way, with the stabling sidings and workshops removed and replaced by new facilities located elsewhere, including: * Epping station received a new major workshop and stabling yard, opened in 1990. * Macaulay received a light maintenance facility located on the site of existing stabling sidings in 1993. * Melbourne Yard was the site of a replacement washing plant and stabling sidings made operational in May 1995. * Westall and Bayswater stations both received new train maintenance facilities and stabling yards at a cost of $16.5m. The yards were constructed on little used goods sidings and house seven or three trains respectively. * Camberwell station received new stabling sidings on the site of the former goods yard. * Burnley station received new stabling sidings on nearby unused land. The track rationalisation itself cost $40 million with 53 operating lines between Flinders Street and Richmond were reduced to just 12. The number of points was also reduced, from 164 to 48 and 1 in 9 and 1 in 15 points were used to permit higher speeds. New lower profile masts were installed to support the overhead wiring, and a new electrical substation erected to supply power to the trains. The main area of new track was between Flinders Street Station, Richmond Junction and the City Loop portals. Piling works and crash walls for Federation Square were done by October 1998. The deck was completed by mid-1999, with building works atop of it commencing in August 1999. The removal of other buildings along Batman Avenue was carried out at this time, including the Metrol train control facility. Opened at the time of the City Loop opening in 1981, it was moved to a temporary location pending the replacement of the elderly technology with a new system. The Exhibition Street Extension was also built, connecting the CBD to Batman Avenue and Swan Street, permitting the closure of Batman Avenue for Federation Square and Birrarung Marr. Tolled as part of the CityLink project, it was opened in 1998 and carries trams and four lanes of traffic. By June 1999 the route 70 tram had been rerouted from Swan Street to a new section of reserved track running between the Tennis Centre and the remaining railway lines, entering the CBD via the Exhibition Street Extension rather than Batman Avenue. A new footbridge from the Multi Purpose Stadium to the MCG Great Southern Stand concourse was built, and existing footbridge from the MCG Pontsford Stand to Scotch Oval was rebuilt and widened. As part of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games the 525-metre long William Barak footbridge was built east‚Äìwest from Birrarung Marr to Yarra Park. Stated in 2005 and opened in 2006. The bridge is yet to be completed, with scaffolding and formwork still attached to the piers. Today View east over the remaining lines from Federation Square Looking west over the former yard from the MCG footbridge Twelve tracks run through the area today, in six pairs named (from north to south): * Burnley through lines * Burnley local lines * Caulfield local lines * Caulfield through lines * Special lines * Sandringham lines Where the lines interconnect outside the MCG was originally known as Jolimont Junction, but was renamed Richmond Junction following the demise of the yard. From Flinders Street in the west to Richmond Station in the east, bridges over the area include: * Flinders Street Station concourse * Swanston Street * Federation Square * former yard footbridge (removed on the rationalisation) * Exhibition Street extension * William Barak footbridge * Melbourne Park ‚Äì MCG footbridge * Multi-Purpose Arena ‚Äì MCG footbridge * Yarra Park footbridge * Richmond Station sports subway On 28 April 2008 Premier John Brumby announced that his government was proposing a multimillion-dollar development to link the sports and arts precincts in Melbourne's CBD. To be funded by a public- private partnership, the railway lines would be roofed and commercial buildings built on top. The next day the Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry urged the roofing over the railway lines east of Federation Square for the construction of a residence for the Prime Minister of Australia, and as well as for hosting visiting heads of state and business delegations. In August 2009 the VECCI again brought up the topic of roofing over the railway tracks, an article in The Age cited that an 2002 costing of $1.4 billion.

The Three Stooges featuring Curly Howard appear in an uncredited straight role as wedding singers. There is a small gag wherein Lee Tracy asks the Stooges to sing \\"Tony's Wife\\", a song which the Stooges have not heard before; Moe Howard then asks \\"Tony's wife? Who is she?\\" Although they are not credited as the Three Stooges (indeed, they receive no screen credit at all), this marks the first time the trio appeared as a group on film without their former leader, Ted Healy. They would launch their long-running film-shorts career a few months later. Plot On March 6, 1933, middle-aged cigar store owner Joe Gimlet (Lee Tracy) runs into his childhood friend, banker Ted Wright (Otto Kruger). While having dinner with Joe and his wife Mary, Ted asks the couple to invest $4,000 in his company. Joe is excited by the idea, but Mary refuses to part with their savings. Angered by her reluctance, Joe gets drunk and declares to Mary that he should have married the wealthy Elvina. Drunkenly leaving their apartment, he is hit by a car and is brought to a hospital for surgery. Joe wakes to discover that he is a young man again. After scaring his mother (Clara Blandick) with talk of the future, and after having to face the doctor who asks him if he wants to go crazy like his father, he decides to keep his past life to himself. Going to his job as a soda jerk, he meets Elvina (Peggy Shannon). They soon become engaged. The engagement announcement crushes Joe's girlfriend, Mary, and his mother, who reminds him that money does not buy happiness. After the wedding, Joe becomes rich due to his knowledge of the future. Meanwhile, Mary and Ted, Joe‚Äôs old friend, get married. Remembering the post war problems, Joe pledges one million dollars to help returning vets. His wife is enraged, but President Woodrow Wilson hails Joe as a hero and nominates him as the head of the War Industry. Elvina openly mocks him, but they refuse to divorce to avoid scandal. Years pass and in 1929 Joe goes into the cigar store and sees Ted working there. At dinner with Ted and Mary, Joe offers Ted the chance to invest $4,000 in a venture. Mary approves the idea, because she believes in Joe. The venture does not go forward because Joe is ruined by the stock market crash, due to Elvina having invested their common savings in the stock market through a broker instead of putting it in a trust fund as Joe had told her to do. Joe divorces Elvina, telling her that this time they are really washed up. His bank employees plunder the bank and Joe is to be held responsible. It is now March 6, 1933, the date of the car accident. Joe must now live his life with no knowledge of the future. He flees, and finding Mary, begs her to run away with him. Mary tells him she cannot leave her husband. Joe is pursued by a horde of police officers and brought into custody. At that moment, he wakes up in the hospital room with his life returned as it was. He tells Mary he wouldn‚Äôt change a thing about their life together.

He made an unsuccessful bid for the Rhode Island's 1st congressional district in 1992.Political Graveyard In 2012 he made a bid to return to the Rhode Island legislature, but was decisively defeated in a Democratic primary for the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He remains a registered Democrat, but is very much at odds with the ruling ideology of today's Democratic Party. For instance, he is strongly opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. In addition to his 12 years in the state Senate (1981 to 1993), he has served 12 years on the Newport School Committee. He was also at one time the chair of the Newport Democratic Party. Carlin is the author of four books: The Decline and Fall of the Catholic Church in America (2003), Can a Catholic Be a Democrat? (2006), Homosexualism versus Catholicism (2012), and My Dear Bishops: an Open Letter to the American Catholic Bishops (2013). He has been an opinion columnist for two Catholic periodicals (Commonweal and Our Sunday Visitor) and two Catholic websites (Crisis and Aleteia).

De Gruyter, Berlin, 2014. ) is a planar diagram used to represent the fact that a particular word in the generators of a group given by a group presentation represents the identity element in that group. History The notion of a van Kampen diagram was introduced by Egbert van Kampen in 1933.E. van Kampen. On some lemmas in the theory of groups. American Journal of Mathematics. vol. 55, (1933), pp. 268-273. This paper appeared in the same issue of American Journal of Mathematics as another paper of van Kampen, where he proved what is now known as the Seifert‚Äìvan Kampen theorem.E. R. van Kampen. On the connection between the fundamental groups of some related spaces. American Journal of Mathematics, vol. 55 (1933), pp. 261-267. The main result of the paper on van Kampen diagrams, now known as the van Kampen lemma can be deduced from the Seifert‚Äìvan Kampen theorem by applying the latter to the presentation complex of a group. However, van Kampen did not notice it at the time and this fact was only made explicit much later (see, e.g.Aleksandr Yur'evich Ol'shanskii. Geometry of defining relations in groups. Translated from the 1989 Russian original by Yu. A. Bakhturin. Mathematics and its Applications (Soviet Series), 70. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, 1991. .). Van Kampen diagrams remained an underutilized tool in group theory for about thirty years, until the advent of the small cancellation theory in the 1960s, where van Kampen diagrams play a central role.Bruce Chandler, and Wilhelm Magnus. The history of combinatorial group theory. A case study in the history of ideas. Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, 9. Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982. . Currently van Kampen diagrams are a standard tool in geometric group theory. They are used, in particular, for the study of isoperimetric functions in groups, and their various generalizations such as isodiametric functions, filling length functions, and so on. Formal definition The definitions and notations below largely follow Lyndon and Schupp.Roger C. Lyndon and Paul E. Schupp. Combinatorial Group Theory. Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001. \\"Classics in Mathematics\\" series, reprint of the 1977 edition. ; Ch. V. Small Cancellation Theory. pp. 235-294. Let :G=\\\\langle A  R\\\\, \\\\rangle (‚Ä†) be a group presentation where all r‚ààR are cyclically reduced words in the free group F(A). The alphabet A and the set of defining relations R are often assumed to be finite, which corresponds to a finite group presentation, but this assumption is not necessary for the general definition of a van Kampen diagram. Let R‚àó be the symmetrized closure of R, that is, let R‚àó be obtained from R by adding all cyclic permutations of elements of R and of their inverses. A van Kampen diagram over the presentation (‚Ä†) is a planar finite cell complex \\\\mathcal D\\\\,, given with a specific embedding \\\\mathcal D\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb R^2\\\\, with the following additional data and satisfying the following additional properties: #The complex \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is connected and simply connected. #Each edge (one-cell) of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is labelled by an arrow and a letter a‚ààA. #Some vertex (zero- cell) which belongs to the topological boundary of \\\\mathcal D\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb R^2\\\\, is specified as a base-vertex. #For each region (two-cell) of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, for every vertex the boundary cycle of that region and for each of the two choices of direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) the label of the boundary cycle of the region read from that vertex and in that direction is a freely reduced word in F(A) that belongs to R‚àó. Thus the 1-skeleton of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is a finite connected planar graph Œì embedded in \\\\mathbb R^2\\\\, and the two-cells of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, are precisely the bounded complementary regions for this graph. By the choice of R‚àó Condition 4 is equivalent to requiring that for each region of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, there is some boundary vertex of that region and some choice of direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) such that the boundary label of the region read from that vertex and in that direction is freely reduced and belongs to R. A van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D\\\\, also has the boundary cycle, denoted \\\\partial\\\\mathcal D\\\\,, which is an edge-path in the graph Œì corresponding to going around \\\\mathcal D\\\\, once in the clockwise direction along the boundary of the unbounded complementary region of Œì, starting and ending at the base-vertex of \\\\mathcal D\\\\,. The label of that boundary cycle is a word w in the alphabet A ‚à™ A‚àí1 (which is not necessarily freely reduced) that is called the boundary label of \\\\mathcal D\\\\,. Further terminology *A van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is called a disk diagram if \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is a topological disk, that is, when every edge of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is a boundary edge of some region of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, and when \\\\mathcal D\\\\, has no cut-vertices. *A van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is called non-reduced if there exists a reduction pair in \\\\mathcal D\\\\,, that is a pair of distinct regions of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, such that their boundary cycles share a common edge and such that their boundary cycles, read starting from that edge, clockwise for one of the regions and counter-clockwise for the other, are equal as words in A ‚à™ A‚àí1. If no such pair of region exists, \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is called reduced. *The number of regions (two-cells) of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is called the area of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, denoted {\\\\rm Area}(\\\\mathcal D)\\\\,. In general, a van Kampen diagram has a \\"cactus-like\\" structure where one or more disk-components joined by (possibly degenerate) arcs, see the figure below: General form of a van Kampen diagram Example The following figure shows an example of a van Kampen diagram for the free abelian group of rank two :G=\\\\langle a, b ab a^{-1}b^{-1}\\\\rangle. Example of a van Kampen diagram The boundary label of this diagram is the word :w=b^{-1}b^3a^{-1}b^{-2}ab^{-1}ba^{-1}ab^{-1}ba^{-1}a. The area of this diagram is equal to 8. van Kampen lemma A key basic result in the theory is the so-called van Kampen lemma which states the following: #Let \\\\mathcal D\\\\, be a van Kampen diagram over the presentation (‚Ä†) with boundary label w which is a word (not necessarily freely reduced) in the alphabet A ‚à™ A‚àí1. Then w=1 in G. #Let w be a freely reduced word in the alphabet A ‚à™ A‚àí1 such that w=1 in G. Then there exists a reduced van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D\\\\, over the presentation (‚Ä†) whose boundary label is freely reduced and is equal to w. Sketch of the proof First observe that for an element w ‚àà F(A) we have w = 1 in G if and only if w belongs to the normal closure of R in F(A) that is, if and only if w can be represented as :w=u_1s_1u_1^{-1}\\\\cdots u_n s_nu_{n}^{-1} \\\\text{ in } F(A), (‚ô†) where n ‚â• 0 and where si ‚àà R‚àó for i = 1, ..., n. Part 1 of van Kampen's lemma is proved by induction on the area of \\\\mathcal D\\\\,. The inductive step consists in \\"peeling\\" off one of the boundary regions of \\\\mathcal D\\\\, to get a van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D'\\\\, with boundary cycle w' and observing that in F(A) we have :w=usu^{-1} w',\\\\, where s‚ààR‚àó is the boundary cycle of the region that was removed to get \\\\mathcal D'\\\\, from \\\\mathcal D\\\\,. The proof of part 2 of van Kampen's lemma is more involved. First, it is easy to see that if w is freely reduced and w = 1 in G there exists some van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D_0\\\\, with boundary label w0 such that w = w0 in F(A) (after possibly freely reducing w0). Namely consider a representation of w of the form (‚ô†) above. Then make \\\\mathcal D_0\\\\, to be a wedge of n \\"lollipops\\" with \\"stems\\" labeled by ui and with the \\"candys\\" (2-cells) labelled by si. Then the boundary label of \\\\mathcal D_0\\\\, is a word w0 such that w = w0 in F(A). However, it is possible that the word w0 is not freely reduced. One then starts performing \\"folding\\" moves to get a sequence of van Kampen diagrams \\\\mathcal D_0, \\\\mathcal D_1, \\\\mathcal D_2,\\\\dots\\\\, by making their boundary labels more and more freely reduced and making sure that at each step the boundary label of each diagram in the sequence is equal to w in F(A). The sequence terminates in a finite number of steps with a van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D_k\\\\, whose boundary label is freely reduced and thus equal to w as a word. The diagram \\\\mathcal D_k\\\\, may not be reduced. If that happens, we can remove the reduction pairs from this diagram by a simple surgery operation without affecting the boundary label. Eventually this produces a reduced van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D\\\\, whose boundary cycle is freely reduced and equal to w. Strengthened version of van Kampen's lemma Moreover, the above proof shows that the conclusion of van Kampen's lemma can be strengthened as follows. Part 1 can be strengthened to say that if \\\\mathcal D\\\\, is a van Kampen diagram of area n with boundary label w then there exists a representation (‚ô†) for w as a product in F(A) of exactly n conjugates of elements of R‚àó. Part 2 can be strengthened to say that if w is freely reduced and admits a representation (‚ô†) as a product in F(A) of n conjugates of elements of R‚àó then there exists a reduced van Kampen diagram with boundary label w and of area at most n. Dehn functions and isoperimetric functions Area of a word representing the identity Let w ‚àà F(A) be such that w = 1 in G. Then the area of w, denoted Area(w), is defined as the minimum of the areas of all van Kampen diagrams with boundary labels w (van Kampen's lemma says that at least one such diagram exists). One can show that the area of w can be equivalently defined as the smallest n‚â•0 such that there exists a representation (‚ô†) expressing w as a product in F(A) of n conjugates of the defining relators. Isoperimetric functions and Dehn functions A nonnegative monotone nondecreasing function f(n) is said to be an isoperimetric function for presentation (‚Ä†) if for every freely reduced word w such that w = 1 in G we have :{\\\\rm Area}(w)\\\\le f(w), where w is the length of the word w. Suppose now that the alphabet A in (‚Ä†) is finite. Then the Dehn function of (‚Ä†) is defined as :{\\\\rm Dehn}(n)=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{{\\\\rm Area}(w): w=1 \\\\text{ in } G, w\\\\le n, w \\\\text{ freely reduced}.\\\\\\\\} It is easy to see that Dehn(n) is an isoperimetric function for (‚Ä†) and, moreover, if f(n) is any other isoperimetric function for (‚Ä†) then Dehn(n) ‚â§ f(n) for every n ‚â• 0\\\\. Let w ‚àà F(A) be a freely reduced word such that w = 1 in G. A van Kampen diagram \\\\mathcal D\\\\, with boundary label w is called minimal if {\\\\rm Area}(\\\\mathcal D)={\\\\rm Area}(w). Minimal van Kampen diagrams are discrete analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry. Generalizations and other applications *There are several generalizations of van-Kampen diagrams where instead of being planar, connected and simply connected (which means being homotopically equivalent to a disk) the diagram is drawn on or homotopically equivalent to some other surface. It turns out, that there is a close connection between the geometry of the surface and certain group theoretical notions. A particularly important one of these is the notion of an annular van Kampen diagram, which is homotopically equivalent to an annulus. Annular diagrams, also known as conjugacy diagrams, can be used to represent conjugacy in groups given by group presentations. Also spherical van Kampen diagrams are related to several versions of group-theoretic asphericity and to Whitehead's asphericity conjecture,Ian M. Chiswell, Donald J. Collins, and Johannes Huebschmann. Aspherical group presentations. Mathematische Zeitschrift, vol. 178 (1981), no. 1, pp. 1-36. Van Kampen diagrams on the torus are related to commuting elements, diagrams on the real projective plane are related to involutions in the group and diagrams on Klein's bottle are related to elements that are conjugated to their own inverse. *Van Kampen diagrams are central objects in the small cancellation theory developed by Greendlinger, Lyndon and Schupp in the 1960s-1970s.Martin Greendlinger. Dehn's algorithm for the word problem. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, vol. 13 (1960), pp. 67-83. Small cancellation theory deals with group presentations where the defining relations have \\"small overlaps\\" with each other. This condition is reflected in the geometry of reduced van Kampen diagrams over small cancellation presentations, forcing certain kinds of non- positively curved or negatively cn curved behavior. This behavior yields useful information about algebraic and algorithmic properties of small cancellation groups, in particular regarding the word and the conjugacy problems. Small cancellation theory was one of the key precursors of geometric group theory, that emerged as a distinct mathematical area in the late 1980s and it remains an important part of geometric group theory. *Van Kampen diagrams play a key role in the theory of word-hyperbolic groups introduced by Gromov in 1987.M. Gromov. Hyperbolic Groups. Essays in Group Theory (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75-263; . In particular, it turns out that a finitely presented group is word-hyperbolic if and only if it satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality. Moreover, there is an isoperimetric gap in the possible spectrum of isomperimetric functions for finitely presented groups: for any finitely presented group either it is hyperbolic and satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality or else the Dehn function is at least quadratic.Michel Coornaert, Thomas Delzant, Athanase Papadopoulos, G√©om√©trie et th√©orie des groupes: les groupes hyperboliques de Gromov.

Michigan Mathematical Journal, vol. 42 (1995), no. 1, pp. 103-107. *The study of isoperimetric functions for finitely presented groups has become an important general theme in geometric group theory where substantial progress has occurred. Much work has gone into constructing groups with \\"fractional\\" Dehn functions (that is, with Dehn functions being polynomials of non-integer degree).M. R. Bridson, Fractional isoperimetric inequalities and subgroup distortion. Journal of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 12 (1999), no. 4, pp. 1103-1118.

Sapir, Isoperimetric functions of groups and computational complexity of the word problem. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 156 (2002), no. 2, pp. 467-518. explored the connections between Dehn functions and time complexity functions of Turing machines and showed that an arbitrary \\"reasonable\\" time function can be realized (up to appropriate equivalence) as the Dehn function of some finitely presented group. *Various stratified and relativized versions of van Kampen diagrams have been explored in the subject as well. In particular, a stratified version of small cancellation theory, developed by Ol'shanskii, resulted in constructions of various group-theoretic \\"monsters\\", such as the Tarski Monster, and in geometric solutions of the Burnside problem for periodic groups of large exponent.A. Yu. Ol'shanskii. On a geometric method in the combinatorial group theory. Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. 1, 2 (Warsaw, 1983), pp. 415-424, PWN, Warsaw, 1984.S. V.

It is unclear to which one the report relates. :\\"At the center of the island is a small village, the inhabitants of which owe allegiance to neither of the two chiefs. These people are called 'Berbalangs', and the Cagayans live in great fear of them. These Berbalangs are a kind of ghouls, and feed on human flesh occasionally to survive. You can always identify them, because the pupils of their eyes are not round, but just narrow slits like those of a cat. They dig open the graves and eat the entrails of the corpses; but in Cagayan the supply is limited. So when they feel the craving for a feed of human flesh they go away into the grasslands, and, having carefully hidden themselves, hold their breaths and fall into a trance. Their astral bodies are then liberated.... They fly away, and entering a house make their way into the body of one of the occupants and feed on their entrails..... The arrival of the Berbalangs may be heard from afar, as they make a moaning noise which is loud from a distance but dies away into a feeble moan as they approach. When they are near you the sound of their wings may be heard and the flashing lights of their eyes can be seen like dancing fire- flies in the dark. Should you be the happy possessor of a cocoa-nut pearl you are safe, but otherwise the only way to beat them off is to jab at them with a kris, the blade of which has been rubbed with the juice of a lime. If you see the lights and hear the moaning in front of you, wheel fast and make a cut in the opposite direction. Berbalangs always go by contraries and are never where they appear to be.\\" :\\"The cocoa-nut pearl, a stone like an opal sometimes found in the cocoa-nut, is the only really efficacious charm against their attacks; and it is only of value to the finder, as its magic powers cease when it is given away. When the finder dies the pearl loses its luster and becomes dead. The juice of limes sprinkled on a grave will prevent the Berbalangs from entering it, so all the dead are buried either under or near the houses, and the graves are sprinkled daily with fresh lime juice.\\" References Philippine mythology Philippine legendary creatures ","title":"Berbalang"},{"id":"18871513","text":"M…ômm…ôdoba (also, Mamadyuba and Mamedoba) is a village and municipality in the Masally Rayon of Azerbaijan.

(Sunday, October 21, 2007). Town of Lancaster Conservation Land History As glaciers retreated from what is now the New England landscape, distinctive hills were formed. When the last glacier moved across the New England landscape over 10,000 years ago, it formed distinctively-shaped hills called \\"drumlins\\" running parallel to the path of the ancient ice flow. Dexter Drumlin is \\"a classic example\\" \\"Drumlins and subglacial meltwater floods\\" by Douglas E. Cox surrounding the drumlin was donated to the Trustees of Reservations by Lancaster \\"town father\\" Nathaniel Dexter by bequest in 2002. The change of the toponym from \\"Kilbourn Hill\\" to \\"Dexter Drumlin\\" was part of a Trustees of Reservations rebranding effort in 2000 following their acquisition of the property. Ecology The reservation consists of hayfield, transitional meadow, and wetlands. The stream that runs along the western side of the hill forms wet meadows in lower terrain. Grassland bird species nest and raise their young on the hill and in the adjacent floodplains. Researchers at Fitchburg State College have used the reservation as a place to study the mating displays of male fireflies. Using specially-designed devices to mimic the fireflies bioluminescence, the researchers found that the courtship flashes of Photinus ignitus males attracts both competitors and predators.

The project consists of two large office towers and two smaller residential towers, as well as a public park. The towers are being built on a platform over Penn Station storage tracks along Ninth Avenue. The buildings are close to the Hudson Yards mega-development to the west across Tenth Avenue. Upon its completion, the taller west tower will extend up to its roof and will be one of the tallest buildings in New York City. History Ground was broken for the site in January 2013. In May 2014, permits for complex were submitted and approved. Under the updated 2014 plan, the complex is set to be completed by 2020. By the end of 2014, a $680 million platform over Long Island Rail Road tracks between Tenth and Dyer Avenues, atop which the Manhattan West development would be built, was completed. In October 2015, the Qatar Investment Authority invested a 44% stake in the $4.5 billion mixed-use development project. The deal included the formation of a joint venture between Brookfield Property Partners and QIA for the development of of residential and office space in five buildings, including 62-story and 67-story skyscrapers, that Brookfield said would be worth $8.6 billion upon completion. Manhattan West is part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment, a larger plan to redevelop the Hudson Yards area, which extends from the west of Pennsylvania Station to the Hudson River. The QIA was referred to as an \\"early bird\\" for their investment in an area that has not yet come under widespread development. This strategy assumes taking on more development risk in the hope of better returns. Buildings  1 Manhattan West  The development plans announced by Brookfield Property Partners and QIA include five buildings. The 67-story, 2.1 million square-foot building is scheduled for completion in 2019 and law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Affiliates have been confirmed as tenants. In July 2018, Wells Fargo provided a $530 million construction loan for the project. The structure topped out in August 2018. The structural system of the tower is composed of a central reinforced concrete core and a perimeter steel moment frame. Part of the tower overhangs the below ground train tracks leading into Penn Station. In order to avoid the tracks, the perimeter columns on the south, north, and east sides do not come down to ground level, but are transferred to the core above the building's lobby.  2 Manhattan West  2 Manhattan West, which reportedly would not undergo construction until it secures an anchor tenant, will be completed following the first tower. Updated permits filed in November 2017 show the building will span just under of office space on 59 stories and rise high. In January 2019, Brookfield announced that construction of the building would begin in 2019 despite not having signed an anchor tenant. In October 2019, law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore signed a lease for floors 25 through 37 in a move from One Worldwide Plaza. 3 Manhattan West (The Eugene) 3 Manhattan West, located at 435 West 31st Street, is a residential tower that is part of the Manhattan West project, and broke ground in December 2014. Now complete, it stands 64 floors and high. In total it has 844 units, split between 675 market-rate and 169 affordable. 4 Manhattan West (Pendry Manhattan West) 4 Manhattan West will be a 21-story hotel with 164 guest rooms including 30 suites, a restaurant, a lounge, an open-air terrace bar, and meeting and event space operated by Pendry Hotels. The building, designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill, began construction in December 2018 and is set for a 2021 opening. 5 Manhattan West The initial appearance of 450 West 33rd Streetleft The existing building at 450 West 33rd Street, also known as Westyard Distribution Center, was designed by Davis Brody Bond and opened in 1969. The , 16-story building originally had a beige precast concrete facade with a sloped base, and although the facade was cleaned up in 2003, it was seen as out of place with the architecture of the surrounding neighborhood. As of 2014, it contained the headquarters of the Associated Press. In 2014, the brutalist concrete exterior was replaced with a glass facade and its interior and mechanical systems were also renovated. When renovation of the building was completed, it was renamed 5 Manhattan West. Tenants and owners  Tenants  The law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom plans to move to One Manhattan West from 4 Times Square. Another law firm, Fried Frank, is considering moving to Manhattan West when the development is completed. In August 2017, Accenture signed a lease for the top eight floors of the tower. The National Hockey League is planned to move its headquarters to 1 Manhattan West. Ernst & Young also announced in 2017 that it would relocate to at One Manhattan West, occupying the 6th through 22nd floors. The company is moving from its previous location at 5 Times Square, leaving a million square feet of office space vacant.  QIA ownership stake  By late 2015, reports emerged that the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) had plans to invest $35 billion in the U.S. over five years. The QIA investments focus on diversifying the fund‚Äôs assets and concentrate on direct investments in real estate, with one of these investments being a 44% stake in Manhattan West. Since the announcement, QIA has made a series of high-level investments in the U.S. including the purchase of a minority stake in the Empire State Building's owner. In September 2015, QIA opened an office in New York City for closer management of the fund‚Äôs U.S. assets.
