Portfolio Insurance and the 1987 Crash.An extensive account is available in Diana Henriques, A First-Rate Catastrophe: The Road to Black Monday, the Worst Day in Wall Street History. Henry Holt and Co., 2017. . In 1979, Leland realized that then-recent work on option pricing could be applied to dynamically hedge a portfolio, resulting in a financial product termed ‚Äúportfolio insurance.‚Äù In conjunction with Mark Rubinstein, a Berkeley colleague and options expert, and John O‚ÄôBrien, a financial industry professional, he co-founded Leland O‚ÄôBrien Rubinstein Associates(LOR) in 1980 to provide portfolio protection strategies.Peter Bernstein, ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Invention,‚Äù Capital Ideas: The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street. Free Press, 1992. Paperback edition, Wiley, 2005. LOR's protected asset base grew rapidly, reaching $50b by mid-1987 (the equivalent of almost $500b when adjusted to the S&P; 500 level in mid-2017). In 1987, Leland and his partners Rubinstein and O‚ÄôBrien were co-named ‚ÄúBusinessmen of the Year‚Äù by Fortune Magazine. The portfolio insurance strategy required that clients sell (to hedge) stocks or stock index futures as the market declined. During the crash of October 19, 1987, the drop in stock prices required LOR to sell large amounts of stock index futures, creating further downward pressure on stock prices. While portfolio insurance was not the initial cause of the crash, the Brady Commission Report examining trading that day concluded that insurance selling, roughly 15% of total stock and futures sold that day, was contributory to the magnitude of the crash.\\"Brady Report\\": The Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms (1988): Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms. Nicholas F. Brady (Chairman), U.S. Government Printing Office. Market mechanism failures, including the failure of the SuperDot system, were also held responsible in the Brady Report.Some retrospective ideas are presented in G. Gennotte and H.

Tufano and B. Kyrillos, https://hbr.org/product/leland-o-brien-rubinstein-associates-inc- supertrust/an/294050-PDF-ENG, traces the LOR‚Äôs decisions on structuring the SuperTrust and difficulties before reaching the targeted initial funding. LOR's SuperTrust consisted of two funds, known as SuperUnits, whose assets were S&P; 500 stocks and short-term Treasury securities, respectively. To provide a basket product, shares of the SuperUnits required continuous trading when markets were open, similar to the trading of exchange-listed closed-end fund shares. But for the funds' market value to closely track the underlying portfolio value ‚Äî a problem with closed-end funds whose shares often fell to discounts ‚Äî fund shares also needed to be redeemable daily for cash or for underlying assets at net asset value (NAV). The SuperTrust's SuperUnits allowed smaller redemptions in cash, with larger redemptions in stock bundles.An additional feature of LOR‚Äôs fund shares was their optional divisibility into sub-shares termed SuperShares, one of which provided protection of the S&P; 500 Index value over a three-year term that was fully collateralized by US Treasury securities. A more complete description is provided in P. Tufano and B. Kyrillos, op.cit., and the short video (1990) referenced at http://www.40act.com/community/etf-supertrust-history-files/ The Investment Company Act of 1940 disallows such a fund structure, i.e., with simultaneous closed-end and open-end fund properties, but it does allow the SEC to provide exemptions to the regulations when they're deemed to be in the public interest.In particular, exemption from Rule 22(d) was needed. Rule 22(d) required open-end fund shares to trade only at NAV, which was typically calculated only after the market close. See J.Heffernan and J. Jorden, ‚ÄúSection 22(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940‚Äîits Original Purpose and Present Function,‚Äù Duke Law Journal Volume 1973: 975- 1008. LOR applied for exemptive relief from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April 1989. Arguments justifying LOR's request for exemption are available at http://www.40act.com/community/etf-supertrust-history-files/. While these arguments are now widely accepted and relief has been granted to hundreds of ETFs, the request was controversial at the time and required five amended applications and a hearing before the full Commission prior to final approval in October 1990.In the Matter of the SuperTrust Trust for Capital Market Fund, Inc., (‚ÄúSuperTrust‚Äù), Investment Company Rel. Nos. 17613 (Jul. 25, 1990) (notice) and 17809 (Oct. 19, 1990) (the ‚ÄúSuperTrust Order‚Äù), granting exemptions under Section 6(c) from Sections 4(2), 22(c) and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, and 22(d) of the Act and an order under Sections 11(a) and 11(c) of the Act. SEC News Digest, Issue 90-204, October 22, 1990, available at http://www.40act.com/community/etf-supertrust-history-files/.A fuller history of the difficulty in achieving the requested exemptions is provided in P. Tufano and B. Kyrillos, op.cit. After some initial funding delays, LOR launched the SuperTrust with $1 billion in assets in November, 1992, with the SuperUnit shares trading on the American Stock Exchange (Amex).Due to earlier licensing arrangements between Standard and Poor‚Äôs (S&P;) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), S&P; insisted that the sub-shares be traded on the CBOE rather than their more natural home on the Amex. The SuperTrust's SuperUnits were the first U.S. exchange-traded funds that allowed daily redemption of shares at NAV. Notably, the SuperTrust's Index SuperUnit was the first S&P; 500 based ETF. The Amex initially had cooperated with LOR to develop a basket product, but subsequently decided to follow their own path with the Standard and Poor's Depository Receipt (SPDR), also based on the S&P; 500. Their request for exemptive relief from the SEC was filed over a year after LOR's, and approval was received two years after LOR's.The sequence of SuperTrust and SPDR filings is documented in https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-11-15/s71115-12.pdf. Their proposal was somewhat different in structure (e.g., redemption in large stock bundles only, and no sub-shares) but cited The SuperTrust exemptive order as precedent, using many of the same arguments made previously in application by LOR.SPDR Trust, Series I, et al., Notice of Application, File No. 812-7545, Investment Company Act of !940 Rel. No. 18959 (Sept. 17, 1992), See \\"Applicants' Legal Analysis,\\" paragraph 4. The SPDR was launched in 1993, three months after SuperUnit shares began trading, with initial asset value just over $6 million. However, with the Amex's marketing blitz (e.g., ‚Äúspiders‚Äù descending from the ceiling onto the trading floor) and campaign, the SPDR ultimately became the basket product that gained liquidity and for many years was the largest ETF. The SuperTrust, which had an initial term of 3 years, failed to gain competitive liquidity and was not rolled over after its initial term.

It was recognized in the 1970s but not designated into the National Priorities List until 1989. It is a contamination of the Kittany Limestone Aquifer underlying the Pohatcong Valley. This toxic site stretches across 9,800 acres of land. The chemicals that are polluting the groundwater and soil are trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE). If someone were to be exposed to these harmful toxins for a short amount of time it can result in unconsciousness. Long term effects unfortunately include liver and kidney problems. The plans to clean up this superfund site are costing the companies involved, Pechiney Public Packaging Inc., Bristol Meyers Squibb Company, Albea Americas Inc, and Citigroup Inc, about $92 million, and the situation still has not been completely resolved. Origins Pohatcong Township is located in Warren County, New Jersey, United States. It was established in 1881. Franklin Township is in Somerset County, New Jersey and was originally formed in 1798 as Eastern precinct. Washington Township is also a part of Warren County, New Jersey. It was established as a township in 1849. Lastly, Washington is a borough of Warren County, and similar to Pohatcong and Washington Township, lies in the easternmost region of the Lehigh Valley. Town history Established in 1881, ‚ÄúThe name Pohatcong Township is alleged to come from the Lenni Lenape Native American term that means ‚Äòstream between split hills‚Äô‚Äù. The Native Americans used that phrase to describe the area most likely because of its appearance. It was created by being divided off of Greenwich Village in 1882. The recorded population in 2010 was 3,339. =Franklin Township= Franklin Township's most recent population count was about 62,300. ‚ÄúIt traditionally is a farming community that has transitioned into a rapidly growing suburb‚Äù. In 1798, it became one out of 104 of New Jersey's townships. The designated naming of Franklin Township still remains unknown between Benjamin Franklin or his illegitimate son William Franklin. =Washington township= Washington Township's most recent population count was recorded in 2010, which came out to be 6,651. ‚ÄúIt is actually one of 6 municipalities in the state of New Jersey with the name Washington‚Äù. It was named for the first president of the United States, George Washington. Portions of the township were split up in 1868 to make up Washington Borough. =Washington Borough= According to the latest Washington Borough census, the latest population count in 2010 was a recorded 6,461. A New Jersey Legislature made that it was incorporated as a borough in 1868. It was also named for George Washington, making it one of more than ten communities named after him. Company history Pechiney Plastic Packaging Inc. was established in 1999, based out of Chicago, IL. They sell plastic packaging products such as dairy, meat, types of healthcare, and specialty products. Bristol Meyers Squibb Company is a worldwide industry founded in 1858 based out of New York City, NY. Albea Americas Inc began operating in 2010 and is a steel mill located in Washington, NJ. Rexam Beverage Can Company is another worldwide company that's main facility is in the United Kingdom. Lastly, the Citigroup Inc is globally functioning in over 160 countries. It was founded in 1812, and works as a global financial service company. Superfund designation Pohatcong Valley's danger was recognized in the late 1970s. It was not until 1989, when the area was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) as an active superfund site. State intervention It took about a full decade for EPA to add Pohatcong Valley to the NPL. At that time there was a total of two infected public supply wells. It was not until the mid-1980s when a recorded 79 properties were contaminated with high levels of PCE and TCE that the state began to be concerned. Then in 1989, the government designated an EPA that established Pohatcong Valley as an active superfund site. National intervention It took the national government about two full decades for them to take action in the Pohatcong Valley superfund sites. There were many recorded contaminations in the area, but it was not an alarming amount until 1989. They began soil samples, monitoring of the wells, and aquifer testing. Health and environmental hazards This superfund site consists of two dangerous chemical compounds, trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE). Both consist of very harmful toxins that have long term effects on the central nervous system. PCE is generally used for dry cleaning fabrics and decreasing metals, while TCE is typically used as an industrial solvent. The short-term effects of PCE can include unconsciousness, and the long term effects often include liver and kidney damage. At this site its environmental issues include the contamination of soil and groundwater. The health concerns come from the private unfiltered wells that produce drinking water opposed to the public water supply. Short-term health effects Human exposure to PCE and TCE can have lasting effects on a person. Some of the short-term effects of these chemicals include dizziness, unconsciousness, irritation in the eyes and upper respiratory tract, severe shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, sleepiness, confusion, and impairment of coordination. Long-term health effects The more serious issues that can be developed from PCE and TCE include kidney and liver damage, problems with one's immune system, central nervous system, and respiratory failure. If you are pregnant, exposure to these chemicals can cause a series of birth defects, as well as developmental and reproductive issues. Environmental effects PCE and TCE create unsafe drinking water. When they are released into the soil it evaporates very quickly into the air because of its high vapor pressure and low rate of adsorption in soil. It is extremely toxic to aquatic organisms. Clean up Clean up started up in 1999 and the process included action such as ‚Äú...sampling private wells at off-site properties, conducting soil sampling, soil gas surveys, aquifer testing and a geological survey‚Äù. Clean up continued in 2006 with three different plans specifically for each area that is contaminated. The process is still underway and remains an active superfund site. Initial cleanup The first recorded cleanup process began in 1999 and ‚Äú...it entailed installing groundwater monitor wells and temporary well points, sampling private wells at off-site properties, conducting soil sampling, soil gas surveys, aquifer testing and a geological survey‚Äù. This process was to find out exactly what was the extent of the contamination and to evaluate the extent of the environmental and human health risks. Current status The next steps into resolving the issue of this superfund site began taking place in 2006. Due to the outstanding 9,800-acre contaminated area, it was divided into three sections. Washington Borough, Franklin Township, and Washington Township all have individual plans to further the cleanup process. Washington Borough called for the contaminated groundwater to be pumped out of the ground, cleaned and then put back. Franklin Township went about it with a more personal approach. Individual homes with toxic water wells received their own treatment systems. Washington Township has contaminated soil that ‚Äú...Pechiney and Albea are yet to determine who is responsible to clean that area‚Äù.

History After six years of study in Vienna, where he acquired German discipline and experienced the grandiose cultural summit of the late romantic era, Enescu moved to Paris, where he continued his studies for another five years at the Paris Conservatory. His contact with the modernity of the French musical world gave him certainty, clarity of thought, measure, elegance in expression and sound color for refined detail, which he learned to blend with what he had learned in Vienna, together with a stream of freshness and optimism, love of life and people, which he had brought with him from his childhood home in Moldavia. The end of his musical apprenticeship was marked by the composition of his Second Violin Sonata in Paris in 1899 . The first performance of the sonata was given in Paris by Jacques Thibaud, violin, with the composer himself at the piano, on 22 February 1900, in a concert that was part of the Concerts Colonne series . The score is dedicated to Joseph and Jacques Thibaud Enescu later acknowledged that this sonata, together with his next work, the Octet for Strings, marked the point where \\"I felt myself evolving rapidly, I was becoming myself . . . Until then, I was fumbling. From that moment I felt able to walk on my own legs, even if not yet to run very fast ...\\" . Analysis The Sonata is in three movements, * Assez mouvement√© * Tranquillement * Vif The construction of each of the three movements is clear, though not entirely according to a textbook observance of the classical models. After the development section proper of the first movement‚Äôs sonata form, there is further development of the main theme, constituting a climax, full of dramatic tension. The slow movement is a ternary form with particularities caused by cyclical returns of musical ideas from the first movement. Unusually, this movement is written in the same key (F minor), as the first movement of the Sonata, which contributes to a blurring of contrasts in favour of a principle of slow and organic transformation of the musical substance. The finale is a rondo with a certain amount of freedom. It is prepared for at the end of the slow movement, which it follows without interruption. Perhaps as compensation for the lack of tonal contrast between the first two movements, the refrain theme begins in D minor, modulating to settle in C major. It is only in its final statement that the tonic of F is confirmed, but this time in major .

He is also known for his work in the bands Crush and Erotic Liquid Culture. Biography Crimson Glory In 1979, guitarist Ben Jackson and drummer Dana Burnell co-founded the band Pierced Arrow, which was later renamed Beowulf. This band underwent multiple lineup changes before they were later joined by Drenning, bassist Jeff Lords, and finally vocalist John Patrick McDonald, Jr., who would become professionally known as Midnight, and settled on the name Crimson Glory in 1983. Since their inception, Crimson Glory have released four studio albums with Drenning and Lords being the only members to appear on each one; Drenning would also serve as the sole guitarist on their third album Strange and Beautiful. Other studio members have been drummer Ravi Jahkotia and vocalist Wade Black, who appeared respectively on Strange and Beautiful and Astronomica. The original lineup eventually reunited in March 2005 with tentative plans for recording a fifth album. However, Midnight passed away in 2009 at the age of 47 from a stomach aneurysm. In 2010, Crimson Glory reemerged with new vocalist Todd La Torre and tentative plans for a fifth album. The band toured for three years before La Torre parted ways with the band to join Queensr√øche, putting the band on hiatus again. Other musical projects When Crimson Glory first went on hiatus after a brief tour in support of Strange and Beautiful with vocalist David VanLanding filling in for Midnight, Drenning along with Lords and Jahkotia formed the short-lived projects Crush (with vocalist Billy Martinez) and Erotic Liquid Culture (with VanLanding), releasing one label-supported, self-titled album for each project. Equipment Drenning is a long time user of Jackson guitars, normally favoring the Rhoads model. He also uses other guitars, most notably a Gibson Les Paul Gold Top. Personal life Drenning and his ex-wife Danae Saree have a son and an adopted daughter. In 2005, while playing in Crush, Drenning pursued a career as football journalist, mentored by senior ESPN NFL analyst and College and Pro Football News Weekly editor Frank Ross and appearing occasionally on ESPN2. In April 2014, Drenning was arrested on charges of conspiracy to purchase cocaine and use of a two-way communication device to facilitate a felony.

Mass murder research Duwe's research on mass murder has examined its patterns and prevalence, the role of the news media in its social construction as a crime problem, and the impact of right- to-carry concealed firearms laws on mass public shootings. In 2007, he wrote the book, Mass Murder in the United States: A History, an \\"excellent historical analysis of mass murder in the United States\\" that is still considered \\"one of the most exhaustive studies\\" that has been done on the topic. Since the publication of Mass Murder in the United States: A History, Duwe has written articles that have focused on mass public shootings. In these articles, Duwe argues that while mass public shootings have not recently been on the rise, they have become more deadly. He has been critical of the methods Mother Jones has used to compile its mass shooting dataset and the conclusions that have been drawn from the use of these data. Corrections research Duwe has published more than 50 research studies and program evaluations in peer- reviewed academic journals on a wide variety of correctional topics. He is the author of a 2017 report published by the National Institute of Justice on the use and impact of correctional interventions on prison misconduct, post-prison employment, recidivism, and cost avoidance.

Walsh was the first woman to be registered with the American Stock Exchange, the first woman to be director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and first woman to be president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade.  Early life, education, and early career  Margaret Julia Curry was born on March 29, 1923 in Akron, Ohio into a working-class family. Her father worked on the assembly line at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Her mother was a bookkeeper before her marriage. Curry was president of her high school and a citywide student council. She excelled academically, earning a scholarship to Smith College and graduating as a salutatorian. Her mother encouraged her to enroll at Kent State and lived at home as a compromise with her father who objected to her pursuing further schooling, and instead wanted her to take a clerical position. At Kent State, Curry was the first woman to be president of the student body. During summer after her sophomore year at Kent State, she was a member of a group of college students in the United States who studied world problems. She met First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who inspired her to pursue a career in public service and to consider life pursuits not usually done by women. Curry graduated from Kent State in June 1945 as the first woman to receive an undergraduate degree in business administration. In 1945, Curry applied for a position in United States government foreign service, and after passing the Foreign Service exam she relocated to Munich, Germany to work as an administrative assistant at the consulate. She held another foreign service position as the director of the Fulbright Program in Turkey. Curry met United States Army officer John Montgomery while the two were living in Germany. They married in 1948. She enrolled in correspondence courses at New York University and at George Washington University to strengthen her career opportunities. George Ferris Jr., then vice president of Ferris & Company, was one of her professors and recognized her aptitude for financial investing. She was the first woman to earn a degree in business from George Washington University. Ferris hired her as a broker with his securities firm, Ferris & Co. Inc. in 1955. In 1957, John Montgomery died in an accident. As a career woman with four children, she needed reliable childcare so she employed her mother-in-law to stay with her children, \\"paying her 20 percent of her earnings, plus health benefits, a pension plan and profit-sharing.\\" Five years after she was widowed she had the highest earned income of any woman in Washington, DC. In 1962 Montgomery at age 39 was the first woman to graduate from the 13-week Advanced Management Program of the Harvard Business School. While at Harvard Business School Montgomery faced the \\"full force of male chauvinism\\" for the first time. She married Thomas M. Walsh, a real estate executive, in 1963. She was the mother to twelve children - four sons with Montgomery (John Montgomery, Stephen Montgomery, Michael Montgomery, and Mark Montgomery), one daughter with Walsh (Margaret Walsh Cornog), and seven stepchildren (Mary Frances Walsh, Patrick Joseph Walsh, Kathleen Walsh Carr, Thomas D. Walsh, Joan Walsh Cassedy, Anne Walsh Walton, Daniel E. Walsh).  Career in finance  Walsh was recruited by her professor, George Ferris, to his securities firm, Ferris & Co. Inc. first as an unpaid intern in 1955. She spent twenty-two years at Ferris, and held positions of general partner (1959), senior vice president (1971) and vice chair (1973). At that time, Walsh was the only woman to be a partner of a New York Stock Exchange firm in Washington. Attempting to change the 116-year tradition of male only membership, Walsh and Phyllis S. Peterson applied for full membership in American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in 1965. At the time the exchange had some women associate members, but no woman was a full member. Both women were admitted. In 1972, she was the second woman elected to the AMEX Board of Governors, and the first woman to come from the securities industry. As a Governor, she successfully formulated a plan to attract companies to the AMEX. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter offered her a seat on the Security Exchange Commission which she turned down because after her term ended she would be \\"too young to retire\\" and \\"too old to develop another career.\\" Walsh served as director of Esmark and Pitney Bowes.  Julia M. Walsh and Sons  Looking for a challenge and thinking that the time was right for a woman to prosper in financial services, Walsh founded Julia Walsh and Sons in 1977. In November 1979, the firm joined the New York Stock Exchange. At its peak Julia Walsh & Sons did between $20 million and $30 million a year in revenue. In 1983, Julia Walsh and Sons sold to Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., a Boston investment and brokerage firm that was a subsidiary of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company. Walsh became a managing partner at Tucker, Anthony. At the time of the sale, John Montgomery, one of Walsh's business-partner sons, said that with deregulation, to do a good job, we have to offer an increasingly wide array of products.  Public service  Walsh thought that business people had a responsibility to engage in public service. In 1980, Walsh was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.  Democratic Party  Walsh served as co-treasurer of the National Democratic Party in 1966.  Recognition  In 1969, Walsh received an honorary LL.D., Doctor of Laws from Hood College. In 1982, the American Association of University Women (AAUW) Educational Foundation presented Walsh with the AAUW Achievement Award. She was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1986.  Later life and death  In 1985 Walsh was the first woman to be president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. United States President George H. W. Bush appointed her to the commission to help rebuild post-Cold War Czechoslovakia. Walsh retired in 1993 after several vascular strokes. Walsh and her family raised funds to research stroke prevention. In 1996, she wrote her memoir, Risks and Rewards: A Memoir, with Anne C. Carson. Walsh died on July 2, 2003 in Rockville, Maryland.

Geography Dar Bouazza is located on the Chaouia plain on Morocco's Atlantic coast. It adjoins the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the city of Casablanca to the east, the rural commune of Ouled Azzouz to the south, and Berrechid Province to the west. It consists of two neighbourhoods: Tamaris to the west, where the beaches and municipal headquarters are located; and Errahma to the east, site of the new town currently under construction. Dar Bouazza is well known in Morocco for its beautiful beaches. In the 1940s, the Jaquier family built the first seaside resort in the area, lending their name to Jack Beach in the process. The wetlands or dayas of Dar Bouazza are located on the coast near the border with Casablanca and are the last of their kind remaining in the Casablanca area.

Toppi fostered a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother and this devotion further developed and was solidified when he was appointed to oversee the Marian shrine in the Pompei prelature. He carried out his duties to the fullest as a teacher serving in Palermo and Naples prior to his episcopal appointment and served in various capacities of leadership for his order. Toppi's reputation for holiness and his rapport with the faithful led to calls after his death for his cause of beatification to be introduced and the cause was introduced on 3 October 2013 titling Toppi as a Servant of God. Life Vincenzo Toppi was born on 26 June 1925 in Brusciano to humble and simple peasants. Toppi had total and unconditional love for the Blessed Mother and desired nothing more since his childhood than total self-giving all for Jesus Christ. But his piousness was often countered with mischievousness since he liked pranks that appealed to his often exuberant character. He was also noted for his keen intelligence and was seen as a brilliant student due to his academic achievements. His father had initial doubts about his son's vocation but encouraged him after giving him his blessing. He commenced his ecclesial studies on 19 October 1936 in the San Agnello district in Sorrento and in 1940 completed high school which he had spent in both Nola and Avellino where he had completed his theological education from 1944 until 1948. He commenced his novitiate in the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in 1940 when he entered their order and he later made his perpetual profession of vows on 7 July 1947. Toppi graduated from the Pontifical Gregorian in Rome in historical sciences on 20 June 1951. Toppi began teaching in Naples in the old convent of Sant'Efremo (1957‚Äì71) while from 1959 to 1968 serving as the provincial superior for the Naples province of his order; he held exactly the same position from 1971 to 1976 though for the Sicilian province when he was based in Palermo. It was during this period that he made visits to both Africa and Latin America. He later taught at the Ateneo San Giovanni Evangelista in Palermo from 1974 to 1976 of which he was one of the co-founders of. Toppi later published the historical thesis entitled \\"Maria Lorenza Longo e l'Opera del Divino Amore a Napoli\\"; he was also a writer. He once met with Saint Pio da Pietrelcina and with Chiara Lubich of the Focolare Movement. Toppi collaborated with Catholic Action in Benevento and with the Secular Franciscan Order in Naples and he served on the Diocesan Pastoral Council of the Nola diocese from 1984 until 1989. Pope John Paul II appointed Toppi on 13 October 1990 as the Bishop- Prelate of Pompei while elevating him as an archbishop (the holder of the said office was a bishop in rank). Cardinal Michele Giordano conferred episcopal consecration upon Toppi on the following 7 December in the Santuario della Beata Vergine del Rosario di Pompei. In 2000 he submitted his resignation to the pope in accordance with canon law and this was accepted later in 2001. Toppi died at 1:00am on 2 April 2007 in a Franciscan convent after a prolonged period of frail health and Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe presided over his funeral at 4:00pm on 3 April. His remains were interred in the Santuario della Beata Vergine del Rosario di Pompei. Beatification process On 15 April 2013 the bishops from the Campania region approved the proposal to request and launch the beatification cause for Toppi and this decision was communicated one month later. The official request was lodged to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 13 June 2013. The cause commenced on 3 October 2013 under Pope Francis once the C.C.S. issued the official edict of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against the cause) which approved the cause's introduction and titled Toppi as a Servant of God. Tommaso Caputo inaugurated the diocesan process on 2 April 2014 and later closed the process upon the investigation being completed on 13 October 2016. The current postulator for this is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni and the vice-postulator for the cause is the priest Massimiliano Noviello.

Knudsen worked on symbolistic and exotic themes. He collaborated with Finnish composers Jean Sibelius in 1911 on the tragic ballet-pantomime, Scaramouche, and with Leevi Madetoja in 1927 on a second ballet-pantomime, Okon Fuoko. The premieres of each production, however, were delayed and, upon being premiered, Knudsen was faulted for weak libretti. Okon Fuko Okon Fuko is Japanese- themed ballet in one act by Knudsen and Leevi Madetoja. Knudsen provided the libretto and Madetoja composed the music. Madetoja had been introduced to Knudsen's work probably by Wilhelm Hansen. Madetoja might have met Knudsen while in Copenhagen in 1925. After composing Okon Fuko for two years, Madetoja sent the score to Knudsen in Copenhagen. Georg H√∏eberg conducted the score for a rehearsal and was very pleased with it, calling it a masterpiece. The Royal Danish Theatre had promised Knudsen that Okon Fuko would be staged in the form of pantomime as soon as it was ready. Encouraged by the positive feedback, Knudsen hoped Okon Fuko would be someday staged in Paris as well. In his letter to Madetoja outlining his plans for Okon Fuko, Knudsen enclosed another libretto for a new opera, hoping Madetoja would compose it, too. Madetoja, however, was still waiting for Okon Fuko to be premiered and was not interested in a new project. Okon Fukos premier was delayed despite being given the go-ahead by the Royal Danish Theatre, because a suitable lead actor could not be cast. Knudsen insisted on Johannes Poulsen playing the lead role, but Poulsen was on a leave from the theatre. Kundsen opted to wait until Poulsen would return. Meanwhile, Knutsen's ambition knew and he envisioned ‚Äì in addition to Paris ‚Äì staging in London, and Germany, and even a making a film, but Madetoja did not agree with his plans. After all, the two had agreed to split the profits half-and-half for shows abroad but two-thirds to Madetoja and one third for Knudsen for performances in Finland. In the end, Okon Fuko was agreed to be premiered in Finland. Knudsen hoped positive reviews there would advance his cause in Denmark. Okon Fuko was finally premiered in the Finnish Opera on 12 February 1930. Critical reception was unenthusiastic, and many Finnish critics preferred to blame Knudsen rather than Madetoja for the work's weaknesses. The drama of the play in particular was criticized, and because Madetoja did not agree to Knudsen's request to compose it in the form of an opera, he is partly to blame. About a year later, Knudsen still wanted more audiences for Okon Fuko and wrote to Madetoja presenting his plans. Knudsen wanted to publish the work in Germany, with the partiture abridged and with additional music, but received little encouragement from Madetoja. Still in 1935 Knudsen approached Madetoja: chances of the play ever being staged at the Royal Danish Theatre seemed bleak, and the challenge of finding an actor who could sing and mime as well, remained an obstacle for performances elsewhere as well. Knudsen thus proposed that Okon Fuko should be adapted as an opera instead. Knudsen and Madetoja's ways parted in 1937. Plans to stage Okon Fuko in Dortmund had failed, but Knudsen presented two new librettos for Madetoja to compose: an opera based on a theme by E. T. A. Hoffmann, and a ballet that was originally to be composed by Carl Nielsen who had died suddenly. In the end, Okon Fuko was performed only thrice in Finland and never abroad. Other works Knudesn also made a libretto for Jean Sibelius' Scaramouche. While Okon Fuko was still without a premiere, Madetoja agreed to compose music for Knudsen's new play Les masques de la vie et de la mort for the Royal Danish Theater, but Madetoja never finished this task.

He was eponymous consul for AD 119 as the colleague of the emperor Hadrian. Rusticus is known only through surviving inscriptions. Rusticus poses a mystery to historians of the period. He is known only from his consulship, yet as the colleague of the emperor, a very prestigious honor; why he received this honor is unknown. It may be that he was a childhood friend or associate of Hadrian's, but Ronald Syme notes that, in Baetica, the home province of Hadrian, only six people with the gentilicum \\"Dasumius\\" are known -- and none in the other Spanish provinces.Syme, \\"The Testamentum Dasumii: Some Novelties\\", Chiron, 15 (1985), p. 44 For some time, he was thought to be the testator of the Testamentum Dasumii. The grounds for this identification was first proposed by Bartolomeo Borghesi: that an heir in the will named \\"Dasumia\\" was assumed to be his daughter, and thus his gentilicum was \\"Dasumius\\". This argument was widely accepted, forcing experts to assume the testator was Lucius Dasumius Hadrianus, proconsul of Asia (106/107), then later Rusticus, until a new piece of the inscription was identified which invalidated Borghesi's argument.Werner Eck, \\"Zum Neuen Fragment des sogenannten testamentum Dasumii\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 30 (1978), pp. 277-295 The identity of the testator of the Testamentum remains unknown. As an adjunct of his supposed association with the Testamentum Dasumii, Rusticus was thought to be the adoptive father of Lucius P.f. Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, consul in 152; but, on learning that the testator's name was not Dasumius, there is no evidence to connect the two, although Olli Salomies notes \\"the adoptive father -- who seems to be otherwise unknown -- was certainly related to Rusticus.\\"Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 99  References  2nd-century Romans Imperial Roman consuls Rusticus, Publius Dasumius ","title":"Publius Dasumius Rusticus"},{"id":"55477309","text":"Peter Dowd may refer to: *Peter Dowd (born 1957), British politician *Peter Dowd (academic) (born 1946), Australian professor of Mining Engineering ","title":"Peter Dowd (disambiguation)"},{"id":"55477352","title":"HB Colony"},{"id":"55477360","text":"Jaynagar - Udhna Antyodaya Express is an express train belonging to East Central Railway zone that runs between Jaynagar and Udhna Junction.

According to The Times, \\"the movement was set up as a self-proclaimed 'anti-extremist' movement\\" but has increasingly become associated with far-right politics and far-right activists. The Premier League has warned clubs that \\"the group is using fans and stadiums to push an anti-Muslim agenda\\". Concern has also been expressed that the Alliance is \\"giving cover to the far right\\" and \\"uses a secret Facebook page full of violent, racist and misogynistic posts\\".  History  Following a number of terror attacks in the UK, including the Westminster Bridge attack (22 March 2017) and the bombing of Manchester Arena (22 May 2017), a group of Tottenham Hotspur (Spurs) supporters organised a march in London in June 2017 against extremism, led by Spurs supporter John Meighan. The FLA was registered as a private company in August 2017. A store was opened online selling t-shirts, hoodies and caps. The second FLA march was in October 2017, present were members \\"Veterans Against Terrorism\\" (VAT), an advocacy group made up of claimed military veterans which opposes what it describes as \\"Islamist extremists\\". The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) monitored the FLA's social media posts as part of their ongoing research into extremist movements and tactics online. It reported that, in less than a year, the FLA had moved to the right. FLA organized a campaign selling pin badges featuring the poppy symbol of The Royal British Legion donating sums collected to the Legion. The charity however returned a ¬£1,104 donation to the FLA on 11 April 2018 saying that, \\"a small number of FLA supporters have expressed views and opinions that are not compatible with the values of The Royal British Legion.\\" FLA founder Meighan stood down on 16 April 2018 saying that the company would be dissolved. It was finally formally dissolved on 22 January 2019. An FLA march was held on 19 May 2018 to mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing with around 200 people attending. An opposition rally was organized with around 800 people, with speakers from anti-racist and anti- fascist movements, local councillors and trade union bodies. FLA split and formation of DFLA Logo of the Democratic Football Lads Alliance or the \\"true\\" FLA. The organisation split over certain issues, with some senior activists setting up the Democratic Football Lads Alliance (DFLA or the \\"Democratic FLA\\" or \\"true FLA\\"). It has adopted the slogan \\"Against All Extremism\\". The DFLA leader and march organiser is Phillip Hickin. On 13 October 2018, the DFLA staged a rally in central London which was stopped by anti-fascist protesters, and resulted in violence against the police. Later that week, Premier League club, West Ham United suspended their under-18s coach, Mark Phillips, following his attendance at the DFLA rally. The club said \\"We have a zero tolerance policy to any form of violent or abusive behaviour. We continue to protect and cherish those values and we remain committed to ensuring that every single member of the West Ham family feels safe, respected and included.\\" An anti-Brexit rally in London on 7 September 2019 was disrupted by pro-Brexit demonstrators organized by the DFLA.

During the period of general land surveying of Russia in 1888, the stanitsa of Romanovskaya was designated along with Tsimlyanskaya to the 1st Don district, with the district center in the stanitsa of Konstantinovskaya. In 1963, with the consolidation of rural areas and cities in the region, Romanovsky District, which had existed since 1937 and in 1957 was renamed Volgodonskoy, became part of Tsimlyansky District.

Dating from the Sikh era of the mid-19th century, the haveli is considered to be one of the finest examples of Sikh architecture in Lahore, and is the only Sikh-era haveli that preserves its original ornamentation and architecture. Location The haveli is located within the Walled City of Lahore, and is located near the Mori Gate in the southern half of the walled city. The haveli is also near the Bhatti Gate and Lohari Gate. History The haveli was built around 1830 or 1840 for Nau Nihal Singh, by his grandfather and founder of the Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh.The Free Library. S.v. Hindu symbolism in sikh art brickwork in Haveli Naunihal Singh..\\" Retrieved Oct 08 2017 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hindu+symbolism+in+sikh+art+brickwork+in+Haveli+Naunihal+Singh.-a0389937207 The mansion was intended to be a personal residence for Nau Nihal Singh. The haveli has been used, since the British colonial era, to house the Victoria Girls' High School. Architecture The base of the haveli is rectangular in shape, with its entrance on the western side. The fa√ßade is divided into two sections, with the portion housing the haveli's entryway profusely decorated with frescoes painted in the vivid Kangra style, and the other pierced with numerous windows. A large jharoka balcony with sculpted brickwork and a small bulbous half dome is above the haveli's entry, which acted as a Jharoka-e- Darshan from which the Maharaja could view his subjects gathered below. The jharoka features 5 small arches, and is embellished imagery of winged humans, parrots, and frontally-viewed fish that are carved in a style which displays East Asian influences. The winged humans resemble both Islamic descriptions of angels, but also reflect influences of the mythical Hindu garuda. The base of the dome is decorated with a serpent-like figure which echoes the Hindu snake god Naga. The Jharoka-e-Darshan is flanked by two smaller jharokas. Each of the haveli's jharokas is decorated with a floral pedestal. The building has four stories, and a basement level. The fourth level is made of a small room known as Rang Mahal (\\"Colour palace\\"), or alternatively as Sheesh Mahal (\\"Mirror palace\\"), with large screens that form a space in which to catch breezes. The remaining floors were built with high ceilings, to exaggerate the height of the structure in order to give the appearance of a citadel, rather than a private residence. The ceilings of the haveli are made of decorated wood inlaid with glass and mirror, as well as sun-motifs in the central portion of the roof. Walls within the haveli are decorated with false arches that each contain a small 18 inch by 18 inch painting, with blues, golds, reds, and oranges dominating the haveli's colour palette. The interior is also decorated with carved wood, brickwork, and floral frescoes. The haveli features a large 2 storied inner courtyard which was also profusely decorated - the bottom level of which has since been whitewashed. In front of the haveli is a small plaza known as Maydan ka Bhaiyan that was once used as the haveli's garden. Conservation The haveli is protected by the Antiquities Act 1975.

He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at the age of 13 to study organ with Fran√ßois Benoist (1st Prize of organ in 1860) and music composition with Ambroise Thomas, of which he became assistant in composition class. In 1860, he was appointed to the choir organ of the √âglise Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin (Paris), then to the great organ the following year. He then appeared in the gallery of the Church of Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle where he inaugurated the organ in 1863, at Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle, then at Saint-Merri in 1866. Finally, he was appointed titular organist of the new Cavaill√©-Coll organ of the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√© in 1869, a position he held until his premature death at the age of 34 years of tuberculosis. √âglise de la Sainte- Trinit√© Paris where Chauvet was titular organist from 1869 to 1871 .

It was founded in 1867 as a mission and is now established as a separate parish. The first church building was a temporary iron church which was then replaced in 1876 by a substantial Victorian Gothic stone building which is now Grade II listed. Subsidence made that unsafe and it was deconsecrated in 1979. It has been converted to flats but still forms the landmark centrepiece of the St Stephen's Conservation Area. The congregation now holds services on the site of the church hall which has been redeveloped as the third church building and church centre. History The parish of Christ Church was created in Ealing in 1853 for the increased population in the area, following the opening of a railway station in 1838. The population continued to grow and the vicar, Stephen Hilliard, decided to establish a mission on Castlebar Hill, to the northwest, where Henry de Bruno Austin was developing the area with large houses. The first church building was prefabricated from corrugated iron for rapid construction ‚Äì an iron church. This opened as St Stephen's on Wednesday, 12 June 1867 with a sermon preached by the Bishop of Ripon, Robert Bickersteth. The second permanent church building was a substantial stone church, built of ragstone with ashlar dressings and a slate roof. It cost ¬£6,000 and was consecrated on 3 June 1876 by the Bishop of London. A tall steeple was added in 1891, designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield. The attendance by the end of the century was substantial ‚Äî 570 worshippers being recorded for morning services in 1903 plus another 300 in the evening. In 1907, the vicar, Dr. Tupholme, founded a new mission church at the foot of the hill in Pitshanger. This was St Barnabas' Church, which was initially another iron church seating just 250 worshippers, and so a more substantial brick church was built nearby, seating a thousand. Plans for this were discussed in 1911 at a meeting chaired by Henry Vivian of the Brentham Garden Suburb and it was agreed that there would be restrictions on bell- ringing. After its large church building was completed in 1916, St Barnabas became a separate parish. The stone church built for St Stephen's still stands and is listed for preservation as Grade II. It was deconsecrated in 1979 after subsidence caused it to become unsafe and it was then converted into flats as St Stephen's Court. The St Stephen's congregation continued to meet in the church hall to the south east and that site was then redeveloped into the current church building, which was dedicated in 1987. This is a lower complex in modern red brick with slate roofs and is called St Stephen's Church Centre. Bells A set of eight bells were cast for the steeple by Mears & Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. These were completed in 1911 and blessed for use in 1912. A team of bell ringers was soon established and their regular Sunday peal lasted 40 minutes. Visiting teams of bell ringers were also invited and, in 1921, the Ancient Society of College Youths rang a peal of 2 hours on a Saturday. This caused complaints ‚Äì \\"Why do they have this tremendous bell ringing? ... what might almost be termed cruelty\\" ‚Äì and the Reverend Maynard called a meeting which agreed that the bells should only be rung on alternate Sundays. Later, in 1979, when the building was declared unsafe, the bells were removed and stored in a Docklands warehouse as possible replacements for the swaying bells of St Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. But instead, in 1987, the bells were restored by Eayre & Smith and then installed in St Machar's Cathedral in Aberdeen which is now one of the few churches in Scotland to have a set of bells designed for change ringing. Conservation area The stone church building is on an island site at the head of The Avenue ‚Äì a broad, straight road, lined with mature plane trees, which leads up the hill to the church in a grand, processional style. This avenue and its continuation of North Avenue form the spine of the St Stephen's Conservation Area. The housing of this area is subject to planning controls to preserve its Edwardian appearance and character. The assessment commissioned by the borough council explains the importance of the church for this scene: School 400px A parochial school was opened by the church in 1867. This used a stable in Castlebar Mews off Pitshanger Lane. This was crowded and so a purpose-built schoolroom and house were built nearby on Albert Road and they opened in 1882. They too became crowded and, by 1910, the attendance was 209 pupils. In 1911, the girls and infants were transferred to North Ealing School, which was run by the council.

Is one of the most important regional newspapers of the country. History El Liberal was founded by the political activist Juan Figueroa on November 3, 1898. His first print was 200 copies, in an edition that the media remember as \\"almost handmade\\", since it was printed with a hand press. It's the oldest newspaper in northern Argentina. In 1926 the newspaper was transferred to its current headquarters in the center of the capital of Santiago del Estero, and three years later the newspaper was sold to two lawyers: Jos√© and Antonio Castiglione; Jos√© exercised the direction of the newspaper until his death and was succeeded by his younger brother, Antonio, who redefined the orientation of the newspaper, changing it from an evening tabloid into a morning broadsheet, and leaving his characteristic opinion platform to a journalistic and informative format. After the death of Antonio Castiglione, the editorial board of the newspaper was in charge of Aldo Castiglione (son of Jose) and the executive direction in charge of Julio C√©sar Castiglione (son of Antonio). The Castiglione family had control of the newspaper until May 7, 2009, when the control of the newspaper was taken by the Ick Group. The current director of the newspaper is Gustavo Ick. The headquarters of the newspaper remains in the same location and is printed as tabloid again. Editorial stance El Liberal was born as a nationalist progressive newspaper, with secular orientation and strong defense and promotion of civil and political rights. With the management of the Castiglione family, the newspaper was reoriented to an informative journalism, opens its pages to the Catholic Church, and in its editorials shows a centrist position. However, the newspaper kept open its page for center-left wing leaning authors. The newspaper traditionally advocates for economic, cultural, social, civil and political rights and as well for freedom of expression, environmental protection, sustainable development and free education and healthcare. From its editorial pages, El Liberal supported many civic movements and stood for citizens participation. During the decade of 1990, the newspaper got international and national acclaim for its investigative pieces, human rights and environmental reporting, photography, visual journalism, health news, human storytelling and its Op-Eds. At that time, El Liberal got awards from the Inter American Press Association, Merck & Co., University of Navarra and other national and international journalism institutions. Attacks During the decade of 1990, many journalists of the newspaper suffered aggressions from several parties, according to reports of human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International. In 2000, the Inter American Press Association reported an alleged political and judicial persecution against the newspaper by the governor of Santiago del Estero, Carlos Ju√°rez, in apparent reprisal for his newspaper reports against him. The newspaper faced a lawsuits filed by 4,000 women affiliated with the ruling party, seeking $19 million for material that had already been published by La Voz del Interior another newspaper.

Prensa Valenciana, 2007 The 49th Mixed Brigade (),SBHAC - Brigadas Mixtas del Ej√©rcito Popular, 49¬™ Brigada MixtaCarlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 p. 76 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in February 1937 at the Guadalajara Front. This ill-fated military unit suffered heavy casualties over and over again during its involvement in different conflicts of the Civil War. It was finally terminated after the bombing of X√†tiva in February 1939. History First phase The 49th Mixed Brigade was formed in Guadalajara with four battalions, the \\"Pablo Iglesias Battalion\\", the \\"Triunfo Battalion\\" and the \\"Guadalajara n¬∫ 1\\" and \\"Guadalajara n¬∫ 2\\" Battalions, which became the 193, 194, 195 and 196 battalions respectively. The commander was Infantry Lt. Colonel √Ångel de la Macorra Carratal√°, a retired commander living in Madrid at the beginning of the conflict. The new unit was placed under the XII Division of the IV Army Corps of the Central Army. On 9 March 1937 the 49th Mixed Brigade had its baptism of fire at the Guadalajara Front, where it became part of the Republican forces that fought the Fascist Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie. Anti-Fascist Italian Major Arturo Zanoni took the command of the unit relieving de la Macorra for a brief period of time. He was then replaced by Infantry Commander Fulgencio Gonz√°lez G√≥mez who had been captain at the 15th Almansa Regiment (Regimiento Almansa n¬∫ 15) in Tarragona. The commissar was Francisco Ant√≥n Sanz. After the Battle of Guadalajara the unit was sent to the Extremadura front on 14 May. Thereafter it joined the Cuenca Autonomous Group (Agrupaci√≥n Aut√≥noma de Cuenca) and went to the Huesca Front, returning to Madrid shortly after the failed offensive. Battle of Brunete On 8 July the 49th Mixed Brigade became part of the vanguard at the Battle of Brunete and after three days the brigade was placed under the A Division (Divisi√≥n A) of the V Army Corps of the Central Army. Its mission was to advance from Portillera de las Rozas until the V√©rtice Cristo along the Majadahonda-Boadilla del Monte road until reaching the V√©rtice Manilla behind Romanillos. On 12 July the brigade crossed to the right flank and after two days it was made part of the Dur√°n Division. During the night of the 24 to 25 July it relieved the 10th Mixed Brigade at the Perales River. Towards the final phase of the fight at Brunete it was placed under the V Army Corps and at the end of the battle it became part of the XLVII Division of the XVIII Army Corps. Last phase and end of the unit The following commander of the unit would be Militia Major Emeterio Rodr√≠guez Sanabria. Under his command the 49th Mixed Brigade took part in the Battle of Teruel and later in the Battle of Alfambra, where its ranks were heavily depleted while trying to conquer 961 Hill (Cota 961) on 7 and 10 January. Only in the first day it suffered 213 casualties. On 3 April the unit found itself at the breaking point of the front which was submitted to vehement attacks by the forces of rebel general Antonio Aranda and it had to withdraw from the first line after being badly shattered. On 30 May the 49th Mixed Brigade was again very hard hit fighting the rebel Levante Offensive in the Ares del Maestrat-La Jana sector. Towards the beginning of July the much depleted unit was defending Castell√≥n under the command of Infantry Major Amado Granell, but on the 15 it was definitively withdrawn for its reorganization. Following the Levante battles Militia Major Fernando Gil Ferragut became the new leader of the unit and the brigade was transferred to the less active southern front of the Levantine Army.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 p. 77 On 12 February 1939, when the train transporting the 49th Mixed Brigade was stopped at X√†tiva, a group of Italian Aviazione Legionaria bombers attacked the train station, leaving 129 dead and over 200 wounded.Pablo Rodr√≠guez Cort√©s: Febrero de 1939 en X√°tiva . Many of the soldiers in the military train, as well as families and onlookers who were at the station to say farewell became victims of the bombing. There were so many dead among the members of the 49th Mixed Brigade, that the Republican high command desisted from reconstituting it, distributing the survivors among other military units.

Vacis had a Gothic name and, if the words Procopius attributes to him are accurate, identified as a Goth. From the latter's brief account, it can also be inferred that he could speak Latin. Procopius (De bello Gothico, I.18.39‚Äì41), calls him one of the archontes (leaders) of the Goths and \\"a man of no mean station\\". He records that in February 537, after Belisarius took Rome, he was dispatched by Witigis to persuade the citizens of Rome not to abandon the Ostrogoths. He gave a speech at the Porta Salaria in which he reminded the Romans that the Ostrogoths were capable of defending them, but the Greeks had only ever came to Italy before as \\"actors of tragedy and mimes and thieving sailors\\". The Romans made no response and the siege of Rome began the following day. Vacis is probably to be identified with the Vacimus who fought the Greeks in the following year. Procopius (II.13.5‚Äì15) describes him as an archon dispatched by Witigis against the Greek forces under Conon at Ancona in the summer of 538, for which task Vacimus took men from the garrison of Osimo. Although he inflicted a major defeat on Conon in the open field, he was unable to take the city. He may have been involved in the failed defence of Osimo in 539, but this can only be a guess. Vacis may also be identified with the Wacces who served King Theodahad as maior domus in 534‚Äì535. According to a letter of Cassiodorus to the Senate, he was placed in charge of Ostrogothic troops in Rome after Theodahad received a complaint about their behaviour from the Senate. Possibly Wacces is the unnamed individual mentioned in an earlier letter of Cassiodorus who was put in charge of victualing the army in Rome in such a way as to spread the burden of its upkeep fairly across the populace. Wacces was considered a man of virtue and integrity who would stand as an example for the soldiers. If his identification with Vacis is correct, then he must have been part of the faction of the aristocracy that immediately threw its support behind Witigis despite the latter's poor treatment of the deposed Theodahad.

In 2015 the Moroccan Health Ministry estimated there were 50,000 prostitutes in Morocco, the majority in the Marrakech area. Prostitutes tend to be mostly from Nigeria, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait UNAIDS estimated the figure at 75,000 in 2016. Many children are vulnerable as adoption laws in Morocco are very rigid and difficult. Morocco's increasing reputation for attracting foreign pedophiles made it sign various international treaties to deal with the problem. Male prostitution exists but is stigmatised. Health services for Moroccan sex workers include OPALS, an organisation promoting treatments for HIV/AIDS. Traditionally, women's roles in North African society have been rigidly defined, particularly so with increasing Islamification. Yet the economic and social realities often provide few alternatives to many Moroccan women, and the area has increasingly been seen as permissive to prostitution. French colonial rule Entrance to the Bousbir in Casablanca early 20th century A BMC in Morocco in the 1920s During French colonial rule prostitution was regulated. The authorities were concerned about the spread of STIs, particularly syphilis, amongst the troops stationed in the colony. \\"Quartiers r√©serv√©s\\" (red-light districts) were set up where prostitution was permitted: Bousbir in Casablanca, Moullay Abdullah in Fez, Oukassa in Rabat and Bab el Khemis in Marrakesh. Within these quartiers r√©serv√©s prostitutes had to be registered and have mandatory regular health checks. They had to carry their registration card with them at all times and travel outside the quarter was only allowed by permit. Outside the quarters maisons de tol√©rance (brothels) were set up for the use of Europeans. The prostitutes in these maisons were subject to the same regulation. Some prostitutes worked outside the quartiers r√©serv√©s. There was frequent police action against these clandestines and they were forced to take a medical test. Those who were healthy received a warning. If they had a STI they were taken to a hospital. On release from the hospital they were taken to the quartiers r√©serv√©s. Women who received three warnings were forcibly taken to the quartiers r√©serv√©s. Where troops were stationed away from the cities, bordels militaire (mobile brothels) were set up for the soldiers. Much Loved Much Loved is a 2015 French‚ÄìMoroccan film about the prostitution scene in Marrakesh. The film tells about the lives of four prostitutes and shows their exploitation by pimps and the corruption of the police. The film was banned in Morocco for its \\"contempt for moral values and the Moroccan woman\\". The leading actress, Loubna Abidar, received death threats and in November 2015, she was violently attacked in Casablanca and left the country for France soon after.Much Loved : apr√®s son agression, Loubna Abidar se r√©fugie en France (French), lefigaro.fr, 8 novembre 2015 Religious authorities condemned the film for portraying a negative image of Morocco, with its supporting of extramarital sex and sympathy for homosexuals. Chikhat Chikhat (Arabic ÿ¥ŸäÿÆÿ© shƒ´kha) is a Moroccan term for singers, musicians, dancers and prostitutesMarie Virolle-Souib√®s, Gestes d‚ÄôAlg√©rie, Karthala, 2007, p. 78 Traditionally female entertainers were also prostitutes. Often they were part of a traveling show. In modern times performers of the Chikhat dance are generally not prostitutes. Sex trafficking Morocco is a source, destination, and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. According to a November 2015 study conducted by the Moroccan government, with support by an international organization, children are exploited in sex trafficking. The 2015 study also found that some Moroccan women are forced into prostitution in Morocco by members of their families or other intermediaries. Some female undocumented migrants, primarily from Sub- Saharan Africa and a small but growing number from South Asia, are coerced into prostitution. Criminal networks operating in Oujda on the Algerian border and in the northern coastal town of Nador force undocumented migrant women into prostitution. Some female migrants, particularly Nigerians, who transit Oujda are forced into prostitution once they reach Europe. International organizations, local NGOs, and migrants report unaccompanied children and women from Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Cameroon are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking in Morocco. Some reports suggest Cameroonian and Nigerian networks force women into prostitution by threatening the victims and their families; the victims are typically the same nationality as the traffickers. Moroccan women and children are exploited in sex trafficking, primarily in Europe and the Middle East. Moroccan women forced into prostitution abroad experience restrictions on movement, threats, and emotional and physical abuse. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Morocco as a 'Tier 2' country.

William de Mohun gave the church to Bruton Priory in the 12th century. They held the advowson until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Its tower used to display a beacon light for ships approaching the harbour. After being caught in a violent storm at sea, Robert Quirke dedicated a ship and its cargo to God's service, as well as donating a cellar near the quay for prayers to be offered for those at sea. Dating from 1628 and known as the Gibraltar Celler, it is now the Chapel of St Peter. Quirke also donated money from the sale of the ship and its cargo to build almshouses. The church underwent Victorian restoration in 1880 and was further restored in 1974. The parish and benefice of Minehead are within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The blue lias building has red sandstone dressings and a slate roof. It consists of an aisle with a projecting north east chapel.

It preserves an area of a type of wetland (sabkha or salt plain) once common along the western coastal plains of the UAE and consists of a visitor centre with viewing points to both captive and wild birds, as well as extensive areas of dunes, mud flats, salty lagoons and freshwater pools. Located in the northern Sharjah suburb of Wasit, the centre runs along the Sharjah/Ajman border. The centre comprises of protected habitat and has been designated as a Ramsar site since 2019. The centre, which was opened in 2015 by the ruler of Sharjah, Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, is operated by the Environment and Protected Areas Authority of Sharjah Government and conducts golf-buggy tours around the extensive preservation area, which features a number of hides or observation points. An active educational program is maintained, encouraging visits from local schools. The centre also offers an on-site caf√©, a souvenir store and interactive educational games for children. At the core of the visitor centre is a long, soundproofed gallery which allows visitors to view the birds without disturbing them.  Biodiversity and Environmental Education  The facility's goal is to educate and inform visitors about the unique wetland environment while encouraging its preservation. In addition to viewing areas, the centre has documentation and displays about the wetlands and houses lecture halls and offices. The Wetland Centre provides local fauna and migrant birds a safe place to reproduce. Up to 350 species of bird live in or are migratory visitors to the area, and some 60 species of birds are housed permanently in the visitor centre. These include a number of rare birds, including northern bald ibis, glossy ibis, grey heron, marbled duck (a threatened species), purple swamphen, pink-backed pelican and greater flamingo.  Minimally Invasive  Designed by X-Architects of Dubai in 2012, and completed in 2015, the building integrates into the site's topography to blend into its environment with minimal visual impact. When visitors enter the building, they go underground and into a linear, transparent gallery to view birds in their natural habitat. There are also eight bird observation structures along the wetland path so visitors can observe birds and other wildlife from within the environment. In 2019, the Wasit Wetland Centre received the Aga Khan Award for Architecture. It was one of the first projects in the UAE to be shortlisted for the award, along with Concrete in Alserkal Avenue and Al Mureijah Art Spaces at the Sharjah Art Foundation. A common theme shared by the three projects is education. This project won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture due to its contribution to the betterment of the urban environment. It transformed close to 20 acres of a former wasteland into a pleasant place for visitors to enjoy Nature while simultaneously recovering the native ecosystem. Nowadays it harbours over 350 species of local and migratory birds.  Transforming Wetlands  The site of the Wasit Wetland Centre was once a garbage dump, so the centre‚Äôs establishment literally turned a wasteland into a wetland.

It is in the TR14 postcode area. Knave go by is sometimes erroneously depicted as being located in Dartmoor in the neighboring county of Devon, despite no place of that name ever having existed there. The village is featured as the backdrop to the 1951 book Knave-go-by: the adventures of Jacky Nameless. It also occasionally features in books such as Collection of Weird: Place Names on account of its unusual name. Politics The village is within the Camborne and Redruth UK Parliament Constituency. The current MP of this constituency is George Eustice of the Conservative Party. It is represented at Cornwall Council as part of the Camborne Treslothan Unitary Authority Electoral Division. As of 2017, the current Cornwall Councillor for Camborne Treslothan is David Atherfold from the Conservative Party For European parliamentary purposes, it is within the South West England constituency. Although the Mebyon Kernow party has campaigned for Cornwall to have its own constituency. Name The origin of its name has been subject to speculation. It refers to an incident involving the founder of the Methodist church the Reverend John Wesley. Wesley came to the village several times in August 1743, it is supposed that he took the route to avoid the warden of the neighboring parish. He preached to the local population from a split Elm tree in the village centre. After crowds gathered there to watch John Wesley, an incident occurred by which the village was named, however, the exact details of what happened are subject to speculation. Unfortunately this story appears to be just that - a story - the name was recorded as Never-go-by, before Wesley's time, because it was relatively little visited. According to locals one supposed version is that during one of Wesley‚Äôs missionary visits, a woman leaned from her cottage window and shouted, ‚ÄúLet the knave go by‚Äù, a comment for Wesley to move on. This is based on the supposition that the local Anglicans referred to Wesley as a Knave on account of his faith. Another possible version is that Wesley was heckled by a drunk \\"knave\\" during a sermon, and when the crowd tried to detain the troublemaker, Wesley is reputed to have said, ‚ÄúLet the knave go by.‚Äù The area has been known as Knave-go-bye ever since, although the spelling has varied. John Wesley's Elm Tree named Wesley‚Äôs Tree stood in the village until it died and blew over on Camborne Festival Day, circa mid 1980s. No new tree has been planted at the site to replace it. BBC Radio Cornwall featured an item on the hamlet in 2014, and added a Facebook video of a resident who in part explains the historic nature of this British Heritage location. It was since learned that the tree was not an Oak, as spoken of in the video, but an Elm, which suffered Dutch Elm disease and fell.

Career He was of serf origin (thus he was not related to the Kendi de Szarvaskend noble family). According to his last will and testament, Kendi liberated his parents himself from serfdom, when he was already notary. Based on his noble prefix, it is possible that he was born in the early 1600s in Nagykend (today Chendu, part of BƒÉlƒÉu»ôeri commune in Romania). In 1623, he was a scribe at the Princely Court of Justice during the reign of Gabriel Bethlen. He was a scribe at the Lesser Chancellery between 1632 and 1638. He compiled the urbarium of Sz√©kelyudvarhely (present-day Odorheiu Secuiesc, Romania) and its surrounding areas in 1644. In the last years of Prince George II R√°k√≥czi, Kendi served as notary of Marossz√©k, mentioned in this capacity in 1656. He became a judge of the Princely Court of Justice in the next year, becoming one of the few known lowborn members, who have reached that office. In the same time, he was appointed princely praefectus too and managed the financial affairs of the Alvinc lordship (today Vin»õu de Jos, Romania) in 1659. He was responsible for the collection of extraordinary (including Turkish) taxes in 1660, assisting the work of Andr√°s Ugron, chief treasurer of the principality. During the trouble years of 1658‚Äì61, he constantly interchanged his loyalty between claimants George R√°k√≥czi, John Kem√©ny and Michael Apafi, similarly to the majority of the Transylvanian lords. For instance, he fled to the attackers' camp \\"in an unworthy way to his noble status\\", when John Kem√©ny laid siege to Segesv√°r (Sighi»ôoara, Romania), as Saxon historian Georg Krauss recorded. Contemporary works (including a mocking poem by scribe Luk√°cs) connected his rapid ascension from the lowest social status with his alleged \\"miser and two-faced\\" personality. Michael I Apafi, who ascended the throne in September 1661 appointed Kendi as assistant notary or \\"master of the judgement\\" (), an eminence he occupied as long as he lived. He participated in the upcoming diets and was involved in several lawsuits, for instance the case between the tanners and cobblers in Brass√≥ (today Bra»ôov, Romania) in 1665. According to the narration of Chancellor Mikl√≥s Bethlen's Memoires, Kendi died in the autumn of 1677. Personal life J√°nos Kendi married a noblewoman Erzs√©bet Bak√≥, thus after that, he closely connected to the Transylvanian nobility as a consequence of several marriage alliances. For instance, his brother-in-law was captain-general Istv√°n Bak√≥, who was executed by G√°bor Barcsay, brother of Prince √Åkos Barcsay in 1660. The marriage produced several unidentified children, but all of them predeceased their father Kendi, who adopted his late siblings' children towards the end of his life. Around 1664, he married for the second time to Zs√≥fia M√≥r√©, widow of R√°k√≥czi's former diplomat and envoy Istv√°n Tisza de Borosjen≈ë (died in 1663). He increased his personal wealth on his well-devised marriages and certain juridical maneuvers unascertained by his contemporaries, through which he has also received considerable property. Towards the middle of the 1670s, he owned landholdings and estates in K√ºk√ºll≈ë and Torda counties as well as in the territories of Sz√©kely seats of Marossz√©k and Udvarhelysz√©k. He built his principal residence in Kelementelke (today CƒÉlimƒÉne»ôti in F√¢nt√¢nele commune, Romania). Kendi made his last will in the mid-1670s. As he had no descendants, his second wife's family largely inherited his wealth, while other estates were donated to Calvinist academies and schools, in accordance with his will. A considerable part of his possessions returned into the Principality's fiscal property.

In there discussions under the yew tree a club called The Rostrum was formed. Under this Yew tree with Sidney F Wicks' guidance the purpose and scope of the club, the Rostrum Promise and the roles of the club key figures in the club were set.The Story of The Rostrum, Malcolm Green, P1, October 1961 (paper) Sidney was the recognised founder. They set The Rostrum objects as: * The Rostrum is for those who desire to improve themselves in public speaking, and who hold freedom of speech, loyalty to truth, clarity of thought and a love of the English language are of the utmost value to the community. * The Rostrum aims to enrich the fellowship of its members; it holds to an educational ideal. The Rostrum allocated roles as follows: * Speaker of the Last Word (who should be a recognised teacher or exponent of the art of public speaking) - to give guidance and instruction in matters essential to the art, and to give constructive criticism at the close of each session. This officer is now called a Coach * Chief Guardian of Order - to interpret and guard the Constitution, to adjudicate on questions of law and order, to preside on special occasions or to appoint a Guardian of Order to preside on other occasions. This officer is now known as the Club President. * Scribe - to act as Secretary to the Speaker of the Last Word and to conduct correspondence with outside bodies. This officer is now known as the Club Secretary. * Recorder - to carry out all internal secretarial work, to keep the minutes of the Committee, to record the activities of the club, and to convene meetings. This officer is now known as the Secretary. The roles of Scribe and Recorder are now combined. * Purse Holder - to collect members‚Äô subscriptions, to be responsible for club moneys, and to pay such amounts as were authorised by the Committee. This officer is now known as the Club Treasurer. * Pathfinder - to arrange and lead all Rostrum outings and to organise social functions. * Committee of the Round Table - this was the name of the Committee, and members were known as ‚ÄòSpeakers of the Round Table‚Äô. These officers are now known as the Club Committee. * Pioneers of the Rostrum - All foundation members of The Rostrum, in 1923 Due to Sidney's declining health and move to Buxton, after 1929 he mainly just attended The Rostrum club meetings on one night per year, Founder's Night, and he joined in an annual walk to Greendale Farm and the Yew tree on the closest Saturday to 21 July each year. With Sidney's encouragement a visiting Australian engineer, Alan Crook, who was a club member between 1924 and 26, on his return to Australia he started a Rostrum club on 21 July 1930. The first meeting of this club was under an Angophora tree in Sydney at Middle Harbour with the same Objective as The Rostrum club. Numbers quickly grew through the Australian States and a national body called the Australian Rostrum Council was formed. There was ongoing association between the Australians and both The Rostrum club in Manchester and Sidney F Wicks. During the Second World War, Australian Rostrum Club members sent food parcels to England for the Wicks family and for The Rostrum club members. During the second World War, a Rostrum Club was formed in the Changi Prison, Prisoner of War camp. It was called A. G. H. Rostrum standing for Australian General Hospital and held its first meeting on 18 May 1943. The scant records of the club include agenda with topics such as \\"That tradition is a bar to progress\\", \\"Is an enduring peace possible?\\", \\"The importance of increased pleasure time\\", \\"Preservation of the Fauna of Australia\\" and \\"That women should participate in industry on an equal basis to me\\". The Minutes of the first meeting record that future meetings were to be held in the Men's, Sergeants' and Officers' Messes by rotation.Australian War Memorial, Private Record: 82, Series: 092, Folder Number 1 of 1. As part of a business trip, Alan Crook paid a return visit to Sidney F Wicks at Buxton and The Rostrum Club in Manchester in 1946. In 1952, when tape recording was still uncommon, Sidney recorded a message on a reel to reel tape recorder for the Australian Rostrum clubs. As The Rostrum Club grew, with time, it reached the upper limit of the club of 35 members. A second Rostrum Club, called Rostrum Number 2 Club, was opened in Manchester by Sidney F Wicks in 1953The Manchester Guardian, P10, 22 September 1953 Sidney's legacy is a Rostrum Club still operating in Manchester today called the Rochdale Rostrum Club and many Rostrum Clubs operating throughout Australia.  Later life and death  After the death of his wife Dorothy in September 1954, Sidney moved to Still Cottage, Alvescot, Oxfordshire where he planned to grow a beautiful rose garden. Within the year his health failed and he moved to the Portland Nursing Home, Buxton, where he died on 13 February 1956.

Dr. Carl Wilhelm Ludwig Muecke PhD., DTh., MA. (16 July 1815 ‚Äì 4 January 1898), occasionally written M√ºcke, especially in German language newspapers, was a German-born clergyman, plant pathologist and German-language newspaper editor in the colony of South Australia. History Muecke was born in M√∂ckern, near Magdeberg, and was originally destined for a career in mining, which he studied at Frieberg, but after experiencing an accident in the mines, his father sent him to the University of Bonn, where he took his degrees. He served for a time as an observer on the Luxembourg border during the 1831 war between Belgium and Holland. He began teaching chemistry, and became an activist for the cause of compulsory education in State schools. He was an excellent speaker, and much in demand at the Handwerkerverein (de), a workers' education society in Berlin. One of Muecke's brothers established a Liedertafel in association with the Verein, which after his death erected a monument to his memory. During the repressive Eichhorn ministry Muecke published some anti-authoritarian pamphlets, for which two of his fellows were punished. He moved to Berlin, where he had a hand in editing educational year- books. Following the Revolutions of 1848, Muecke left Germany for South Australia aboard Princess Louise, arriving in August 1849. Also on board were two of the Schomburgk brothers: Otto Alfred Carl Schomburgk and his wife Maria Charlotte Schomburgk (n√©e Von Selchow) and Richard Moritz Schomburgk, and Pauline Henriette Schomburgk (n√©e Kneib), who were married at sea. He was naturalized as a British subject in September 1849, one of the few times his name was written as M√ºcke. He first settled as a farmer near Gawler, but agriculture had no great attraction for him, and in 1859 he accepted an invitation to serve as pastor of the Lutheran Church at Tanunda, and shortly afterwards settled in that town. Over the next twenty years he also served several other Lutheran congregations: Lyndoch, Concordia (5 km ENE of Gawler), Schoenfeld (near Freeling) and King's Belt (near Sheaoak Log). At each of these pastorates he was closely associated with the church school and intellectual life of these towns. He was at the forefront of agitation for equal voting rights for naturalized Germans, and gave popular and stimulating lectures on scientific subjects. He was of great assistance to Sir Robert Torrens in promoting the Real Property Act which, thanks to Dr. Ulrich H√ºbbe, was largely based on the system used in the Hanse towns, and helped organise a festival at Tanunda in honour of Sir Robert after the Act was passed. For years he took a very practical interest in \\"takeall\\" and \\"red rust\\", significant diseases of wheat, studying the soil and roots under a microscope, and discovered parasites that could have been responsible. His MA. degree was conferred by the University of Adelaide. Journalism In late 1849 Muecke, together with Otto Schomburgk and Gustav Dr√∂geGustav Droege arrived in SA in December 1847 aboard Hermann von Beckerath, and was still in South Australia 1861, and in New South Wales in 1866 as \\"Thomas Myers\\". founded the Suedaustralische Zeitung, a German-language weekly newspaper, using Roman type (and replacing umlauted letters with their two-letter equivalent), perhaps as a rejection of tradition, or that being the only typeface available. The following year it was printed in traditional black letter type as S√ºdaustralische Zeitung. An English translation of this article could be helpful in resolving some of the loose ends in this history. Throughout the history of the paper Muecke had a considerable attachment in its various phases: :S√ºdaustralische Zeitung absorbed an (unnamed) Tanunda paper in early 1851. :The paper was for a time printed in Adelaide by the South Australian Register, and for several years was not published at all due to the Victorian gold rush. It was re-established in the mid-to-late 1850s by different owners, but better information is hard to find. :The S√ºdaustralische Zeitung was in 1859 sold to Rudolf Reimer ( ‚Äì 7 April 1860), who founded Adelaider Deutsche Zeitung in April 1851, but continued publication in Tanunda as a separate title. :The S√ºd Australische Zeitung was in late 1862 sold to Basedow, Barton, and Eimer, trading as George Eimer & Co. Contrary to promises and expectations, they immediately moved production from Tanunda to Adelaide. The partnership was dissolved on 31 January 1863 and Eimer became sole owner. :Frederick Basedow (Muecke's son-in-law) and C. H. Barton retaliated in 1863 with a new Tanunda publication, the Tanunda Deutsche Zeitung, edited by Muecke until 1869, when he left Tanunda for the neighbouring colony of Victoria, according to one report to set up a branch office which failed to thrive, and returned to Tanunda the following year. Barton was later to become bankrupt and in 1867 fled to Maryborough, Queensland, owing substantial sums to his Tanunda backers. :In January 1870 Eimer & Co. founded the Australische Zeitung, and S√ºd Australische Zeitung continued to be published until December 1874, when it was absorbed into Australische Zeitung. Wilhelm Eggers (c. 1815‚Äì1882), from roughly 1855‚Äì1865 owner-editor of the Adelaider Deutschen Zeitung, was part-owner and editor from at least 1871 to 1875. Around 1876, now living in Adelaide, Muecke was appointed chief editor. Later years For many years he resided at Semaphore, then around 1890, thinking the mountain air would be more beneficial to his health, he retired to Hahndorf. On his eightieth birthday a great celebration was held at the German Club in his honour.

No Bra Day was initially observed on July 9, 2011, but within three years it had moved to the 13th day of the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, October. Users on social media are encouraged to post using the hashtag #nobraday to promote awareness of breast cancer symptoms and to encourage gender equality. Some users on social media sites also encourage women to post pictures of themselves not wearing a bra. Some women embrace No Bra Day as a political statement while others prefer the comfort of discarding what they view as a restrictive, uncomfortable garment. The observance has spread worldwide. The event was spun off a medical event in Toronto, Canada, that encourages breast cancer survivors to consider reconstructive surgery. First held on October 19, 2011, the medical event was named BRA (Breast Reconstruction Awareness) Day. It was adapted by an anonymous individual who conceived of No Bra Day as a way to encourage women to enjoy being braless and to become knowledgeable about breast cancer symptoms. The day is controversial as some see it as sexualizing and exploiting women's bodies while at the same time belittling a serious disease.  Origins   Event origins  A braless woman in a restaurant. The original event known as \\"BRA Day\\" was started by Toronto plastic surgeon Dr. Mitchell Brown. The first BRA Day event, titled \\"Breast Reconstruction ‚Äì An Evening of Learning and Sharing\\", was held in Toronto, Canada at Women's College Hospital and Toronto General Hospital on October 19, 2011. Brown found that many Canadian women who underwent a mastectomy due to breast cancer resisted undergoing reconstructive surgery. He founded \\"Breast Reconstruction Awareness\\" (BRA) Day to increase women's awareness of the availability of reconstructive breast surgery. BRA day is intended to raise awareness of breast cancer screening, alert women to breast cancer symptoms, and to encourage women to conduct regular self examinations. The event was adopted in the U.S. in 2012. , the BRA Day event devoted to educating women about reconstructive surgery, and hosted by the Canadian Cancer Society, continued to be held across Canada. BRA day is observed on different dates in different provinces of Canada during the month of October. The origin of No Bra Day can be traced back to the first BRA Day held in Toronto, in 2011. In July that year, an anonymous individual using the name Anastasia Doughnuts conceived of No Bra Day and published the first website promoting the event.  Cultural genesis  Women have protested the physical and cultural restrictions imposed by bras over many years. In 1966, during the height of the hippie era in San Francisco, two women students at San Francisco State College protested a proposed law that would require women to wear bras by walking topless near the campus. On August 1, 1969, an Anti-Bra Day was declared in San Francisco to protest societal pressure to wear constrictive, feminine garments. The protest drew large crowds, blocking traffic, and a few women took their bras off from under their clothing in the Financial District. In 1968, feminists organized a protest at the Miss America Contest and tossed a number of feminine products in a garbage can. A newspaper headline erroneously stated that the women had burned their bras. That protest has been interpreted as a rejection of society's perception of women's bodies and dress requirements. During the 1970s women wore what they wanted without regard for political correctness. During the last two decades of the 20th century, bras expressed both professionalism and, due to the attention given a pink satin conical bra worn by Madonna, sexual freedom.  No Bra Day   Beginnings in social media  The first No Bra Day event was created by an anonymous internet user self-named \\"Anastasia Doughnuts\\" for July 9, 2011 and was observed on that date through 2013. In 2013 and 2014, social media posts announced both July 9 and October 13 as No Bra Day. Since 2015, the event has only been promoted on October 13. The event was initially described, in part, as: The announcement was later reposted on a Facebook group named \\"No Bra, No Problem\\" which grew to over 1,200 members.Why You Don't Have to Wear a Bra The group was started by teenager Brooke Lanie of Montana. She was responding to her Helena, Montana high school principal's treatment of her friend Kaitlyn Juvik, who was summoned to the office because her bralessness had \\"disturbed\\" a male teacher.Montana Teen Stages Protest After School Demands She Wear Bra: 'I Was Told a Male Teacher Had Complained He Was Uncomfortable' October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and by 2014 the official day of the event was moved to October 13, during which women are urged to forgo wearing a bra. An increasing number of women, especially millennials, have expressed opposition to and are giving up wearing bras.  Participation  A braless woman in a white tank top. In 2012, about 400,000 individuals took part in No Bra Day, 250,000 of those on Facebook. As of 2017 the day was observed by women in 30 countries, including New Zealand, Romania, Malaysia, Scotland, India, and Ghana. Women are urged after taking off their bra to give themselves a breast exam. On social media, women are encouraged to go braless and to post photos using the hashtag #nobraday. More than 82,000 women posted pictures on Twitter and Instagram in 2017. Women who choose not to go braless and men are encouraged to wear something purple on that day. Some sites suggest that participants donate to breast cancer charities. A Romanian photographer capitalized on the idea and published an album of photos depicting braless women.  Impact on fashion  Many celebrities world-wide have been seen braless in public for a number of years. A increasing number of women are going braless. Fewer women are buying push-up style bras. Some are choosing unstructured, wireless soft cup bralettes, and some choose to go bra free altogether. Victoria's Secret's parent company L Brands Inc. derives about one-third of its earnings from bras, and in 2016, its revenues were down nearly 30%. Capitalizing on the trend, companies had begun offering clothing designed to advertise that the wearer is not wearing a bra, or fashions designed to take advantage of the no bra look. Some women choose to go braless to wear fashions that would otherwise expose straps and to create a streamlined silhouette.  No official sponsorship  The unofficial No Bra Day is not recognized by any cancer research organization and is not a formal part of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Some critics have described the event as being \\"purely sexual\\". The event does not directly raise money for cancer research or prevention, although individuals are in some cases encouraged to support such causes.  Feminist connection  Some participants connect not wearing a bra to feminist protests like those at the 1968 Miss America protest. There, protesters symbolically threw a number of feminine products including bras into a \\"Freedom Trash Can\\". They described the items as \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. The protest gained notoriety when a local news story in the Atlantic City Press erroneously reported that \\"the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women's magazines\\" were burned. Some feminist activists believe that anti-feminists used the protesters' suggestion of going braless to trivialize what the women were trying to accomplish and to minimize the importance of the feminist movement in general. Some feminists who support the idea of using No Bra Day to raise awareness of breast cancer are concerned with the sexualization of the #nobraday hashtag in social media. In the Philippines, the observance is seen as a day to advance the cause of gender equality. One journalist supported No Bra Day, saying that it \\"asserts femininity and our appreciation of who we are as a woman... The bra symbolizes how women are being held in bondage\\". The observance and its connections to gender equality has drawn comparisons with the Go Topless women's rights movement and Go Topless Day, a protest in which women assert their legal right to go both braless and shirtless.  Criticism  Going braless during the current decade has according to some been politicized by No Bra Day, and the association between going braless and breast cancer screening has drawn criticism.Keep your bras on, ladies. That selfie won't stop cancer Scotland Herald Retrieved October 8, 2017  Sexualization vs. disease  The tabloid website TMZ posted an item about \\"Happy No Bra Day\\" with an image of Selena Gomez wearing a see-through top. Another site featured a photo gallery titled \\"#NoBraDay: 15 Celebs Who Frolick About With Their Fun Bags Freed\\". One of the issues with the concept is that breast cancer survivors who use prosthetics must wear a bra to conceal their disfigurement or wear prosthetics and inserts in their bra to make them appear \\"normal\\". Some critics have described the event as sexualizing and exploiting women‚Äôs bodies while at the same time belittling a serious disease. Jean Sachs, CEO of Living Beyond Breast Cancer, thinks No Bra Day is offensive. \\"I mean breast cancer is a life-threatening illness. It has nothing to do with wearing a bra or not wearing a bra.\\" Gayle Sulik, founder and executive director of the Breast Cancer Consortium, said, \\"But we don't really pay attention to what's going on with breast cancer. That's a hugely damaging impact of this sort of message\\". In New Zealand, the New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation attempted to repeat the success of a Scottish television breast cancer awareness campaign that educated women about the appearance of their breasts. It featured comedienne Elaine C. Smith showing pictures of typical breasts displaying cancer symptoms. But New Zealand's Commercial Approval Bureau would have likely given the ad showing breasts and nipples for medical purposes an Adults Only classification, requiring it to be broadcast after 8:30 pm. The Breast Cancer Foundation opted to place objects strategically in front of the nipples instead.  Personal decision  One writer criticized the Facebook site's message \\"P.S. Ladies‚Ä¶. Wearing a white t-shirt on this day is not only acceptable, but encouraged!\\" as objectifying women's bodies. Some women resist the attempt to politicize their decision to not wear a bra or fetishize their breasts for a cause. One woman commented, \\"The reason is that I tried being braless, and I liked it better. It wasn't a political decision, except insofar as everything a woman does with her body that isn't letting someone else dictate what she ought to do with it is a political decision\\".

It premiered on 7 November 2017. The series is a restructuring of Pehredaar Piya Ki, which received negative social media response for depicting its two central characters, Diya, an 18-year-old princess and Ratan, a 9-year-old prince, as married. The Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) asked SET India to move the series to a later 10pm time slot and the network complied. After a drop in viewership resulting from the move, series producers opted to restructure the series for prime time, in part by removing the child marriage theme by advancing Ratan's age to adulthood and recasting the character. Summary It follows the life of a 30-year-old girl Diya, who sacrificed 12 years of her life by fulfilling a dying man's wish on his deathbed by becoming the caretaker of his heir and son, Ratan Maan Singh. She shares no relationship with Ratan or his family and there is no greed which drives her to do this. Set against the royal canvas of Rajasthan, the show challenges the conventional perception of men being the protector of women. Ratan is constantly being targeted by attackers, and it is up to Diya to find the person behind the attacks who might as well be part of the family. Story The show revolves around a Rajput Shatrani, Diya Sajjan Singh, who gave up 12 years of her life to protect the heir to the Rajput throne, Ratan Maan Singh. Ratan is 21 and lives in London after his parents, Harshwardan and Padma, were killed in an accident. He returns to Surajgarh to become the king. Several attempts to kill Ratan occur shortly after his arrival. Diya suspects it to be someone from the family. Padma's sister, Sushma (Choti Thakuranisa) is married to Bhuvan Singh (Chote Thakursa) and has two children Sakshi and Raghu. Sakshi is married to Mohak and Raghu to Priya who has borne him a son, Yash. Bhuvan has a sister, Nithya, whose son, Ayush, is married to Diya's sister, Isha. Ratan and Diya devise a plot that could bring out the attacker by faking their love towards each other. Diya meets with a serious accident. While in the hospital, Priya tries to harm Diya, and the culprit is found. It turns out that Priya, Raghu, and Sushma were working together in trying to assassinate Ratan. Priya is imprisoned and Raghu is killed; Sushma realizes her mistake and begs forgiveness. Since Diya's duties are over, she decides to marry her fianc√©, Abhay Rathore Singh. But Abhay's sister, Arpita, makes Abhay realize his twelve-year wait for Diya and they leave her stranded at the wedding mandap. Ratan then finds out that his late father wanted him to marry Diya, so he reluctantly marries her. Ratan finds it hard to fulfill his responsibilities to Diya, also due to the nine-year age gap between them. More problems arise when Yash marries Mohana, Arpita's daughter. Ratan decides to divorce Diya, only after helping her win a case against Abhay and Arpita. Diya then realizes her love for Ratan. Another problem arises when a man claims that he is the real Ratan Maan Singh and tries to influence the entire family against Ratan. His truth is revealed, as he tries to assassinate the entire family. Ratan then realizes his love for Diya, and they work together with their family to eliminate the terrorist. The show ends revealing that Diya is pregnant with Ratan's child and Mohana is pregnant with Yash's child.

The game is inspired by the game mechanics of Fallout Shelter, XCOM, and also the movie Das Boot. Like other submarine simulation games such as the Silent Hunter series, the player is put in command of a German U-boat during World War II.  Development  Initially, development of the game started with a Kickstarter campaign to provide funding for the project. The original goal of the project was to raise CA$20,000 to fund the project but the campaign managed to raise CA$38,000 from 1,511 backers. The team developing the game are reportedly \\"a mix of young open- minded people and old hands at game development\\". Significant amounts of the game have already been completed and according to the most recent developer diary the game is \\"getting more and more full of shape\\". Originally release was planned for 2017. but it has been delayed and is now expected in the first quarter of 2019. A beta was released to Kickstarter backers on October 14, 2018 and has been updated frequently since then.  Overview  UBOAT gives players command of a Type VII submarine during World War II. The player is not in charge of the submarine itself but in fact \\"in charge of the men controlling the submarine\\" as a U-Boat captain. The player has to manage the morale, discipline and trauma of the crew and make sure all the crew come back alive at the end of a mission. The crew are also made up of individuals who each have their own individual stories and personalities. According to Rock, Paper, Shotgun, \\"Everything has been created down to the tiniest of details to make sure WWII buffs get what they want, and realistic and modern graphics are promised as well.\\" The developers have also developed precise and historically accurate interior of the ship to further enhance gameplay and give the player the ability to take control of certain tasks on the ship themselves such as firing torpedoes, using radios and piloting the submarine.  Release  UBOAT released on the 30 April 2019 in Early access to the public, some Kickstarter contributors who had received the game earlier during beta and alpha testing were released from non-disclosure agreements and allowed to post videos and media of the game.  Reception  Reception for the game is currently generally positive. Polygon writer, Charlie Hall, wrote that \\"there‚Äôs a brilliant experience lurking in its depths\\". He praised the effort the developers had gone to making an authentic experience, but stated concerns about how early access the release was and that the game lacked game-play due to large amounts of bugs.

As of 2017, he is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Jewish thought at Ben Gurion University of the Negev.  Biography  Born on April 5, 1949 in Flint, Michigan, United States, to Arnold and Miriam Lasker, he grew up in Orange, New Jersey, where his father served as a congregational Rabbi. As a teenager he was active in USY and served as chapter head and on the regional board. He received his B.A., M.A. and PhD from Brandeis University, all in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies, he also was a visiting research student at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His dissertation was advised by Alexander Altmann and is titled \\"Jewish Philosophical Polemics Against Christianity in the Middle Ages\\". He married Debbie (Debora) Dworkin in 1973. They have five children. In 1978 he made Aliyah to Beer Sheva, Israel, where he still lives.  Work  Lasker served as a faculty member in the Goldstein-Goren Department of Jewish Thought at Ben Gurion University of the Negev (1978‚Äì2017) and as of 2017 is a professor emeritus. He served as department chair and was the incumbent of the Norbert Blechner Chair of Jewish Values. His main field of research and teaching is Medieval Jewish philosophy. He has taught as well at Yale University, Princeton University, Ohio State University, University of Toronto, Yeshiva University, University of Texas at Austin, University of Washington, Boston College, Queens College, Ahva College, Kirkland College, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and Gratz College. He also served as the vice president of the Society for Judaeo-Arabic Studies which is housed at the Ben Zvi institute,I-CORE Jerusalem.  Research  His areas of interest are medieval Jewish philosophy (including the thought of Judah Halevi, Maimonides, and Hasdai Crescas), the Jewish-Christian debate, Karaite Judaism , and other issues in Jewish theology and law. His first book, Jewish Philosophical Polemics Against Christianity (1977; second edition, 2007), details the use of philosophy in the medieval Jewish critique of Christianity. His most recent book, co-authored with Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis and David Sklare, is Theological Encounters at a Crossroads: A Preliminary Edition of Judah Hadassi‚Äôs Eshkol ha-kofer, First Commandment, and Studies of the Book‚Äôs Judaeo-Arabic and Byzantine Contexts (2019). This book serves as a partial edition and translation of a twelfth-century Karaite book of commandments and theology. His other books are an edition and translation of Hasdai Crescas‚Äô Refutation of the Christian Principles (1990, 1992); (with Sarah Stroumsa), The Book of Nestor the Priest (1996), which presents the texts and translations of the earliest extant Jewish anti-Christian polemic, written in Judaeo-Arabic and then translated into Hebrew; From Judah Hadassi to Elijah Bashyatchi: Studies in Late Medieval Karaite Philosophy (2008), which describes developments in Karaite philosophy from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries in the Byzantine Empire He has also co-edited a jubilee volume and three conference proceedings and authored over 250 other publications.  Contributions to Research  Lasker‚Äôs publications in the field of Jewish- Christian polemics have emphasized the extent to which the critique of Christianity is an integral part of Jewish theological self-definition. Thus, in those Jewish communities in which Jews engaged in rational speculation - the Islamic east, Iberia, Southern France, and Italy - arguments against Christianity were a regular part of their discussions. Among the important thinker-polemicists from these areas were Saadia Gaon, Moses Nahmanides, Hasdai Crescas, Joseph Albo, and Isaac Abravanel. In contrast, northern European Jewish communities, which generally eschewed rationalism, rarely wrote specifically anti-Christian treatises. Only under extreme stress did Jews in northern Europe write specifically polemical compositions, and their works were concentrated on exegesis and not theology. Lasker‚Äôs conclusion is that, in contrast to the accepted historiographical narrative, Jewish anti- Christian polemical activity is not necessarily a response to Christian missionary pressure; the medieval Jewish critique of Christianity is much more complex than that. In addition, a full understanding of medieval Jewish philosophy requires attention to the interreligious polemical motives behind the philosophical discussions. Lasker‚Äôs studies of Karaism and Karaite philosophy have demonstrated the close connection between Karaite and Rabbanite Jewish thought. By publishing articles which survey Karaite intellectual achievements from the tenth to nineteenth centuries, he has shown that Karaite thought has been as dynamic as Rabbanite thought. Starting at the end of the thirteenth century, Karaite authors were greatly influenced by Maimonides and incorporated many of his theological insights into their work. Thus, Lasker has challenged the view that Karaites remained loyal to the Kalam theology of the earliest Karaite thinkers such that Karaism and Karaite thought are unchanging and static. The interplay between Rabbanite and Karaite thought continued into the nineteenth century in eastern Europe before the Karaite communities there until the twentieth century when these communities began to deny their connection to Judaism .

PostmarketOS was launched on May 6, 2017 with the source code available on GitLab. It is capable of running different X and Wayland based user interfaces, such as Plasma Mobile, MATE, GNOME 3, and XFCE,; later updates added support for Unity8 and Phosh. The project aims to provide a ten-year lifecycle for smartphones.  Architecture  Unlike many other projects porting conventional Linux distributions to Android phones, PostmarketOS does not use the Android build system or userspace. Each phone has only one unique package, and flashable installation images are generated using the \`pmbootstrap\` tool. The project intends to support the mainline Linux kernel on all phones in the future, instead of the often outdated Android-specific fork, to reduce the potential for security exploits. A few devices can boot into the mainline kernel already. The project aims to support Android apps through the use of Anbox. Alpine Linux was chosen as the base distribution due to its low storage requirements, making it more suitable for older devices. Excluding the kernel, a base installation takes up approximately 6 MB.  State of development   Features  the project was under development; and no devices were yet able to make phone calls with PostmarketOS, although significant efforts were being made in this regard. Different tools have been published by the project, including: * \`pmbootstrap\`, a utility to help the process of development with cross compilation; * \`osk-sdl\`, a virtual keyboard to allow decryption of a password during startup (on a device with full disk encryption); * \`charging-sdl\`, an application contained in the initramfs to display an animation when the phone is charging while off.  Device support  As of May 2020, over two hundred devices are able to boot the operating system, including 92 with WiFi support. This includes many smartphones and tablets that originally ran Android, wearable devices such as Google Glass, smartwatches including the LG G Watch and some Linux-based Nokia smartphones, such as the N900 and N9. After Corellium ported Linux to the iPhone, pmOS also gained support. = Porting to a new device = The development process to make a new device compatible with the operating system consists of creating a phone-specific package using the \`pmbootstrap\` tool. For that, the use of the Linux kernel from the device's original manufacturer is often necessary. The source code of the original kernel is often made available by compliance with the requirements of the GPLv2 license, but some drivers necessary for the operation of the device may not be available, and must, therefore, be recreated. Examples include GPU drivers such as Lima, which has a proprietary equivalent in userspace on Android that is not subject to the GPLv2 requirements.

History Medieval Cork City was separated in two by channels of the River Lee, with the northern part of the main street being the North Main Street and the southern island containing the South Main Street, both of which were connected by a bridge built in 1190. It is not believed that North Main Street was extensively inhabited until the 13th century, following the walling of the northern island in sandstone, after which it became the main street of medieval Cork. At this time, the population of the walled city consisted primarily of Anglo-Norman merchant families. Property on North Main Street was divided into strips running perpendicular to the street, known as burgage plots. 16th century map of Cork, which includes St Peter's Church and Skiddy's Castle on North Main Street A number of archaeological excavations of the area have revealed the remains of houses which were Anglo-Norman in style, made mainly of timber and wattle. The building of houses from timber posed a fire risk, and declined after May 1622, when a lightning strike on North Main Street resulted in a loss of 1500 houses in the city. Other 20th century excavations focused on Skiddy's Castle, a 15th century tower house which became a gunpowder magazine for a period, prior to its demolition in the late 18th century. At the top of the North Main street in medieval Cork was the North Gate Bridge and adjacent North Gate Castle, which later saw use as a jail. The street was also the principal street of the parish of St. Peter's, the parish church now in use as the Cork Vision Centre. In the 1820s, St Patrick's Street began to overtake North Main Street as the primary business street of the city. Slum clearances were conducted around North Main Street in the 1850s and late 1870s, the former \\"cosmetic rather than socially ameliorative,\\" the latter as part of a rehousing initiative. A number of businesses on North Main Street were destroyed by fire during the Burning of Cork in December 1920. Later development North Main street has undergone some redevelopment in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the construction of a cinema, apartment blocks and a shopping centre. A heritage conservation project was carried out on the street in the mid-1990s. The street was also included in the \\"Painting and Facade Scheme\\" in 2016, which received grant aid from Cork City Council to give incentive to building owners in some parts of the city centre to paint their buildings. A number of groups, including the 'North Main Street Traders‚Äô Association', have advocated further initiatives to 'rejuvenate' the street - following 'a decline' in commercial activity in the early 21st century.

Architectural coatings Keefe joined Dow in 2001, and is now an R&D; manager, specializing in the development of architectural coatings. These include the Evoque pre-composite polymer platform. The Evoque polymer encapsulates titanium dioxide to more evenly distribute within coatings. This improves the hiding efficiency of the coating (its ability to cover the color of the base material to which the coating is applied). Less , often the most expensive and energy-intensive component of a coating, is required. Evoque received the 2013 Greener Reaction Conditions Award in the EPA's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge for industrial contributions to green science. The Dow Coatings Team, including Keefe, received the 2017 \\"Heroes of Chemistry\\" Award from the American Chemical Society for the development of Evoque.

In 2008 Keefe began a partnership with Dow, the Tate and the Getty Conservation Institute to work on the development of specialized solvents for use by art conservators. Keefe helped to develop wet cleaning systems for the identification of possible cleaning liquids capable of removing surface dirt without damaging multiple paint layers. Dow provided high-throughput (HTP) analytical devices for the rapid screening of potential cleaning solutions, varying the percentage of each additive and monitoring factors such as paint gloss, color, flexibility, migrated surfactant removal and residue detection.

It is a novel about the coming together of Indian and Western painting traditions, against the background of the dramatic war of 1799, when the British defeated Tipu Sultan, and finally established unchallenged supremacy in the Indian sub-continent. The Wire described The Untitled as an imaginative break from the themes that have animated historical fiction in India for over a century now, namely \\"the temptation to be intimate with the monumental.\\" The Huffington Post review called the prose \\"supple and sublime\\" and termed the novel as \\"an allegory of how art and politics cannot remain insulated from one another.\\" The Times Lit Fest in December, 2016 had a session devoted to the novel. The Untitled has also been featured in The Times of India, The Hindu, The Telegraph, The Tribune, Sakal Times, and the Deccan Herald. The whimsical and inventive novel Birdswim Fishfly (published in 2006) was an exploration of adolescence, family secrets, and the quickening of the artistic temperament. Prabhu's first novel, Maya, published in 2003, was set in the Konkan region and drew from local and family lore as they emerged in the consciousness of a young, questioning girl. The novel was described by the Deccan Herald as ‚Äúa grippingly haunting tale.‚Äù Memoir Prabhu's lyrical memoir If I Had to Tell It Again, published by HarperCollins, was released in November 2017.

Numerous reviews and responses emerged in the aftermath of the memoir's publication. If I Had to Tell It Again received several positive reviews in the months following its publication. Writer, editor, and columnist, Krupa Ge writes in First Post: ‚ÄúGayathri‚Äôs sparkling prose is light, as it meanders artfully conveying memories heavy, laden with emotions‚Äù.

A reflective piece about the reception of the memoir was written by Prabhu and published in The Economic and Political Weekly in Sep 2018, about the challenges of the memoir genre in India, the experience of disclosing sexual abuse in/ to the family, and the author's take on why a public telling matters.

He trained as a mining engineer. When his father died in 1888 he inherited the presidency of the Bethune mining company and also replaced his father as deputy for the Nord department. He remained head of the Bethune mining company and a member of the legislature or senate for most of the remainder of his life. He advocated protectionist policies throughout his career. Early years (1863‚Äì88) Jean Ignace Alexis Winoc Plichon was born on 14 June 1863 in Bailleul, Nord. He came from a well-established bourgeois family of French Westhoek. He was the son of Charles Ignace Plichon (1814‚Äì88) and Marie Constance Boitelle (1840‚Äì94), and brother of Pierre Plichon (1865‚Äì1936). His mother was the daughter of Alexis Boitelle, one of the main founders of the coal industry in the Nord department. His father was seen as the representative of the four interrelated landholding dynasties in the region collectively known as \\"la grande famille.\\" His father was Deputy for Nord from 1857 to 1870, Minister of Public Works in 1870 and Deputy for Nord from 1871 until his death in 1888, and was a supporter of Albert, 4th duc de Broglie. After completing his secondary education Jean Plichon attended the √âcole centrale des arts et manufactures of Paris, graduating in 1886 in 3rd place. He then became an engineer at the Compagnie des mines de B√©thune. Prewar deputy and industrialist (1888‚Äì1914) After the death of his father in 1888, Plichon replaced him as a member of the General Council of the Nord department, representing Bailleul. In the 22 September 1889 legislative elections he was elected in the first round for the 2nd constituency of Hazebrouck, Nord as a monarchist candidate. During the election he said, \\"Christian, I am the defender of religious principles, without which there can be no barrier to the progress of the Revolution. Catholic, I will find myself constantly struggling with those followers of Gambetta who scream, 'Clericalism, behold the enemy!'.\\" Plichon sat on the right, but soon joined the Republicans. On 31 March 1891 in Wavrechain-sous-Denain Jean Plichon married Jeanne Leduc (1870‚Äì1940). Their children were Genevi√®ve (1893‚Äì1989), Marguerite, Adeline and Christiane (1900‚Äì80). His wife's sister Marthe was the wife of Paul Dussaussoy (1860‚Äì1909), right-wing deputy of the Pas-de-Calais and the son, grandson and great-grandson of a deputy. Two of Plichon's children married into the Thiriez family, well-known textile manufacturers of the Nord. Plichon succeeded his father as an administrator of the Compagnie des mines de B√©thune. He became one of the leading industrialists of northern France, president of the B√©thune, Blanzy and Sainte-Th√©r√®se mining companies. He sat on the boards of industrial and banking concerns such as Mines de Kali Sainte-Th√©r√®se, Forges de Denain-Anzin, Cr√©dit Industriel et Commercial, Banque Scalbert and Compagnie √©lectrique du Nord-Ouest. This gave him considerable authority in the chamber on questions of economic and financial affairs. Plichon was reelected Deputy for Nord on 20 August 1893, 8 May 1898, 27 April 1902, 6 May 1906, 24 April 1910, 26 April 1914 and 16 November 1919. Throughout his parliamentary career he was a protectionist. He played an important role in the M√©line commission in 1892, which implemented protective duties for wheat producers. In 1900 √âmile Deshayes de Marc√®re was President of the Mines de B√©thune, while Jean Plichon was secretary of the management council. Later the presidency returned to Jean Plichon, who also dominated the mines of Blanzy and Kali Sainte-Th√©r√®se. In the early 20th century Plichon succeeded L√©on Renard (1836‚Äì1916) as vice-president of the Comit√© Central des Houill√®res de France (Central Committee of French Coal Mine Owners). World War I (1914‚Äì18) In 1914, despite being 51 years old Plichon joined the army. He was awarded the Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre, and reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel. His house at Bailleul was destroyed in the war, and from 1918 he lived at Oxelaere. Postwar career (1918‚Äì36) Plichon gave up his seat in the chamber and was elected Senator for Nord from 11 January 1920 to 5 January 1924. In the senate he often intervened in favor of support for his region of France, which had been devastated by the war. In 1922 his report on the world economic situation advocated protection of French production from foreign competition. In 1924 Jean Plichon was still president of the Compagnie des mines de B√©thune and Louis Mercier was still director- general. In 1924 Plichon resigned as senator in order to run again for election as a Deputy for Nord. Plichon was among the Catholic industrialists who were well-represented in the Republican Federation (F√©d√©ration r√©publicaine), others being Fran√ßois de Wendel, Guy de Wendel and Pierre Amidieu du Clos. Plichon was elected deputy for Nord on 11 May 1924, 22 April 1928 and 8 May 1932, leaving office on 31 May 1936. Jean Plichon died on 22 September 1936 in Oxela√´re, Nord. For industries like metallurgy and coal mining, only a limited company can manage the huge amounts of capital investment required. However, the Bethune mines had become a fief of the Plichons, since Jean was succeeded by his brother Pierre and nephew Jean- Pierre Plichon. Men such as the Plichons, although they did not belong to the rich industrial bourgeoisie, were able to build great fortunes due to their political and technical skills. Publications Plichon published numerous speeches, proposals for laws and parliamentary reports.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Judah Holcomb House stands northwest of the village center of Granby, on the west side of North Granby Road north of Kearns Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance. The entrance surround is particularly fine, with fluted pilasters rising to an architrave and dentillated cornice. Sash windows are surrounded by simple trim, with those on the second floor butting against the plain box cornice. The interior of the house follows a typical central chimney plan, including a winding staircase in the front vestibule, parlor spaces to either side of the chimney, and the kitchen behind it. The downstairs rooms are notable for being entire sheathed in vertical board paneling that is unusually wide, typically in width, a quantity not seen in other period houses in the state. Other chambers in the house also exhibit some amount of similar wainscoting. The house was built about 1776 by Judah Holcomb, when the area was still part of Simsbury. Holcomb's grandfather was an early settler of the area, and he was politically active, serving as a justice of the peace and in the state legislature. The house remained in the Holcomb family until 1894. It is notable for its entry surround, which is rare within the state as a vernacular flat-top surround, contrasting with more widely found broken-scroll pediments.

As a two-year-old in 2009 he was beaten in his first two races but after winning a maiden race at his third attempt he went on to record major victories in the Railway Stakes and the Phoenix Stakes. He was beaten in three subsequent races that year and failed to recover his form in two starts as a three-year-old. After his retirement from racing he stood a breeding stallion in Ireland and Australia. Background Alfred Nobel is a bay horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by Lodge Park Stud. As a yearling in October 2008 he was consigned to the Tattersalls sale where he was bought for 220,000 guineas by John Magnier of the Coolmore Stud. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses the details of the colt's ownership changed from race to race: he sometimes raced in the colours of Derrick Smith or Michael Tabor, while on others he was described as the property of a partnership between Tabor, Smith and Susan Magnier. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Johnny Murtagh. He was sired by Danehill Dancer, who won the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes and Greenham Stakes before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Choisir, Mastercraftsman, Legatissimo, Lillie Langtry and Dancing Rain. Alfred Nobel's dam Glinting Desert showed little racing ability, winning one minor race from eight starts. However, as a granddaughter of the outstanding racemare Park Express she was closely related to many major winners including New Approach and Was. Racing career 2009: two-year- old season Alfred Nobel began his racing career in a maiden race over five furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 18 April when he started at odds of 7/2 and finished second of the eight runners, beaten half a length by Pilgrim Dancer. On 4 May he started favourite or a similar event over six furlongs at the Curragh but finished third of the twelve runners after briefly being denied a clear run in the last quarter mile. Later that month he was stepped up to seven furlongs for a maiden at Leopardstown Racecourse and recorded his first success. Starting at odds of 4/5 he tracked the leaders before going to the front approaching the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Sparking Power. On 28 June the colt was moved up in class for the Group 2 Railway Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh and started 6/4 favourite ahead of five opponents including the Rochestown Stakes winner Love Lockdown and the Fillies' Sprint Stakes runner-up Kitty Kiernan. After racing in fourth place Alfred Nobel took the lead a furlong and a half out and stayed on to win by one and a quarter lengths and a head from the outsiders Dragon Fighter and King Ledley. After the race Aidan O'Brien said \\"He progressed from his first run to his second, his second run to his third, and now he's come forward again. He was green when he hit the front, and leaned away from the ground, and you'd hope he'd get a mile in time\\". The Group 1 Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh on 26 July saw Alfred Nobel narrowly preferred in the betting to the Tommy Stack-trained filly Walk On Bye who had won the Anglesey Stakes on her last start. Dragon Fighter and King Ledley were again in opposition with the best-fancied of the other four runners was Beethoven. After being restrained toward the rear by Murtagh he moved up into second behind his unfancied stablemate Air Chief Marshal inside the final furlong. He gained the advantage in the final strides and won by half a length with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Walk On Bye in third. O'Brien commented \\"The last day he won very snug but Johnny said he just got there too early on him, so today he was going to wait and wait. The worry was whether he could change gears on that heavy ground but obviously he's a very good horse\\". Bookmakers responded by offering odds of between 6/1 and 8/1 against the colt for the following year's 2000 Guineas. With Murtagh required to ride Changingoftheguard in the St Leger on 12 September, Seamie Heffernan took the ride when Alfred Nobel started favourite for the National Stakes at the Curragh on the same day. After racing towards the rear of the field he made some progress in the last quarter mile but never looked likely to win and finished last of the six runners behind the Kevin Prendergast-trained Kingsfort. On 2 October he was sent to England for the Tattersalls Timeform Million, a valuable race restricted to juveniles sold at auction at Tattersalls, and finished fifth of the 22 runners. He appeared somewhat unlucky as he raced up the stands side (the left-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) whilst the first four finishers all raced up the far side. Alfred Nobel ended his season with a trip to California for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile on the synthetic Cushion Track at Santa Anita Park in which he finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Vale of York. 2010: three- year-old season Alfred Nobel made his first appearance of 2010 in the Listed Loughbrown Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 11 April in which he started 3/1 second favourite but came home seventh of the eight runners. He produced a better effort in the Greenlands Stakes over six furlongs at the same track on 22 May as he finished third to the British gelding Markab. Stud record After his retirement from racing Alfred Nobel stood as a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud in Ireland and was also shuttled to stand in Australia for the southern hemisphere breeding season. In March 2015 he was bought outright by Lynward Park Stud, who had previously owned a 50% share in the stallion and moved to Western Australia. The best of his offspring has probably been Snowy Chloe who won the WATC Sires Produce in 2015.

The book delves into questions pertaining to existence, human existence, consciousness, reality and perception. It was published on February 7, 2017 and became a New York Times best-seller. Synopsis You Are the Universe is a philosophical work which attempts to give answers to questions pertaining to the origin of the universe, time, space, matter and the origin and meaning of consciousness and the marrying of science and spirituality in daily lives. The book challenges the assumption that consciousness is a byproduct of matter claiming that matter is actually an experience in consciousness. The book proposes that the entire universe, as experienced by human beings, is a \\"human construct in consciousness.\\" The book delves into the two most prominent questions in science which are: * What is the universe made of? * What is the biological basis of consciousness? The book makes use of analogies, to make certain philosophical points, such as equating the chance of DNA structure forming the building blocks of life emerging from the chaos that existed after The big bang with 100 monkeys with 100 typewriters eventually producing the complete works of Shakespeare, or the possibility of a whirlwind blowing through an aircraft spare parts yard and putting together a functional jumbo jet.  Critical reception  Professor of Neurology at Harvard University, Rudolph E. Tanzi, describes the book as \\"A riveting and absolutely fascinating adventure that will blow your mind wide open!\\" Constance Scharff of the New York Journal of Books wrote that '\\"what is most compelling about You Are the Universe: Discovering Your Cosmic Self and Why It Matters is that if you can hold the ideas set out in its pages as at least possible, you may find your capacity to change your life will be catapulted off the charts. If the universe is indeed human and our minds have the same type of creative capacity as the universe or at least parts of the universe, we have the ability to change our lives in profound ways.\\"' Professor of physics Sadri Hassani reviewed You are the Universe for Skeptical Inquirer and said \\"Every chapter... is headed by a question followed by a long discussion of (sometimes irrelevant) topics mostly from physics but also from neuroanatomy. ... The answer to every chapter heading boils down to two words: conscious universe\\". And about the authors, Hassani says \\"It baffles the mind how a medical doctor and a computational physicist have been able to solve puzzles that more than 600 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology and medicine have been unable to solve in the past 117 years!\\".

They were discovered in 2015 by British scientists at the pharmaceutical company F2G Ltd. while searching for a new drug for Aspergillus infection. The discovery was formally announced at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) 55th meeting during 17-21 September 2015 at San Diego, California, and published the next year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It was found to be effective against most important human fungal infections including those with Aspergilus, Lemontospora (Scedosporium) prolificans, Fusarium, Penicillium spp., and Taloromyces. The most promising drug candidate is designated F901318, chemical name 2-(1,5-dimethyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-N-{4-[4-(5-fluoro- pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]-phenyl}-2-oxo-acetamide. Unlike other antifungal drugs, the orotomides act differently by stopping pyrimidine biosynthesis in fungal cells. They cause reversible inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme that catalyses dihydroorotate to orotate. This inhibition in turn block the growth of hyphae. This unique action makes it more effective than other antifungal drugs. Originally named the F3 series, the name was changed to orotomides, combining the names of the compound (dihydroorotate) they acted upon with the chemical group (Œ±-ketoamide) which they belong to. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products granted orphan designation to F2G for F901318 for the treatment of scedosporiosis on 29 August 2016, and for invasive aspergillosis on 14 October 2016. As of May 2017, F901318 is in late phase 1 clinical trials. It was shown to be useful for acute sinopulmonary aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus flavus.

Early life & Career Morrison was born in Illinois and was a descendant of Lucien Bonaparte Maxwell. Following high school, he became the manager of a grocery store in St Louis, Missouri in 1930 and continued taking correspondence courses at LaSalle Extension University, graduating in 1940. By the 1940s, Morrison had become a court appointed probate investigator, specializing in wills and bankruptcies, often working with various law firms in St. Louis, Missouri, and in Texas. Genealogical Studies and research on the Maxwell Land Grant Morrison was a member of the Missouri Historical Society and conducted extensive primary research on the Maxwell Land Grant. Many of Morrison's papers have been donated to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. Joe Hines and Billy the Kid In 1949, Morrison was appointed to settle a court case involving a man named Joe Hines, whose brother had died in Minot, North Dakota. During the course of proving his identity to the court, Hines claimed that he was in fact the notorious outlaw Jesse Evans that had fought in the Lincoln County War and related that Billy the Kid was not killed by Pat Garrett in 1881. Morrison was intrigued, but skeptical. Hines would not reveal the name or whereabouts of The Kid, but did provide some leads that Morrison was able to follow which eventually led him to William H. \\"Brushy Bill\\" Roberts in Hico, Texas. Following a period of interviews and approximately one year of gathering evidence, Morrison became convinced that Roberts was The Kid and took the 90-year-old Roberts in front of New Mexico Governor Thomas Mabry to obtain a pardon. Mabry was unimpressed, and allowed numerous skeptics to attend the meeting, who peppered Roberts with questions. Roberts had a stroke on the spot, and died slightly more than a month later. Disappointed with the results, and believing that Roberts had not received a fair hearing, Morrison collaborated with renowned folklorist C.L.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance and a slightly overhanging second floor. The roof has a shallow pitch, and has a deeper than normal eave over a simple box cornice. The window bays are 19th- century enlargements of what were originally smaller openings, and the present siding is laid over what is believed to be original period clapboards. A two- story gabled ell extends to the rear. The house in 2018 The house was built about 1675 by John Hollister, Jr., whose father is credited with building Glastonbury's first house (which no longer stands). Local lore says that the currently-standing house was built in the meadows west of its present location, and was moved to its present location about 1720; there is no documentary or architectural evidence to support the idea. The house was originally built as a two-room structure with chimney, and its chimney structure suggests that the leanto structure on the rear is a later addition. In the 19th century a portion of the leanto was raised a full two stories in height.

Biography  Born on 13 July 1745, Dickinson was the eldest son of Sarah (n√©e Prankard), daughter of Graffin Prankard, iron merchant, of Bristol and Caleb Dickinson, merchant, of Bristol. He was probably educated at Westminster School in 1758 and entered the University of Edinburgh in 1765. Dickinson was returned as Member of Parliament for Great Marlow after a contest at the 1768 general election. He lost his seat at Marlow in 1774. The Fullers had a strong influence at Rye, a Treasury borough, and Dickinson re-entered Parliament as MP for Rye in a by- election on 20 May 1777 succeeding Rose Fuller. He was returned unopposed for Rye in 1780. This was a period in which the West Indies commercial lobby, to which Dickinson belonged as did some of his Fuller relations by marriage, was growing; and was able to head off Edmund Burke's 1780 proposal for gradual abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.Andrew J. O'Shaughnessy, The Formation of a Commercial Lobby: The West India Interest, British Colonial Policy and the American Revolution, The Historical Journal Vol. 40, No. 1 (Mar., 1997), pp. 71‚Äì95, at p. 81. Published by: Cambridge University Press Kingweston House, Somerset - now part of Millfield School His father died in 1783 and left him his estate at Kingweston, Somerset where he built his new house in the Georgian style between 1785 and 1788 under the supervision of Samuel Heal of Bridgwater.VCH Explore Kingweston House He was also left a share of the Appleton estate in Jamaica which had been granted to the Dickinson family by Charles II. Dickinson was returned unopposed again in 1784. However he supported the Portland Whigs and this cost him his seat for Rye in 1790. Although he originally owed the seat to his wife's family interest, he was informed by Thomas Lamb, manager of the borough on 11 June: ‚ÄúWe should hope it will not be very displeasing to you to retire when the politics of the times run so contrary to your own; to attempt to accomplish your wishes soon with the assurances of your giving your support to government I found would be very hardly combated.‚Äù Dickinson's offered to come in as locum tenens for his Lamb's son Thomas Phillipps Lamb but this was rejected,. Dickinson wrote that he would retire into private life as he could not represent Rye, bearing his ‚Äògreat disappointment‚Äô with ‚Äòthe most perfect resignation and good humour‚Äô. He also wrote to the Duke of Portland that, as a victim of his loyalty to him, he had ‚Äòa prior claim to anyone to regain that very seat ... or such other as I may approve of‚Äô. To ‚Äòhis Royal Highness‚Äô he wrote that his being thrown out was a measure forced on his constituents and that he had ‚Äòno doubt at a future opportunity of being reinstated‚Äô In August 1792 there was a vacancy for Somerset, where Dickinson's inherited wealth had been invested in the Kingweston estate. He was tempted to offer himself, but made way for Henry Hippisley Coxe. His brother in law Hans Sloane congratulated him on not endangering a ‚Äòconstitution so sensible to fatigue‚Äô. When another vacancy arose on Coxe's death in 1795, Dickinson was again a contender, but made way for William Gore-Langton. By 1796 he was not to be frustrated again and when the veteran Member Sir John Trevelyan, Bt retired at the 1796 general election he was able to come in quietly for the county. His son and heir William was returned for Ilchester at the same time. He retained Somerset in 1802. Family Philippa Fuller, portrait c.1770 In January 1771, he married Philippa Fuller, daughter of Stephen Fuller of Brightling, Sussex and Jamaica. They had at least a son and a daughter.

It found the CMC responsible for not properly disposing waste and not properly carrying out payment of compensation for the effected. It was further revealed that the CMC continued to dump waste at the site even after a court order prevented it in 2009.

The conflict encompasses civil unrest which has been sporadically ongoing since 1979 events, pro-democracy and pro-human rights protests and occasional armed incidents, which increased in 2017 as part of the 2017‚Äì19 Qatif unrest. Background Since Al-Hasa and Qatif were conquered and annexed into the Emirate of Riyadh in 1913 by Ibn Saud, Shiites in the region had experienced state oppression. Unlike most of Saudi Arabia, Qatif and much of the Eastern Province has a Shiite majority, and the region is also being of key importance to the Saudi government due to it both possessing the bulk of Saudi oil reserves as well as the main Saudi refinery and export terminal of Ras Tanura, which is situated close to Qatif. History 1979 uprising The 1979 Qatif Uprising was a period of unprecedented civil unrest that occurred in Qatif and Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in late November 1979. The unrest resulted in 20-24 people killed in what was described as a sectarian outburst of violence between the Shi'a minority and Sunni majority in Saudi Arabia and the beginning of the modern phase of the Qatif conflict. 1979-83 crackdown After the 1979 uprising, the Saudi authorities have engaged in systematic persecution of Shi'a activists in Qatif, with an estimated 182-219 killed by 1983 (including the 1979 events). Arab Spring protests 2011-12 The protests in Saudi Arabia were part of the Arab Spring that started with the 2011 Tunisian revolution. Protests started with a self-immolation in Samtah and Jeddah street protests in late January 2011. Protests against anti-Shia discrimination followed in February and early March in Qatif, Hofuf, al- Awamiyah, and Riyadh. A Facebook organiser of a planned 11 March \\"Day of Rage\\", Faisal Ahmed Abdul-Ahad, was allegedly killed by Saudi security forces on 2 March, with several hundred people protesting in Qatif, Hofuf and al- Amawiyah on the day itself. Khaled al-Johani demonstrated alone in Riyadh, was interviewed by BBC Arabic Television, was detained in  ΩUlaysha Prison, and became known online as \\"the only brave man in Saudi Arabia\\". Many protests over human rights took place in April 2011 in front of government ministry buildings in Riyadh, Ta'if and Tabuk and in January 2012 in Riyadh. In 2011, Nimr al-Nimr encouraged his supporters in nonviolent resistance. Execution controversy of Nimr al-Nimr On 15 October 2014, al-Nimr was sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court for \\"seeking 'foreign meddling' in [Saudi Arabia], 'disobeying' its rulers and taking up arms against the security forces\\". Said Boumedouha of Amnesty International stated that the death sentence was \\"part of a campaign by the authorities in Saudi Arabia to crush all dissent, including those defending the rights of the Kingdom's Shi'a Muslim community.\\" Nimr al-Nimr's brother, Mohammad al-Nimr, tweeted information about the death sentence and was arrested on the same day. The head of Iran's armed forces warned Saudi Arabia that it would \\"pay dearly\\" if it carried out the execution.The Shia in Saudi Arabia: The sword unsheathed , economist.com. In March 2015 the Saudi Arabian appellate court upheld the death sentence against al-Nimr. On 25 October 2015, the Supreme Religious Court of Saudi Arabia rejected al-Nimr's appeal against his death sentence. During an interview for Reuters, al-Nimr's brother claimed that the decision was a result of a hearing which occurred without the presence or notification of al-Nimr's lawyers and family. This being said, he still remained hopeful that King Salman would grant a pardon.October 26, 2015. \\"Saudi Arabia court confirms Shia cleric death sentence\\" . Al Jazeera. Retrieved 27 October 2015. However, on January 2, 2016, al-Nimr was executed. Unrest 2017-present The 2017‚Äì19 Qatif unrest is a conflict in the Qatif region (within Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia) between the Saudi government and the Shia militants. It began in May 2017 after an incident on 12 May when a child and a Pakistani young man were shot and killed. In the same month, Saudi authorities erected siege barricades in Awamiyah and attempted to bulldoze the al-Musawara residential area. The conflict became an armed conflict, with about 12‚Äì25 people killed in shelling and sniper fire during May and the following few months.

With renewed interest in Caribbean literature, and especially after a new edition was published in 2000, it has attracted critical attention, especially its author's attitude towards slavery. Background St Kitts landscape The Scottish doctor James Grainger settled on the West Indian island of St. Kitts in 1759. Marrying there, his parents- in-law made him manager of the family's sugar estates. At the same time he also set up in medical practice and rode about the island visiting patients. His georgic poem The Sugar Cane was substantially completed by 1762 and represents all he had learned on the subject of planting, about his new home in general, and about the diseases to which the slaves working there were subject. For a few months in 1763-4 he made a brief return visit to Britain and arranged for his poem to be published there. About half the book's text was made up of voluminous explanatory and descriptive notes. A West-India georgic The introduction to The Sugar Cane mentions the exoticism and novelty of his new surroundings as Grainger's main reason for writing his ‚ÄúWest-India georgic‚Äù, coupled with the example of adaptations of the Classical model to domestic subjects such as John Philips‚Äô Cyder (1708) and John Dyer‚Äôs The Fleece (1757) - which Grainger had been among the few to review favourably on its first appearance. Samuel Johnson also recognised the subject‚Äôs novelty in his review in the Critical Quarterly: ‚ÄúA new creation is offered, of which an European has scarce any conception: the hurricane, the burning winds, a ripe cane-piece on fire at midnight; an Indian prospect after a finished crop, and nature in all the extremes of tropic exuberance.‚ÄùQuoted in Gilmore 2000, p.41 Grainger defines the scope of his work in the opening verses: ::What soil the cane affects; what care demands; ::Beneath what signs to plant; what ills await; ::How the hot nectar best to christallize; ::And Afric‚Äôs sable progeny to keep: ::A Muse, that long hath wander‚Äôd in the groves ::Of myrtle- indolence, attempts to sing. Like Virgil's Georgics, the work is organized in four books, of which the first describes the conditions most favourable for planting and cultivating sugar cane, focusing on the landscape, soil, wildlife and climate in St. Kitts, which at that time was considered one of the most favourable islands for sugar production. The second book is addressed to his fellow poet, the landscape gardener William Shenstone. There Grainger discusses various threats to the growth and health of the sugar-cane, which include natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes. The third book deals with the harvest of the cane and the sugar-boiling process, while the fourth book gives an account of slave culture on the plantations. The title page of the original edition Although Grainger's The Sugar Cane remains the best known 18th century poem on a West Indian subject, others were written both before and after it. Nathaniel Weekes‚Äô Barbados, a poem (1754) was a forerunner that also included a consideration of sugar cane.Excerpts in The Penguin Book of Caribbean Verse, ed. Paula Burnett (1986), pp.104-5 Not long after the appearance of Grainger's work, John Singleton published A general description of the West Indian islands (1767) in which he paid tribute to the poem as a successful model.Book 2, p.22. Later there was also a sideways allusion to Grainger in the anonymous Jamaica, a poem in three parts (1777), where the ‚ÄúArgument‚Äù to part one declares that ‚ÄúThe Muse thinks it disgraceful in a Briton to sing of the Sugar-cane, since it is owing the Slavery of the Negroes‚Äù.p.6 Grainger himself, besides placing his poem within the tradition of English adaptations of the georgic in his introduction, also echoed a passage from one of them at a critical point in the body of the text. The description of the harvesters dancing after the apple crop is gathered in John Philips‚Äô CyderBook 2, p.74 is adapted to a similar scene among the plantation Negroes.Book IV, lines 582-600, pp.157-8 Where Philips‚Äô harvesters ‚Äúfrisk and bound‚Äù, Grainger's ‚Äùgay troop‚Ä¶frisks and capers‚Äù while ‚Äúshaking their sable [or in Philips their brawny] limbs‚Äù. In both places the males steal kisses from their female partners, which are received scornfully ‚Äúwith neck reclin‚Äôd‚Äù. By such deliberate allusions Grainger affirms the place of his ‚ÄúWest-India georgic‚Äù in the British tradition of such writing, and not simply as an isolated piece of colourful Caribbeana. Gilmore, ‚ÄúGrainger, James‚Äù, The Encyclopedia of British Literature 1660 ‚Äì 1789, Wiley Blackwell 2015, vol.1,p.550 The Oxford Handbook of British Poetry comments on the dynamics of the poem that ‚Äúat the same time as presenting the West Indies as an extension of the British nation, The Sugar Cane also implicitly confirms David Hume‚Äôs observations regarding the way that trade and travel can undermine the distinction between nations: it depicts the West Indies as a crucible in which the goods, peoples and languages of numerous nations have been mixed‚Ä¶.Grainger‚Äôs poem, a veritable encyclopedia of information about local flora, fauna, diseases and cures, including names and etymological derivations from English, French, Spanish, Arabic, and the local language, embodies the miscegenous results of colonialism.‚ÄùLeith Davis, ‚ÄúPoems on nation and empire‚Äù in The Oxford Handbook of British Poetry 1660-1800, OUP 2016, One problem that all the writers of British georgics had in common was contemporary interpretations of the Classical model they were following, particularly in the matter of diction, where the use of specialised terms and low concepts were deprecated. In 1697 Joseph Addison had published his ‚ÄúEssay on Virgil‚Äôs Georgics‚Äù, in which he particularly commended Virgil for the avoidance of these through a poetic technique whereby ‚ÄúHe delivers the meanest of his precepts with a kind of grandeur, he breaks the clods and tosses the dung about with an air of gracefulness‚Äù.Gilmore 2000, p.27 At one point Grainger drafted this sentiment directly into his poem in lines he later rejected, ‚ÄúThe Muse on Lowliness can Worth impart:/ And scatter dung with conscious Majesty‚ÄùGilmore 2000, p.30, although ultimately preferring to scatter the low word abundantly about in his advice on the management of the soil. Conscious also of mediating unfamiliar landscapes and products, he was not shy of naming the island's profuse and unfamiliar flora and fauna ... humming birds, prickly pears and wild liquorice (1.526-540) ... and annotated them minutely. Once again, his precedent was the practice of his forerunners in the English georgic, of which one example is the list of antipathetic plants in Cyder. Cyder: A Poem in Two Books, London 1709, pp.8-9 Grainger's poem was reprinted many times, the last being in 1836, when such writing was already falling out of favour. It was not until after a century and a half of disparagement, during which most 18th century writing was undervalued (unless it could be perceived as a precursor to Romanticism), that The Sugar-Cane saw its first modern edition in Thomas Krise's Caribbeana: An Anthology of English Literature of the West Indies, 1657-1777.University of Chicago, 1999, pp.166ff It was followed in 2000 by John Gilmore's critical edition, The Poetics of Empire: A Study of James Grainger's The Sugar Cane.The Athlone Press Since then, there has been a steady stream of new scholarly articles and book chapters dedicated to Grainger and his major work. Slavery Grainger's presentation of West Indian slavery in The Sugar-Cane appeared a little before formal agitation against the slave trade in England but was informed by his reading of advanced thinkers who questioned its validity, such as Adam Smith‚Äôs The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and George Wallace‚Äôs A System of the Principles of the Laws of Scotland (1760).Anna Foy, ‚ÄúGetting to know James Grainger‚Äù, Oxford University Press online Indeed, he himself raised the question whether as ‚ÄúServants, not slaves; of choice and not compell‚Äôd;/ The blacks should cultivate the Cane-land isles,‚Äù (IV.242-3) but without providing an answer.Thomas 2006 In his otherwise favourable review in the Critical Quarterly, Dr Johnson was uneasy about the poem's ambivalence. Of Book IV, dealing with the economics of slave culture, he commented that ‚Äúthat tenderness and humanity, with which the former part of the poem seems replete, is, in some measure, forgotten. The poet talks of this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation; but proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow-creatures with the same indifference that a groom would give instructions for chusing an horse.‚ÄùQuoted in Silva 2016, pp.127-8 Modern judgements also point out the discrepancy between Grainger's liberal sentiments and the practical advice on the management of ‚ÄúAfric‚Äôs sable progeny‚Äù, proving The Sugar Cane ‚Äúultimately rooted in a form of poetic failure‚Äù. For such critics, the continual evasions in the body of the poem hide who is responsible for the work of sugar production behind poetic conventions that ‚Äúrequire Grainger to maintain the fiction that slavery is a formal problem of poetry rather than an ethical problem in the world‚Äù.Silva 2016, p.129ff While admitting this, his editor John Gilmore has pointed out that many nineteenth-century writers who criticized Grainger for his depiction of slavery did not object to Virgil's writing about his own slave-tended estates.Gilmore 2000, p.63 Bibliography *Monique Allewaert, ‚ÄúInsect Poetics: Or, How James Grainger‚Äôs Fraught Personifications Presage Enlightenments Not Taken‚Äù, 2016 *Anna M.

Some of the larvae feed externally on plants and some form plant galls on willows (Salix species). In the case of the gall-forming species, when the female lays her eggs she injects a stimulant and the gall start to form before the eggs hatch. Most sawfly galls are hard and individual larva tend to inhabit the gall, feeding on the tissue and leave the gall to pupate in the soil. Most of the species are monophages (i.e., specific to one species of willow) although the type species, Euura mucronata, is polyphagous feeding on over thirty species of willow. Most groups of insects tend to have maximum numbers of species in the tropics and decrease towards the poles. The Nematinae reverse this trend with the highest number probably occurring in the boreal forest zone. The reason is not fully understood but could be because of the abundance of species of willow in the region. In the Western Palaearctic all of the species of Euura are attached to Salix species as hosts for their larva. Reports of European species of stem-galling Euura, galling poplar (Populus species) remain unconfirmed, although at least five species in North America do gall poplars. Galls A gall is an abnormal growth where the host plants cells enlarge and/or multiply providing food and shelter for the gall- causer. Most gall-causers stick to one host species, or a group which are closely related and tend to cause short-term, localised damage to their host plant. Unlike most gall insects where the development of the gall is a response to the immature stages living in the gall, females of Euura species inject a substance during oviposition which starts the growth of the gall. The female secretions have led taxonomists to consider gall-inducing species of sawfly to be highly host specific. One hypothesis for the evolution of galls is, they may have started with the larvae of an ancestor that either folded or rolled leaves, culminating in E. atra; which does not usually induce a gall but taxonomically belongs to the gall species. The first publication of a sawfly gall was by Francesco Redi in 1668 with illustrations of E. proxima. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek wrote numerous letters to the Royal Society including one on ‚Ä≥growths on the leaves of willows‚Ä≥. The early researchers sometimes mistook parasitoids emerging from the galls as the gall-makers. Reaumur (1737) was possibly the first to correctly identify a sawfly as a galler, based on the morphology of the larvae. Until recently the taxonomy of gall-forming Euura was based mostly on the morphology of the adults and the larvae often lived on a wide range of Salix species. From the 1980s onwards Jens-Peter Kopelke argued that each sawfly species was strictly monophagous i.e. feeds on a single species. Kopelke and other taxonomists have since described many new species, although it is not universally agreed and it is argued that some recently described species are considered to be host plant races. The reason being there are only small genetic and morphological differences, which are not enough evidence to treat them as separate species. In 2014 gall-inducing species, on willow, of Eupontania, Phyllocolpa, Pontania and Tubpontania were placed in the Euura, reflecting advances in the understanding of their phylogeny. Free-feeding species were also transferred.

On January 7, 965, Qarghuyah was appointed governor of Aleppo by Sayf al-Dawla, who had by that point retreated to Martyropolis, moving against an advancing Byzantine army lead by Nikephoros II Phokas. On October 29, 965, a rebel force led by the former secretary of Tarsus, Rashiq al-Nasimi, approached Aleppo while Sayf al-dawla was away from the city. After three months, he managed to capture a lower part of the town, but was killed in an attack on the citadel on January 8, 966. Sayf al-Dawla died on 8 February of 967 in Aleppo. He was succeeded by his son, Sa'd al-Dawla, who reached Aleppo on June/July 967. Around April 968, the same month the rebellion of Abu Firas failed, Qarghuyah convinced Sa'd al-Dawla to leave Aleppo. Following this, Qarghuyah seized power for himself but was immediately besieged by an unknown rival. Qarghuyah appealed to the nearby Byzantine general, Petros, for aid, who was then besieging Antioch with Michael Bourtzes. Following the capture Antioch (October 28, 969), Petros and Bourtzes made their way to Aleppo, defeating Qarghuyah's rival quickly. They then in turn besieged Aleppo from 14 December to 11 January, successfully defeating Qarghuyah and his defenders. Following the siege, Petros and Bourtzes forced Qarghuyah and his deputy, Bakjur, to sign the Treaty of Safar, which stipulated that Aleppo, Homs, and the whole \\"province\\" would pay tribute to Byzantium, while Qarghuyah would be guaranteed rule over Aleppo, and Bakjur would be designated as his successor. In 975, Bakjur deposed and imprisoned Qarghuyah and seized control of the Emirate for himself. Two years later, Sa'd al-Dawla returned to Aleppo after defeating Bakjur, who he exiled to Homs, and elevated Qarghuyah to his previous post as deputy. He died around April in 990 in Aleppo.

Two were built, with different engines and were used by the Swedish Air Force. Design and development The Falken trainer, closely related to the Jaktfalken fighter, was derived from the earlier Piraten. It was a single bay biplane with unswept, constant chord, thin section wings. Both wings were built around rectangular section steel spars and were fabric covered. They were mounted with light dihedral but with stagger so strong that the forward lower spar was directly below the upper aft one. Because of the stagger and a slightly shorter lower wing the N-form interplane struts leant both forwards and outwards. The upper wing was supported over the fuselage by a cabane formed by a pair of lateral, inverted V-struts to the forward spar and a single, transverse inverted V to the aft spar. There were long, broad ailerons on both upper and lower wings, externally linked by streamlined tubes. The Falken could be powered by one of two radial engines, either a five-cylinder, Armstrong-Siddeley Mongoose or a seven-cylinder Armstrong-Siddeley Lynx. The Mongoose-powered version was known as the SA-12 Skolfalken and the Lynx- powered one as the SA-13 √ñvningsfalken. Behind the engine the fuselage was built around a tube steel structure. It was flat sided and fabric covered, though it had aluminium covered, rounded decking. The Falken's two open tandem cockpits were fitted with dual control; the forward one was under a cut-out in the trailing edge and the other over a similar cut-out in the lower wing. Its empennage was conventional, with a semi-elliptical tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and braced from below on each side by a single strut. Its angle of incidence was ground-adjustable. It carried parallel chord elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The fin, small and roughly triangular, mounted a straight-edged, upright balanced rudder. Like most of the Falken, these surfaces were formed from steel tubes and fabric covered. The Falken had conventional, fixed landing gear. The mainwheels were on a single axle, separated by . The axle ends were mounted via rubber cord shock absorbers to the crosspiece of a frame consisting of three legs from the lower fuselage on each side and stabilised by a V-strut to the crosspiece centre. The Skolfalken's first flight was in September 1929, though the exact date is not known. The √ñvningsfalken was flying by early 1930. Operational history The first and only SA-12 Skolfalken went to the Swedish Air Force Flight Academy at Ljungbyhed, where it was known by the Air Force basic trainer designation Sk 8. Tests resulted in a new vertical tail, flat-topped and without the earlier prominent balance horn. It remained there for a while and was later moved to Malm√∂ where it ended its 386 hours of flying in 1939 on a May bonfire. There was also only one SA-13 √ñvningsfalken; this, known as the √ñ 8 (√ñ denoted an advanced trainer), was tested in the first half of 1930 but was lost a few months later.

She became the first woman president of the Geological Society of America (1991) and made meaningful contributions towards Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  Biography  Doris Malkin Curtis was born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 12th, 1914. Both her mother, Mary Berkowitz, and father, Meyer Malkin, inspired Doris from a young age to pursue excellence in all areas of life. In her early years, Curtis had a significant involvement with Girl Scouts. She began as a member, then became increasingly involved as a counselor. She attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, where she demonstrated a variety of interests. During her post-secondary academic years, she attended Brooklyn College, where she received her bachelor's degree in Geology in 1933, and went on to earn her master's degree in 1934 and PhD in 1949 at Columbia University. Curtis had a lengthy career in the petroleum industry working for Shell oil from 1941 until 1950. She then began her career in academia, where she taught for nearly 5 years. Ultimately, her passion for the petroleum industry reunited her with Shell Oil, where she continued to work until 1979. She then formed a geology consulting company with her long time friend/partner Dorothy Jung Echols. Doris continued to work until her death on May 26th, 1991 in Houston where her career began. In August later that year, her life was celebrated by the staff of the Geological Society of America as her ashes were placed beneath the branches of a spruce tree, which represented the ever-growing impact she made on those she came across. Doris Malkin Curtis was a pioneer in her field, working within the gulf coast for over 50 years and making contributions throughout her career. Shortly before her death, Doris was made the first woman president of the GSA. Even during her battle with acute leukemia, she continued to travel as the GSA president, demonstrating the same strength and perseverance that she was known for.  Career  In 1941, Doris began working for Shell Oil Company. Initially as a paleontologist until she was transferred to several different locations to work as a stratigrapher and geologist (1942-1950). With the help of her mother, she also completed her field work required to complete her PhD during this time. After marrying a Shell engineer, temporarily ending her career at Shell due to nepotism laws at the time, Curtis joined the University of Houston as a Faculty of Earth Sciences member. After teaching for two years, she left to become an associate research geologist for Scripps Institution of Oceanography where she made contributions to the study of biofacies. Doris began teaching at university as an instructor for sedimentary geology, beginning at the University of Oklahoma (1954-1959) where she became a popular professor and instructor, loved among students. In 1960, she began working in the petroleum field once more and was assigned to Shells Baton Rouge Exploration Office. After working alongside Shell for nineteen more years, Doris retired in 1979. She created a geological consulting firm with her good friend, Dorothy Jung Echols by the name of 'Curtis and Echols.' where she used her skills to map deposition in various locations to determine where hydrocarbons could be found within the earth. Doris was a very respected geologist, she held many sessions of various geology topics. Thanks to Doris' contribution to the geological field, new concepts for interpreting the geology of basins all around the world were created and the study of time-synchronous deltas was initiated in Louisiana.  Accomplishments  * Doris published over 30 papers that were featured in professional journals on topics such as biostratigraphy and the source of hydrocarbons in the Gulf of Mexico during the Cenozoic period. * She was a member of multiple geologic organization's such including being an honorary member and president of the Gulf section of SEPM, the American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG), the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), the Houston Geological Society, Sigma XI and the 28th International Geological Congress. * The first woman to become president of the Geological Society of America (GSA). * With her background in geology and industry, she became a member of the Environmental Quality Committee and worked towards conservation of the environments that industries are founded on and led her to be appointed in 1967 as one of four delegates from the United States to the USSR in an exchange visit to tour petroleum provinces in the Baku area of the Caspian Sea. * The accomplishment she was most proud of was her opportunity participate in the shipboard sedimentologist on two legs of the Deep Sea Drilling Project on the Glomar Challenger in Yokohama to Okinawa Japan from 1978-1979 and again in 1983. * Doris was listed in the book American Men and Women of Science and Marquis Who's Who due to her contributions to geology. * Received Matrix award in Houston for Women in Community Service. * Member and chairman of the U.S National Committee of Geology. * The Doris Malkin Curtis medal is awarded to individuals in geology who have made considerable contributions in understanding of the geology of the Gulf coast. * The Curtis-Hedberg petroleum career achievement award is a new award that is meant to honor the two former presidents of GSA (Geological Society of America), Doris Malkin Curtis and Hollis Hedberg, this award is given to those who have made significant contributions to the discovery of petroleum reserves. * Doris M.

Joseph Rheingold was born in New York City on October 5, 1903. His father was Louis Reingold (Joseph added the ‚Äúh‚Äù to his surname as an adult), a Yiddish-language playwright, and a union leader in the tailor trade. His mother was Esther Friedman, who devoted her life to charitable works. Both of them were originally from Poland. They moved from New York to Chicago in 1912. Rheingold had four sisters. He married Harriet Lange in 1930, though they divorced in 1958. They had two sons, Paul Rheingold and Arnold Rheingold.  Education  Rheingold graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a B.S. degree in 1926. He then graduated from the University of Illinois Medical School in 1929, and received a Master's degree in pathology in 1930. In that same year he became an M.D., and in 1939 became a Diplomate in neurology and psychiatry. He did residencies at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago and Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute in Chicago, becoming a specialist in neuropsychiatry. He received further training at the Memorial Foundation for Neuro-Endocrine Research in Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston Psychiatric Hospital; and the Augusta State Hospital in Maine. In 1941 Rheingold was awarded a Ph.D. in neurology and psychiatry by the University of Illinois; his thesis dealt with possible organic causes of schizophrenia. The thesis, titled ‚ÄúAutonomic Integration in Schizophrenia: Autonomic Status Determined Statistically, the Thyroid Factor, and a Possible Thyroid-Hypothalamus Mechanism‚Äù, was published in Psychosomatic Medicine, the official journal of the American Psychosomatic Society.  Private practice and naval service  In 1935, Rheingold opened a private practice in Chicago on North Michigan Ave., which he would operate until 1942. He then served in World War II from 1942 until 1945, as a Commander in the Medical Corps, US Navy, and was stationed in Panama, where he was chief of the neuropsychiatry station at the US Naval Hospital. Upon return to civilian life, Rheingold practiced psychiatry in Rockford, IL., from 1945 until 1958. He then left individual practice and retired to the Boston area. While living in Boston he became a research associate in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, a position that enabled him to do research and write his two books. As well, he served as psychiatric consultant in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the Boston City Hospital, again a position that was useful in his personal research and writing. Rheingold became director of the court clinic of in Hingham District Court, where he examined the mental competency of those arrested. He also did volunteer work in marine biology in Boston harbor. He was a member of many professional organizations, including Sigma Xi and the American Psychiatric Association, where he was named a Life Fellow. Rheingold also was a book collector, amassing a very large library about Franklin D. Roosevelt. This included ephemera such as surrender pamphlets dropped in Germany in World War II. In 1958 he donated the entire collection to Beloit College in Wisconsin, where it is accessible today. The collection was described by book dealer Arthur R. Gofen, as \\"probably the largest and finest personal collection about Roosevelt and the New Deal era in existence.\\"  Writing  Rheingold is remembered today for writing two books, which were based in large part upon his many years of psychoanalysis of female patients. The first is The Fear of Being a Woman, 1964 (Grune & Stratton). The subtitle describes his thesis: A Theory of Maternal Destructiveness. This work is stated to be based on his twelve years of psychotherapy in Rockford, IL, between 1946 and 1958. At one point he refers to have analyzed 2,500 patients. The length of The Fear of Being a Woman ‚Äî 760 pages ‚Äî can be attributed to Rheingold‚Äôs efforts to demonstrate the commonality, even universality, of a mother‚Äôs unconscious destruction of her daughter‚Äôs psyche. A large part of the book considers the woman at various gynecological and obstetric phases of her life. Rheingold reinforced his own arguments with references to the work of many other writers. The Fear of Being a Woman was reviewed in many journals, both psychiatric and obstetrical. Many praised the effort and insights, but few if any agreed with the basic concept. The second, more comprehensive book was The Mother, Anxiety, and Death, published in 1967 by Little Brown. The subtitle, ‚ÄúThe Catastrophic Death Complex,‚Äù pretty well summarizes the thesis, which is that fear of death is universal and that this ‚Äúanxiety associated with death is due to the reactivation of basic anxiety aroused [. . .] in the early mother-child relationship.‚Äù During this time, Rheingold was associated with Harvard Medical School, and did his writing in Wellesley, Mass., where he resided. Both Rheingold‚Äôs books were also published in England, and translated into Italian. Both books are marked by clear expository and erudite writing, and logical reasoning. To make his individual points, Rheingold relied on the writings of philosophers, psychologists, and psychiatrists, plus on cultural myths. To this he added his own insights gained by years of psychoanalysis of patients. Unfortunately for Rheingold, his fundamental theories did not catch on amongst fellow psychiatrists, or a broader popular audience. Of course, the intervening past half century has presented a great amount of scientific knowledge, such as on genetics and brain activity, which were not available to him. Today insofar as he is cited, it is in reference to psychoanalysis in the context of his time, as in Edward Dolnick‚Äôs 1998 monograph ‚ÄúMadness on the Couch: Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis‚Äù. Rheingold is cited multiple times in Dolnick‚Äôs book. In the introduction to ‚ÄúMother, Anxiety and Death,‚Äù Rheingold thanks a number of persons for help. First is Jacques Choron, PhD (1904‚Äì1972), for criticisms of the text; Choron was a teacher of philosophy in New York, and himself an author on the same topics. The second is Kurt Eissler, M.D., who was a writer on these same topics. Rheingold of course had a mother, a wife and children of his own. It is unknown how he viewed his own interpersonal relationships. In ‚ÄúThe Mother, Anxiety and Death,‚Äù he does state (p. 125) that he had a death complex, a complex in psychoanalytical theory being ‚Äúa core pattern of emotions, memories, perceptions, and wishes in the personal unconscious organized around a common theme.‚Äù For Rheingold, then, the concept of death was a source of deep-seated and complicated anxiety.  Death  Rheingold died June 4, 1978, at age 75, of a heart attack. He is buried in Scituate, Massachusetts.

Officially launched in public preview under the code name Project Honolulu at the Microsoft Ignite 2017 conference in Orlando, Florida, Windows Admin Center offers \\"flexible, locally-deployed, browser- based management platform and tools\\". The idea behind this project is to help simplify management of servers by placing a majority of the frequently referenced tools used by system administrators in one spot. On April 12, 2018 the project left preview and was named Windows Admin Center. Features A list of features that are offered from this web based administration tool are as follows, and expected to grow with the ability for plugins and 3rd party extensions: * Overview * Azure hybrid services * Azure Backup * Azure File Sync * Azure Monitor * Azure Security Center * Certificates * Devices * Events * Files * Firewall * Installed apps * Local users & groups * Network * PowerShell * Processes * Registry * Remote Desktop * Roles & features * Scheduled tasks * Services * Storage * Storage replica * Updates * Virtual Machines * Virtual Switches * Settings There are a few like Storage Replica which don't have any alternative GUI so far. In addition, Windows Admin Center also offers Hyper Converged Cluster Management. At present, Microsoft only supports Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers. Internet Explorer and Firefox are not supported.  Server compatibility  This tool is meant to manage Windows Server 2012 and later. Windows Admin Center also supports managing Windows 10 with fewer tools. In order for it to be able to manage Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2, the Windows Management Framework (WMF) version 5 or higher must be installed.  Client compatibility  When it comes to installing Windows Admin Center, it can be installed on a Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 or later operating systems. Installing Windows Admin Center requires a ~64MB Microsoft Installer Package (MSI). Walking through the installation it will ask for a port to serve the website on, as well as the ability to generate a self-signed SSL cert or use an SSL cert from your Certificate Authority, for example. In terms of configuration options that is all that is required to install. Upon completion, access Windows Admin Center over the web you will need to add servers in order to manage them.  Simplified management  Windows Admin Center was brought into existence because \\"IT admins have repeatedly told us that PowerShell is necessary but not sufficient, and that Windows Server ease-of-use is still largely dependent on GUI Tools for core scenarios and new capabilities\\" Windows Admin Center builds off of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) that was first introduced in Windows 2000. It takes some of the most commonly accessed management utilities, such as the Event Viewer, Roles and Features, Hyper-V management, Windows Firewall, and the Registry editor and combines them into a centrally accessible, web based friendly, intuitive interface that makes accessing these items simplified and straightforward.

Early life Irene Williams Coit was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on September 24, 1872. She was the only daughter of General James Bolles Coit (1836-1894). Coit came of old New England stock. Her father, General James B. Coit, was a distinguished soldier in the Civil War. In the administration of President Cleveland he was chief of a pension bureau in Washington. Her mother, Anne \\"Annie\\" Willoughby (1849-1914), was the daughter of A. P. Willoughby, representing one of the oldest families in Norwich. She took the full classical course in the Norwich free academy and was graduated in June 1891, with highest honors. Her determination to try the Yale examinations with the male classical students of her class, was born solely of her generous ambition. Her instructor, Dr. Robert P. Keep, arranged to have Prof. Seymour, of Yale, give Coil an examination with his class. She was accepted on July 8, 1891 and The New York Times wrote: \\"She is the only young woman who has taken the examinations at Yale University and been notified by the Faculty that, except for reasons of sex, she is in every way fitted for the institution.\\" A year after she took the exam, two more women passed it. Career Besides her aptitude as a student, Coit manifested a marked literary capacity. Her first essay in the field of letters was especially successful. Since the summer of 1891 she contributed to various newspapers and publications a variety of articles. In 1893 she moved to Geneva to teach in the DeLancey Private School where she was employed for two years until her marriage. For half century, since her marriage in 1895 to the postmaster of Geneva, she was a leader in Geneva civic affairs. Personal life On September 10, 1895, she married Henry Bronson Graves (1860-1955), the postmaster of Geneva, and had 7 children: Henry Bronson Graves (1896-1980), Richard Nelson Graves (1898-1919), Ralph Coit Graves (1901-1959), Elizabeth Constance Graves (1906-1945), Eleanor Howland Graves (1907-2000), Irene Willoughby Graves (1908-1999), Barbara Ann Graves (b. 1913), who served with the American Red Cross in Paris during World War II. She lived at 139 N. Brook Street, Geneva. She died on August 2, 1945, and is buried at Glenwood Cemetery, Geneva, New York.

Amid China's general campaign to combat desertification, the mostly unreclaimable site in the Gobi's Kubuqi Desert was developed as the country's first desert-themed tourism resort. It now consists of four \\"islands\\" of activities located around the Sand Dune Resort. Mongolian folk culture is displayed, and annual cultural events include an International Photography Week and a sand sculpture festival. Most popular during the summer, Xiangshawan is currently developing a ski resort to attract tourists during the winter months as well. Name Xiangshawan is the pinyin romanization of the site's Chinese name, written in traditional characters and in the simplified form used in mainland China. The tourist area uses the official translation , although the name has also been variously translated into English as \\"Noisy Sand Bay\\", \\"Sounding Sands\\", \\"Singing Sand Ravine\\", \\"Resounding Sand Bay\\", \\"Resonant Sand Bay\\", and \\"Resonant Sand Gorge\\". All of these names reference the \\"humming\\", \\"buzzing\\", or \\"roaring\\" sound created by sliding down its tall sand dunes during dry weather.. Geography Dunes and scrubland in the Kubuqi Desert, overlooked by a Buddhist stupa. Xiangshawan is in Ordos Prefecture's Dalad Banner, about halfway between Baotou and Ordos City,. within the great northern bend of the central stretch of the Yellow River. The Grain of Sand Resort, reception area, and parking lots lie to the east at the edge of Inner Mongolia's reclaimed desert.. The rest of Xiangshawan lies at the far eastern corner of the Kubuqi Desert (t s K√πb√πq√≠ ShƒÅm√≤), which forms the northern half of the Ordos Desert, which itself forms the southwestern portion of the Gobi Desert. The sand is mostly very fine and soft, and the wind-sculpted sand dunes in the resort can reach over high. The resort is separated from the park's reception area and main roads by the valley of the Sasol River ( Su«íshƒÅ H√©), formerly known as the Laotai ( L√°ot√†i H√©). It is also sometimes known as the Hantai ( H«éntƒÅi H√©).. Xiangshawan is about away from Dalad Banner's Wayao Village and about south of Baotou. Climate The area around Xiangshawan is a cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk) with hot summers; cold, long, and very dry winters; and strong winds, particularly in spring... Most rain that occurs falls in the summer between July and September, with very little naturally-occurring snowfall in the winter. Because of the arid climate, bottled water and moisturizing lotion are also strongly advised. The arid climate and relatively high elevation can also produce large differences in temperature between day and nighttime, so a supply of warm clothing is advisable even in the summer when staying overnight. At Xiangshawan, the average temperature in spring is about , in summer about , in the fall about , and in the winter about . For the 30 years prior to 2000, the monthly data for the area including nearby Baotou and Ordos were roughly:. History V≈© Ho√†ng My (Miss Vietnam) in one of the ethnic costumes at the 2012 Miss World competition, hosted in Ordos, Xiangshawan, and Shanghai. One of the nautically-themed shuttle buses at the resort Xiangshawan's train Desert Lotus Hotel (2013) One of Xiangshawan's swimming pools In the 1950s and 1960s, what is now the entrance area to Xiangshawan was the small settlement of Guziqu; the tourist area itself was barren waste.. The area received few visitors before the development of the tourist resort area, which was part of a general project to develop the Ordos and combat the Kubuqi's desertification.Xinhua (July 2017). Xiangshawan opened as China's first desert resort. and remains its largest. With Xiangshawan preserving an area of unreclaimable desert, other districts around it were planted with licorice and other herbs to begin improving the soil and returning it to its former grassland state. (China became the first country in the world to achieve annual shrinkage in its desert area in the early 21st century.) It began hosting a weeklong international photography convention around 2009. The China National Tourism Administration granted the location AAAAA status in 2011, after a four-year campaign. In 2012, it was used as a venue for the 2012 Miss World competition, which was principally based in Ordos that year. The Desert Lotus Hotel in the Liansha Island area was completed in March 2013 and, in 2014, it hosted the International Mongolian Beauty Pageant. In 2015, it received additional funds and privileges from the provincial government as part of a three-year tourism development program. The site can accommodate about 10,000 guests at any one time. In 2016, Xiangshawan welcomed almost 810,000 visitors, around 770,000 during the summer and the rest throughout the other seasons of the year.Xinhua (Dec 2017). The resort greatly increased local living standards, which saw some household incomes rise from around 25,000 each year as herders or corn farmers to over 100,000 each year selling goods to the area's tourists. The five desert resorts in Dalad Banner employed over 1000 workers in about 100 households in 2016. Layout The parking lot and ticket counter are separated from the main resort area by the Sasol Valley. Visitors can traverse the valley on foot or by riding either of two chairlift-style cable cars. On the other side, Xiangshawan is divided into five main themed areas called \\"islands\\", connected by boat-style roofless shuttle buses and other forms of transportation.. They host around 100 different activities and sights, including sandboarding, scaling ladders, zorbing, horse and sand boat riding, and golf. Sand Dune Resort The Sand Dune Resort,. also known as the Grain of Sand Resort ( Yƒ´l√¨shƒÅ D√πji√† C≈´n), is the reception area to the east of the Sasol Valley. It includes a hotel, restaurant, shopping area, tourist center, fitness center with a large pool, clinic, bank, and police and bus stations. There are Chinese dramas and performances by firebreathers in the evenings. It and the adjacent parking lot host the two separate cable cars over the river valley; the cableway near the shopping center goes to the sand slides at Xiangshawan Port and the cableway nearer the parking lot goes to the Fusha Island area. Xiangshawan Port Xiangshawan Port (t s Xi«éngshƒÅwƒÅn G«éng) is the site of the resort's most popular attraction, a slide down a , 45¬∞ sand dune that in dry weather produces the area's namesake singing sand. (The angle had been as much as 75¬∞ in the early days of the park.) The best conditions for the singing sand are produced after thirty consecutive days without rain; a recent shower can dull the sound entirely.. Under optimal conditions, the sound produced by a single person is a hum similar to a frog, bugle, or drumbeat; many people sliding at once can produce roars as loud as a low-flying plane or large bell, as the surface of the dune vibrates beneath them. \\"Sand socks\\" (t s shƒÅw√†) used to prevent the area's fine powdery sand from getting into one's shoes or boots are also rented in this area, although some local guides can endure even the midsummer heat barefoot. Paths run north to the Xiansha Island area and south to the Fusha Island area; to the west, one can board the train to the Yuesha and Liansha Island areas. Xiansha Island Xiansha Island (t s XiƒÅnshƒÅd«éo) is geared towards athletic pursuits, including tightrope walking, sandsurfing and sandbiking, desert volleyball and soccer, and ziplines. There are swings and a playground for children.. Apart from the sports facilities, there is also the Guolao Theater and juggling performances, dune buggy and ATV rides,. as well as a market and snack street. Apart from the trail to Xiangshawan Port, there is a camel caravan that leads to the Yuesha Island area. Yuesha Island Yuesha Island (t s Yu√®shƒÅd«éo) is the location of the resort's sandcastles and sand art, both those made by tourists and a large gallery of major works, the Desert Palace of Fine Arts. There are more children's, soccer, and volleyball areas, as well as swimming pools,. the Rainbow Theater, and professional gymnastic, acrobatic, and hiphop performances. A \\"desert beach\\" area includes beach umbrellas and space for sun and sandbathing during the day and stargazing at night. There are camel caravans to the Xiansha Island area to the east; to the south, the miniature train reaches Xiangshawan Port and the Liansha Island area. The train also passes by an outdoor performance exhibiting traditional Mongolian life on the steppe. Liansha Island Liansha Island (t s Li√°nshƒÅd«éo) consists of the Desert Lotus Hotel and its associated outdoor facilities. The hotel was designed by PLaT Architects.. Unable to use traditional foundations, the architects fixed the structure to the fluid sands by using underground steel panels and supports; the hotel thus floats like a boat upon the sands, which stabilize it. Load-bearing walls reduce the pressure transferred to the base. They also employed local materials in the design, using the area's sand to construct its wall covering. The resort has two swimming pools, a basketball court, pool tables, and putting greens.. It occasionally holds fireworks displays at night. It employs three large banks of photovoltaic panels for its electricity.. Fusha Island Fusha Island (t s F√∫shƒÅd«éo) is focused on Mongolian culture. It includes a yurt, oboo, archery range, oxcart rides, Mongolian cuisine. and folk dancing by the light of bonfires. Other items include the Blessing Island Hotel with its two pools and volleyball and soccer facilities. Fusha Island can access the other areas by shuttle bus; there is also a trail to the Xiangshawan Port and a cable car across the river valley to the Sand Dune Resort and parking lot. Xiangshawan Ski Resort Xiangshawan Ski Resort is a project to improve the location's desirability throughout the year. It opens its slopes in the second week of December. Because of the region's generally dry winter climate, it typically uses artificial snow.. There are two gentle slopes for beginners, a steeper intermediate-level slope for more advanced skiers, and a designated area for children and others to play in the snow. Altogether, the snow covers about . Other winter activities include riding snowmobiles, camels, sleds, and sleighs. Activities The site's three chief cultural brands are its International Photography Week in mid-July,. its sand sculpture festival, and its Ordos wedding performances in the Fusha Island area. Xiangshawan's hot air ballooning area is also used as a leg in the Ordos Hot Air Balloon Festival. Transportation Xiangshawan is about away from the G65 Baotou‚ÄìMaoming Expressway.. It can be reached from Baotou by two buses departing from Donghe Station. The bus to Yiming includes a stop at nearby Wayao Village; the bus to Daqi stops farther away, but permits using a taxi to reach the resort.

Seen from the Langer Pfad. Ekel is the eastern part of the town centre of Norden. Its name goes back to a Low German description for \\"acorn\\" (Eichel) or \\"oak grove\\" (Eichengeh√∂lz), which gave its name to a medieval fortified house (Wehrhaus) about 800 metres northeast of the big market place. Later a private estate and then part of the agriculturally dominated Norden environs, in the 20th century Ekel quickly merged with Norden as a result of new housing estates and was finally incorporated in 1919.  Geography  Because Ekel was never an independent administrative unit, but was only a placename used in everyday language, it has no defined boundaries. It can be seen that many new estates relate to the name, Ekel, that do not lie on the land once owned by the historical estate (eastern part Ekeler Weg, Ekeler Land). Today's understanding is that the town quarter of Ekel is roughly bounded by the Norder Tief stream in the southeast, the B 72 federal highway in the northeast and the railway line to the southwest that cuts through the town. To the northwest it is more difficult to define a boundary, the nearest of the medieval fortified houses (of which about 15 encircled the town forming a defensive ring) were Haus Barenbusch and Haus Wirde, so that the boundary can be taken as the very old road of Ekeler Gaste which follows the geest ridge. In the consciousness of the local people, a not unimportant role in the boundary question is the catchment area of the Ekel Primary School, which extends beyond the named area.

He was the founder of the Union D√©mocratique Africaine.  Biography  Andr√© Lubaya was born on 28 March 1932 in the Kazumba Territory, Kasai Province, Belgian Congo to a Bena- Ngoshi (Lulua) family. His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant. In the 1960 general elections, Lubaya won a seat on a Union National Congolaise (UNC) ticket in the Chamber of Deputies with 9,946 preferential votes. On 2 August 1961 a new government under Cyrille Adoula was presented to Parliament for a vote of confidence. Lubaya joined a few other deputies in expressing concerns about the government's sincerity in guaranteeing the safety and freedom of expression of the parliamentarians. He was the only deputy not to vote in favor of investing the government; he abstained. In December 1961 the Kasai Provincial Assembly elected Lubaya Provincial President. He was seated the following January, replacing Barth√©lemy Mukenge. Both were members of the Lulua-dominated UNC, but while Lubaya was a member of the \\"modernist and revolutionary\\" tendency in the party, Mukenge adhered to the \\"moderate and more traditionalist\\" faction. Under Lubaya's rule more attention was given to the needs of the population of the Sankuru region, which were neglected by his predecessor. His government took a legalistic approach towards its work. Mukenge meanwhile contested the election of Lubaya on the grounds that several unqualified provincial deputies had participated in the election and demanded that Parliament reverse the result. He returned to the office in July 1962, causing Lubaya to appeal to the United Nations Operation in the Congo for security. The following month he relinquished their protection. Soon thereafter the provinces of the Congo were divided up and a new Luluabourg Province was created. A power struggle over the Luluabourg government ensued. On 18 September a government under Fran√ßois Luakabuanga was installed. Lubaya hesitantly accepted the post of Minister of the Interior. Seven days later at the inaugural ceremony, Lubaya delivered a speech denouncing the fact that he had not been made Provincial President. On 11 May 1963 the provincial assembly, following a motion of censure against Luakabuanga, elected Lubaya as President before police interrupted the session and arrested several deputies. As a result, 12 other deputies traveled to the capital and lobbied for Parliament to confirm Lubaya's investiture, which occurred in an extraordinary session in August. However, shortly thereafter Central Government Minister of Interior Joseph Maboti arrested Lubaya and affirmed the legitimacy of Luakabuanga's government. Lubaya fled to Brazzaville where he joined other nationalist dissidents on 3 October in founding the Comit√© National de Lib√©ration, a revolutionary organisation with the goal of overthrowing the Congolese government. He was given the responsibility of managing the organisation's internal affairs. On 18 October 1965 Lubaya was appointed Minister of Economy of the Congo. Lubaya did not approve of Mobutu's coup in 1965 and refused to join his party, the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution. Nevertheless, he became Mobutu's Minister of Economy. In October 1966 Lubaya introduced a resolution in the Chamber that urged the government to break off diplomatic relations with Portugal‚Äîwhich was suspected of supporting rebellion from Angola‚Äîand close all foreign consulates in the country. It passed unanimously. Meanwhile, Lubaya felt increasingly marginalised by the Lulua paramount chief, Kalamba Mangole. He announced his break from the UNC in a speech and subsequently organised his own party, the Union D√©mocratique Africaine. UNC leader Alphonse Ilunga then allegedly reported Lubaya's opposition to Mobutu's regime. In 1968 Mobutu made an official visit Luluabourg during which he announced that a plot to overthrow his regime was being orchestrated by several Kasai senators.

It is an uncommon coral and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being a \\"vulnerable species\\". Description H. indica forms massive solid colonies, usually hemispherical in shape. The individual corallites, the stony cups in which the polyps sit, are plocoid (surrounded by a wall) in smaller colonies, becoming meandroid (several corallites inside a valley) in larger ones. There are three cycles of septa (stony ridges) inside the calyx and these continue as well-developed costae between the corallites. This is a zooxanthellate species containing microscopic symbiotic algae in the tissues which supplement the nutritional needs of the colony. This gives it a generally pale brown appearance, with contrasting oral discs of bluish-grey. Distribution and habitat H. indica is found in the southwestern Indian Ocean, its range extending from Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique to Madagascar, the Comoros, Mayotte, Mauritius, R√©union and the Seychelles. It inhabits sandy reefs at depths of less than . Status H. indica is an uncommon species of coral that was first described in 1971. Like other corals in the southwestern Indian Ocean, it faces threats from global warming, rising sea temperatures and the increasing occurrence of severe weather conditions. Bleaching events occur with rising sea temperatures and the corals become more prone to coral diseases. Ocean acidification affects corals as does increased siltation from human developments and mechanical damage to reefs from fishing activities.

It is a new method that was developed by researchers from Aarhus University and California Institute of Technology. RNA origami is synthesized by enzymes that fold RNA into particular shapes. The folding of the RNA occurs in living cells under natural conditions. RNA origami is represented as a DNA gene, which within cells can be transcribed into RNA by RNA polymerase. Many computer algorithms are present to help with RNA folding, but none can fully predict the folding of RNA of a singular sequence. Overview 388x388px In nucleic acids nanotechnology, artificial nucleic acids are designed to form molecular components that can self-assemble into stable structures for use ranging from targeted drug delivery to programmable biomaterials. DNA nanotechnology uses DNA motifs to build target shapes and arrangements. It has been used in a variety of situations, including nanorobotics, algorithmic arrays, and sensor applications. The future of DNA nanotechnology is filled with possibilities for applications. The success of DNA nanotechnology has allowed designers to develop RNA nanotechnology as a growing discipline. RNA nanotechnology combines the simplistic design and manipulation characteristic of DNA, with the additional flexibility in structure and diversity in function similar to that of proteins. RNA‚Äôs versatility in structure and function, favorable in vivo attributes, and bottom-up self-assembly is an ideal avenue for developing biomaterial and nanoparticle drug delivery. Several techniques were developed to construct these RNA nanoparticles, including RNA cubic scaffold, templated and non-templated assembly, and RNA origami. The first work in RNA origami appeared in Science, published by Ebbe S. Andersen of Aarhus University. Researchers at Aarhus University used various 3D models and computer software to design individual RNA origami. Once encoded as a synthetic DNA gene, adding RNA polymerase resulted in the formation of RNA origami. Observation of RNA was primarily done through atomic force microscopy, a technique that allows researchers to look at molecules a thousand times closer than would normally be possible with a conventional light microscope. They were able to form honeycomb shapes, but determined other shapes are also possible. Cody Geary, a scholar in the field of RNA origami, described the uniqueness of the method of RNA origami. He stated that its folding recipe is encoded in the molecule itself, and determine by its sequence. The sequence gives the RNA origami both its final shape and movements of the structure as it folds. The primary challenge associated with RNA origami stems from the fact RNA folds on its own and can thus easily tangle itself.  Computer-aided design  Computer- aided design of the RNA origami structure requires three main processes; creating the 3D model, writing the 2D structure, and designing the sequence. First, a 3D model is constructed using tertiary motifs from existing databases. This is necessary to ensure the created structure has feasible geometry and strain. The next process is creating the 2D structure describing the strand path and base pairs from the 3D model. This 2D blueprint introduces sequence constraints, creating primary, secondary, and tertiary motifs. The final step is designing sequences compatible with designed structure. Design algorithms can be used to create sequences that can fold into various structures. thumbDNA and RNA origami double cross over building block comparison. The left panel is the blueprint design of a multi-stranded DX used commonly in DNA origami. The right panel is the design of the single stranded DX by inserting hairpins, kissing loops, and dovetail seam motif. alt=500x500px  The double crossover (DX)  To produce a desired shape, the RNA origami method uses double-crossovers (DX) to arrange the RNA helices in parallel to each other to form a building block. While DNA origami requires the construction of DNA molecules from multiple strands, researchers were able to devise a method in making DX molecules from only one strand for RNA. This was done through adding hairpin motifs to the edges and kissing-loop complexes on internal helices. The addition of more DNA molecules on top of one another creates a junction known as the dovetail seam. This dovetail seam has base pairs that cross between adjacent junctions; thus, the structural seam along the junction becomes sequence-specific. An important aspect of these folding interactions is its folding; the order that interactions form can potentially create a situation in which one interaction blocks another, creating a knot. Because the kissing-loop interactions and dovetail interactions are a half- turn or shorter, they do not create these topological issues. Comparison with DNA origami RNA and DNA nanostructures are used for the organization and coordination of important molecular processes. However, there exist several distinct differences between the fundamental structure and applications between the two. Although inspired by the DNA origami techniques established by Paul Rothemund, the process for RNA origami is vastly different. RNA origami is a much newer process than DNA origami; DNA origami has been studied while approximately a decade now, while the study of RNA origami has only recently begun. In contrast to DNA origami, which involves chemically synthesizing the DNA strands and arranging the strands to form any shape desired with the aid of \\"staple strands\\", RNA origami is made by enzymes and subsequently folds into pre-rendered shapes. RNA is able to fold into unique ways in complex structures due to a number of secondary structural motifs, such as conserved motifs and short structural elements. A major determinant for RNA topology is the secondary-structure interaction, which include motifs such as pseudoknots and kissing loops, adjacent helices stacking on one another, hairpin loops with bulge content, and coaxial stacks. This is largely a result of four different nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U), and ability to form non-canonical base pairs. There also exist more complex and longer-range RNA tertiary interactions. DNA are unable to forms these tertiary motifs and thereby cannot match the functional capacity of RNA in performing more versatile tasks. RNA molecules that are correctly folded can serve as enzymes, due to positioning metal ions at their active sites; this gives the molecules a diverse array of catalytic abilities. Because of this relationship to enzymes, RNA structures can potentially be grown within living cells and used to organize cellular enzymes into distinct groups. Additionally, the DNA origami's molecular breakup is not easily incorporated into the genetic material of an organism. However, RNA origami is capable of being written directly as a DNA gene and transcribed using RNA polymerase. Therefore, while DNA origami requires expensive culturing outside of a cell, RNA origami can be produced in mass, cheap quantities directly within cells just by growing bacteria. The feasibility and cost effectiveness of manufacturing RNA in living cells and combined with the extra functionality of RNA structure is promising for the development of RNA origami. Applications RNA origami is a new concept and has great potential for applications in nanomedicine and synthetic biology. The method was developed to allow new creations of large RNA nanostructures that create defined scaffolds for combining RNA based functionalities. Because of the infancy of RNA origami, many of its potential applications are still in the process of discovery. Its structures are able to provide a stable basis to allow functionality for RNA components. These structures include riboswitches, ribozymes, interaction sites, and aptamers. Aptamer structures allow the binding of small molecules which gives possibilities for construction of future RNA based nanodevices. RNA origami is further useful in areas such as cell recognition and binding for diagnosis. Additionally, targeted delivery and blood-brain barrier passing have been studied. Perhaps the most important future application for RNA origami is building scaffolds to arrange other microscopic proteins and allow them to work with one another.

Karl Joachim fled to his Heiligenberg Castle, leaving government of the principality to his confident Kleiser. He pulled back the first squadron of the landsturm to advance and opposed a decision by the Swabian Reichkreis to make Donaueschingen a rendezvous point for the troops of the kreis. Karl Joachim was generally sympathetic to the French Republic and it is thought that he would have joined the Confederation of the Rhine had he lived until its foundation.s.

Risdiplam is a survival of motor neuron 2-directed RNA splicing modifier. The most common side effects include fever, diarrhea, rash, ulcers of the mouth area, joint pain (arthralgia) and urinary tract infections. Additional side effects for the infantile-onset population include upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation and vomiting. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2020, for the treatment of adults and children two months of age or older. Developed in association with PTC Therapeutics and the SMA Foundation, it is marketed in the US by Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche.  Medical uses  In the United States, risdiplam is indicated to treat people two months of age and older with spinal muscular atrophy.  Adverse effects  The most common side effects include fever, diarrhoea, rash, ulcers of the mouth area, joint pain (arthralgia) and urinary tract infections. Additional side effects for the infantile-onset population include upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation and vomiting. Risdiplam should not be taken together with medications that are multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) substrates because risdiplam may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs.  Pharmacology   Mechanism of action  Risdiplam addresses the underlying cause of SMA: a reduced amount of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The protein is encoded by the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. SMA is caused by mutations in SMN1 that code for inactive forms of the protein. The activity of the SMN2 gene, which produces much smaller quantities of SMN, tends to determine the severity of disease. The compound is a pyridazine derivative that modifies the splicing of SMN2 messenger RNA, resulting in up to a 2-fold increase in the concentration of the functional SMN protein in vivo. Nusinersen, the first drug approved to treat SMA, works in a similar way.  Efficacy  The safety and efficacy of risdiplam in infantile-onset and later-onset SMA has been evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials. In the infantile-onset SMA study, an open-label trial with 41 participants, efficacy was established based on the ability to sit without support for at least five seconds. After 12 months of treatment, 29% of participants were able to sit independently for more than five seconds. After 23 or more months of treatment, 81% of participants were alive without permanent ventilation. Although the study did not perform direct comparisons against children receiving a placebo (inactive treatment), these results compare favourably with the typical course of the untreated disease. The study of later-onset SMA was a randomised controlled trial that enrolled 180 participants, aged between 2 and 25 years, with less severe forms of the disease. Participants treated with risdiplam for 12 months showed improvements in motor function compared to participants given a placebo. Two further clinical studies are underway as of August 2020.  Society and culture  Legal status  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awarded marketing approval to Genentech on August 7, 2020. The FDA earlier granted the application for risdiplam fast track, priority review, and orphan drug designations. Genentech was also awarded a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) awarded risdiplam a priority medicine designation in 2018 and an orphan drug designation in 2019. , Roche has applied for marketing authorisation in Brazil, Chile, China, the European Union, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan.  Names  Risdiplam is the International nonproprietary name (INN).  Compassionate use  Since late 2019, Roche has been offering the drug globally for free for eligible people through an expanded access program.

Life  Joseph Wenzel was the eldest son of prince Joseph zu F√ºrstenberg and Maria Anna von Waldstein. He studied in Stra√üburg and Leipzig. He tried to develop the principality's education and introduced a chancery for it. Teaching was based on the Austrian system and a Jesuit was made head of the Donaueschingen Gymnasium and later the Benedictine Franz Uebelacker was put in charge of the whole school system. He also had a history of the House of the F√ºrstenberg written from the principality's archives. He set up a zuchthaus in H√ºfingen and stopped his father's industrialisation policy and made resettlement difficult, since he saw industry as immoral - he preferred home handiwork such as watchmaking. In 1777 he set up a fire brigade. He was made director of the Swabian College of Reichsgrafen and in 1775 the Holy Roman Emperor appointed him a major general (with his rank effective from 1765). He was also a music lover and was said to have been an excellent cellist. In 1762 he began building a private chapel at his court at Donaueschingen, and bringing a number of foreign musicians to man it. In 1783 he appointed Franz Christoph Neubauer as his musical director.Seifriz S. 364 He employed Ernst Christoph Dressler as Kapellmeister at Wetzlar between 1767 and 1771.

Henceforth, he governed Jin until his death. He was the longest serving zhengqing and zhongjunjiang of Jin.

Ailshie won the World Grand Championship in the Racking Horse World Celebration 6 times, more than any other trainer. Alshie's son Keith and daughter Buffy have also won numerous Championships. Life and career Ailshie was born on November 27, 1948 to Bon Lee and Anna Mae Ailshie and grew up in Greene County, Tennessee. His first job was training young horses for wages of $1 a day. Later he began spending time at a local trainer's stable and learned more about Racking Horses, which became his specialty. Ailshie eventually got a small training facility and began competing in horse shows. He rode and trained Tennessee Walking Horses in addition to Racking Horses. He did not do well because the horses he rode were of average quality and not the exceptional horses needed to win at national shows. In 1987 Ailshie was contacted by Larry and Carolyn Peters, a couple who owned Oil Stock, the previous year's World Grand Champion Racking Horse. At the time, no horse had won the World Grand Championship and returned to win it again. The Peters thought Oil Stock could do so and wanted Ailshie to take over his training from Jackie Barron, who had ridden him the previous year. Ailshie entered Oil Stock in the Racking Horse World Celebration and won the 1987 World Grand Championship. With the Peters' support, Ailshie rented a new 21-acre facility with option to buy and expanded it to ultimately house 55 horses in two barns. Ailshie was Trainer of the Year in 1991, the same year he won the World Grand Championship on Oil Stock's Delight, a son of Oil Stock, who was owned by the Clyde Creech family. The following year he and Oil Stock's Delight repeated their win. Ailshie won his fourth World Grand Championship in 1998, riding The Finalizer for the Clyde Creech family. Four years later in 2002, he rode Unreal, also owned by the Creeches, to the World Grand Championship. His final World Grand Championship was in 2006 on the horse Score at Halftime, owned by Denny Russell.http://rackinghorse.org/Past-World-Grand-Champions-2014.pdf Russell, who once worked as a stablehand for Ailshie, had bought the bay stallion only two weeks prior to the Celebration. Ailshie and his wife Sara had a son, Keith, and daughter, Buffy. Both children followed their father into the horse industry. Keith was Trainer of the Year in 2001, when he won the World Grand Championship on The Pushoverture. Buffy was given the Trainer of the Year award in 1994. Her son Brandon, Kenny's grandson, was at age 4 the youngest person to ride unassisted in the Racking Horse World Celebration. In 2001 the Ailshie family had won over 20 World Championships. Kenny Ailshie died August 22, 2008. He was 59 years old. Ailshie was found dead in his home by a relative early in the morning. He had suffered a gunshot wound, and the police department's preliminary findings indicated that he had committed suicide.

For hundreds of years, the castle was the seat, residence and administrative center of the Archbishop of Nidaros. During the Middle ages The castle is one of the largest medieval stone structures in Scandinavia and the oldest walls are likely from the 13th century. The Archbishops of Nidaros expanded the castle gradually, with great halls and residential areas being built over time. Norway‚Äôs last Archbishop, Olav Engelbrektsson, attempted to make a final stand and defend the castle during the Reformation but eventually fled into exile. Royal property After the abolishment of Roman Catholicism, the castle became royal property where the local lensherre resided. The castle was restored, rebuilt into a residential palace and eventually used more for military purposes, again being expanded considerably. After the Sovereignty Act of 1660, the castle became the seat and residence of the Amtmann. Restoration and current use Substantial archeological excavations were made during the 1950s by Nicolay Nicolaysen and Gerhard Fischer which led to restorations being made at the castle.

He won seven classics between 1849 and 1859, including the Derby on Andover, and was nicknamed \\"King Alfred\\" for his success. Career Day was born into a famous racing family which included his father John Barham Day and several jockey brothers. He was born on 3 November 1830 and baptised on 6 October 1833 at St Edith‚Äôs Church, Monks Kirby, a village in north-eastern Warwickshire. He was educated at Winchester and, in the holidays, rode his father‚Äôs horses on Stockbridge Downs. He rode in the 1843 Cesarewitch, aged just 12 and weighing 4st 7lbs, on a three-year-old called Shocking Mamma, but he first came to prominence at the age of 14, when he won the Goodwood Stakes on Mr Wreford's Flea, at a weight of 6 stone. Then, in 1847 and 1848, he won consecutive Ascot Gold Cups on The Hero, during the period when the race was known as the Emperor's Plate. He went on to ride for some of the most titled people in the land, including Sir Robert Peel and Lords Clifden, Derby and Palmerston. During his career, he was closely associated with the stables of his brothers John and William and it was for them he won his classics. For John, he won four classics, and for William one. His first classic came for John in the 1850 2,000 Guineas. Day was on 5/2 second favourite Pitsford and held on for a neck win. He took another 2,000 Guineas in 1854 on The Hermit, again trained by his brother John, and owned by John Gully. Gully also owned Andover, on which he won the Derby. He was fortunate to win the 1856 Oaks on Mincepie ‚Äì the runner-up, ridden by Robert Sly, should have won easily. He won his final classic, the 1859 2,000 Guineas, for his other brother William, on The Promised Land. The 1854 Ascot Gold Cup gave him one of the greatest races of his career, when he beat Kingston by a head on the famous West Australian. His final ride came at Epsom on 17 April 1863 on a horse called Golden Dust which finished second. He died on 4 January 1868 aged 37. Riding style and personality Day was a \\"natural horseman\\" with \\"exceptionally fine judgement\\" and was a \\"more accomplished rider\\" than his brothers. George Lowe of the Sporting Life described him as \\"absolute perfection in seat and hands, and the way he dropped on an opponent in the last fifty yards could never be forgotten\\". Physically, he was \\"long in the leg, but very perfectly made\\". In common with other members of his family, he was not entirely trustworthy. In the 1859 Derby, he finished third on Trumpeter, beaten half a length and a neck by Musjid and Marionette, a horse he had a part share in. He was threatened with not being able to ride again until he disposed of this share. Alfred enjoyed riding to hounds on his favourite horse, Stonehenge.

First, there will be an examination of the significant contribution of the region's iron, steel, coal, and transportation industries, which helped fuel and move America's industrial growth and development and establish its standing among the nations of the world. Many of the region's cultural resources relate not only to its heritage but to the present and future as well. Second, in addition to the historic sites, the project will use sites within Johnstown and Altoona as focal points for a nine-county tourism promotion program. Tourism development efforts will take advantage of the region's scenic, natural, and recreational areas and will include these resources as integral to the planning process. Much of the project's background is based in a 1985 National Park Service (NPS) study of the region entitled Reconnaissance Survey of Western Pennsylvania Roads and Sites. The NPS study identified the significant cultural resources at Johnstown and Altoona as focal points for new tourism initiatives. 1990 National Park Service (NPS) pamphlet on the AIHP. =East Broad Top Railroad National Historic Landmark = Early on in AIHP planning, Altoona, Pennsylvania, was identified as the focal point around which the story of rail transportation could revolve.

Practice The complainant would stand by the Torah ark, and prevent the removal of the Torah scroll before its ceremonial reading in synagogue. By custom, no person had the right to move him from his place, until one of the community leaders promised to stand by him and take care of his complaint. The complaint could be against either the community or an individual. A description of the practice appears in the Or Zarua (13th century):Or Zarua, Hilchot Shabbat 45 \\"It once happened in Cologne that one complained on the Shabbat when the parsha \\"Emor el hakohanim\\" should have been read, and delayed the prayer and Torah reading the entire day, and when the next [Shabbat] came the rabbi R Eliezer son of R Shimon zt\\"l directed to begin with the parsha \\"Emor el hakohanim\\" and to read it and also [the parsha] \\"Behar Sinai\\" which should have been read that Shabbat.\\" A different form of protest consisted of delaying the prayer between pesukei dezimra and the Shema blessings.

It was built in 1972 during the regime of General Gaafar Nimeiry, from two World War II era bridges. It was re-opened in January 2012 after major repair works following an accident in 2010 which left one lane of the bridge unusable for heavy vehicles. A new bridge, the Freedom Bridge, is expected to be completed in 2018. History The original Nile bridge crossing at Juba was built in 1974 by the Dutch construction company De Groot International under a United Nations programme. On the 15th of March 1974 it was opened by general Gaafar Nimeiry. Up until that time an irregular ferry service was the only way to cross the Nile river for hundreds of miles. After the Sudan civil war the United Nations Commissioner For Refugees asked for help from the Dutch government. The \\"Rijkswaterstaat Directie Bruggen\\" was asked to design a bridge and they came up with a practical design using World War II-era Bailey bridge material. The design for the bridge with six 43 meter spans also included walkways to the left and right, five pillars driven into the granite substrate, the landends and the road leading up to the bridge. More than 600 tons of steel, parts of a floating crane, a drilling rig and a bulldozer and a complete field kitchen and medical unit were transported to the site.The materials were shipped around the Cape and driven into Sudan from neighbouring Kenya. From the first order until the transport leaving the port of Rotterdam took 7 weeks, the transport took 10 weeks, and the total construction time on site was 14 weeks. One reason this tight schedule was a success was the setting up of a sober \\"campsite\\" where the Dutch construction workers lived, working closely with locals to get the job done. Following the collapse of one of the bridges due to hostilities, two replacement 252-metre Mabey Compact 200 bridges were installed in 2006. In 2010, one of these two Juba Nile Bridges was damaged, leaving it completely unusable for heavy vehicles. The bridges provided the only access over the Nile into much of South Sudan, since most goods and foodstuffs imported from Kenya and Uganda passed over the Juba-Nimule Road. As of result of South Sudan's becoming an independent nation in 2011, newly elected president Salva Kiir made the repair of the Juba Nile Bridges one of his government's priorities during the administration's first 100 days. Funding for the repair was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the Accelerated Infrastructure Program, a cooperative agreement with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). A new bridge, the Freedom Bridge is expected to be completed in 2018. A local construction firm started the repair works in December 2010, fully reopening the bridge in mid-January 2012, ahead of the scheduled February completion date.

The new proposed Freedom Bridge funded by (JICA) would be 560 kilometers long with sufficient width for both east and west bound traffic and a pedestrian sidewalk.

The cemetery opened in 1841 and was planned on the model of a rural cemetery. With the relocation of remains from the city's earliest burying ground, the cemetery became the final resting place for many of Springfield's 17th and 18th century pioneer settlers. History The Springfield Cemetery was designed in the landscaped tradition of the rural cemetery, evoking a pastoral, garden environment in an urban setting. The cemetery is located on a plot of land once owned by Martha Ferre and known as ‚ÄòMartha‚Äôs Dingle‚Äô. A dingle is a small wooded valley, a dell. The land was purchased from Alexander Bliss on May 28, 1841 for the purpose of establishing the cemetery. The first burial occurred on September 6, 1841, Early in its history the cemetery was also known as ‚ÄòPeabody Cemetery‚Äô, in recognizer of one of its founders, Rev. William Peabody, a local Unitarian minister. In 1848 the remains of Springfield's earliest European settlers were transferred to the cemetery from the Old Burying Ground by the Connecticut River. Relocated remains included those of Mary Holyoke, daughter of William Pynchon, known as the founder of Springfield. Chapel and columbarium The Dorcas Chapin Chapel was constructed in 1885 with funds donated by the wife of Chester W. Chapin. Designed in the English Gothic style, the chapel contains stained glass windows created by the L.C. Tiffany Company and provides a seating capacity for fifty. Soldier's Rest, Civil War monument ‚ÄòSoldier‚Äôs Rest' is a Civil War monument that was dedicated in 1877 and depicts a Union private at rest. The funds used to commission the monument were raised by women of the city who, in 1862, had developed the Soldier‚Äôs Rest Association to support the needs of soldiers, returning veterans and their families. The statue stands above the Soldiers plot, with graves both at its base and more below a descending slope. At least 200 Civil War soldiers are buried in the cemetery.

He played college basketball for the University of Albany. College career Hooley played for the Albany Great Danes from 2011 to 2016. He was a standout player for the team, earning All- America East honors three times and the America East Tournament Reggie Lewis Most Outstanding Performer honors in 2014 and 2015. While attending the University at Albany, SUNY Hooley finished as the America East Conference men's basketball scholar athlete of the year twice, following the 2013‚Äì14 and 2015-16 seasons.

Sophomore Campaign  During 2013-14 season for Albany, Hooley would start 32 of the 33 games he appeared in averaging 35.1 minutes per game. The only game he would not start would be on Senior Night, when Albany coach Will Brown elected to start all seniors in the Great Danes‚Äô final regular season home game. Hooley would reach a new career high for points in a game several times throughout the season, peaking with a 30-point outing as Albany defeated UMBC in the first round of the America East Tournament. In total, Hooley would accumulate 10 games in which he scored at least 20 points and 25 games in which he scored in double figures, on his way to averaging a team high 15.5 points per contest.

His mother, Sue Hooley, would pass away after a 4 1/2 year battle with colon cancer on 30 January 2015. Hooley, who would later state \\"I always played for her before all of this\\", would eventually continue to do just that. On 13 February 2015 he returned to the court for Albany, recording his 1000th career point in a six-point Great Dane's victory at NJIT. With only five games remaining in the regular season, Hooley would ease his way back into the rotation for Albany, averaging 24.2 minutes per game while coming off of the bench. In a 60-58 America East Conference Men's Basketball Tournament semifinal victory over the University of New Hampshire Hooley would come off of the bench and record a game high 21 points in 35 minutes of action. With the Albany Great Danes men's basketball program once again facing the Stony Brook Seawolves in the America East Tournament Finals, Hooley would hit Albany's only three pointer of the game with 1.6 seconds left to give Albany their third consecutive America East Conference Men's Basketball Tournament championship in a 51-50 triumph. When asked about the shot after the game, Hooley referred to his late mother Sue stating \\"When you've got angels watching you, you can do anything\\" Hooley finished his Junior season with 329 points, 72 rebounds and 56 assists in 781 minutes, while winning his second consecutive America East Tournament Reggie Lewis Most Outstanding Player award.

W. Hornung, and the first appearance of the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, and his companion and biographer, Bunny Manders. The story was first published in June 1898 by Cassell's Magazine.Rowland, page 282 The story was also included in the collection The Amateur Cracksman, published by Methuen & Co. Ltd in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1899.Rowland, page 283. Plot Part one \\"Bunny\\" Manders returns to the flat in the Albany where he just lost over two hundred pounds in a game of baccarat, earlier that evening. The famous cricketer A. J. Raffles, who lives there and who Bunny once fagged for at school, greets him. Bunny confesses to Raffles that he is hopelessly in debt. The checks he wrote for Raffles and the others are worthless. When Raffles does not express sympathy, Bunny tries to leave. Raffles detains him. Agitated, Bunny raises a pistol to his head to kill himself. However, Raffles unexpectedly admires the bold move, which stymies Bunny. Raffles promises to help Bunny. He takes away Bunny's gun. However, Raffles is also hard-up; he and Bunny must now work together to find income. Bunny is astonished, but eagerly agrees to the partnership. Bunny recalls how he had helped Raffles break curfew at school; Raffles remembers this also. Raffles leaves with Bunny, ostensibly to ask for money from a friend of his. Part two Raffles brings Bunny to the unnamed friend's flat in Bond Street, which sits above a jeweler's shop. Bunny is reluctant, but with his own key Raffles leads him into the dark flat. Raffles takes Bunny quietly upstairs, then lights a match. Abruptly Bunny sees that the house is empty. The truth is revealed: there is no friend. Raffles is actually planning to burgle the shop of the jeweler, named Danby, underneath. Though Bunny is shocked to learn that Raffles is a burglar, he reaffirms his commitment to Raffles. Raffles takes Bunny to the cellar, then across an outside yard to a door that Raffles forces open with a jimmy. They ascend more stairs, to another door. Raffles uses a brace and drill bit to cut around the lock. He slips his arm through and picks the iron gate behind the door with a skeleton key. Next is an empty lobby, separated from the shop by an iron curtain. The curtain will be noisy to remove. Raffles asks Bunny to return to the empty room above, and beat the floor to communicate when the street is clear. Bunny signals when a policeman and a watchman pass by outside. Later, Bunny returns to Raffles, who has pocketed some of the shop's valuables, some port, and cigars. They clean themselves in the shop's lavatory and leave. At the Albany, Raffles cajoles Bunny into promising to stand by Raffles for future crimes. Publication history thumbIllustration for \\"In the Chains of Crime\\" in the June 1898 issue of Cassell's Magazine. When printed in Cassell's Magazine, the story was renamed to \\"In the Chains of Crime\\". It included an introduction clarifying that Bunny was presently a prisoner, as well as an illustration showing Bunny Manders being dragged by a skeleton in cloak and hood. The magazine was hesitant to publish a story that featured criminals as the protagonists, and these changes were intended to make it clear that it was a cautionary tale. Cassell's would reprint this same illustration in each of its six Raffles issues.Rowland, page 119. Adaptations Television The story was adapted into the first episode of the Raffles television series, with Anthony Valentine as A. J. Raffles and Christopher Strauli as Bunny Manders. The episode, titled \\"The First Step\\", first aired on 25 February 1977. Radio BBC Radio adapted the story into the first episode of its Raffles radio series, \\"The Ides of March\\", which first aired on 20 October 1985. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The episode closely follows the plot of the original story, with some changes, including: * In the original story, Raffles hosted the game of baccarat. In the radio drama, the game is hosted by a different man in another room in the Albany, and Raffles takes no part. * In the original story, Bunny threatens to kill himself with a pistol. In the radio drama, Bunny goes to Waterloo Bridge with the aim of throwing himself into the Thames. * In the drama only, Raffles injures his hands with the iron curtain. * In the drama, the constable and watchman block the exit, and Bunny uses a rope to lower the injured Raffles and himself down a window, similar to how he had lowered and raised the rope for Raffles at school. \\"The Ides of March\\" was adapted as the first episode of Raffles, the Gentleman Thief, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre. The episode first aired in 2004.

Riding career Sherwood was born in Epsom in 1835, to trainer Ralph, who would go on to train the 1838 Derby winner Amato. He was one of six children. Early career success came in 1853, when he won a French Oaks/Derby double on Jouvence, which was trained by his father. He then won the 1855 Derby on Wild Dayrell. The horse had been bred, owned and trained by people with no racing experience, and thus was not highly regarded. However, after being sent to professional trainer, John Rickaby, the horse began to shine, and ten days before the Derby, Sherwood rode him in a trial which he won comfortably. As word spread, the stable became subject to several attempts at sabotage and bribery, but these were staved off. In the race itself, Wild Dayrell, won easily by a length. A photograph of the horse was taken in 1856 and is the earliest known photo of a Derby winner. Training career In 1863, Robert, together with his brother Tom, moved to Hong Kong for several years to ride and train for the merchant Robert Jardine and others, taking the Ascot Gold Cup winner Buckstone with him. On returning to England, he was out of racing for a while, before opening his own stable at Exeter House, Newmarket. There he trained St. Gatien, who dead-heated with Harvester in the 1884 Derby. St Gatien also won the Cesarewitch under the heaviest weight ever carried by a three-year-old. With Florence successful in the Cambridgeshire that year, Day completed the Autumn Double. Robert also trained the 1889 Oaks winner L'Abbesse de Jouarre for Lord Randolph Churchill. Other successes included the 1887 Northumberland Plate with Exmoor, the 1890 Goodwood Cup with Philomel, and the 1891 City and Suburban Handicap and Kempton Park Jubilee with Nunthorpe. He built a new yard, St Gatien House, in Newmarket, which is still in operation today. Personal life Sherwood married Julie Charlotte Louise Vodoz in 1858. She gave birth to a son, Robert Louis Voduz Sherwood, at Epsom in 1860, who would also become a trainer. Julie died in 1867, and Sherwood remarried a lady called Elizabeth. He suffered an apoplectic fit at Newmarket on 8 October 1894 while supervising horses, and died at 1.30am on 12 October, leaving an estate of ¬£13,017 to Elizabeth. She died in 1913. Robert Louis took over St Gatien Lodge.

Encouraged by her family to become educated, she attended the University of Algiers and completed training as a midwife. During her schooling, she joined the Algerian Independence Movement, which sought to free the country from French colonial rule. Using her work as a midwife to make contacts with other women, she rallied them to the nationalist cause and founded the first women's rights organization in the country. As part of the militant group, she was exiled, arrested and then fled to Tunis, Tunisia in 1955. While living there, she was one of the founders of the Algerian Red Crescent Society. At the end of the Independence War she became a journalist, returned to Algiers and studied political science. She served as organizer of the National Union of Algerian Women and was successful in creating family planning centers. Frustrated at an inability to change the family code to prohibit polygamy, she retired from politics in 1969. Early life Mamia A√Øssa was born in 1922 in Haouz village, near Bensekrane in the Tlemcen Province of Algeria to Elabdli A√Øssa. When she was four years old her family had to flee because her father was wanted by the police. They moved to Oujda, Morocco, but as her father was a supporter of Ben Badis they moved again to Ghazaouet. Both parents were supportive of women's education and A√Øssa, after completing her primary education was sent as a boarder to the high school in Mascara in 1935. During that time, she became interested in women's rights and wrote a paper on the emancipation of Muslim women. When she graduated in 1942, her father took her to the only university in Algeria to enroll in midwifery classes. They arrived almost simultaneously with the invasion of Algiers during the North African Campaign of World War II. Postponing her schooling, they left the capital and she taught for a year before returning to school and completed her training as a midwife. Career When she had finished her training, A√Øssa opened the first women's clinic in the Casbah of Algiers. During her studies, she had joined the Muslim Student's Association of North Africa () and became involved in the Algerian People's Party (). Taking part in peaceful demonstrations against the French colonial administration in 1945, she worked with Mimi Belahouel and Kheira Bouayed to smuggle the wounded protesters to safe havens after the French retaliation. In 1947, A√Øssa became vice president of AEMAN and was responsible for recruiting women to join the PPA and fight for national independence. Her future husband, Abderezak Chentouf was president of the student association. She worked alongside Salima Belhaffaf, Nassima Hablal, Nefissa Hafiz, , Malika Mefti, Z'hor Reguimi, and Fatima Zekal, organizing women's cells to the cause. Soon thereafter, the PPA dissolved and the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTDL) replaced it. In 1947, A√Øssa and Chentouf married. Later that year, she and Hamoud founded the , the first organization for Algerian women. Reaffirming Arab Muslim culture, as opposed to French culture, and accepting the differences of men and women based on biological difference, the organization aimed to increase the political awareness of Algerian women and offer assistance to those whose spouses had been arrested or detained by the French government. Chentouf became president of the association and Hamoud served as secretary general. In addition to assisting dissidents, the organization encouraged education for boys and girls, distributed food and goods to the poor, and provided aid to those who were sick. Chentouf made many contacts to the cause through her midwifery services. In 1954, Chentouf joined the National Liberation Front (NLF), after a split occurred in the leadership of MTDL. The following year, she was exiled and remained outside the country for several months during the declared state of emergency. When she returned, Chentouf joined Baya Larab and Hamoud, resuming their agitation, but she was arrested. Upon her release, because of intense surveillance, Chentouf went to Tunisia, where she was joined several months later by her husband. She became part of the group responsible for the creation of the Algerian Red Crescent Society in 1957. Because the NLF did not trust the French Red Cross and the terms of the Geneva Conventions were not recognized because of the internal nature of the conflict, activists hoped to gain both humanitarian aid and gain international acceptance by becoming members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent. The first offices of the organization were established in Tangier, Morocco and Tunis, where Chentouf and her husband remained until 1962. In 1961, Chentouf embarked on a career in journalism and was sent as a delegate to the Afro-Asian Women's Conference by the FLN, which was held in Cairo. Upon the conclusion of the war, the couple returned to Algiers and Chentouf entered the University of Algiers to study political science. When she graduated in 1965, she was in the first class promoted after independence. The following year, Chentouf was asked by Houari Boumediene, head of the Revolutionary Council, to organize the National Union of Algerian Women (). The aims of the organization were to hold a conference to address family planning and change the civil code. In 1967, UNFA opened the first family planning center in the maternity ward at Mustapha Hospital. They had much less success in modifying the family code as there was extreme opposition to abolishing polygamy, and in 1969, Chentouf resigned from UNFA and politics. Death and legacy In 2007, a documentary Mamya Chentouf, militante de la premi√®re heure (Mamya Chentouf, activist of the first hour) was produced by Baya El Hachemi, to retell Chentouf's life story. In 2010, it was shown at the Algerian Cultural Center in Paris. Chentouf died on 10 October 2012, in Algiers. Two months after her death a tribute to her memory was hosted by the Wassila-Avife Network at the Palais de la Culture d'Algiers to recognize her contributions to independence and women's rights.

At night, Olivia and Jake Ballard (Scott Foley) discuss about their uncommitted affair. The next morning, Ballard investigates Joshua Stewart (Andrew Tinpo Lee), Madeline's missing father, and discovers he is a CIA agent who helps the Nation several times as an undercover, so his vanishing is something to worry about. Jake suggests they kill him in order to prevent any type of betray since he could've been caught by terrorist and such. Cyrus meets with Senator Diane Greenwald (Bess Armstrong) to talk about the Vargas bill, and she reveals that she opposes to the bill because it should be a Democratic rather than a Republican product, as well as prompting Cyrus to look forward to a future where he is President, and not Pope and Grant's doormat. Quinn omits to Madeline the fact that her father is a spy, and Huck (Guillermo D√≠az) thinks ahead and visits Olivia, already knowing that she and Jake planned Joshua's death, and states that his daughter will need a body to bury. However, the next morning, President Grant summits Jake in the Oval to ask him about Joshua's rescue, which was planned by Olivia, much to Jake's dismay.

History Straddling the boundary between Sampaloc and Santa Mesa, the interchange was originally the Rotonda de Sampaloc, a roundabout which at the turn of the 20th century marked the boundary between Manila's urban core and its suburbs. At the center was the Carriedo Fountain, built in 1884 to commemorate the inauguration of Manila's waterworks system. However, in 1976 the Rotonda de Sampaloc was cleared due to traffic congestion, and the Carriedo Fountain was moved, first to the headquarters of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System in Diliman, Quezon City, and eventually to Plaza Santa Cruz in downtown Manila, where it remains today. The eventual construction of the interchange was driven by the need to alleviate continuing severe traffic congestion along the Circumferential Road 2 corridor. In February 1990, the administration of President Corazon Aquino signed an agreement with Japan to fund the construction of two interchanges, including the Nagtahan Interchange, using Japanese official development assistance funds. The project was later certified as urgent by the Aquino administration, which allowed it to proceed quickly with construction, and the near-¬•1.6 billion (‚Ç±257.58 million) interchange began construction in May 1991. The completed interchange was opened to traffic in March 1992, ten months ahead of schedule. A subsequent study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency issued in 2001 shows that in the nine years since the Nagtahan Interchange was constructed, traffic flows improved considerably despite the doubling in the number of cars on Metro Manila roads in that same time frame. However, there were concerns that underinvestment in its maintenance would be detrimental for any major rehabilitation work to take place when the need arises. Artwork In 2013, students from various universities in Metro Manila re-touched the murals of prominent national heroes which were painted along the stone column of the Nagtahan Interchange. The project was undertaken by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, where it aimed to create awareness of Filipino history and culture.

It has become popular for learning riders. It was changed little over its two decade production run.  Mechanical details   Engine  This bike was built to handle both racing and harsh terrain riding. The engine was a single cylinder air-cooled system. The compression ratio was 9.4:1 and the bore and stroke were 2.1 inches by 1.8 inches. The whole configuration adds up to about a 10 hp output. This gave the bike a friendly power curve but also plenty of torque and power for the beginner or smaller sized rider.  Aesthetics  Debuting in orange in 1985, the color of the XR100 changed over the years as following; 1987 white front and rear fenders, and other subtle color changes followed and years to come. Since the bike debuted, the most notable difference between it and the standard XR100 is the use of the single coil-over adjustable Honda Pro-Link swing-arm suspension system instead of the older twin single coil-over shocks. The gas tank shifted from metal to plastic, design of the plastics changed slightly over the years.  Racing Heritage  With its high revving motor, the XR100 became a favorite for motor swaps into various two-stroke mini bikes, such as the YZ80 and KX80 in the 1980s, and later the CR85 in the 1990s and 2000s.

Geography  Jarvisfield is bounded by the Coral Sea to the east, the Burdekin River to the south and Plantation Creek to the north. The locality is flat low-lying land (below 10 metres above sea level). Most of the locality is freehold and used for growing sugarcane. However, the most eastern coastal parts of the locality are not developed and are at risk of coastal erosion from storms and from sea levels rising. A cane tramway through the locality carries harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mills, Pioneer Sugar Mill and Kalamia Sugar Mill, both located in Brandon.  History  The Budekin River was explored by John Clements Wickham in in 1839. In 1859 the lower Burdekin River was explored by Captain Sinclair and James Gordon from Bowen. After the Separation of Queensland in December 1859, the newly established Queensland Parliament sent further expeditions to assess the potential of the Burdekin River for settlement, leading to the area being officially opened for settlement from 1 January 1861, leading to the \\"Great Land Grab\\". One of the larger properties established was Jarvisfield Station owned by Robert Towns and Alexander Stewart, both of Sydney. The present day locality takes its name from the Jarvisfield Station (although it is not as large in area as that pastoral run). In 1863‚Äì1864 there was an attempt to establish a port called Wickham on the north bank of the Burdekin River near the Jarvisfield Estate, despite Captain Wickham himself being dubious as to its viability noting that the river had two entrances, both very shallow, and that the river banks were vulnerable to flooding. However, the project proceeded but ultimately failed due to constant problems with mosquitoes, difficulties in navigating to upper reaches of the Burdekin through much of the year and problems with coastal erosion from storms. Initially Jarvisfield Station was used for cattle grazing. In 1869, Alexander Stuart attempted to grow sugar as did a number of other local farmers but inconsistent rainfall was a problem, so cattle grazing was the most common use of the land in the area. It was only when it was realised that the freshwater lagoons in the Burdekin Delta could be used for irrigation that the reliable cultivation of sugarcane became possible and far more profitable than cattle grazing. It was possible for a farmer to make a good living from a small block of land with sugarcane compared with a large parcel of land needed to make a good living from cattle. This raised the value of land and larger estates, such as Jarvisfield Station, were subdivided. This brought more farmers into the area and with them the extra labour needed to grown sugarcane. This increase in population led to the development of towns and service industries in the Burdekin district. Jarvisfield State School opened on 29 March 1915. It celebrated its centenary on 3 October 2015.  Education  Jarvisfield State School is a primary (P-6) school for boys and girls operated by the Queensland Government on the corner of Rita Island Road and Loram Road. In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 13 students with 2 teachers (1 full-time equivalent) and 5 non-teaching staff (2 full-time equivalent). The school opened on 29 March 1915.

The seawall itself is made of slag. In this seawall, are large concentrations of lead, antimony, arsenic, and copper. The lead in particular has contaminated the nearby soil and surface water. The slag deposits are a by-product from NL Industries (formerly known as National Lead Company), a lead smelting company, dumping its wastes in the Raritan River. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) investigated the area and found large concentrations of metals to be dangerous to human health. The NJDEP called the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate the area further, which resulted in some of the slag being physically removed and the toxic areas being fenced off. Origins Located in Laurence Harbor is the Old Bridge Waterfront Park, a boardwalk where the Superfund site is located. The cause of the Superfund site is a lead smelting company, National Lead Company, which currently goes by the name NL Industries. NL Industries specializes in lead-based ‚Äúquality- of-life‚Äù products such as paint and metal bearings. The factories belonging to NL Industries have led to several lawsuits due to environmental pollution, similarly to this Superfund site. Community history The Raritan Bay is located in Laurence Harbor, an unincorporated community in Old Bridge, New Jersey and runs to Sayreville. Old Bridge Waterfront Park is a boardwalk in Laurence Harbor where the focus of this Superfund site is located. The boardwalk attracts tourists and locals alike for several beachside activities. These activities range from swimming and fishing to walking on the beachfront. Company history NL Industries, formerly known as National Lead Company, is a lead smelting company, created in Philadelphia and currently located in Dallas, Texas. Founded in 1772, NL Industries specialized in lead solder, piping, and metal bearings which eventually changed to lead paint in the 1920s. The experimentation of titanium dioxide gave NL Industries a foothold in the paint industry. In later years, the company sold products to aid in the manufacturing of castor oil, rayon, airplanes, and oil drills. Due to multiple lawsuits because of environmental hazards created by NL Industries factories, NL Industries changed its name from the National Lead Company to NL Industries. Superfund designation Elevated amounts of lead, antimony, arsenic, and copper were found by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Due to the concentrated amount along the shore of Laurence Harbor and Sayreville, the NJDEP called the EPA to evaluate the site. The EPA detected high levels of lead in the slag, soil, and water. Due to the concentration of harmful metals, action to clean up the site was recommended. State intervention The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, or NJDEP for short, have identified several dangerous heavy metals at the Raritan Bay Slag Site. These heavy metals include elevated concentrations of lead, antimony, arsenic, and copper. In addition to the location in Laurence Harbor, another area of concern was found on the Sayreville waterfront. The western jetty at the Cheesequake Creek inlet and waterfront area is the specific location of the area of concern. The NJDEP requested for the EPA to evaluate the Raritan Bay Slag site. National intervention The EPA evaluated the Raritan Bay Slag site in 2009. After confirming the findings of the NJDEP, the EPA‚Äôs results showed elevated levels of lead in the slag, soil, sediment and surface water. Several locations along the shoreline were marked as ‚Äúdangers to public health and safety‚Äù. Remedial action and cleanup as soon as possible was recommended by the EPA. Health and environmental hazards The NJDEP and EPA‚Äôs observations have shown excessive amounts of lead, arsenic, antimony, and copper in the site. Lead is extremely dangerous, lethal if ingested, and can cause developmental issues for children and fetuses. Arsenic increases the chance of cancer, however the amount of arsenic present in the site is too small to cause serious human harm. Antimony and copper are not known to harm humans, but they are unnaturally abundant in the site. Lead Ingestion of lead at the correct dosage can kill. Accumulation of lead in the body can damage the gastrointestinal and nervous system, kidneys, or red blood cells. Children, infants, and fetuses are more affected by lead than adults. Lead can cause learning difficulties, stunt physical and mental growth, or threaten fetal development. The amount of lead needed to cause these effects is unknown as the effects can occur due to incredibly small amounts. Arsenic, antimony, and copper Arsenic does not give as nearly as severe effects to the human body when compared to lead. The most arsenic can possibly effect a person is by slightly increasing their chance of getting cancer. However, the small quantity of arsenic in the site location is not enough to harm a person. Antimony and copper have no known symptoms due to overexposure although it is worth mentioning that there are unnatural amounts of antimony and copper at the site. Cleanup The slag and other hazardous materials along the shoreline were recommended by the EPA to be physically removed from the area. Contaminated soil and surface water was also removed and treated. The excavation process began in November 2016. The site is not fully cleaned up yet, however the process should be completed in late fall 2017. Initial cleanup Initial inspection of the site took place from September 2010 to June 2011. After the elevated quantities of heavy metals in the lag, soil, sediment, and surface water were identified, the EPA published a Record of Decision for the site in May 2013. Excavation, dredging and off-site disposal were the EPA‚Äôs preferred method of cleanup. Slag, battery casings, and any other polluted material along with the soil the materials have contaminated would be dug up or dredged and disposed of at off-site facilities. The surface water would be monitored to test if the removal increases any risks. Current status In September 2016, $7,000,000 of federal funding was awarded to the region. The Superfund State Contract was signed in July 2016. Field work officially began in November 2016. Site cleanup is estimated to be completed in late fall of 2017.

A performance lasts about 30 minutes. History Enescu began composing his Second Cello Sonata in Tescani, probably in June 1935, and finished it the following November. The first and second movements were completed in Bucharest on 8 August and 12 September, respectively. The third and fourth movements were completed in Vienna, on 27 September and 30 November . The sonata is dedicated to Pablo Casals and was premiered at the √âcole Normale de Musique in Paris on 4 March 1936, by the cellist Diran Alexanian with Enescu at the piano . The opus number 26, which Enescu assigned to this work, is chronologically appropriate relative to the preceding Third Violin Sonata, Op. 25, and the following Third Orchestral Suite, Op. 27. What is odd is that he chose to include with it the very much earlier Sonata in F Minor (1898), written before the Second Violin Sonata, Op. 6, publishing the two cello sonatas as a pair: Op. 26, Nos. 1 and 2 . Analysis The Sonata is in four movements * Allegro moderato ed amabile * Allegro agitato, non troppo mosso * Andantino cantabile, senza lentezza * Final a la roumaine, Allegro sciolto Although the broad outline of the work follows the classical model of a four-movement sonata, Enescu‚Äôs working-out of the internal structures of the movements is not easy to fit to the conventional schemes. A certain mobility in the transformation of the musical material reaches solutions similar to those of the Classical era, but interpreted and altered according to the composer‚Äôs personal taste . The first movement is relatively unproblematic, cast in a sonata-allegro form. The first theme is expansive, and falls into two large parts, with the piano and cello in a generally heterophonic relationship. Its structure is complicated by being stated twice, separated by a developmental passage on the second part of the theme. The secondary, rather Schumanesque theme is assigned mainly to the piano, with occasional pizzicato interjections by the cello. The development is fairly conventional, but the recapitulation is unusually concise, and is followed by a lengthy coda . The structure of the second movement is much more problematic. While one analyst sees it as a somewhat blurred ternary scherzo , another argues for \\"a new original structure, superimposing a sonata-form‚Äîwith exposition, development and recapitulation‚Äîto the principles of the fugue\\" (, quoted in ), while yet another sees it as nearly a textbook example of an ABA scherzo, though including the cyclical return of nearly the entire main theme of the first movement . The third, slow movement may be seen as a theme and variations or, alternatively, as a dreamlike sonata form . The rhythm throughout the movement is in the \\"parlando-rubato\\" style characteristic of Romanian folk music . The finale is sometimes claimed to be a rondo, at other times a sonata-rondo, whereas Pascal Bentoiu maintains that it \\"contains all the elements to qualify without hesitation for a sonata form\\" .

It aired in the United States on Fox on October 8, 2017. This episode is dedicated in memory of Tom Petty who guest appeared in \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\". Plot After Lisa has a recurring dream involving the lockers at Springfield Elementary, Homer and Marge decide to seek a therapist. Due to Homer having used all their insurance covered counseling sessions for a stupid reason, they take her to see a shrink-in-training at Springfield Community College. There, a therapist student suggests that Lisa draw her typical day. Back home, Lisa is frustrated at her bad drawings, so Marge helps her drawing while she explains her feelings. Lisa takes the drawings to the college, but loses them on the steps. Comic Book Guy's unhappy wife Kumiko collects them and sells them at The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop as a graphic novel called \\"Sad Girl.\\" Lisa and Marge complain to Comic Book Guy and Kumiko. But when they see that people are buying the books, Lisa is happy and stops Kumiko from burning them. Marge and Lisa get commissioned by Kumiko to do a sequel and they bond. At the Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con, a panel is held by Roz Chast, with Alison Bechdel and Marjane Satrapi, but the public lauds Lisa and hurts Marge's feelings by not wanting to listen to her talk about her drawing work. When Marge tells Lisa she wants more credit, Lisa becomes defensive and they have an argument which ends with them dissolving their partnership. Soon thereafter, they meet a theatrical director named Guthrie Frenel who has come by the house and wants to make an avant garde Broadway show of the books. When the play opens, the play developed by Guthrie focuses Marge's work and makes a point of giving Lisa/Sad Girl little mention. Lisa is upset and talks to the therapist about it, getting an analogy on parenting that's inspired by the therapist having just had a baby after an affair with her faculty advisor. At the premiere of Frenel's play, Marge finally notices that the play is terrible and also insulting to Lisa, and feels bad about it. She draws Lisa's face on a spotlight and shines it on the stage, enraging Guthrie, which causes a chain reaction that ruins the show. During the end credits, Marge presents Maggie her comic \\"The Adventures of Sad Girl's Mom.\\" Marge still thinks it's good, but Maggie is disappointed with it. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ stating, \\"'Springfield Splendor'‚Äôs journey has a lot along the way to perk up the eyes and ears of the jaded Simpsons viewer. The plot, about Lisa and Marge teaming up to tell Lisa‚Äôs American Splendor- esque miserablist life story in graphic novel form, allows for an arresting visual style in those scenes where Marge‚Äôs pencils are animated to illustrate their comic vision. Accompanied as the stylized images are by a melancholy jazz score (as any real Lisa narrative would be), these sequences have a life of their own that suggests how well the mother-daughter team has captured what‚Äôs going on in Lisa‚Äôs head every damned day in the yahoo-infested halls of Springfield Elementary. The sequences‚Äô lovely and evocative mix of the internal and external are impressive without being flashy, less a gimmick than an expansion of the show‚Äôs capabilities. They‚Äôre super.\\" \\"Springfield Splendor\\" scored a 2.2 rating with an 8 share and was watched by 5.25 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.
