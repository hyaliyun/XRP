Bertoni assumed the religious name of \\"Giacomo Filippo\\" upon being admitted to the Servites and he became the procurator of the convent he lived in from his appointment until his death. The approval of the late priest's \\"cultus\\" (or popular devotion) on 22 July 1761 acted as Pope Clement XIII's conferral of beatification upon the late priest while the town of Faenza - where Bertoni hailed from - appointed him as its patron in 1762. Life Andrea Bertoni was born in Faenza to poor parents in 1454. He often frequented the churches in his area during his childhood and possessed an ardent devotion to the Mass. He joined the Servite Order in 1453 at the tender age of nine and was later ordained to the priesthood following the successful completion of his theological and philosophical studies that were required for ordination. He was made the procurator of his convent in Faenza from the appointment until his death. Bertoni assumed the religious name of \\"Giacomo Filippo\\" upon making his profession. He dreaded offending God so underwent frequent confession. He also - on one occasion - healed an ill monk after making the sign of the Cross over the latter three times. His first biographer was Nicol√≤ Borghese who Bertoni once cured; Borghese wrote a chronicle of the priest's life three months before the latter died. On 24 May 1483 he visited his fellow Servites and asked for their prayers due to his ill health. Bertoni died on 25 May 1483 as he recited the Divine Office and kissed a Crucifix that he was holding in his hands. His remains were re-interred in the Manfredi Chapel on 15 April 1594 while his remains were re-interred once more to the altar of Saint Charles Borromeo in the Faenza Cathedral after the church he was in before was damaged in November 1944 due to World War II. Beatification Bertoni was beatified - on 22 July 1761 - after Pope Clement XIII approved of the late priest's \\"cultus\\" (or popular following and devotion) while Bertoni was selected as a patron of Faenza in a decree that the council of the town issued on 14 July 1762.

It facilitates not only the monitoring and control of the nanosatellite software applications, but also the interaction with the nanosatellite platform. This is achieved by using the latest CCSDS standards for monitoring and control, and by exposing services for common peripherals among nanosatellite platforms. Furthermore, it is capable of managing the software on-board by exposing a set of services for software management. In simple terms, it introduces the concept of apps in space that can be installed, and then simply started and stopped from ground. Apps can retrieve data from the nanosatellite platform through a set of well- defined Platform services. Additionally, it includes CCSDS standardized services for monitoring and control of apps. An NMF App can be easily developed, distributed, and deployed on a spacecraft. There is a Software Development Kit (SDK) in order to facilitate the development of software based on the NanoSat MO Framework. This SDK allows quick development of software that is capable of running on ground and/or in space. The reference implementation of the NanoSat MO Framework will be used in ESA's OPS-SAT mission.  Architecture Specifications  The NanoSat MO Framework is built upon the CCSDS Mission Operations services Architecture and therefore it inherits its properties such as being transport-agnostic, multi-domain, and programming language independent. Additionally, it is independent from any specific nanosatellite platform. The software framework includes 5 sets of MO services. The first 3 are Standardized by the CCSDS and the other 2 are bespoke interfaces: *COM services *Common services *Monitor and Control services *Platform services *Software Management services The NanoSat MO Framework is split in two segments. First, the ‚ÄúGround Segment‚Äù just like in any traditional spacecraft system. Second, the ‚ÄúNanoSat Segment‚Äù which is the equivalent of the space segment but because the target of the framework are nanosatellites, it contains a more specialized name. An NMF Composite is a software component that consists of interconnected services specialized for a certain purpose and to be deployed on the NanoSat segment or Ground segment. The NMF Composites are based on SOA‚Äôs service composability design principle that encourages reusing existing services and combine them together to build an advanced solution. The naming convention for the NMF Composites is: MO The defined set of NMF Composites are: *NanoSat MO Monolithic *NanoSat MO Supervisor *NanoSat MO Connector *Ground MO Adapter *Ground MO Proxy The objective of the NMF Composites is to provide prebuilt components that allow quick development of new software solutions that are interoperable in end-to- end scenarios. The NanoSat MO Framework defines an NMF App as an on-board software application based on the NanoSat MO Framework. An NMF App can be developed by integrating the NanoSat MO Connector component into the software application. NMF Apps are expected to be started, monitored, stopped, and/or killed by the NanoSat MO Supervisor component.  Reference Implementation in Java  The reference implementation provides a concrete implementation of the specifications of the NanoSat MO Framework in the Java programming language. It was used to discover problems, errors and ambiguities in the interfaces. The implementation is mature and the first version is available online. This reference implementation also serves as the basis for the tools of the Software Development Kit which can be used by other developers. The reference implementation in Java is currently maintained by the European Space Agency and it is available online for free (on GitHub) under an open-source license. This license allows anyone to reuse the software for the nanosatellite mission without any major restrictions.  NMF SDK  The NanoSat MO Framework Software Development Kit (NMF SDK) is a set of development tools and software source code that facilitate the creation of applications with the NanoSat MO Framework. It is composed of: *Demos for NMF Ground software development *Demos of NMF Apps *Consumer Test Tool (CTT) *NMF Package Assembler *NMF Playground (with a satellite simulator) *Documentation The NMF SDK is the starting point for a software developer willing to develop applications with the NMF.  NMF Missions  An NMF Mission is a concrete implementation of the NanoSat MO Framework for a specific mission. The NMF Mission development includes activities such as implementing the Platform services and the NanoSat MO Supervisor for the specific platform. If a custom or tailored transport is used for the mission, then the transport binding must be implemented and additionally, integrated with the Ground MO Proxy for protocol bridging. The following NMF Mission implementations were implemented: Software Simulator, and OPS-SAT = Software Simulator = The Software Simulator was developed to be part of the NMF SDK in order to provide simulated data towards the NMF Apps during the development and testing phases. = OPS-SAT = An implementation for ESA's OPS-SAT mission was developed in order to validate the software framework in-flight. OPS-SAT is a CubeSat currently being built by the European Space Agency (ESA) and it is intended to demonstrate the improvements in mission control capabilities that will arise when satellites can fly more powerful on-board computers. For example, OPS-SAT experimenters can use the NMF SDK for quick development of software capable of running on ground and/or in space. The NanoSat MO Framework apps are able to publish telemetry, receive telecommands or access the GPS device on OPS-SAT.

Denoff began his entertainment career in 1977 as the Assistant to the Producers of the original long-running CBS television series Hawaii Five-O, ultimately working as the Associate Producer overseeing post- production. In 1980 he worked as the line producer of the ABC Television film \\"A Time For Miracles\\" and then secured the rights to a front-page story that was to become an NBC Movie. The 1981 Writers' Guild strike put all productions on hold for over one year. While working from home in the era before call- waiting and needing multiple phone lines, he salvaged an unused multi-line phone system for his own use. Months later, he was asked if he could install a similar system for another businessman, and subsequently formed one of the early telephone interconnect companies, Dencom Systems, Inc.; installing business phone systems for commercial clients in the Los Angeles area. The company gained prominence by guaranteeing 1-hour emergency service response 24 hours a day. It assumed the service contracts of a number of much larger competitors who left the industry. Recognized several times by Inc. Magazine as one of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the US, Dencom grew to over 20 employees in Santa Monica. In 1992, Denoff learned that long-distance services could be re-sold and formed an affiliated company, Fibernet, Inc. to resell the long-distance services of major carriers and provide clear, integrated monthly statements. By offering discounts on the telephone systems to Dencom customers in return for term contracts on the monthly long-distance services, Fibernet quickly became a flourishing business. In 2003, however, Denoff began to downsize the companies in preparation for his long-desired relocation back to New York City, and a return to a creative career. Personal life Denoff resides in New York City and is a Member of The Broadway League (www.broadwayleague.com ), The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and The Recording Academy. Denoff is the son of television writer/producer Sam Denoff and his first wife Bernice Levey. He has one full sister Leslie, and two half siblings, Melissa and Matthew, from his father's second marriage to dancer Sharon Shore. He was born in New York City attended nursery school at the Hunter College Elementary School. His family moved to Los Angeles at the age of 4 1/2. He grew up in Beverly Hills, attending El Rodeo Elementary School and Beverly Hills High School, where he worked in the theatre department; building sets and running lights for the schools' musicals and plays. He attended UCLA, majoring in English and Computer Science.

The British parliament voted for annual subsidy of ¬£10,000, in order for them to be properly maintained. Robert W. Harms argues that this subsidy was in recognition of the importance of maintaining a British presence on the Gold Coast, as the supply of slaves produced significant profits not so much from the slave trade as from the exploitation of slave labour in the Americas. In many ways this made up for the loss of 10% of the profits of independent slave traders which the company had received from 1698 to 1712.

Main characters *Yootha Joyce as Mildred Roper *Brian Murphy as George Roper Supporting characters *Norman Eshley as Jeffrey Fourmile *Sheila Fearn as Ann Fourmile *Nicholas Bond-Owen as Tristram Fourmile *Simon Lloyd as Tarquin Fourmile (from series 3) Recurring characters *Avril Elgar as Ethel *Reginald Marsh as Humphrey Pumphrey *Roy Kinnear as Jerry *Gretchen Franklin as Mildred's mother *\\"Pussy Galore\\" as Truffles Character descriptions =Mildred Roper= Mildred is the long- suffering wife of George who is always getting on her nerves. Whether she buys a new hat or armchair, George is not bothered. It is hinted that she used to have many flings with men when she used to work at an airbase during the war. Mildred has a sister called Ethel, who is a snob and is disliked by George and many others. Mildred dislikes Jerry, George's best friend and odd-job man who is usually conning people. Most of the storylines for Mildred are for her trying to climb the social ladder, and with George ruining her attempts. In George and Mildred she makes friends with her neighbour Ann Fourmile (Sheila Fearn), who is married to the snobbish Jeffrey (Norman Eshley). When Mildred thinks of adopting a child, and George agrees, the person from the orphanage declares that the Ropers cannot adopt because they are too old. Feeling sorry for Mildred, George buys her a Yorkshire Terrier, Truffles, who becomes Mildred's pride and joy, and receives better attention than George himself. =George Roper= The dim, lazy husband of Mildred, George is either watching television, at the pub or somehow annoying Jeffrey Fourmile, who he detests. He is best mates with Jerry who usually does a very cheap and dodgy job when he is roped in to do work on the house. George has a pet budgie called Oscar and a goldfish called Moby. George and Mildred's relationship is strained and they suffer each other. Throughout the series, George's relatives often visit: his father and younger brother Charlie. When Charlie Roper visits, all names of the Roper siblings are revealed: Fred, Gloria, Betty, Bill, George, Charlie and Bill (it is stated that the second Bill was named after the first). When George's father Jack arrives, their relationship is put under a serious strain, but when he leaves everything returns to normal. When Mildred's sister Ethel and her husband, Humphrey arrive, George often runs away to the pub. =Jeffrey Fourmile= Jeffrey lives next door to George and Mildred; he is a snobbish estate agent and lives with his wife Ann. Ann and Mildred become good friends, but Jeffrey is frequently irritated by George, with their spats providing much of the show's humour. The Fourmiles have a young son, Tristram, who gets on well with George, much to the chagrin of Jeffrey. Jeffrey supports the Conservative Party and is head of the Parent Teacher Association at Tristram's school. Jeffrey is always trying to impress his neighbours by buying sports cars and criticising the lower classes‚Äîaccording to Ann, Jeffrey only buys the Financial Times just to impress the newsagent. =Ann Fourmile= Ann, who lives with her husband Jeffrey, son Tristram (and later also Tarquin) lives next door to George and Mildred Roper, at number 48 Peacock Crescent. She quickly befriends Mildred and does not dislike George, unlike her husband who absolutely detests him. Ann is portrayed as a warm, lovable character who manages the Fourmile household. =Tristram Fourmile= Tristram, the young son of Jeffrey and Ann, is a cheeky private-schoolboy whose hobbies include playing with his Action Man. He reads The Beano, watches Doctor Who every week, and often questions Ann and Jeffrey about sex (unintentionally); when he asks his mother where babies come from, she replies \\"Harrods baby department\\", to which he replies: \\"That's not what Michael at school said\\". Jeffrey, surprised, asks him what Michael at school said; Tristram replies: \\"You wouldn't believe me even if I told you\\". After Mildred asks what Ann's new baby will be called, Tristram replies, \\"My mum says that when she has had the baby, she is going to call it 'a day'\\". =Ethel Pumphrey= Ethel, the elder snobbish sister of Mildred, lives a life of luxury in her large mansion in Oxshott. Her husband Humphrey owns a meat company and is nicknamed 'The Offal King of Oxshott'. Ethel is always trying to show off her new 'presents' from Humphrey like her new Jaguar XJ6, diamond rings, yachts and most of all her massive fur coat collection. When trying to show up the size of Mildred's home, as it is tiny compared to theirs, Ethel always says \\"Oh, what a lovely small room\\" Mildred's usual response is to make subtle digs at Ethel's age such as \\"Well, none of us are getting any younger, except you\\". =Humphrey Pumphrey= Labelled 'The Offal King of Oxshott' by the Ropers, Humphrey owns a meat company and puts up with the snobbish Ethel as his wife. However he does enjoy himself when flirting with his buxom secretary (Jennifer Guy) at work. He once planned a holiday for the two of them in Jersey, but George let it slip and the idea was abandoned. When visiting George and Mildred, Mildred always sits Humphrey next to her lava lamp which makes him annoyed as it makes him feel queasy. Humphrey is a snob, but he is not as bad as Ethel. =Mildred's mother= The ageing 74-year-old mother of Mildred and Ethel lives in Dagenham. She gets things muddled up as she puts her hat on George and says hello to the hat stand. Her constant catchphrase, which she says in all of her appearances is 'I'm not longed for this world'. =Jerry= Jerry is an odd job man who is always persuaded by George, his best friend, to get him to do various jobs around the house that do not even need doing, like fitting new showers and mending letterboxes. He is disliked by all, apart from George, but especially by Mildred.

The 19th century saw much devastation from grave plundering; many items found on the site found their way to the Canarian museum of Las Palmas, who bought them. Subsequently, the site was designated as a nature reserve to stop the plundering and other damages. The importance of water courses through the valley is shown by the many remains of water mills. A museum has been built at the beginning of the GC-103 road: the Guayadeque museum ‚Äì Centre of Archaeological interpretation (Sp.: Museo de Guayadeque ‚Äì Centro de Interpretaci√≥n Arqueol√≥gica).

She studied fine arts at Kabul University before attending Beaconhouse National University in Lahore, Pakistan on a scholarship. In Lahore she began to create public performances, a practice she continued upon her return to Kabul, where her work actively responded to a society dominated by extreme patriarchal politics. After performing her piece Armor in 2015, Khademi was forced to flee Afghanistan due to a fatwa and death threats. She is currently living and working in Paris.  Work  Through her practice, Khademi explores her life as a refugee and a woman. = Kubra & Pedestrian Sign/Kubra et les bonhommes pi√©tons (2016) = In this video work Khademi walks the streets of Paris dressed as a pedestrian crossing sign. In place of green or red male figure, Khademi's crossing sign displays a female figure. The costume consists of a black dress and a light up pedestrian box affixed to her head; in the piece Khademi is seen standing next to street signs and adding the female figure to the urban landscape. = Eternal trial (2015) = Eternal Trial is a video performance that consists of a long shot of Khademi walking through an empty field in Noyers, France. As she comes closer to the camera, it is revealed that she is picking poppies off a white dress and discarding them in the field behind her. = Armor (2015) = In 2015, Khademi walked along a Kabul street dressed in custom-made metal armour which emphasised her breasts, buttocks, and groin. Underneath the armour, Khademi wore a traditional hijab. Though the work was originally planned to have a twenty minute duration, Khademi was forced to abort the performance after only eight minutes and to seek refuge in a friend's car. The project was inspired by Kubra's personal experiences of harassment, both on the particular Kabul street where she staged the work, and in general since her childhood. Through the project she hoped to address the sexual harassment women in Afghanistan face on a daily basis. Khademi has stated that the performance explored her life as a woman and the limitations that come with being a woman in Afghanistan. After the performance, Khademi received many threats and abusive messages. As a result, she was forced to flee Afghanistan by foot, and is currently living in exile in France. For Khademi, the result of her project emphasised the problems of extreme patriarchy and social imbalance in Afghan society.  Reception  After fleeing Afghanistan and settling in France, Khademi was awarded an MFA scholarship at Pantheon Sorbonne University and was given the title of Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et Letter by the Ministry of French Culture.

History The building was built in the early eighteenth century, but has been rebuilt several times. The current appearance of the cathedral is the result of work done in 1864. After Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in 1998, several donations for the renovation of the cathedral were performed, which today is in very good condition. The church is dedicated to the patron saint of the city, the Virgen de la Candelaria. The most striking feature is the huge bell tower, topped with a statue of Christ. The temple follows the Roman or Latin rite and is the seat of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Camag√ºey (Archidioecesis Camagueyensis) which was raised to its current status in 1998 by the bull \\"Maiori spirituali\\". The cathedral is part of the historic center of Camag√ºey, a UNESCO world heritage site since 2008. In January 2014 Pope Francis also conferred on it the title of minor basilica.

He subsequently became the first president of the new country and served the Central African Republic in several diplomatic roles. Gu√©rillot is known mainly for having developed the Committee of Economic Health, a failed project for the expansion of plantations in Ubangi-Shari, under the authority of the Loi Cadre Defferre (1957‚Äì1958). It was based on conservative ideals but presented as part of the emancipation of the colonies. In general, his political orientation was controversial and he seems to have been guided solely by personal interests.  Biography = From colonist to African emancipation movement = Roger Gu√©rillot was born on 12 November 1904 in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, to a 21-year-old domestic servant, Marie Gu√©rillot, employed by a family of the 16th arrondissement. Until the end of his life, Gu√©rillot used two first names on legal documents, L√©on and Charles, He had been a student at the √âcole Sp√©ciale des Travaux Publics before being hired by Michelin in 1928, to work as an engineer in their technical service centre in Paris. The historian Pierre Kalck claims that Gu√©rillot was only a mechanic, dispatched to French Equatorial Africa in 1928 to work on the steamships. In 1935, Gu√©rillot left Michelin and moved to Ubangi-Shari where he worked for the Society of African Mechanics and then the Society for Forestry and Industrial Exploitation. Following the invasion of France by Axis forces in July 1940, Gu√©rillot joined the Free French. For his services he was awarded the Resistance Medal and the Commemorative medal for voluntary service in Free France after the war. In 1944, following the Brazzaville Conference, a reform of the colonial society of French Equatorial Africa was announced. Gu√©rillot was opposed to the granting of political rights to Africans. As a result, he became hostile to the colonial administration. His engagement with politics was affirmed when he was employed by Uniroute in a society for land transport and joined the Bangui Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Bangui Masonic lodge. With this support he was elected as a councillor of the Territorial Assembly of Ubangi-Shari by the European college of voters in 1952. In the same year, he received a seat on the grand council of French Equatorial Africa from his peers. Like the majority of the colonists, Gu√©rillot was hostile to the native d√©put√© Barth√©lemy Boganda. In 1954, he proposed the formation of an anti-Bogandist militia to Governor Louis Sanmarco. When this failed, he changed his position. The movement towards the internal autonomy of the colonies appeared irreversible. The French government was inclined to suppress the double electoral college. In 1955, with the approval of the Europeans of Bangui, Gu√©rillot concluded an accord with Bouganda, leading to the creation of the Ubangi Liberal Inter-Group, of which Gu√©rillot was co-vice-president. As a result, Gu√©rillot became vice-president of the Territorial Assembly of Ubangi- Shari and of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa in 1956. He had completely acquired the confidence of Boganda, who in turn named him General Treasurer of his party, the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN). In 1957, he was one of eight Europeans elected in the territorial elections on the MESAN list, on the list in Lobaye, with Boganda himself as one of his co-candidates. = The white minister of Ubangi under the Loi-cadre Defferre = As a result of the entry into force of the Loi-cadre Defferre in 1956, the 1957 elections led to the formation of a council for local government. Although he had won these elections with a landslide, the council was presided over by the French High Commissioner, so Boganda refused to enter it. Nevertheless, he personally arranged its composition. On 14 May 1957, Gu√©rillot was named as one of six ministers‚Äîthe only European to be appointed. He was entrusted with the super-portfolio of Economic and Administrative Affairs and was thus effectively Minister of the Interior and Minister of the Economy. Gu√©rillot adopted a paternalistic attitude towards his African ministerial colleagues: he took care of their facilities, organised a car for each of them, chose their residences, and decorated their offices. Most importantly, he made himself an obligatory intermediary between the ministers and Boganda, requiring that any request to meet with the leader of MESAN be addressed to him personally. He seems to have done this without Boganda's knowledge.  Extraordinary promotion of African senior officials  In October 1957, while Ubangi-Shari was in the grip of social protests, some African officials demanded equality with their white colleagues and Gu√©rillot decided to raise their salaries. When it proved impossible to put this promise into practice, the government adopted another of Gu√©rillot's ideas: demanding that the French government release 400 million francs to enable an \\"extraordinary promotion of African senior officials,\\" while retaining European officials in their roles. The response was negative. In response, Gu√©rillot and Boganda organised a campaign of protest against the administrators of Outre-mer.  Fuel tax  In December 1957, the vice- president of the Government Council, Abel Goumba, presented the projected budget of the council of ministers for 1958 to the Territorial Assembly, which included a tax hike for commercial enterprises which did not re-invest in Ubangi-Shari. At the session of 20 December, Gu√©rillot separated himself from the government denouncing the \\"asphyxiation\\" of the Ubangi-Shari economy and suggested the replacement of certain tariffs and taxes by a tax on fuel. This project, called a syst√®me de d√©taxation-surtaxation, was inspired by the economic theories developed by the founder of the cosmetics group L'Or√©al, Eug√®ne Schueller. The idea of a special tax on fuel was most widely considered in the spring of 1958 when Gu√©rillot was focused on the finances necessary to create rural collectives in Ubangi-Shari. Gu√©rillot calculated that their introduction would require an additional 60‚Äì85 million Central African CFA francs in the local budget. According to Gu√©rillot, Ubangi-Shari could increase its income by instituting a monopoly on the sale of petrol, given to an authorised company which would pass a levy on petrol to the public treasury. When Gu√©rillot found this project difficult to apply solely within Ubangi-Shari, he proposed it to the Grand Council in Brazzaville as a project to be implemented across the whole of French Equatorial Africa. Eventually, the project was abandoned.  Committee for Economic Health  Gu√©rillot entered into a rivalry with Abel Goumba. In December 1957, he scuttled the development project focused on education which had been proposed by Goumba in September 1957, in favour of his own project, the committee for economic health. Gu√©rillot's committee sought to put an additional under cultivation between 1958 and 1970 as coffee plantations owned by African families and to construct 77 new factories to treat the additional of coffee resulting from this programme. Gu√©rillot estimated the cost of this project to be 4 billion Central African CFA francs. This cost would be gradually reimbursed, partially by the new owners of the plantations who were expected to repay around 3.5 billion francs of loans, by training fees, and by the factories. Boganda was convinced of the value of this project and took the presidency of the Committee for Economic Health. Experts pointed out that it would not be possible to provide the required number of plants in a short period of time. In the meantime, therefore, Gu√©rillot undertook to develop the general economy by increasing the amount of cotton and peanuts under cultivation, to increase tax revenues. To achieve these objectives, \\"controllers\\" were recruited from amongst the unemployed of Bangui and employed to \\"motivate\\" the peasants. Some abuses occurred. The project faced hostility from villagers, village chiefs, and politicians. To pay the \\"controllers\\", Gu√©rillot appealed to a \\"union of capital and labour\\" in order to obtain capital from the colonists. The colonists were skeptical: the project seemed to take little account of the environmental, sociological and economic conditions of the country. The Committee for Economic Health had to be with the limited assistance offered by the French state, from which Ubangi-Shari borrowed a hundred million CFA francs in March 1958. = Ambassador of the Central African Republic =  Loss of support from Boganda  For several reasons, Gu√©rillot lost the support of Boganda. In July 1958, the portfolio of administrative affairs‚Äîequivalent to the ministry of the interior‚Äîwas reassigned to David Dacko. In December 1958, Gu√©rillot lost the ministry of economic affairs as well. As treasurer of Boganda's party, Gu√©rillot had organised a security service for MESAN known as SOM. SOM contained sixty groups, many of which were Europeans, who were paid monthly from the party treasury. They trained on the edge of Bangui in the Mamadou Mba√Øki district. Among their officers was the Czech, Otto ≈†acher, the future director of the Ngaragba Central Prison under David Dacko and Bokassa. Gu√©rillot had justified the existence of the SOM to Abel Goumba as an effective means of ensuring the protection of the ministers and of facilitating Ubangi-Shari's establishment as an independent state, if the French state suffered some sort of disaster. Members of SOM were regularly employed as \\"controllers\\" by the Committee for Economic Health. Following complaints from members of SOM about unpaid salaries, an audit of the MESAN treasury revealed that, in addition to emptying the party treasury, Gu√©rillot had been involved in the weapons trade. Gu√©rillot also came into conflict with Boganda after the latter became aware of his political manoeuvres in spring 1958 to get the seat in the French Senate for Ubangi-Shari vested in Hector Rivi√©rez. Taking advantage of Boganda's absence from Bangui, Gu√©rillot had sought the support of members of the Territorial Assembly of Ubangi-Shari and party members of MESAN. This intrigue deeply angered Boganda. Abel Goumba was finally convinced that through the fuel tax project, Gu√©rillot had intended to collect a personal commission on petrol.  Central African ambassador to the west  Although he had lost Boganda's favour, Gu√©rillot did not resign his public role and he seems to have been feared by the president of MESAN. He was sent far from Bangui to the post of deputy general delegate to France for Ubangi-Shari, under the authority of Philippe Monin, the general delegate. His mission was to make contact with French and European institutions for the benefit of Ubangi-Shari. Gu√©rillot refused to accept the post until he was promised that his salary would remain at the same rate as his old ministerial salary and that he would be appointed a general delegate, not a deputy general delegate. Jean-B√©del Bokassa This was the beginning of a long diplomatic career in the service of the Central African Republic, the independent state which Ubangi-Shari became on 1 December 1958. This career began in Paris at the general delegation, where Gu√©rillot obtained the voluntary resignation of Philippe Monin. on 1 January 1961, Gu√©rillot saw his mission redefined as simply a commercial delegate attached to the Central African Republic's embassy in Paris. He continued in this role until 13 February 1962. In the meantime, by a decree of 11 October 1961, he obtained Central African citizenship, which was certainly a preliminary to his appointment in February 1962 as permanent ambassador of the Central African Republic to Belgium, Luxembourg and the European Economic Community. From July 1963 to October 1965, he was simultaneously also the ambassador to West Germany. In 1970, in his final appointment, the Central African government relieved him of his role in Brussels to appoint him ambassador to Washington, D.C. After the death of Boganda in March 1959, Gu√©rillot retained a certain influence within the Central African political scene. He was among those who suggested to David Dacko, Boganda's successor, the idea of entrusting Captain Jean-B√©del Bokassa with the task of organising the new national army. Gu√©rillot got on well with Bokassa. The journalist Pierre P√©an reports that Gu√©rillot played a decisive role in Bokassa's fascination with Napoleon Bonaparte. On 31 October 1971, Roger Gu√©rillot died of a heart attack in a clinic in Uccle, in the suburbs of Brussels. General Bokassa organised his official funeral in Bangui, where he is buried and where a road was renamed in his honour.  Legacy  Roger Gu√©rillot was among the European colonists who supported the transfer of the French colonies to self-government by African politicians, out of opportunism or conviction, and who was appointed by the new African governments to ministerial posts. Among the French colonies, there are parallels in French West Africa (AOF) and Madagascar, as well as French Equatorial Africa (AEF). In the AOF, the former French senator, Georges Monnet, who was close to F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny, served as Minister of Agriculture in Ivory Coast from 1959 to 1961. In Madagascar, Eug√®ne Lechat, a supporter of Philibert Tsiranana, served as minister of public works continuously from 1959 until May 1972. In the AEF, Gu√©rillot promoted the model of the Ubangi Liberal Intergroup in the various territories, with a view to the establishment of an AEF Liberal Intergroup. Only French Congo answered this call, following Gu√©rillot's establishment of contact with the local leader, Fulbert Youlou in 1956. On 15 October 1956, the Middle Congo Liberal Intergroup was established by the union of Fulbert Youlou's Democratic Union for the Defense of African Interests and the Union of Middle Congo of colonist Christian Jayle, former director of the cabinet during the Vichy period. This union led to Christian Jayle receiving the post of Secretary of State for Information from Youlou in February 1959, a role which he held until April 1960.

It was released on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux on 4 November 2016. It is the fourteenth iterative instalment to the Football Manager series. Gameplay FM17 features similar gameplay to that of the Football Manager series. Gameplay consists of taking charge of a professional association football team, as the team manager. Players can sign football players to contracts, manage finances for the club, and give team talks to players. FM17 is a simulation of real world management, with the player being judged on various factors by the club's AI owners and board. Development FM17 received a free early-access beta version of the game two weeks prior to the official release. Careers started in the beta version could later be continued in the full release. After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union (EU) on 23 June 2016, FM17 featured a form of brexit, with three possible scenarios: \\"business as usual\\" with no additional work visas needed; current players will be grandfathered but new players will need work visas; or a \\"hard Brexit\\" in-game scenario, which has Scotland voting for independence in a second referendum and remaining in the EU, whilst EU players would require working visas to play in any English, Welsh or Northern Irish teams. FM17 featured a new social media view, which would show a Twitter themed view of fans and players thoughts, that would change after events that transpired in game. A new face scanning option allowed the player's in-game avatar to be customised to show a 3D view of the player's real life face by use of a webcam, or brought from a picture. Reception On the review aggregator Metacritic, Football Manager 2017 received a score of 80 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". GameSpot gave the game a 7/10, applauding the player development and smart transfers, and also saying \\"Football Manager 2017 is easy to recommend to the budding manager\\", but not enjoying the tactics interface. PC Gamer gave the game a score of 85/100, saying the game is a significant step up from previous versions. Trusted Reviews gave the game 4.5 stars, \\"saying FM17 is a very definite leap forward.\\" George Osborn of British newspaper, The Guardian, was less positive about the game, particularly citing previous releases in the series, and the lack of a substantial increase over previous instalments. Osborn wrote, \\"Over the past four years, Football Manager editions have shaken up the way players create tactics, introduce in game manager stats or provide new game modes to play. FM 2017 offers none of that.\\" Osborn was also highly critical of the game's purely cosmetic addition of a face scanner, and inclusion of social media, calling it \\"utterly inconsequential\\". User reviews of the game on the Steam service, however, show a \\"Mostly Negative\\" view, the result of a backlash from Chinese users protesting at the lack of an official translation in their language. =Sales= On 21 August 2017 PC Games Insider magazine published that FM17 had sold its one-millionth copy. This would be the fifth time in succession that the Football Manager game had sold one million copies or more.

The company was formed in 1935 in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, and diversified into electric vehicles after the end of the Second World War. They had a good record at exporting their products, with notable successes in Switzerland and California. There were several changes of ownership during the 1970s and 1980s, and the company ceased to exist in 1989. History In 1935, the Market Harborough Construction Company was formed, and established itself as a manufacturer of aircraft components. They expanded rapidly, as the Second World War created a demand for their products, and when the hostilities ceased, they diversified into other areas. This included sub-contract machining and fabrication, and the production of electric vehicles. Batteries for the vehicles were obtained from D P Batteries, who were part of the Chloride Group and were based in Bakewell, while most of the chargers came from Partridge Wilson of Leicester, who were making their own range of Wilson battery vehicles. Chargers were re-badged with the Harbilt name. The first vehicle produced was the 551 pedestrian controlled vehicle (PCV), which they sold to brick yards, where they replaced wheelbarrows, and to the dairy industry. Both types of user tended to overload the vehicles, and the axle size had to be increased, to reduce the number of breakages. The 551 had two wheels at the front, which were at the outside edges of the vehicle, and a short axle holding the two rear wheels. Other early PCVs had the wheels arranged more conventionally. The 727 was fitted with a differential and gearbox made by P R Motors, who were based in Coventry and came with a mechanical braking system. The 720 was similar, but the brakes were operated hydraulically. A large number of 551 vehicles were sold to Switzerland, where the lack of a differential gave better grip when there was snow and ice on the ground, and some 2000 vehicles were supplied for use by the Post Office and by hotels. The range was expanded by the addition of the model 685 low loader, a 3-wheeled truck for moving goods around factories, the model 790 tow truck, which was a ride-on 3-wheeler, and various models of forklift truck. Most of these were not road vehicles. A number of 790 tow trucks were supplied to the airline Pan Am for use at Heathrow Airport, while customers for the 685 power units included Leyland Motors and the Scottish company TPS. The company suffered a downturn in its profitability in 1957, but recovered soon afterwards, helped by an order for sanitation trucks from Pan Am. Another part of the recovery was sales of ride-on milk floats. Their first design, the 735, had been built in 1956, and one of the earliest examples was bought back from the dairy who ran it, and is now part of the Leicestershire County Collection. It was displayed at Snibston Discovery Museum until that closed in 2015. Harbilt offered three other designs, the 750, 760 and 850. The 750 had a 72-volt battery and a wide body, whereas the 760 was narrower and had a 36-volt battery. The 850 was a development of the 750. All featured cabs with rounded body panels made from fibreglass, which were bought in from a third party ready for attaching to the chassis. The 750 had a range of 25‚Äì30 miles, and could travel at speeds up to 18 mph with a payload of 25 cwt. Harbilt showcased the 750 and 760 models at the 1959 Diary Show, and also displayed a 20 cwt pedestrian controlled model on their stand. A Harbilt Model 850 (far right), registration number RYM 308E, at the Burnaby Road depot of N F Collins, Southend-on-Sea, Essex. This style of cab was fitted to 850 and 808 models. The two vehicles nearest the camera are Morrison-Electricar models D4 and BM. The 900 range was the next to be introduced, beginning with the 916 and the 924, and later the 936. The final two digits referred to the number of 2-volt cells that formed the battery. The vehicle was similar to the 760, but was somewhat wider. A model 808 was also added at some point. The Dairyliner range was announced in September 1970 and showcased at the Royal International Dairy Show held at Olympia in October. It was initially available in two models, with 24 and 36 cell batteries. The smaller battery size gave a top speed of while the bigger battery increased the top speed to . The vehicle was designed for a payload of 30 cwt, and much of it was made from reinforced and ABS plastics. The front wheels were at the extreme front of the vehicle, with entrance and exit from the cab through angled openings behind the wheels. Options for bi-fold doors or roller blinds to seal the exits were available, as were produce cupboards, for the storage of other products besides milk. The Dairyliner range expanded to include eight variations of vehicle. Harbilt also built the HSV (higher speed vehicle), which was a general delivery truck. The payload was reduced to allow it to travel at faster speeds in urban traffic, and 30 were supplied to the United States Post Office for mail deliveries in Cupertino, California. The vehicles were supplied in March 1974 as right-hand drive chassis, with the bodywork assembled in Scotts Valley, California and this model was officially the HSV3. The main issue encountered was that the battery liquid dried up rapidly in the hotter conditions of California. Initially, each cell had to be topped up individually, but Chloride batteries developed a reservoir system, which allowed all the cells to be topped up from a single fill, significantly reducing the time spent on maintenance. In June 1972, Harbilt bought the Douglas company, a manufacturer of electric trucks and tractors, moving production of these vehicles to Market Harborough. At some point in the early 1970s, prior to 1974, Harbilt and Morrison-Electricar reached an agreement for a product exchange and rationalisation. Morrisons had moved from Leicester to Tredegar in 1968, as part of a government plan to replace jobs lost in the coal mining industry. Under the agreement, production of milk floats would transfer from Market Harborough to Tredegar, and Morrison trucks would be handed over to Harbilt. This included some Manulectric trolley trucks, but details of the deal and the precise dates are a little sketchy, as a copy of the agreement has not been found. =Acquisition= The Crosby Valve and Engineering Co Ltd took over the Market Harborough Construction Company in 1959. Crosby was a European offshoot of an American company, which was based in Wembley, north west London. They were particularly interested in the industrial machining capacity which Harbilt had. Although they had administrative offices in the West End of London, enqiries about electric vehicles were still channelled to Market Harborough, and the Harbilt trade mark was retained. British Steel Piling (BSP), who were based in Claydon near Ipswich announced in December 1971 that they would be buying the Crosby Valve group for ¬£1.8 million. T F Croxall was appointed as the new Chief Executive of the Crosby Valves and Harborough Construction part of the business in 1973. BSP changed their name to Edward Le Pas in the same year. By late 1974, Crosby Valves and Edward Le Pas had decided that they wanted to concentrate on other products besides electric trucks. The local management team, headed by Mike Warrington, decided to attempt a management buyout. There was considerable support from within the existing company, and with some outside financial backing, the company transferred to its new ownership in 1975. They moved to a factory on Rockingham Road, and traded briefly as McGibbon, as one of the backers was the former Northamptonshire cricketer Lewis McGibbon, until the registration of Harbilt Electric Trucks Ltd was completed. The new company won accreditation to British Standard 5750, which enabled them to produce vehicles for the Ministry of Defence (MoD). In late 1987, Fred W Davies, a Canadian who owned the Davies Magnet Group and York Trailers, was also trying to break into the MoD market, and saw the acquisition of Harbilt as a way to obtain their good reputation and their BS5750 accreditation quickly. Harbilt shares were trading at about ¬£6, and he offered ¬£11. The offer was accepted, and production moved to Corby, but Davies failed to win any MoD contracts, and lost interest in building electric vehicles. The business was put up for sale in 1989, and although John Bradshaw of Peterborough was keen to buy it, it was M&M; Electric Vehicles of Atherstone who were successful.

Early and family life Born in Lisbon, Iowa, Kathryn Haesler attended Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, and then the University of Iowa, which awarded her bachelor's and master's degrees in American history. She taught history and government at Menominie High School in Michigan, and later the University of Iowa's Lab School (1931-1933), and Merlaine Park Country Day School in New Orleans, Louisiana. While in Louisiana in 1936, Haesler married then Department of Agriculture management engineer Harold A. Stone, and they later had a son (Paul) and two daughters (Suanne and Joanne). The couple moved to northern Virginia in 1940, and lived in Arlington until the 1980s, when they moved to nearby Alexandria. She was active in the Beverley Hills Community Church in Alexandria, as well as various Parent Teacher Organizations, the American Association of University Women, Pi Lambda Theta and Delta Kappa Gamma. Career She and her husband traveled extensively studying local governments in their spare time, as he worked in administrative positions in the Department of Agriculture and later the Department of the Army. The Stones were among the original 34 founders of Burgundy Farm Country Day School in Alexandria, Virginia, the first racially integrated school in Virginia. In 1940, Stone helped found the League of Women Voters chapter in Arlington. She wrote an organizational history of the League in 1949,Barbara Stuhler, For the Public Record: A Documentary History of the League of Women Voters (Greenwood Publishing 2000), bibliographical note at p. 301 and later served on its Virginia State Board and as vice-president of the National Board (1946-1950). As a member of the Northern Virginia Planning Commission (which evolved into the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, Stone helped design Reston, Virginia, and later wrote a history of that planned community. She also was active with the Commission on Human Resources of the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies (serving as vice chairman), and the Tenth District Women's Democratic Club. In 1954, Stone (who ran as a \\"housewife and mother\\") became the first woman elected to represent northern Virginia in the Virginia General Assembly, and the first woman to serve as a Virginia legislator in two decades. She took office months before the United States Supreme Court issued its first decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Her husband Harold was then working for the Department of the Army, and had previously worked as a volunteer to eliminate Arlington's appointed school board (temporarily succeeding in having it popularly elected).typed \\"A hopeless minority\\" dated June 1979 in Arlington local history clipping file Initially, Kathryn Stone's was one of the few Virginia voices advocating on behalf of civil rights and criticizing the Massive Resistance policies of the Byrd Organization as fostering a \\"spirit of lawlessness and disrespect for constitutional government.\\"Washington Post obituary In addition to being the only woman in the Virginia General Assembly at the time, Stone was one of only two legislators with a background in education, and one of only nine legislators born outside the \\"Solid South\\".Robbins L. Gates, The Making of Massive Resistance: Virginia's Politics of Public School Desegregation 1954-1956 (University of North Carolina Press, 1964) pp. 146-147 Arlington, which she represented, wanted to integrate its public schools as a result of an NAACP lawsuit against it, but Senator Harry F. Byrd and others (particularly from Southside Virginia) had taken away Arlington's elected school board and proposed to close any school or district that integrated, rather than allow that \\"local option.\\" Stone specifically warned against a series of bills targeting the NAACP, telling fellow legislators \\"you are stooping in panic as you desert the Bill of Rights, which was born in the minds and hearts of the greatest Virginians.\\" For this, the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties bought newspaper space to urge her defeat at the polls.Washington post p. F2 August 3, 1965 In fact, she and delegates John C. Webb and Vernon S. Shaffer were the only three delegates to oppose all seven anti-NAACP bills in the segregationist Stanley Plan, with opposing votes never exceeding nine of the 100-member body.Benjamin Muse, Virginia's Massive Resistance (Indiana University Press 1961) p. 33 On January 19, 1959 both a three-judge federal panel in Virginia and the Virginia Supreme Court held the Stanley Plan (various Virginia laws passed to undercut the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown I and Brown II rulings) unconstitutional. After Governor J. Lindsay Almond Jr. acceded to that judicial direction (much to Byrd's dismay), Arlington (and similarly accommodating Norfolk, Virginia) peacefully integrated their schools in early February. Virginia also failed to correct the historic under-representation of the growing northern Virginia suburbs after the 1960 census (although Arlington had received one additional seat in the 1953 election, which Stone had won to be seated alongside J. Maynard Magruder and C. Harrison Mann).Cynthia Miller Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia 1619‚Äì1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 705, 711, 718, 724, 729, 735. Stone became one of the four named plaintiffs, along with Mann (but not Magruder's successor William L. Winston) as well as with Fairfax state senator John A. K. Donovan and delegate Webb. in the voting apportionment case. The United States Supreme Court decided Davis v. Mann in 1964, ruling in their favor, and Arlington received an additional delegate in the House of Delegates after the required reapportionment, although Stone retired to pursue other interests as discussed below. Stone also served on President Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women. Throughout her part- time legislative career, Stone worked to improve youth services, mental health, education and welfare‚Äîall of which had received little funding in Virginia in previous decades. She introduced a bill establishing a minimum wage (which narrowly lost), as well as unsuccessful bills for state-wide compulsory schooling, a state conservation corps for unemployed youth, freedom of information, conflict of interest, open meetings and to eliminate the poll tax. After Dorothy Shoemaker McDiarmid of Fairfax and Marion Galland of Alexandria followed her into the House of Delegates, the three women proposed legislation to establish a State Commission on the Status of Women, which failed, but Governor Albertis S. Harrison Jr. established it anyway and made Stone a member. Stone was more successful in establishing the Virginia Community College System, as well as the Commonwealth's first regional juvenile detention home. In 1966, she declined to seek re-election in order to concentrate on her work as director of the Commission on Human Resources for the Washington Center for Metropolitan Studies, as Chairman of the Arlington Citizens Committee in President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty and a book tentatively titled \\"Human Resources: Focus in the Sixties.\\" The Washington Post said she symbolized the change facing Virginia politics, as well as had become one of the Assembly's most influential members. She was succeeded as delegate by Arlington's new Democratic chairwoman, Mary A. R. Marshall, who would serve 24 years in the General Assembly, and with Del. McDiarmid, update Virginia's laws, especially relating to women, children and senior citizens.Cynthia A. Kierner and Sandra Gioia Treadway, Virginia Women: Their Lives and Times, vol 2 (University of Georgia Press 2016) pp. 333 et seq. Stone wrote and published \\"Choosing the President of the USA\\" in 1954 and Reston, Virginia: Its Beginnings in 1965. She also,co-authored two books with her husband Harold A. Stone and Donald K. Price: City Manager Government in the U.S. (which went through many editions beginning in 1939) and Case Studies in City Manager Government. Death and legacy Stone died at home in 1995 of complications after a stroke, and was survived by her husband (who died in 1996), as well as their son, two daughters and many grandchildren. The Commission on the Status of Women posthumously named her a Person of Vision, which the General Assembly passed as House Joint Resolution No. 870 on February 15, 2001. Most of her papers, including two oral history interviews, are held in the special collections division of the University of Virginia. Some are held by the Iowa Women's Archives.

Retrieved 17 July 2016Bavarian State Chancellery, Information about Bavaria, 1981, p. 11. () are a hill ridge, up to , in Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg in South Germany.  Location and boundaries  The Franconian Heights lie in the west of Franconia on either side of the border between Bavaria in the east (with the districts of Neustadt a.d.Aisch-Bad Windsheim and Ansbach) and Baden-W√ºrttemberg in the west (Schw√§bisch Hall and a small area of the Ostalbkreis). The larger part lies in Bavaria; the markedly smaller southwestern element is in Baden- W√ºrttemberg. It includes the southern part of the so-called Crailsheim Hardt (Crailsheimer Hardt), which extends in an arc around the town of Crailsheim from the ramp of the A 6 northeast of Satteldorf in the north as far as Jagst near Stimpfach in the south, where it transitions into the Virngrund. It also includes the little basin of the upper Zwergw√∂rnitz to the southeast, near Kre√überg. The Franconian Heights, whose plateau has a hill country character in places, lie south of the somewhat lower hills of the Steigerwald, east of the Hohenlohe Plain and northeast of the Ellwangen Hills, and not quite half way on a line from Nuremberg to Stuttgart, east of Rothenburg.  Geology  Geologically, the Franconian Heights belong to the Keuper Uplands, which run through both the Franconian Keuper-Lias Land and through the adjacent Swabian Keuper-Lias Land to the southwest, and is also surrounded by lias country. Its northern continuation is the Steigerwald, up to 499 m high, which transitions into the Ha√überge (up to 512 m) on the far side of the River Main. Its southern continuation, the Swabian-Franconian Forest, runs from the southern boundary of the Heights, mainly westwards, and is a little higher, climbing to 586 m. On its western side, the Franconian Heights end in a steep scarp (also called the Trauf), and in the east, descends to the plains. The dominant rock type is (keuper-)sandstone; the soils are relatively sandy. Old quarries, such as those in Obergailnau near Wettringen bear witness to the former importance of this rock for house construction in the region.  Nature park  The Franconian Heights Nature Park covers most of the region, but not its southern part. In addition, it extends westwards near Rothenburg and as far as the Sulzach north of Feuchtwangen, well beyond the ridge itself.  Settlements  The towns and villages of the region include: * Burgbernheim * Colmberg * Crailsheim with subdistricts east of the Jagst * Diebach * Domb√ºhl * Feuchtwangen * Fichtenau with its subdistrict of W√§ldershub * Kre√überg * Marktbergel * Markt Erlbach * Obernzenn * Satteldorf and its eastern subdistricts * Schillingsf√ºrst * Schnelldorf * Stimpfach with several villages * Trautskirchen * Wettringen * W√∂rnitz  Transport  The Franconian Heights are crossed by the A 6 and A 7 motorways, which meet in the valley of the W√∂rnitz at the Feuchtwangen/Crailsheim intersection. The ramp on the A 6 after the Crailsheim exit which is still on the Hohenlohe Plain up to the western Trauf or edge of the Heights, clearly shows the morphological border. A rest stop on the A 6 about 10 km east of the motorway intersection is named after the landscape.

Produced by keyboardist Jordan Fish and vocalist Oliver Sykes, it was featured on the band's 2015 fifth studio album That's the Spirit. The song was also released as the sixth single from the album on 27 June 2016, reaching number 97 on the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. Promotion and release The first preview of \\"Avalanche\\" was released on 31 August 2015 in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer, alongside another for the song \\"What You Need\\". The full song was premiered on Annie Mac's show on BBC Radio 1 on 9 September, two days before the release of That's the Spirit. \\"Avalanche\\" was not performed live until 22 April 2016, when it received its live debut (along with That's the Spirit closing track \\"Oh No\\") at the band's landmark performance at the Royal Albert Hall with the Parallax Orchestra, which was recorded for December's Live at the Royal Albert Hall release. Since this show, the song has made several appearances in the band's live set lists. Composition and lyrics According to Bring Me the Horizon vocalist Oliver Sykes, \\"Avalanche\\" is the band's attempt at creating \\"a stadium-sounding anthem\\" in the vein of bands such as U2. Keyboardist Jordan Fish echoed the influence of 1980s \\"arena rock\\" on the song, which Sykes claimed was not intended merely for the purposes of \\"getting big\\". Rock Sound writer Andy Biddulph described the song as featuring \\"rumbling, widescreen rock\\" and \\"powerful lyrics\\", compared its style to that of Linkin Park, particularly in terms of its \\"huge, open chords and Oli's raking vocal performance\\". David Renshaw of the NME noted the song's \\"singalong choruses and driving, expansive production\\", comparing it in these respects to \\"Throne\\". Lyrically, \\"Avalanche\\" is a song about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with which Sykes was diagnosed prior to the release of That's the Spirit. Identifying the diagnosis as a factor in his recovery from drug addiction, the vocalist noted the lyric \\"Cut me open and tell me what's inside\\" as indicative of his headspace at the time of writing the song. In a review of the album for the Alternative Press, Tom Bryant proposed that the lyrics and the music juxtapose with one another, describing the song as \\"melancholy, epic and uplifting all at once: \\"I feel like suicide,\\" Sykes sings, but the swelling synths behind him seem to say, \\"Oh, cheer up.\\"\\" Fuse's Maria Sherman noted its \\"self-deprecating chorus\\". In a Reddit AMA (\\"Ask Me Anything\\"), bassist Matt Kean revealed that \\"Avalanche\\" was his favourite song on That's the Spirit. Fish claimed that it was \\"probably [his] favourite\\" too in a 2016 interview, despite previously favouring the album's opener \\"Doomed\\". Music video The music video for \\"Avalanche\\" was released on 23 June 2016. Directed by Tom Sykes, brother of the band's vocalist Oliver, it features footage of the band performing live at various shows throughout early 2016, including the landmark show at the Royal Albert Hall in April. Loudwire's Chad Childers outlined that the video \\"features a mix of day and night shots, with the evening performances giving viewers a glimpse of the light wall that typically backs the band onstage. You also see the full-on energy and vibe of a Bring Me the Horizon show, complete with a crowd separating and staging a wall of death\\". Speaking about the video, director Sykes described the production process as \\"a lot of work but extremely rewarding\\", adding that the brothers had subsequently set up a company called Fun Blood in order to work together on more projects in the future. Critical reception Media response to \\"Avalanche\\" was generally positive. Andy Biddulph of Rock Sound praised \\"Avalanche\\" as a \\"string-laden, wistful ballad\\", claiming that it is \\"ready- made for pyro blasts and sold-out arenas\\". Tom Bryant of Alternative Press claimed that it reflected the overall message of the album in general: \\"Everything's screwed, but what are you going to do about it?\\" Loudwire's Chad Childers described the track as \\"one of the more anthemic songs in the band's catalog\\". Amy Gravelle from Gigwise compared it to Bullet for My Valentine for its \\"weary guitar licks\\" and \\"choral build ups\\", but criticised its \\"mainstream blunder\\", calling it a \\"disappointing lull\\". Commercial performance \\"Avalanche\\" entered the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart at number 7 on 18 September 2015 following the release of That's the Spirit, when it also registered on the main UK Singles Chart for a solitary week at number 97. The song remained in the top 40 of the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart until December. In the United States, the track reached number 32 on the Billboard Twitter Top Tracks chart.

The museum's collection has been gradually extended and diversified, illustrating the different theatrical forms that derive from ancient traditions or emerge from contemporary artistic searches, exploring new forms, new materials and new techniques. This extension was possible only with the participation of different personalities, authors, collectors and puppeteers who, with us, embraced this project, giving their invaluable contribution through the transfer of their estates, to which the Museum gratefully acknowledges. At first, it was kept tonic accent in the national universe, being able to be proud of integrating one of the most significant and comprehensive collections of Portuguese traditional puppetry. Since late 2008, the doors were opened to the world with the host, on deposit, the exceptional and vast collection of puppets and masks of Southeast Asia and Africa of the collector Francisco Capelo. Convent of Bernardas The Museum is housed in the Convent of Bernardas, classified as a Public Interest. The convent was founded in 1653, by permission of King John IV of Portugal, as being a cloistered closed in 1655. On the occasion of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the building was almost completely destroyed. Its reconstruction began in 1758 under the architect Giacomo Azzolini. In 1786 the convent returned to religious use, and it remained as such until 1834, when the religious orders were dissolved and their property expropriated. The former convent was successively leased, being acquired in 1850 by Joaquim Lopes Chamber who installed a College. A succession of occupations, from Polytechnic High School, movie theater, shows, philharmonic concerts, and housing its most recent role. In 1998, with the property in deep degradation, it was acquired by the Lisbon City Council, making the recovery and rehabilitation from November 1999 until July 2001. Currently the former convent houses 34 families, a community center, a restaurant and the Museu da Marioneta. History The museum was created in 1987 by the S√£o Louren√ßo Puppet Company that was dedicated to the realization of traveling shows across the country and the foreigner. It was created thus the first Portuguese space dedicated to puppetry, from the extinction of the Bairro Alto Theatre in 1755, continuing a Portuguese tradition of theater and opera. The existence of a Portuguese tradition of theater and puppet opera, very important in the history of European theater, represented by the historical repertoire of operas for puppet Ant√≥nio Jos√© da Silva, the Jew, and the popular repertoire of numerous street companies of puppeteers that the over the centuries traveled the country. The Society of St. Lawrence, founded by Jos√© Alberto Gil, musician, and Helena Vaz, puppeteer and artist, raised as a result of its activity, several copies of puppets that formed the initial core of the museum. The property degradation it was in the private management of the Museum and the lack of support or institutional subsidies made it difficult economic viability and the maintenance of a project that, over 13 years, Lisbon represented on the international circuit of marionette. The importance of the collection and the fact that it is the only museum of its kind in Portugal led to the signing of an agreement between the owner of the original collection and the Lisbon City Council, through the EGEAC municipal company, which allowed the maintenance of this museum and its transfer in 2001 to a space that allows its public enjoyment in conditions of dignity it deserves. In 2007/2008, the Museum of Puppetry has undergone rehabilitation and expansion works under an application to the operational POC-Cultural Program, which allowed the creation of appropriate conditions for exhibitions and shows, the expansion of the permanent exhibition circuit, the store installation in a new space, larger and more suitable for the reception of visitors.

Peck (December 3, 1902 ‚Äì August 23, 1990) was an American jurist. From 1947 to 1957 he was Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals of the Supreme Court in New York, and in that time took a leading role in the reform of judiciary of that state. In 1950, in Germany, Peck led the Advisory Board on Clemency on recommendations for the pardon of convicted war and Nazi criminals. Life and work David Warner Peck was born in Crawfordsville in Indiana (Crawfordsville is the administrative head of Montgomery County and home to Wabash College, a private college). Peck skipped his senior year of high school and began at age 16 to study in Wabash College where after three years, instead of the usual four, he graduated with honors. He then studied law at Harvard Law School. To finance his studies he worked as a tutor. Joan Cook: David W. Peck, 87, Former Justice And Court Reformer in New York. After graduating and receiving his license to practice law in the New York State Bar, Peck joined the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell where he remained connected throughout his life in 1934.New York State Bar Bulletin, Bd. 30. He was 31 years as a partner with Sullivan and Cromwell and involved in civil litigation. Peck was a Republican in the early 1930s and was with Thomas E. Dewey and Herbert Brownell of the so-called \\"Young Turks\\" of the Republican party in New York County. In 1943, Peck was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of New York. In 1947, Peck was appointed Presiding Judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the 1st District and was thus responsible for the districts of Manhattan and the Bronx. Peck at his appointment was 44 years old and thus was the youngest judge to date of this rank in the State of New York. In 1957 Peck returned to Sullivan and Cromwell where he remained until his retirement in 1980. In 1955, Peck wrote The Greer Case about a 1946 case of deceased Mabel Seymour Greer, in which he himself was involved as a judge. Mrs. Greer admitted before her death to have given a son up for adoption after birth, but the entire substantial fortune of this otherwise childless woman was bequeathed to Harvard University. An alleged son contested the will.Mrs. Greens Secret ‚Ä¶(Time Magazine) The book became a best seller, going through eight editions by Penguin and Reader's Digest Edition, and in 1957 was filmed as an episode of CBS-Series Playhouse 90 . = \\"Peck Panel\\" = US High Commissioner for Germany John McCloy convened in March 1950 as the Advisory Board on Clemency (dt: Advisory board for Pardon, named after its chairman the Peck Panel) as an independent expert panel recommendations to prison of persons convicted by US Military tribunals as convicted war criminals. The Panel included in addition to Peck as Chairman, two other persons: Frederick A. Moran, Chairman of the New York Board of Parole and brigadier general Conrad E. Snow, Legal Advisor of the US State Department.Earl: The Nuremberg SS-Einsatzgruppen Trial. The legal status of Peck panel was not fully understood: neither should it be a court of appeal, because the judgments on the legal basis of Control Council Law No. 10 did not see any reviewing body, nor the mere exercise of the grace legislation was provided, which is more personal to the circumstances of the convicted person. In practice, had the Peck Panel Properties of Cassation as of grace Committee. By the Peck panel subjected the mercy petitions of the convicts and the exculpatory briefs their defense lawyers into consideration, however, the prosecution did not hear again, a mitigation of the sentences was applied already structurally.Thomas Alan Schwartz: John McCloy and the Landsberg Cases. The Peck Panel was on the mercy petitions of 99 convicts, all were in prison for war criminals in Landsberg. The Peck panel was on August 28, 1950 gave its recommendations. In 77 of 99 cases, the panel recommended a reduction of the penalty; this should seven of the 15 death sentences be converted into imprisonment. The Peck Panel said, inter alia for the following convicted of the Subsequent Nuremberg processes recommends that: * For 20 convicted in the Einsatzgruppen trial: ** 7 x maintain the death penalty (Blobel, Braune, Klingelh√∂fer, Naumann, Ohlendorf, Ott, Sandberger) ** 4 x conversion of the death penalty to 20 (Blume) or 15 years (Biberstein, Haensch, Steimle) ** 2 x immediate release of persons sentenced to death (Schubert, Seibert) ** 2 x conversion of a life sentence to 10 years (Jost, Nosske) ** 1 x shortening of a prison sentence from 20 to 10 years (Schulz) ** 4 x immediate release of a prison sentence of 20 (Radetzky, Six) and 10 years (Fendler, R√ºhl) * For convicts of the Krupp Trial: ** Release from 12 years' imprisonment Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, one of the most prominent cases. ** Reducing the sentences of other defendants (inter alia Houdremont and M√ºller) * For those convicted in the High Command Trial: ** Reducing the sentences of other defendants (inter alia) K√ºchler, Reinecke, Warlimont * For those convicted in the Hostages Trial:McCloy: \\"Keine generelle Amnestie\\". ** Reducing the sentences of other defendants inter alia of Felmy, Lanz, Rendulic * For convicts of the Ministries Trial: ** Reducing the sentences of other defendants inter alia of Lammers, Schwerin-Krosigk, Ernst von Weizs√§cker The US High Commissioner John McCloy, who had to make the final decision, disagreed with the recommendations of the Panel Peck in a number of cases. His legal adviser and closest confidant, Robert R. Bowie, advised in particular to grant the convicted generals no preferential treatment. On January 31, 1951 McCloy finally announced his decisions. They deviated in a number of cases from the recommendation of the Panel Peck, and was for some stricter, for others less severe. Only five death sentences from the NMT judgments remained in force. Of the five Death cases reviewed by the Peck Panel, four death sentences were carried out in August 1951:(Blobel, Braune, Naumann, Ohlendorf).A fifth IMT Judgement Death sentence carried out in June 1951 was that of SS General Oswald Pohl Publications * The Greer Case, a true court drama.

He joined the United States Navy in 1941, and was assigned to Station HYPO at Pearl Harbor in early 1942 to join the team working to decipher Japanese naval codes. He retired from the navy in 1945 with the rank of Lieutenant commander. After leaving the navy, Bodman enrolled at Yale, where he obtained his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D., with a study of the phonology of the Shiming. He worked at the Foreign Service Institute from 1950 until 1962, rising to head to the Department of Far Eastern languages. Between 1951 and 1952, he was in Malaya on loan to the British government, where he created a course on Hokkien that is still a definitive reference. In 1962, Bodman joined the faculty of Cornell University, where he stayed until his retirement in 1979. He continued to do fieldwork on Tibeto-Burman languages and Min dialects. In an unpublished paper presented at Princeton in 1971, he proposed a novel six-vowel system for a stage of Chinese prior to the Old Chinese of the earliest records. This system was later developed as a proposal for Old Chinese itself by Bodman's student William Baxter, and independently by Sergei Starostin and Zhengzhang Shangfang, and is now widely accepted. He marshaled his ideas on Old Chinese and its relationship with Sino-Tibetan in an influential treatment published in 1980.

Part of a history of interactions between the Bengal Sultanate and Sharifate of Mecca, an account of these can be found in the Tarikh Makkah (History of Makkah). Histrory Sultan Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah founded two institutes in Makkah and Madinah during his reign in Bengal from 1390 to 1411. The Madrasah as-Sultaniyyah al-Ghiyathiyyah al-Banjaliyah of Makkah was located near the gate of Umm Hani of Masjid al-Haram. Construction began in Ramadan 1411 CE and was completed in 1412 CE. The contemporary Arab scholar Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Fasi worked in this madrasa as teacher of Maliki fiqh and other teachers included Jamal ad-Din Qarshi, Shihab ad-Din Saghani, Muhy ad-Din Fasi, Abul Hasan al-Haskafi and the Shibi family. The curriculum of the institution taught fiqh from all different madhhabs. The Ghiyathiyyah of Madinah was situated near Bab as-Salam in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi. The Sultan also commissioned money to buy property for establishing and to maintain both of these institutes. He sent a lot of money to repair the Arafat Stream. However, the Sharif of Makkah, Hasan ibn Ajlan, decided to use the money given by the Sultan for another project instead. The madrasas were said to be the best institutions in the region during this period. A later Sultan of Bengal, Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, had good relations with Barakat ibn Hasan, the Sharif of Makkah, sent him presents and robes of honour. The Sultan gained permission from the Sharif to construct a madrasah in the city of Makkah. He is also said to have constructed a madrasah in Madinah between 1428 and 1431.

After working as demonstrator of anatomy at the Middlesex, Levitt was house surgeon at Bedford County Hospital and Gloucester Royal Infirmary and surgical assistant medical officer at the Paddington General Hospital.

The knowledge he gained at the New End thyroid clinic ‚Äì where for a long time he was associated with Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Mr JE Piercy ‚Äì culminated in his election to a Hunterian Professorship of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1952. On his appointment, he reportedly held his audience spellbound with his address ‚Äì ‚Äúa model of its kind‚Äù ‚Äì on The Status of Lymphadenoid Goitre, Hashimoto's Disease and Riedel's Disease. His huge experience and research culminated in the publication in 1954 of his magnum opus, The Thyroid: A Physiological, Pathological, Clinical and Surgical Study. The book, which was translated into Italian in 1955 and remained a standard textbook for several decades, provoked world-wide discussion. He was lecturer in surgery to the Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine at the New End Hospital for a number of years. Early in 1952 he had the first of several attacks of coronary thrombosis, which returned in 1955 during an extensive lecture tour in the United States under the auspices of the Kellogg Foundation and the International College of Surgeons. He battled bravely on for several years in spite of ill-health which was a constant concern to those who knew him, but about which he seldom spoke. His health precluded him from continuing work as an operating surgeon, but in spite of this disappointment he achieved happiness through his interest in endocrinology in relation to cancer, and was attached to the Royal Marsden Hospital in a research capacity where he dedicated himself to finding answers to various problems in this field. He used the Hunterian method, collecting the facts (recorded in his note-books in his neat handwriting), classifying them with enthusiasm before making his deductions, which he explained with lucidity. He was a very sick man in his final years and was at work on a book on carcinoma and the thyroid when he died, in the Charing Cross Hospital, of coronary thrombosis, on 22 February 1958 at the age of fifty years.

An excellent and inspiring teacher, it was said of him that he poured out his life's blood for his students, often refusing financial recompense, and that many who had abandoned hope of ever passing their examinations found new hope with him.

The consequent cataclysm would have released an enormous amount of energy and had far-reaching consequences. If further research can prove that there was indeed such an impact, it is likely that it would be considered a major event in Earth's geological history.  Site  Palaeozoic impact structure. The zone in which the Winton asteroid impact theoretically happened lies in a sparsely populated area in the Australian Outback centred roughly at . It is roughly circular and its diameter measures some Glikson et al., 2016 (and it thus has an area of about ). The depopulated town of Middleton and Dagworth Station ‚Äì famous for the part it played in the creation of \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" ‚Äì lie within the anomaly discovered here. Skirting the anomaly zone for more than half its circumference, mostly on the north and east sides, round from its headwaters to well below its confluence with the Western River, is the Diamantina River, an intermittent stream with, in most places, several braided channels of the kind that give the Channel Country its name. It was this particular hooked shape in the upper Diamantina that first raised questions.  Name  It was a while after the discovery of this round zone in Queensland and the formulation of the theory about its cosmic creation before the matter of a proper name had been settled. Geoscience Australia referred to the ‚ÄúWoodstock-Winton circular drainage ring‚Äù in a map caption (Woodstock is another station in the zone where research was done) in reference to the Diamantina's course there, whereas Winton's local news outlet, the Winton Herald, refers to the ‚ÄúWinton Asteroid Theory‚Äù. However, the scientific community now seems to have settled upon \\"Diamantina River ring feature\\".  Discovery  Kennedy Developmental Road. The Diamantina River's hook-shaped upper reaches had long been a puzzle to science. To Dr. Andrew Glikson, whose research interests include \\"early crustal evolution with focus on the role of asteroid impacts\\", the near-circular course was the first indication that there might be an anomaly in the crust in this region. Glikson's research into the matter revealed several noteworthy things about this round zone. For instance, the circular zone inside the upper Diamantina is a \\"magnetically quiet zone\\", according to data yielded by studies of the local magnetic fields, whereas the neighbouring rock shows a more linear pattern in its magnetic signatures. Reflection seismology, used on a line transecting the zone's outer rim, also revealed ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù differences between the rock within the anomaly and outside it. It can thus be inferred that the possible cause is a disturbance of the deep crust by something like a great impact. Gravimetry revealed some interesting information about the anomaly's centre, which itself contains a gravimetric anomaly. This told the researchers about differences in rock densities as compared to neighbouring areas of crust, likewise suggesting that there could long ago have been a major impact event. On the whole, the information gathered at Woodstock Station is comparable to that found at buried asteroid impact structures, but currently, final proof is lacking. The Diamantina River ring feature was, after all, discovered in 2015.  Proof  Proof is the one thing currently wanting in any quest to label the Diamantina River ring feature an asteroid impact structure. However, the scientists involved see that as rather a straightforward matter of drilling core samples in the zone and then analyzing them. Richard Blewett from Geoscience Australia quoted the needed depth for these samples as ‚Äúabout three kilometres‚Äù, whereas Geoscience Australia says in its own report, somewhat more conservatively, that the depth will have to be ‚Äúmany hundreds of metres‚Äù. Analysis of the core samples would involve, among other things, the detection of ‚Äúshock textures‚Äù in the rock, caused by the great energy of an asteroid impact. Impact event The impact event is, as of this writing, only theoretical. Its reality is far from certain. Richard Blewett, mentioned above, admits that there are other possible explanations for the geological anomaly on the upper Diamantina, but adds ‚Äúbut they become difficult to explain‚Äù. Whether the Diamantina River ring feature was truly created by an asteroid falling out of the sky or not, the scientists at Geoscience Australia have some very definite ideas about this theoretical natural missile. It is believed, for instance, that the event happened some 300 million years ago, in the Palaeozoic. At that time, Australia lay quite a long way south of where it now lies. It had not yet rifted apart from Antarctica; both continents, and others, were joined together as parts of Gondwana. The theoretical asteroid itself is reckoned to have measured ten kilometres across, and when it struck, the energy that it released was equivalent to 650 million Hiroshima A-bombs (and thus roughly 41 zettajoules). Richard Blewett believes that the course of Earth's history would have been changed by the enormous blast unleashed by such a strike, and pointed out that there has been an association between these events and great changes in the course of evolution. Geoscience Australia, on the other hand, only pointed out the importance that such an event has to understanding the evolution of Earth's crust and the economic significance, as such formations may contain petroleum or other mineral wealth.

Three died and three were hospitalized, one critically; of the officers who died, two were members of the Baton Rouge Police Department, while the third worked for the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office. Long, who associated himself with organizations linked to black separatism and the sovereign citizen movement, was shot and killed by a SWAT officer during a shootout with police at the scene. Police arrested and questioned two other suspects, but Long was confirmed to be the only person involved in the shooting. Background The shooting occurred during a period of unrest in Baton Rouge, though it is unclear if the events are related. Baton Rouge was experiencing ongoing protests following the officer-involved killing of Alton Sterling less than two weeks before on July 5. On July 7, the FBI's New Orleans field office issued a warning about \\"threats to law enforcement and potential threats to the safety of the general public\\" stemming from the death of Sterling. Within the previous week, four suspects were arrested in connection with an alleged plot to kill Baton Rouge police officers, which was described as a credible threat by law enforcement officials. Ten days earlier, five police officers were killed in a mass shooting in Dallas. Shooting Map of area around Airline Highway near I-12. Hammond Aire Plaza, where Long began the shooting sometime before 8:40 a.m. The area around B-Quik convenience store and Hair Crown Beauty Supply where Long shot six police officers, killing three, until he was shot and killed by SWAT at 8:48 a.m. The Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters, where protests in response to the police killing of Alton Sterling took place in the weeks prior to the shooting by Long. Long arrived at Hammond Aire Plaza, a shopping complex on Airline Highway, sometime before 8:40 a.m. CT and began scouting the area in search of police officers. He first spotted a police patrol vehicle parked at a B-Quik convenience store; it belonged to a sheriff's deputy who was working security in the area. Long parked his vehicle behind an adjacent building, got out, and prepared to shoot, but found that the vehicle was empty. He then drove north and noticed a police officer washing his vehicle a short distance away, but the officer left before Long could get close. By 8:40a.m., police received a call about a suspicious person carrying a rifle near the plaza. However, due to Louisiana's open carry law at the time, the potential threat of Long was downplayed, with one dispatcher describing him as a \\"subject walking with a coat and an assault rifle.\\" Authorities were going to question him and had no probable cause to take him into custody. When officers arrived at the scene, they found Long clad in black and wearing a face mask behind the Hair Crown Beauty Supply store on the 9600 block of Airline Highway. Shots were reportedly fired two minutes later. Another two minutes afterwards, there were reports that officers were down. According to investigators, Long fired upon the first responding officers, fatally wounding three. He first shot and killed a police officer, and shot and wounded his partner who fell to the ground. A third officer tried to help the wounded policeman, but Long engaged him in a gunfight as he approached, and killed him with multiple gunshot wounds. Long then shot the first wounded officer twice more, killing him as well. Long then turned around and shot another police officer standing outside a store and then moved to another part of the complex, where he shot and wounded two sheriff's deputies who were investigating his car. At 8:46a.m., he was reported to be near Benny's Car Wash. Officers fired on Long from behind the cover of patrol cars. Eventually, a SWAT team responded to the scene; one member took aim at Long from about away and killed him at about 8:48a.m. Louisiana State Police said Long was the only person involved in the shooting. The entire shooting lasted for less than ten minutes. Officers used a robot to check Long's body for explosives. A preliminary investigation determined that Long was targeting officers and ignoring civilians. A preliminary autopsy indicated that in addition to being shot by the SWAT officer, Long suffered multiple other gunshot wounds. Police recovered from the crime scene an IWI Tavor SAR 5.56-caliber rifle and a Springfield Armory XD 9mm pistol. A third weapon‚Äîa Stag Arms M4-type 5.56-caliber semi-automatic rifle‚Äîwas recovered from Long's rental Malibu. Officials believed Long had intentions of attacking the Baton Rouge police headquarters and continuing to kill officers. Victims Two Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) officers and one East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's deputy were killed in the shooting, while three others, a police officer and two sheriff's deputies (Police Officer Chad Montgomery was grazed by a single bullet in the head, Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas Tullier was shot and wounded three times in the head, abdomen and upper arm, and Sgt. Bruce Simmons was hit once in the left arm) were injured. The injured were transported to Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, which said it received five patients from the shooting, three of whom later died from multiple gunshot wounds. Of the surviving two, one was in critical condition, being on life support as of August 3, and the other in fair condition. The third injured officer was transported to Baton Rouge General Medical Center and treated for non-life-threatening injuries. The critically injured officer was moved to TIRR Memorial Hermann, a recovery facility in Houston, Texas, on November 16. The officers killed were identified as: *Deputy Brad Garafola, 45, who had been with the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office since 1992. *Officer Matthew Gerald, 41, a former Marine who had been with the BRPD for four months. *Corporal Montrell Jackson, 32, who had been with the BRPD since 2006. Perpetrator Gavin Eugene Long (July 17, 1987 ‚Äì July 17, 2016) was identified as the shooter. He was a resident of Kansas City, Missouri. In May 2015, Long filed papers in Jackson County, Missouri, to change his legal name to Cosmo Ausar Setepenra, but court officials there said he never completed the process of legally changing his name. Long was believed to have traveled more than from his hometown to Baton Rouge using a rental car. He was also believed to have been in Baton Rouge for \\"several days\\" prior to the shooting. Long committed the shooting on his 29th birthday. Long's body was released to his family on July 26, and a funeral was planned in Arkansas for a later date. =Personal life= Long grew up in Kansas City and graduated from high school in 2005. His parents divorced when he was eleven, and his father was neglectful of Long, according to court records. He failed to appear on scheduled visits with his son while the divorce was pending, and did not deliver birthday or Christmas presents to him. Court records described one instance where Long was picked up by his father, but dropped off at a day care facility at a casino shortly after. Long served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a data network specialist from August 22, 2005, to August 1, 2010. He was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant. During his military service, he was deployed to Iraq from June 2008 to January 2009. He was also assigned to units in San Diego, California, and Okinawa, Japan. Long was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, along with an Iraq Campaign Medal, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy Unit Commendation, and others. Following his military service, Long told relatives and friends that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He reportedly had prescriptions for Ativan and Valium, both anti-anxiety drugs; Lunesta, a sleep aid; and citalopram, an antidepressant. Health records from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) reportedly indicated contacts with Long from 2008 to August 2013. The VA records said that Long told doctors that he contracted PTSD after a friend showed him photos of maimed and decapitated bodies while they were in Iraq. In November 2011, doctors contradicted Long's suspicions of PTSD and instead diagnosed him as having \\"adjustment disorder with depressed mood.\\" They eventually concluded that he was mentally stable, with no evidence that he was a threat to himself or others. According to Long's mother, the VA then sent him a letter denying him further treatment on the grounds that his disorder was not related to his military service. Long's mental health and related combat experience may have been a factor leading to the shooting. Long graduated from Central Texas College, attending the college's San Diego site at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and via an online education program from fall 2007 to summer 2011; he received an associate of arts degree in general studies. Long studied at Clark Atlanta University during the 2012-13 academic year. Long also spent one semester at the University of Alabama, in spring 2012, with his name making it to the Dean's List as a general business major. According to local court records, Long had no criminal record and was married for two years before the couple divorced. =Views and statements= Long was identified as a \\"black separatist\\" by a law enforcement official. Mass shooting scholars said that Long displayed hallmarks of a \\"disgruntled, paranoid loner\\" (a common type of mass killer), with a narcissistic and grandiose personality. Social media posts indicated that he was an active member of the anti-government New Freedom Group. According to CNN, a card was found on Long's body, suggesting that he was a member of the Washitaw Nation, a group of African Americans associated with the sovereign citizen movement that originated in Richwood. In addition to changing his legal name, he claimed his nationality was \\"United Washitaw de Dugdahmoundyah Mu'ur\\", and expressed his support for the Moorish Science Temple of America, another African American organization associated with the sovereign citizen movement. However, Long disavowed all prior associations in a recent video, saying, \\"Don't affiliate me with nothing. ... I'm affiliated with the spirit of justice.\\" In April 2015, while in West Africa, Long also became a member of a group dedicated to helping \\"Targeted Individuals\\" suffering from \\"remote brain experimentation, remote neural monitoring of an entire humans body.\\" He asked to be put on the group's \\"buddy list\\", but he unexpectedly deactivated his account a month later. His mother said he once believed the Central Intelligence Agency was following him. He appeared as a guest on an online show discussing \\"Targeted Individuals\\", but downplayed his belief that he was being tracked, saying, \\"That's just a small aspect of me. It's not a complete picture of who I am.\\" However, the show's host, who had frequent phone and email correspondence with Long, claimed that Long was adamant about being tracked during their communications. In a \\"rambling\\" series of YouTube clips, Long claimed to be a former Nation of Islam member and referred to Alton Sterling, a black man killed by Baton Rouge police officers on July 5, in online videos. Long operated his YouTube channel under his new legal name, Cosmo Setepenra, making references to oppression against blacks and police protests. At one point less than two weeks before committing the shooting, Long called the shootings of five Dallas police officers an act of \\"justice\\". In one video, he said, \\"One hundred percent of revolutions... have been successful through fighting back through bloodshed.\\" In another, he said the act of peaceful protesting was a futile method based on emotion and was easily forgettable. Long also maintained a personal website in which he described himself as a \\"freedom strategist, mental game coach, nutritionist, author and spiritual advisor.\\" The website contained dozens of additional videos and podcasts. Long wrote and self-published (also under the name \\"Cosmo Setepenra\\") three books about \\"how to be a strong man\\" and self-empowerment for black males, which all appeared on Amazon.com in October and November 2015. The books were described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"bizarre\\" works featuring a \\"combination of New Age-style jargon, pseudoscience, motivational bromides, health tips and racial theory.\\" In the books, Long harshly criticized Western medicine, denied the germ theory of disease, and asserted that \\"[t]he abundance of Melanin in Black humans produces a superior organism both mentally and physically.\\" The books were pulled from Amazon.com after the shooting. According to one of his books, he spent two years in several African countries studying their histories and cultures. In addition to the books, Long wrote two diaries--one in 2014 and the other in 2015--where he shared \\"rambling thoughts\\" about philosophy, religion, and politics. Sahib Taylor, a nephew of Long, told The Los Angeles Times that his uncle would teach him about the importance of self-reliance, share his views on racism, and assert that \\"only advanced survival skills and decisive action\\" could overthrow the U.S. government. Taylor said that Long recently began sharing his beliefs that international corporations, federal banks, and political organizations were influencing ethnic groups for their own gain; and that the government was using police to control and kill people. =Before the shooting= Within the preceding six months, Long visited the shooting range of a gun shop in Olathe, Kansas, and purchased a target that he used in shooting practice, according to an employee. The same employee also said Long did not purchase any firearms or exhibit any strange behavior at the store. In a ten-minute video, Long claimed that he arrived at Baton Rouge not to protest Sterling's death, but to educate local blacks. He also expressed his distaste for white people and mentioned Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party, in a rambling, one- sided conversation. He had previously made a similar recording using a body camera while visiting barbershops in Dallas sometime after the shooting there, to promote one of his books. A friend said that Long visited him in DeSoto, Texas, two days after the Dallas shooting; during the visit, Long obsessively watched video footage of Sterling's death and praised the Dallas shooter Micah Xavier Johnson, saying \\"at least he did something\\". The same friend said that Long also showed him a Washitaw Nation card and unsuccessfully urged him to join. Long's mother said that he would get upset at news stories of black men being shot by police, often renting cars and using them to drive to locations where such shootings occurred to pass out his books. Less than an hour before the shooting, Long purportedly emailed a three-page, handwritten letter, self- described as a \\"manifesto\\", to a Columbus, Ohio, musician whose YouTube videos he commented on. In the letter, Long described his belief that the shooting was necessary to \\"create substantial change within America's police force.\\" He also wrote his belief that there was a \\"concealed war\\" between \\"good cops\\" and \\"bad cops\\", and that he had to attack \\"bad cops\\" as vengeance for perceived destruction that they continued to inflict on blacks. Aftermath Funeral procession for one of the fallen officers on July 23, 2016. Although Long was said to have acted alone in the shooting, police arrested and questioned two other people in Addis as part of the investigation. They were later identified as Damarcus Alexander, a cousin of slain victim Corporal Montrell Jackson, and Alexander's friend Den'Trell White. According to them, police held them for seven hours, barring them from making any phone calls and refusing to give Alexander diabetic medication even after they were made aware of his condition. Both were eventually released without any charges being filed. At the time, Alexander was unaware of Jackson's death during the shooting. A spokesman for the Louisiana State Police responded to Alexander's claim of police mistreatment, saying, \\"No complaints or concerns have been brought to our attention.\\" Following this shooting and a previous one in Dallas, Texas, that killed five police officers and wounded nine others, local law enforcement agencies across the U.S. began readjusting response strategies, with more officers being paired up in patrol vehicles. On July 28, the victims of the shooting were honored at a memorial service in Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge. Hundreds of people were in attendance. Governor Edwards, Vice President Joe Biden, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and the wives of the victims made speeches during the service. = Louisiana's open carry law = The shooting renewed attention on Louisiana's open carry law, which some law enforcement officials have expressed discomfort towards, believing openly carrying citizens could complicate police matters. Some elected officials have made calls for a reevaluation of the state's open carry law. However, previous attempts at altering state gun laws have resulted in failure due to an amendment to the Louisiana State Constitution in 2012, which gave strong gun ownership protection laws and required limitations of any kind to be faced with strict scrutiny. State Senator Jean-Paul Morrell remarked that gun control bills filed every year in the state are \\"almost universally unsuccessful.\\" James Gill, a columnist with The Advocate wrote an op-ed addressing the state gun laws and their legal complications on August 11. =Reactions= President Barack Obama condemned the shooting in a statement and added, \\"These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop.\\" Later that day, he ordered for all flags in the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims. On July 22, Obama met with law enforcement officials in Washington, D.C., and pledged solidarity in the wake of this shooting and the one in Dallas. Governor John Bel Edwards released a statement immediately after the shooting, saying, \\"This is an unspeakable and unjustified attack on all of us at a time when we need unity and healing.\\" On the day after, he called the shooting \\"pure evil\\" and \\"a diabolical attack on the very fabric of society.\\" In an interview, Mayor Kip Holden recommended police agencies across the U.S. to put their officers on high alert and urged Americans to be \\"vocal about their support for law enforcement\\". =Legal= On June 30, 2017, district attorney Hillar C. Moore, III released a report, clearing the officers who killed Long of wrongdoing.In re.

He is the Chung Wan constituency member of the Central and Western District Council and the Legislative Councillor for the Hong Kong Island constituency. Hui was born in Hong Kong and raised in Tuen Mun. He received his education in Canada and Hong Kong. In 2006, Hui earned his bachelor's degree in law with honors from the City University of Hong Kong. District Council In the 2011 District Council elections, Hui successfully succeeded veteran Yuen Bun-keung's Central and Western District Council seat in the Chung Wan constituency which covers the Central area. Hui first caught media attention for his protests in the council. In 2014, he was ejected from a meeting of the council's working group on civic education when protesting the council's decision to grant HK$150,000 (of a HK$250,000 total grant) to pro-Beijing groups. Hui complained that there was a conflict of interest because several of the councillors were members of or advisers to the recipients. In the process of ejection, he was injured by council security personnel, resulting in his party's demand for an apology from the district office. Hui was considered to be quite radical within the Democratic Party. He opposed the party's meetings with Beijing officials. In 2015, when the party's central committee member Wong Sing-chi publicly called on pan-democrats to back Beijing's restrictive reform model for the 2017 Chief Executive election, Hui led a call for the party to investigate whether Wong had violated any of its internal rules. Wong was expelled from the party. Legislative Council Hui ran in the Democratic Party's intra-party primary for candidacy in Hong Kong Island in the 2016 Legislative Council Elections and won against Wilfred Chong Wing-fai and officially assumed office on 1 October 2016. Hui has been vocal on environmental issues, education, human rights and democracy. He was very much involved in pushing for the banning of ivory trade in Hong Kong. Hui also shows high concerns on the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong and encourages the international community to speak up for Hong Kong. He was also active during the debate over the controversial Hong Kong Express Rail Link co-location controversy. In April 2018, Hui was under police investigation for snatching a Security Bureau executive officer's phone and taking it to a Legislative Council Complex toilet on 24 April 2018. The Democratic Party suspended the lawmaker and criticized him for seriously tarnishing the reputation of lawmakers. Hui later apologized to the executive officer and admitted that his action was \\"not appropriate\\". Hui, however, claimed that the employee had been \\"recording the entry and exit time of lawmakers\\", including himself, into a meeting room and the Legco complex. He alleged that there was a breach of the privacy ordinance. Hui was charged with three offences, including common assault, dishonest access to a computer and obstructing a public officer in the execution of their duties. Hui pleaded not guilty to all three charges. In May 2019, Hui was found guilty of one count of common assault on a senior executive officer. In July 2020, Hui faces a censure motion at the Legislative Council for phone snatching. On 28 May 2020, Hui disrupted the second reading of the National Anthem Bill in the Legislative Council by dropping a container containing rotten plant matter inside the chamber. A fellow lawmaker was taken to hospital after being exposed to the smell. On 4 June 2020, Hui and two other lawmakers, Eddie Chu and Raymond Chan, were alleged with hindering the business of the Legislative Council and violating the Powers and Privileges Ordinance, with Hui having dropped foul smelling liquid during the LegCo session on that day. Hui was subsequently fined HK$52,000 for his misconduct. On 26 August 2020, Hui was arrested on charges related to a protest on 6 July 2019 in Tuen Mun.

It operated from 1929 to 1963. After the merger of the Erie and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;) in 1960 it was known as the Erie-Lackawanna Limited. Once the premier passenger train on the Erie, repeated service reductions in the 1950s and 1960s left it a shell of its former self. The Phoebe Snow replaced it in 1963.  History  The Erie Limited debuted on June 2, 1929, replacing the Southern Tier Express, which had run between Jersey City and Buffalo, New York. The new service joined two other Jersey City‚ÄìChicago trains: the Atlantic Express/Pacific Express and Chicago Express/New York Express. The train included a Buffalo section with parlor and buffet service which split at Hornell, New York. The primary competitors to the Erie Limited were the New York Central Railroad's 20th Century Limited and the Pennsylvania Railroad's Broadway Limited. Both trains were well-established on the New York‚ÄìChicago run and enjoyed several advantages over the Erie Limited: direct access to Manhattan, faster running times (16 hours versus 24), and more luxurious accommodations. The Erie eschewed competition on these fronts and scheduled the Erie Limited for a morning departure from Jersey City so that it traversed the \\"spectacular..Delaware and Susquehanna river valleys\\" in daylight. Erie began offering packaged tours in the early 1930s as the Great Depression curtailed patronage. One such was the \\"3-way tours\\" announced in 1930, which involved a combination of bus, train, and steamship travel. The Erie offered a \\"Six Day All Expense Personally Conducted\\" tour for , originating from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, which included a tour of the Finger Lakes area, a steamship journey to Alexandria Bay, New York in the Thousand Islands, a tour of Toronto, and trip across Niagara Falls via the Great Gorge Route. The Erie later expanded these tours to \\"4-way\\", adding air travel to the mix. Passengers would take the Chicago Express to Cleveland, Ohio, fly to Detroit, Michigan, take a steamship to Buffalo, New York, tour Niagara Falls, then return to New York on the Erie Limited. All this still in six days, and at \\"moderate\\" price. The Erie discontinued the Buffalo section on February 12, 1951. The train continued running after the Erie's 1960 merger with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, but was renamed the Erie-Lackawanna Limited in January 1961. The train was re-routed over the Lackwanna's line between Hoboken and Binghamton and combined with the Phoebe Snow between Hoboken and Elmira. This change, carried out on April 30, 1961, proved short- lived. The Erie Lackawanna dropped the Phoebe Snow name on October 28, 1962, and put the Erie-Lackawanna Limited back on the ex-Erie route. By 1963 sleeping cars ran between Chicago and Binghamton only, although coaches continued to run through to the East Coast. Cutbacks continued through 1963: sleeping car service now ended at Hornell, while the diner-lounge ran between Hoboken and Youngstown, Ohio. The final blow came with the arrival of a new president of the Erie Lackawanna, William H. White. Although favorably disposed to passenger service, White had served as president of the Lackawanna from 1941‚Äì1952. White upgraded the Erie-Lackawanna Limited with a tavern- lounge car and restored through sleeping car service, but he also ordered it renamed the Phoebe Snow, effective October 27, 1963.  Equipment  In its original incarnation the Erie Limited had Pullman sleeping cars, coaches, a dining car, and a club-lounge. All the equipment was heavyweight. The Erie acquired four American series sleeping cars from Pullman-Standard in 1942. These lightweight cars had six sections, six roomettes, and four double bedrooms. One ran on each train. After World War II the Erie acquired seven more lightweight sleepers from Pullman-Standard, each with ten roomettes and six double bedrooms. The Erie Limited was assigned three of the sleepers: one in each direction between New York and Chicago, and one on the westbound Erie Limited between Akron and Chicago which returned on the Atlantic Express.  Route  The Erie Limited used the Erie's main line between the Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City and Chicago's Dearborn Station. From Jersey City passengers traveled to Manhattan via bus or the Pavonia Ferry. Major stops included Binghamton, New York and Akron, Ohio. In 1956 the eastern terminal shifted to the DL&W;'s Hoboken Terminal. For a short period in 1961‚Äì1963 the train used the ex-Lackawanna line between Hoboken and Binghamton.

Since 1974, Klein has been a professor in the School of Critical Studies at the California Institute of the Arts, where he is on the faculty of both the Master's Program in Aesthetics and Politics and the Center for Integrated Media. As layered systems that resemble certain genres of games and other media narrative formats, Klein's novels primarily offer literary alternatives. Having coined the term \\"scripted space\\" in 1998, Klein (with Margo Bistis) coined \\"Wunder roman\\" in 2012 to characterize a particular kind of picaresque novel whose parts function as a narrative engine. In 2004, the Beall Center for Art and Technology organized a retrospective of Klein's work. Early life and career Born in Brooklyn, Klein grew up in an immigrant neighborhood where he regularly heard people tell stories that were partly true and partly not, which informed his view of people's personal histories.Interview with Hans- Ulrich Obrist. 2015. In 1966, he earned a B.A. in History at Brooklyn College and then went on to the University of Minnesota, where he earned an M.A. in French Intellectual History in 1968. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles, where he began teaching at California Institute of the Arts before earning his M. F. A. in Cinema and Professional Writing from the University of Southern California. Klein has been a professor in the School of Critical Studies at California Institute of the Arts for over four decades.

Early life and China Vrooman was born in Allegany County, New York, on 15 August 1818.. He and his wife Elizabeth Clemens (1826‚Äì1854) went to Guangzhou (then known as \\"Canton\\") in March 1852, having been posted there by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.. Soon after their arrival, he wrote to Scientific American, with questions regarding the use of photographs in magic lanterns, the standard American methods of rice cleaning, and the use of india rubber in printing presses. Although Guangzhou had been opened to foreign trade by the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing ending the First Opium War, access to the walled cities of the Manchus and Chinese continued to be denied to foreigners, who were mostly kept to the mercantile ghetto of the Thirteen Factories on the southern shore of the western suburbs. Vrooman successfully made a highly accurate . map of the forbidden cities in 1855 by training one of his converts to pace the streets between major landmarks, marking a course by means of a compass and reference to the wall's major gates.. These measurements were then compared against Vrooman's own, based on the angles of the visible landmarks with the high points of the city's suburbs. The map was so well done that, upon the opening of the city by the treaties of Tianjin (1858) and Beijing (1860), they were found to need no major changes, although the Second Opium War had seen the destruction of the Thirteen Factories and the creation of a new enclave at Shamian. Elizabeth died in Macao in 1854 and he remarried three years later to Maria Wilberforce (1836‚Äì1866). He served as the American vice- consul and was said to have introduced mechanized cotton spinning to the city. In 1863, he published a Cantonese phonetic alphabet of his own devising. Later life Vrooman retired from the ABCFM's Guangzhou mission in 1866 or '67, but continued to work as an independent missionary in Guangzhou until 1878. In 1878, he was made superintendent over a mission to the Chinese in Victoria, Australia. He retired from this post in 1881. He died in Oakland, California, on 3 March 1895.

Opened in 1912 and enlarged in the 1930s with Works Progress Administration funding, it is locally distinctive for its Collegiate Gothic and Art Deco architecture, and for its importance to the city's education system. The building, now converted to residences, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history The Old Waterville High School stands on the north side of Gilman Street, between Burleigh and West Streets, in a residential area just west of the city's downtown. The school consists of three major sections, consisting of its original main section and two flanking wings. The central block is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brick with cast stone trim. It has a raised basement, and a pair of entrances set in Gothic arched openings. Its center bays project, and its upper-floor windows are grouped in tall panels, accentuating the building's height. To the west stands the 1936 training wing, which has a more streamlined design with echoes of the original, and to the east stands the 1938-39 gymnasium and auditorium wing, which is more ornate than the first wing but less so than the original block. Both wings are built using similar materials to the original block.Ives, Amy Cole; Smith, Melanie (2010). NRHP nomination for Waterville High School; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The main block was built in 1909-13 to a design by Freeman, Funk and Wilcox, an architectural firm based in Brookline, Massachusetts, and is one of its few known examples of educational architecture. The Collegiate Gothic style they chose is also uncommon in Maine, and typically appears only on college campuses. The wings were both designed by the Augusta firm of Bunker and Savage, specialists in educational architecture. Funding for the additions was provided by the federal Works Progress Administration. It was the city's second high school (and first after incorporation as a city), the first having been opened in 1876. It served as the city's high school until 1964, and then as its junior high school. The junior high was moved to new facilities in the 1970s, after which the building housed administrative offices and other education-related uses. It has since been redeveloped to primarily house low-income residents.

Over the past 36 years, the gallery's program has included significant works in the American vernacular from the Hudson River School to Impressionist, Modernist, Abstract Expressionist, and Contemporary Art. Hollis Taggart Galleries has organized exhibitions curated by gallery directors in conjunction with scholars. The gallery has also collaborated with over thirty museums and institutions to produce scholarly catalogues in the field of American art. History Hollis Taggart established his gallery in Los Angeles in 1979. Taggart's entr√©e into the art world was as a collector, and he eventually turned to the gallery business after several years of art collecting while practicing law in New Orleans. He holds degrees in art history, business, and law. After four years in Hollywood, the gallery relocated to the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. In 1994, Hollis Taggart Galleries expanded to a satellite location in New York's Upper East Side. The two galleries were consolidated in 1996, following Taggart's move to Manhattan. Located on 73rd Street, the gallery maintained an in-depth and scholarly exhibition program. A series of five groundbreaking exhibitions between 1997 and 2000 explored American Modernism in a considered and perceptive fashion that spearheaded the sort of scholarly exhibitions that are now common. These focused on artists such as Alfred Henry Maurer, Arthur Beecher Carles, Manierre Dawson, and others. The first of this series, The Color of Modernism: The American Fauves (29 April ‚Äì 26 July 1997), examined the American artists who studied directly under Matisse and the successive artists who adapted the Fauvist liberation of color to an American idiom. Organized by art historian William H. Gerdts, The Color of Modernism remains one of the pivotal exhibitions on the subject. From 2000 to 2006, the gallery again expanded to a second location, this time in Chicago. It was there that the gallery's program began to move more toward Abstract Expressionism and American Post War art, a direction that has continued into the present day. In 2005, Hollis Taggart Galleries moved from 73rd Street to Madison Avenue, and would reside for the next decade in sight of the landmark Marcel Breuer building that then housed the Whitney Museum of American Art. In the summer of 2015, Hollis Taggart Galleries opened a spacious 4,000-square-foot gallery in Manhattan's Chelsea gallery district. The gallery also retains a by- appointment-only townhouse gallery space on the Upper East Side. These two venues work in concert to further the gallery's aims. The gallery's current program emphasizes Post-War American art, yet continues to promote the American Modernists upon which the gallery built its reputation. The gallery also represents a select group of contemporary artists whose aesthetic is consistent with its historical vision. Exhibitions Scholarly research The gallery has also been involved in several long-term scholarly projects, including the ongoing research and publication of four catalogues raisonn√©s. The first, published in 2006, was the two-volume catalogue raisonn√© of Pennsylvania Impressionist Daniel Garber, which includes over 1,000 entries. The catalogue raisonn√© of pioneering American modernist Manierre Dawson was published in 2011. In 2000 the gallery launched the Frederick Carl Frieseke catalogue raisonn√© that is currently being compiled by the artist's grandson. Most recently, Hollis Taggart Galleries has undertaken the compilation of the catalogue raisonn√© of Surrealist artist Kay Sage, in partnership with Mark Kelman and Sage scholar Stephen Robeson Miller.

Career McDougall was one of five sons of Manchester flour merchant Alexander McDougall, who, in 1845, set up as a manufacturing chemist, and in 1864 recruited his sons into the business. John McDougall helped establish and grow the family's flour business in London, including construction in 1869 of the Wheatsheaf Mill on the southern quay of the Millwall Outer Dock. He was a Fellow of the Chemical Society. He and his brothers had been encouraged by their father to engage in charitable activities, and John McDougall eventually left the family business in 1888 to become a local councillor, focusing in particular on lunatic asylums and drains. He was a member of the Progressive Party and was elected to London County Council, representing - with Will Crooks  the Tower Hamlets district of Poplar from 1889 to 1913. He was elected chairman of the LCC 1902-03, and, on 26 June 1902, it was announced he would be knighted as part of the Coronation Honours of King Edward VII, the knighthood being conferred in a ceremony on 24 October 1902. He was also a prominent figure in Wesleyan Methodism, participating in a 1903 meeting announcing that London's Royal Aquarium would become the home of Wesleyanism in Great Britain. Family McDougall married twice. His second wife was Ellen Mary Lidgett, with whom he had a son Frank Lidgett McDougall (born in Greenwich, 16 April 1884 - died 1958) who became an Australian public servant and economist.

In 2012 he was elected in the new seat of Assin Central and was re-elected in 2016.  Early life and education  Ohene Agyapong was born in Assin Dompim in the Central Region of Ghana. He had his secondary education at Adisadel College in the Central Region. Agyapong holds a GCE A Level and studied in the Fordham University, New York, USA. He is a farmer and businessman, director of Assin Farms, Supercare Group of Companies and Hollywood Shopping Centre. He is married with 22 children. Politics His early political life was climaxed with his love for the truth and Ghana. Kennedy Agyapong still remains one of the politicians who have never lost election.His intellectual work in the 2016 elections resulted in the victory of Nana Addo Dankwah Akufo- Addo. He also contributed immensely to the victory of most NPP parliamentary candidates- such as K.T Hammond and many more. Kennedy Agyapong chairs the Communication Committee in Parliament, under the current presidency of Nana Akufo-Addo. Agyapong has vowed to commit suicide if former President John Mahama's brother, Ibrahim, is not jailed by the Akufo-Addo government for some corrupt activities which, according to Agyapong, have led to the state losing money. One example he claimed, was the defaulting of payment of taxes by Ibrahim Mahama for more than a year period when his brother was President of the Republic of Ghana. Agyapong's personal campaign on the issue to bring it to media attention led to the investigation of Ibrahim Mahama and subsequent agreement of Ibrahim Mahama to pay the said taxes. This action earned Kennedy Agyapong praises from a wide section of Ghanaians. Agyapong's indirect attack on the Electoral Commissioner of Ghana Charlotte Osei for, he alleged, trading sex for her position as the Electoral Commissioner (EC) boss brought upon him criticisms from various leaders including Queen mothers and human rights activists as well as other members of parliament. In 2018, following the arrest of Ghana Football Association president Kwasi Nyantakyi, he said that anti-corruption investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas should be stopped before he started investigating people in their \\"bedrooms whilst asleep\\".

Whatever happens, I'll pay.\\" Hussein-Suale was subsequently assassinated. In July 2018, he was cross examined for contempt of Parliament. He is believed to be the first Ghanaian individual to own an ¬¢8 million Rolls Royce, and is believed to also own a private jet, sparking calls for an investigation from the Customs Excise and Preventive Service into his wealth.

In 1981, he revived the M'Cool alter ego to record \\"American Memories\\", a single he recorded under his own label, Perspective Records. Pressing only ten copies of the record, he sent it to local Los Angeles radio stations with the assurance that the song would get promotion. However, the program directors who promised this had gone on vacation, and the song faded from memory. Despite this, the song's inclusion on playlists in a major radio market led to \\"American Memories\\" making the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #80. The song also made the Cash Box pop chart, peaking at #93. Due to M'Cool's bad experience with trying to make the song a hit, he rarely recorded music again. A 1988 single, Tuesday Nite In Texas b/w We Got Love, was also pressed on his own Perspective Records. Because of their limited pressings, all of Doyle's recordings became highly sought after by collectors, and have sold for as much as $3000 on eBay.

Henry was brother to Godfrey of Esch, and his family held the castle of Esch-sur-S√ªre in the Ardennes. He and his brother were vassals of Henry III, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother and successor William. His step-mother was Ermengarde, Countess of Clermont, widow of Gozelon, Count of Montaigu, the founder of the family of counts of Montaigu. Henry joined the First Crusade in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon, leaving for Jerusalem in August 1096. He accompanied Robert, Count of Flanders. to the Holy Land. In one account, he and Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut, were sent by Godfrey to secure the release of Hugh the Great who had been imprisoned by the Emperor Alexios. Runciman tells a different story. Rumors had it that arriving crusaders had been bestowed with bountiful gifts, and that Baldwin and Henry hastened to Constantinople to claim their share before the others could arrive, only to find the rumors false and Hugh in chains. It is reported that Godfrey was ‚Äúsomewhat disquieted‚Äù but it is not clear that his displeasure was with Hugh‚Äôs capture or with the haste of the departure of Baldwin and Henry. Henry and Hartmann, Count of Dillingen-Kyburg (Heinricus de Ascha, Hartmannus comes, unus de majoribus Alemanni√¶) constructed a siege engine known as the fox (vulpem) which collapsed when rushed into action at the siege of Nicaea in 1097. Henry was among a group of knights who guarded Adh√©mar de Monteil, Bishop of Puy-en-Valay, in the mountains above the port of St. Simeon after they discovered what they mistakenly believed to be the Holy Lance. The other knights guarding the bishop included Peter of Dampierre-le-Ch√¢teau, Count of Astenois, his nephew Reinhard III, Count of Toul, Reinhard of Hamersbach, Warner of Grez, and Walter, avou√© of St. Valery-sur-Somme and viscount of Domart-en-Ponthieu (husband of Hodierna, daughter of Guy I of Montlh√©ry). The monk Peter Bartholomew, discoverer of the lance, was also presumably present. Peter underwent an ordeal by fire to verify his claim, but did not survive his test of faith.

Description and history The Kedron Brook Bridge is located in a rural residential area of southern Woodstock, just east of the junction of Densmore Hill Road and Vermont Route 106. The bridge is a small single-span structure, wide and long, rising to about above Kedron Brook. The edges of the bridge are lined with a low concrete curb, on which a simple wooden railing has been mounted. (At the time of its National Register listing, it still had apparently original metal stanchions with yokes; these have since been removed.) The bridge's arch is fashioned out of irregularly shaped stone, which is predominantly granite, but includes other stone types commonly found in the vicinity. The exterior surfaces of the stone have been worked to some degree, and the gaps have been pointed with sandy mortar. with This bridge was built about 1810, and is of a type that were once quite common in the state, and were typically found in clusters where skilled stonemasons lived. The critical elements of the arch would have been built by such a mason, while the rubble fill and other elements of the work would have been done by lesser skilled labor. This bridge, while significantly older, is stylistically similar to the early 20th-century bridges of James Otis Follett, found in the Townshend area of Windham County.

All its content is submitted under a Creative Commons license, namely CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 BE.  Alternative  Kaat Van Damme's master thesis claims that DeWereldMorgen can be defined as an \\"alternative media\\" website with regards to content, editing, and business model. In the Belgian context, DeWereldMorgen has been coined together with ApacheApache - Inhoud heerst and Mondiaal Nieuws as alternative news media. It is characterized by politicization.  Content  The website aims to be independent of big media organizations and features the voices of non- governmental organizations and social movements. It also collaborates with similar partners such as StampMediaC.H.I.P.S. StampMedia  jongerenmedia- agentschap and . It can be characterized as preferring to be correct, rather than neutral. In relation to climate change, Yves Pepermans characterized DeWereldMorgen as coming \\"closest to a democratic arena\\" (compared with other Belgian newspapers De Standaard and De Morgen); and has claimed it criticizes the role of markets and stakeholders in relation to climate change, and that it advocates for larger public control over the economy for a socially just outcome for climate change. However, its addition to the debate is one-sided, and the media outlet has few readers.  Editing  Other than traditional media, there is less contrast between the professional journalist and the reader. Reactions can be posted even anonymously, and can only rarely be removed. Further more, DeWereldMorgen encourages readers to contribute to the website via a section of the website called \\"Community\\". Even though everybody can create new articles in the \\"Community\\", DeWereldMorgen is critical of the model of gatewatching: instead, a professional redaction selects articles for promotion to the front page. DeWereldMorgen also tries to inform its readers about changes within the website.  Business model  Because DeWereldMorgen presents oneself as a \\"movement for media and democracy\\", they receive subsidies; without which they would have serious financial troubles. Other than these subsidies, it is mostly dependent on financial partners, which can create a bias towards no negative articles about those partners. Micropayments, book sales, donations and lectures generate a smaller part of its revenue.

While DeWereldMorgen thinks it receives much too little subsidies in comparison to other media, an extreme-right nationalist website called \\"REACT\\" (where Vlaams Belang, Voorpost and :nl:Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond advertise) criticizes the website and its subsidies in denigrating language.

He was a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and senior member of the Supreme Soviet.  Early life and education  Bach grew up in Boryspil to a wine distillery technician's family. In 1875 he graduated from a high school in Kiev. After that he joined the Physico-Mathematical Department of at the University of Kiev. After various revolutionary efforts, he emigrated to France in 1885 and later to Switzerland. However, in 1878 he was expelled for taking part in student disturbances and joined the Narodnaya Volya (People's Freedom) revolutionary party which was active against the tsarist regime, was arrested and exiled to Belozersk, from where he returned to Kiev in December 1881 to continue his revolutionary activity. As from 1883 Bach went underground to live in Kharkov, Yaroslavl, Kazan and Rostov. During that period, he wrote his celebrated revolutionary book Tsar Hunger, which played an important role in spreading the ideas of scientific socialism in Russia.  Research  In 1885, after Narodnaya Volya was crushed, Bach emigrated to Paris to engage in scientific and literary work in the Montieur Scientifique journal. In 1890, he started experimental studies in the laboratory of Professor Paul Sch√ºtzenberger, a well-known chemist at the College de France in Paris. , which he followed in 1891 to a research trip in the United States. In 1894, Bach moved to Geneva, where he worked in his private chemical laboratory and did joint research with Professor R. Chodat of Geneva University, a well-known Swiss scientist. It was precisely during the Geneva period of his life that Bach developed his peroxide theory of respiratory processes and took active part in Swiss scientific activities. Swiss scientists showed respect for Bach: the Geneva Society of Physical and Natural Sciences elected him its chairman for the year 1916. built up an international reputation in medical and agricultural chemistry for his research on catalysis and photosynthesis. Bach's scientific focus was the study of the assimilation of carbon dioxide as well as the mechanism of oxidation to peroxides. Engler-Bach peroxide theory was named after him. Bach's initial works in the 1890s were devoted to the chemical mechanism of assimilation of carbon dioxide by green plants. At that time, Baeyer's concept was already prevalent in science. Proceeding from Butlerov's discovery that sugars form from formaldehyde under the effect of alkalis, Baeyer suggested that formaldehyde, which in condensing yields sugar, was the primary product of photosynthesis. In his works devoted to the biochemistry of photosynthesis, Bach, while agreeing with Baeyer in regard to the role of formaldehyde in the forming of sugar, gave a somewhat different interpretation of the mechanism itself.  Political Views  He was appointed its first director and the institute, where outstanding Soviet biochemists W.A. Engelgardt, A.E. Braunstein, B.I. Zbarsky, D.M. Mikhlin, A.I. Oparin, and others initially worked, played a major role in the development of biochemistry in the USSR. In 1929, Bach was elected full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1935, together with A.I. Oparin, he organized in Moscow the Institute of Biochemistry, USSR Academy of Sciences, of which he was director to the last days of his life; the institute is now named after Bach. Also in 1935, Bach founded the Soviet scientific journal Biochemistry and was elected President of the D.I. Mendeleev All-Union Chemical Society. In 1939, he was elected Academician-Secretary, Division of Chemical Sciences, USSR Academy of Sciences. In addition to being active in research and scientific organization, Bach was very active in public affairs: he was a member of the USSR Central Executive Committee and Deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet. A Bolshevik sympathizer, he moved back to Russia, 1917, and founded the Central Chemical Laboratory (the Karpov Physical Chemistry Institute from 1922), and remained there until his death. He undertook important research during the 1920s and advanced the use of chemicals in the food industry. He joined the Communist Party, 1927, and was made a member of the Soviet Central Executive Committee (VTslK), 1927. He was elected to the USSR Academy of Sciences, 1929, and president of the All-Union Chemistry Society, 1932. He founded the Biochemistry Institute, USSR Academy of Sciences, 1935, and also edited a biochemistry journal. As such he can be regarded as the father of Soviet biochemistry. He was elected a people's deputy, USSR Supreme Soviet, 1937, and became director of the department of chemical sciences, USSR Academy of Sciences, 1939. He was awarded a scare prize, 1941. Bach was elected a member of the Party Central Committee, 1945. In 1928 he was elected a member of the Leopoldina. His grave is located in the Novodevichy Cemetery (Plot 4, Row 24, No. 7) in Moscow.

She is known for collaborating with artists across various media, as well as live performances in unconventional spaces that incorporate elements of classical music, theater, improvisation and visual art across a range of genres including pop, hip-hop, classical and more. These performances often feature a carbon fiber cello and loop station.  Projects and collaborations  Stage Poems  Cellista's stage poems are multimedia installations that weave together various discipline into a presentation which encapsulates a story. = Bird in a Cage = Created in collaboration with visual artist Tulio Flores, ‚ÄòBird in a Cage‚Äô placed Cellista within an ornate birdcage on a public street. She costumed to look like a surrealist doll. As people passed by on the street, Cellista played her cello through a loop station to draw them nearer. As they came closer and listened, they were asked to fill out a paper receipt tag tied to the cage with a hope, wish or dream. Cellista performed improvised responses to those tags. Subsequent performances and projects all incorporate these tags. = The End of Time = Her interdisciplinary exhibit The End of Time alongside internationally renowned visual artist Barron Storey's solo exhibit Quartet at Anno Domini art gallery in downtown San Jose, California with her chamber music collective the Juxtapositions Chamber Ensemble received critical acclaim. The dual exhibition, created in tribute to French composer Olivier Messiaen‚Äôs seminal chamber work The Quartet for the End of Time, received mention in Juxtapoz magazine. Of the quartet, Cellista has said \\"The narrative of the quartet seemed to have immediacy to the San Jose of now. I think in many ways it makes apparent San Jose's connection to the past and illuminates a way to the future.\\" = Finding San Jose = Full-length album and stage poem. Recorded between 2015 and 2016, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, the album utilized the receipt tags as creative prompts from ‚ÄòBird in a Cage.‚Äô Finding San Jose became the soundtrack for an hour long presentation that contained a reminiscent story about a love affair with a city. The story was conveyed through the creation of a full-length film that played as the live stage poem, with ballet and live music. The film and stage poem, are both able to function independently. The album was featured on KQED and San Jose's Metroactive. = Transfigurations = Transfigurations is a multidisciplinary performance art piece and album created by Cellista. Both the album and the installation are accompanied by a full-length book written by Cellista and her father, the philosopher Frank Seeburger, known for his work on Heidegger, and addiction. Transfigurations is a response to the Trump presidency and the repetitions of history, which reinforce the unequal structures that gave rise to this moment in time. Transfigurations as a performance piece incorporates original sound design, live cello improvisations, new compositions by Bay Area composers, chamber music, and modern dance. After its first live performance, the piece was turned into a 20-minute film that debuted on at the Diamond in the Rough Film Festival. The debut performance was also featured on KQED for its 100 Days of Art series. The album is set to be released in late May 2019 and to be followed by a national tour. = Session work = A noted session musician for both recording and live performance, Cellista has worked with: * Grammy- nominated artist Tanya Donelly * Producer John Vanderslice * Don McLean * Casey Crescenzo * Van Dyke Parks. * Yassou * Lady Lazarus * The Canales Project with Carla Canales and Kurt Crowley, musical director of Broadway's Hamilton * Christine Ebersole = JAMS = Cellista is the founding artistic director of the JAMS (Juxtapositions Avant Music Symphony). a process-based ensemble that merges classical and contemporary repertoire and provides professional development, mentoring and advocacy for emerging artists. = Awesome Orchestra = Cellista is an Ambassador for the Awesome Orchestra, a classical music collective with an eye towards increasing the accessibility of orchestral music.

Of the album, she remarked \\"Most especially, this is an offering to the artists of San Jose. I owe San Jose my creative life. I see the town going through a period of rapid growth and development, and I would like to offer this album to my community in dedication of a time when San Jose used to be orchards.\\" The album was re- mixed by a number of Bay area artists including Pam the Funkstress the legendary turntablist and DJ for music icon Prince (musician).

While there were a number of contemporary revolutionary feminist organisations in the UK, the Leeds group was 'internationally significant'.Finn Mackay (2015). Radical Feminism: Feminist Acitivism in Movement. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. The group is remembered chiefly for two reasons. The first is organising the UK-wide ‚ÄòReclaim the Night‚Äô marches in November 1977. The second is the publication of the pamphlet Political Lesbianism: The Case Against Heterosexuality, which advocated political lesbianism. British activist Sheila Jeffreys was closely involved with the group, while UK feminist Julie Bindel has spoken of the group's influence on her, as have many others.'My sexual revolution', Julie Bindel, The Guardian, 30 January 2009. The Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group was founded in 1977, the result of a wider backlash against the perceived dominance of liberal feminism.Finn Mackay (2014), 'Reclaiming revolutionary feminism'. Feminist Review, 106. The group emphasised the importance of women- only spaces and organisation, and identified male violence against women and the threat of it as the keystone in the oppression of women. According to Alison Garthwaite, who was heavily involved with the Leeds group, the group differed from many separatists by their opposition to separatism as a lifestyle, or an end in itself. The group organised the Reclaim the Night marches that were held in various cities across the United Kingdom on the night of 12 November 1977. They were inspired by night marches which had taken place in Germany with the message that women should be able to walk at night without fear. The marches took place in the context of the ‚ÄòYorkshire Ripper‚Äô murders, where thirteen women and girls were murdered over a five-year period. Feminists were angry not just over the murders but also the police reaction to them. Police had advised women not to go out at night. Not only was this not practical to many women, it was also seen as blaming the victims.'Why reclaim the night?' As many of the murders took place in the Chapeltown area of Leeds, and because many of the organisers lived in the area, the Leeds march took place there. This drew criticism from some anti-racist campaigners. They argued that since Chapeltown was a mostly-black area, the march risked reinforcing the ‚Äòblack beast‚Äô stereotype and drawing unwanted police attention the area. Increasing policing, however, was not a demand of the organisers. The pamphlet Political Lesbianism: The Case Against Heterosexuality also proved controversial. The pamphlet was published in 1979, having originated from a conference talk given in 1977. It was republished in 1981 under the title Love your enemy? The debate between heterosexual feminism and political lesbianism. The re-publication highlighted some of the responses to the argument. The authors of the pamphlet advocate that women should become lesbians. Lesbian here is defined as a woman who refrains from heterosexual sexual activity, not necessarily a woman who sleeps with other women. It is argued that heterosexuality must be abandoned since heterosexual relations are one of the main ways that women as a whole are kept under systematic control. Women who engage in heterosexual activity are denounced as ‚Äòcollaborators with the enemy‚Äô. While many women were influenced by the pamphlet, it also evoked a critical reaction. Many heterosexual women were offended at being called collaborators, and the labeling of all men as the enemy of women. Lesbian feminists and others also opposed the suggestion that sexuality was a choice. References External links * Love your enemy?

Seipel is an American sculptor and conceptual artist who was formerly the Dean of the VCU School of the Arts. He was a member of the VCU faculty for over 40 years. As Dean of VCU arts, he also had oversight of the VCU School of the Arts branch in Doha, Qatar. He administered VCU exchange programs with art and design schools in Finland, India, Israel and Korea. He retired in 2016. Education Seipel received his B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison) in 1970, and his M.F.A. from the Maryland Institute College of Art, Rinehart School of Sculpture in 1973. In an interview by Glenn Harper in Sculpture Magazine, before talking about sculpture and sculpture education, Seipel spoke about his own early education and how it affected his concept of the importance of scale and use of varied materials. Teaching and administrative positions When Seipel became chair of the sculpture department at VCU in 1985, succeeding Dean Richard Toscan, the program had been strong for many years, with about 100 VCU-trained sculptors graduating each year. All BFA graduates of the Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts‚Äîeven though not necessarily sculpture majors‚Äîwere required to have at least one rigorous class in the sculpture department. Seipel strove to transfer that multi-disciplinary success to the graduate program and to put additional focus on incorporating new technological equipment and training into the education of artists. \\"All of a sudden the sculpture students were using the same language as engineering students,\\" Seipel said. Named Administrative Dean at the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2011, Seipel returned to Richmond as Dean of the School of the Arts at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts, a position from which he retired in 2016 and was followed by interim dean, Professor James Frazier. In 2017 Seipel served as the Interim Dean of the School of Art and Design at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. He is currently serving as the Interim Director of the VCU Institute for Contemporary Art. Sculpture and exhibitions In 1999 Joe Seipel's biographical installation piece 18,621 Days at 1708 gallery in Richmond received a Critic's Choice award for public art. His exhibition history at 1708 includes 25 x 25 in 2003, 18621 Days (a 1999 solo installation), the Founders‚Äô Exhibition in 1998, and numerous invitational group shows in Richmond, Milan, Italy, New York City, Washington, DC and Norfolk, VA. He participated in the Richmond citywide project 21 Billboards by 21 Artists. Additional photos and commentary by Seipel are included in a 2016 published history of Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts' Anderson Gallery edited by Ashley Kistler. Seipel's sculpture is conceptual, monumental in scale, and frequently robotic. After retiring in 2016 from his administrative duties at VCU, Seipel is working again in his studio in the Fan district of Richmond, Virginia. Gallery and museum affiliations Seipel was a founding board member and first president of 1708 Gallery in Richmond's Shockoe Bottom, now located on West Broad Street, in Richmond's Arts and Cultural District. While working in Savannah, he was the juror for Richmond's 1708 Gallery's 13th Annual SECAC (Southeastern College Art Conference) and MACAA (Mid-Atlantic College Art Association) Juried Exhibition. In 2012 VCU announced plans for a new ICA (Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond), to be a privately funded signature building for the VCU School of the Arts located at the corner of Broad Street and Belvidere, a busy thoroughfare in the city's art district. In 2014 Seipel and architect Steven Holl participated in the ceremonial groundbreaking for the new Institute of Contemporary Art in Richmond. Professional activity and awards Seipel was named top sculpture educator at the 2009 International Sculpture Conference in Philadelphia. Seipel received recognition for lifetime achievement in the 2012 Theresa Pollak Prizes for Excellence in the Arts. In 2016, he was honored by Richmond Magazine as \\"Richmonder of the Month.\\" He has served as an honored member of the International Society of Fine Arts Deans. As Dean of the VCU School of the Arts, in 2014 Seipel oversaw the purchase and transformation of a former Richmond West Broad Street trolley station into a building called The Depot, an art lecture hall, classroom, exhibition, and studio space for students and faculty. He participated as a speaker at the VCU Brandcenter. He was appointed by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder to the Task Force for Promotion of the Arts and by Governor George Allen to the Virginia Art and Architecture Review Board. The VCU Brand Center produced five Vimeo video interviews with Joseph Seipel, each addressing a different question posed to him. The questions were: 1) What's your process when you start a sculpture? 2) Do you see advertising as an art or a science? 3) Do you think creativity can be learned or are you born with it? 4) How do you know when a piece is finished? and 5) Who do you feel is the most important artist of the past 25 years? Seipel has been frequently quoted and interviewed regarding contemporary sculptors and sculpture and about the new Institute for Contemporary Art, Richmond. Following the retirement of the ICA's inaugural director Lisa Frieman from her position at the museum, Seipel was named interim director of the new museum. In December 2018, Seipel was named a Richmond Times Dispatch person of the year for his service to the arts community.

These sentiments were echoed in Howard Singerman's Artforum review of this same exhibition published three months later but this time Singerman goes a step further to suggest that Askevold's work actually tries to position the Symbolists in relation to Postmodernism because they offer a critique of Modernism, just as Askevold does with his installation \\"Delville's Visit\\".Singerman, Howard (1981). ‚ÄúDavid Askevold, Jancar/Kuhlenschmidt Gallery‚Äù, Artforum, April(81-82).

Originally a traditional bhangra band, they were prominent in the community circuit, playing at weddings and family gatherings in Southall. They had an early break on the BBC TV Asian programme, Nai Zindagi Naya Jeevan. In 1978, they were discovered by talent scout Pran Gohill of Multitone Records and they recorded several albums with the label.

In 1984, they began work with Deepak Kazanchi on the album Ten Chunm De Sitare, which introduced elements of contemporary electronic dance music into the band‚Äôs sound. Legacy The success of Ten Chunm De Sitare has been linked to the emergence of professional British Bhangra bands that along with Alaap have been dubbed the 'Southall sound', such as Herra and Holle.

The term is German and has no exact equivalent in English, but is often translated as \\"hill country\\", \\"hilly terrain\\", \\"upland(s)\\" or \\"gently undulating\\"Haafke, Udo. Ratingen: Die Sch√∂nsten Seiten - At Its Best, Erfurt: Sutton, 2013. p. 71. or \\"rolling country\\",Scott-Sabic, Vanessa. Dictionary of Logistics, Beaverbank: Springer, 2005. p.93. or \\"rolling countryside\\".e.g. Cole, Theodor CH, W√∂rterbuch der Biologie, 4th edn., Heidelberg: Springer, 2015, p. 128. It is derived from H√ºgel, a low hill or hillock and appears frequently as a proper name for this type of terrain. The term H√ºgelland is not unambiguously defined, even in German. For example, on the plains of North Germany, Poland or Hungary it may be applied to terrain with a height variation of just 50 metres, whilst in the Alpine Foreland or in the Pre-Alps it might refer to terrain with a height difference of at least 100‚Äì200 metres. On the other hand, some scholars prefer to define H√ºgelland by its height above sea level; for example, applying it to terrain between 200 and 500 metres above sea level.L√ºtgens, Rudolf, Erich Otremba and Edwin Fels, Die geographischen Grundlagen und des Wirtschaftslebens, Frankh, 1950, p. 85.  Structure  Structurally and geomorphologically, a H√ºgelland landscape has a significant proportion of less well-defined components. For example: * It is topographically not as clearly defined a mountain or hill range, * which is why it usually exhibits variable erosion (the aspects of its slopes facing all points of the compass) and * why it rarely has series of parallel watercourses such as those typically created in hilly or mountainous terrain. * Settlements may be located either in the valleys or on the heights (which offered sunny sites in winter, sheltered leeward locations and, formerly, better defensive positions); * Arable usage is equally diverse - depending on soil type, local climate and groundwater. * The formation of the terrain often has geological causes that differ from those of hills and mountains: Hills and mountains are caused by folding along tectonic weaknesses or fault lines, which are then followed by rivers. This results in a parallel pattern, which can be made even more regular through erosion. H√ºgelland rarely exhibits these properties. When the gently rolling hills of a H√ºgelland are suitable for agriculture, their small-scale nature is further reinforced, which may result in a colourful succession of mixed forest and open areas with pastures, meadows, arable crops and orchards, divided by hedgerows along the tracks, lanes and embankments. Mixed woodland, hedges, ponds and scattered settlements occur, giving the appearance of a mosaic from the air.  Regions named H√ºgelland  The regions listed below have H√ºgelland as part of their proper name. Several also have alternative English-language names. * Austria: ** Mattersburger H√ºgelland,Mattersburger H√ºgelland (Mattersburg Hills) at www.naturschutzbund- burgenland.at.

Known as the \\"mother of Chicago's black arts community\\", she received honors and awards for her work in both theater and social programs. Brown was inducted into the Chicago Women's Hall of Fame and interviewed as a subject of the archival program The HistoryMakers. Early life Abena Joan Phillips was born on May 8, 1928 in Chicago, as the only child of Lueola Reed. She began studying dance when she was three years old and performed in church from childhood. After she was discovered skipping school, Phillips was sent to a Catholic boarding school by her mother. She began her tertiary education as a dance major at the University of Illinois and completed her bachelor's degree at Roosevelt University. She then went on to complete a master's degree in social work at the University of Chicago, after challenging the university to open its doors to black students. Career Brown began her career as a social worker and became the Program Services Director at the Harriett M. Harris YWCA of Metropolitan Chicago. She was actively involved in the creation of such organizations as National Association of Black Social Workers during the Civil Rights Movement. Brown's vision was unapologetically Afrocentric and she was driven to create organizations that featured and nurtured the black community. In 1969, Brown and Okoro Harold Johnson, who had met while they were students at Roosevelt University came up with the idea of creating a talent organization for black actors. Together, they along with Al Johnson and Archie Weston Sr. created Ebony Talent Agency (ETA), as an agency to discover and place performers. ETA was franchised by both the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Screen Actors Guild and later evolved into the Creative Arts Foundation, offering training and theater performance opportunities. In 1982, she quit her position at the YWCA to focus her energies full-time to the creation of ETA. After several years without a permanent home, the group found a permanent location in an abandoned factory in 1978 and began renovations of the space. Over the next decade, with numerous fundraising events, including a National Endowment for the Arts grant, the group staged performances and completed the additions of office and classroom space, a gallery, a library, and a 200-seat modern theater in South Chicago. Brown served as CEO of the organization and continuously worked to expand the organization, spearheading the purchase of additional land in 1995 and again in 1998 to improve both the courses they could offer, as well as showcase works written and performed by black artists. She also pushed efforts to create a children's theater, summer camps and training to inspire children to become involved in the arts. In addition to her work at ETA, Brown spoke at many events advocating for the arts in and around Chicago. She retired in 2011 after 40 years at ETA. Brown died on July 12, 2015 in Chicago. Legacy Brown, who was called by the Chicago Sun-Times, the \\"mother of Chicago's black arts community\\" was inducted into the Chicago Women's Hall of Fame in 1991 and in 1995 received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Black Theater Alliance of Chicago. She received the Governor's Award for the Arts, African American Arts Alliance's Paul Robeson Award, as well as many honors from local organizations. Regionally, she received the Hazel Joan Bryant Award from the Midwest African-American Theatre Alliance and was nationally recognized in 2001 as an interviewee for the black history archive project known as The HistoryMakers.

Unlike malware analysis, CDR technology does not determine or detect malware's functionality but removes all file components that are not approved within the system's definitions and policies. It is used to prevent cyber security threats from entering a corporate network perimeter. Channels that CDR can be used to protect include email and website traffic. Advanced solutions can also provide similar protection on computer endpoints, or cloud email and file sharing services.  Applications  CDR works by processing all incoming files of an enterprise network, deconstructing them, and removing the elements that do not match the file type's standards or set policies.

India is the \\"fifth largest electronic waste producer in the world\\"; approximately 2 million tons of e-waste are generated annually and an undisclosed amount of e-waste is imported from other countries around the world.Discarded electronic waste. Annually, computer devices account for nearly 70% of e-waste, 12% comes from the telecom sector, 8% from medical equipment and 7% from electric equipment. The government, public sector companies, and private sector companies generate nearly 75% of electronic waste, with the contribution of individual household being only 16%. E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their \\"useful life.\\" Computers, televisions, VCRs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are common electronic products. Many of these products can be reused, refurbished, or recycled. There is an upgradation done to this E-waste garbage list which includes gadgets like smartphone, tablets, laptops, video game consoles, cameras and many more. India had 1.012 billion active mobile connections in January 2018. Every year the number is growing exponentially. According to ASSOCHAM, an industrial body in India the, Compound Annual Growth Rate of electronic waste is 30%. With changing consumer behavior and rapid economic growth, ASSOCHAM estimates that India will generate 5.2 million tonnes of e-waste by 2020. While e-waste recycling is a source of income for many people in India, it also poses numerous health and environmental risks. More than 95% of India's e-waste is illegally recycled by informal waste pickers called kabadiwalas or raddiwalas. These workers operate independently, outside of any formal organization which makes enforcing e-waste regulations difficult-to-impossible. Recyclers often rely on rudimentary recycling techniques that can release toxic pollutants into the surrounding area. The release of toxic pollutants associated with crude e-waste recycling can have far reaching, irreversible consequences.  By region  alt= In India, the amount of e-waste generated differs by state. The three states that produce the most e-waste are as follows: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Other states that produce significant e-waste are Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. Additionally, e-waste is disproportionately generated in urban areas‚Äî65 Indian cities generate more than 60% of India's total e-waste. Mumbai is the top e-waste producer followed by Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Kolkata.  Health and safety  = Health hazards = Women and children are particularly vulnerable to the health effects of toxic e-waste exposure. E-waste contains many hazardous substances which have been found to be extremely dangerous to human health and the environment; e-waste is often disposed of under less than ideal safety conditions. Since most e-waste is illegally processed by workers operating outside of formally-organized systems, these informal workers commonly practice unregulated and often dangerous recycling techniques that can have serious health consequences. Unfortunately the recycling labor force has a low literacy rate and very little awareness of the hazards of e-waste which means that many of these workers are unknowingly engaging in activities that are harmful to their health. In Delhi alone, an estimated 25,000 workers including children are involved in crude e-waste dismantling units‚Äîannually these units dismantle 10,000‚Äì20,000 tons of e-waste with bare hands. They lack proper personal protective equipment and are exposed to toxins though the e-waste. The materials that are not recycled by waste pickers are often left in landfills or burned. Both methods can lead to toxic chemicals leaking into the air, water and soil. Workers in these facilities often do not have adequate safety gear and exposure to e-waste can lead to many health issues. Exposure can happen directly or indirectly through skin contact, inhalation of fine particles and ingestion of contaminated dust. Potential health outcomes from e-waste exposure include changes in thyroid functions, poor neonatal outcomes, including spontaneous abortions, stillbirths and premature births. Side effects also included changes in behaviors and decreased lung function. There is also evidence of significant DNA damage. = Vulnerable populations = Vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the health risks of e-waste. It is estimated that throughout India, 400,000-500,000 child workers between the ages of 10-15 are involved in e-waste recycling activities. Hazardous chemical absorption can have a negative effect on a child's growth and can cause permanent damages. Children are particularly sensitive to lead poisoning, It is found that the e-waste recycling activities had contributed to the elevated blood lead levels in children. Pregnant women have risks of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, premature births, and reduced birth weights associated with exposure to e-waste.  Environmental impacts  The processes used to recycle and dispose of e-waste in India have led to a number of detrimental environmental impacts. As a result, improper recycling and disposal techniques, air, water and soil throughout much of India is now contaminated with toxic e-waste byproducts. = Air = Air pollution is a widespread problem in India‚Äînine out of the ten most polluted cities on earth are in India. An important contributor to India's air pollution problem is widespread, improper recycling and disposal of e-waste. For example, dismantling and shredding of e-waste releases dust and particulates into the surrounding air. Low value e-waste products like plastics are often burned‚Äîthis releases fine particles into the air that can travel hundreds-to-thousands of miles. Desoldering is a technique used to extract higher-value materials like gold and silver which can release chemicals and damaging fumes when done improperly. In addition to contributing to air pollution, these toxic e-waste particulates can contaminate water and soil. When it rains, particulates in the air are deposited back into the water and soil. Toxic e-waste air particulates easily spread throughout the environment by contaminating water and soil which can have damaging effects on the ecosystem. = Water = A child walks in a trash-laden river in the Indian Himalayas. India's sacred Yamuna river and Ganges river are considered to be among the most polluted rivers in the world. It is estimated that nearly 80% of India's surface water is polluted. Sewage, pesticide runoff and industrial waste, including e-waste, all contribute to India's water pollution problem. E-waste contaminates water in two major ways: # Landfills: Dumping e-waste into landfills that are not designed to contain e-waste can lead to contamination of surface and groundwater because the toxic chemicals can leach from landfills into the water supply. # Improper recycling: Improper recycling produces toxic byproducts that may be disposed of using existing drainage such as city sewers and street drains. Once these products have been introduced into the local water supply, they can cause further pollution by entering surface water such as streams, ponds, and rivers. Researchers at Jamia Millia Islamia University collected samples of soil and groundwater from five locations with high e-waste activity and found dangerous levels of contamination near unregulated e-waste sites. According to this study the average concentration of all heavy metals (except zinc) in water near e-waste sites in New Delhi was significantly higher than reference samples. In addition to being measurable, the effects of industrial waste pollution in India are easily observable. Approximately 500 liters of industrial waste, which includes e-waste, are dumped into the Ganges and Yamuna river daily which has led to the formation of toxic foamtoxic foam which covers large regions of the rivers. = Soil = According to research by Jamia Millia Islamia University, the average concentration of heavy metals in topsoil near e-waste sites in India is significantly higher than in standard agriculture soil samples. Another study tested soil samples from 28 e-waste recycling sites in India and found that the soil contained high levels of toxic Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Further soil sample analysis conducted by the SRM Institute of Science and Technology found the average concentration PCBs in Indian soil to be two times higher than the average amount globally. In India, PCB compounds are most prevalent in urban areas with the highest rate of soil-contamination found in Chennai (a city that imports e-waste), followed by Bengaluru, Dehli and Mumbai.  Disposal techniques  304x304px The current e-waste disposal techniques in India have operated mostly in an informal manner due to the lack of enforcement laws and regulations. This has created a new area of economic gain for the country, especially among the urban and rural poor. Though it helps many make a living, those that are disposing of e-waste are usually not aware of the risks and health hazards that result from certain disposal techniques. There are two sectors that handle e-waste disposal and they can be divided into Informal or Formal Sectors. = Formal sector = The formal sector includes two facilities authorized to deconstruct electronics for the entire country of India and are at capacity with five tons being disposed each day. These facilities primarily receive electronic waste from the producers of \\"service centers or take-back schemes\\" or companies that follow the environmental policies on disposing electronic waste. These facilities, though reaching capacity daily, are not the mainstream method of disposal. The formal sector only follows procedure of dismantling and segregating parts. They do not physically dispose of the electronic waste. The informal sector has made it difficult to compete. = Informal sector = The informal sector handles electronic waste by recycling or final disposal. Much of electronics that reach India are out of date to more developed countries. Then, within India, these electronics are passed around until no longer of use. There is a whole economic market for electronic waste because the parts can be dismantled and the scrap metals can be recycled. There are recycling techniques that are not following any type of environmental or health standards. Some of the methods used are acid baths, burning cables, and disposing in nature which can be detrimental to the health of those participating in these disposal techniques.  Regulations  The Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is primarily responsible for regulations regarding electronic waste. Additionally, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) produce implementation procedures to ensure proper management of rules set forth by the MoEFCC. = E-Waste Management and Handling Rules, 2011 = An addition to the Environmental Protection Act of 1986, the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules of 2011 came into effect in May 2012. The rules stated that all manufacturers and importers of electronic goods were required to come up with a plan to manage their electronic waste. Producers or importers had to establish e-waste collection centers or employ take back systems. These rules also mandated that sellers of electronic goods must provide consumers with information on how to properly dispose of the electronics in order to prevent people from dumping their electronics with domestic waste. Further, companies that produce electronics which have the potential to become e-waste must make the consumer aware of the hazardous materials in their product. These rules established and placed specific responsibilities for each party involved in the production, disposal, and management of electronic waste. Specific responsibilities were given to the producer, collection centers, consumer or bulk consumer, dismantlers, and recyclers. These rules also mandated that commercial consumers and government departments must keep records of their electronic waste and make them available to state and federal Pollution Control Boards. = E-Waste Management Rules, 2016 = E- Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 In October 2016, the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 replaced the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016. This set of rules clarifies duties of responsible parties, enacts more stringent regulations on e-waste production, as well as clarifies the general definition of e-waste. In these rules, e-waste is defined as \\"electrical and electronic equipment, whole or in part discarded as waste by the consumer or bulk consumer as well as rejects from manufacturing, refurbishment and repair processes. ‚ÄòElectrical and electronic equipment‚Äô in turn has been defined to mean equipment which are dependent on electric current or electro-magnetic field in order to become functional.\\" A major concept presented in theses rules is the idea of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Producers of electronic products must implement EPR in order to ensure that their electronic waste is delivered to authorized recyclers or dismantlers. These rules establish and place specific responsibilities for each party involved in the production, disposal, and management of electronic waste. Specific responsibilities were given to the manufacturer, producer, collection centers, dealers, refurbisher, consumer or bulk consumer, recycler, and the state government. These rules also stated target goals for certain industries to drastically reduce their collection of electronic waste. = Amendment to the E-Waste Management Rules, 2018 = This amendment relaxes certain aspects of the strict E- Waste (Management Rules of 2016). Specifically, the amendment focusses on the e-waste collection targets by 10% during 2017‚Äì2018, 20% during 2018‚Äì2019, 30% during 2019‚Äì2020, and so on. This amendment also gives the Central Pollution Control Board power to randomly select electronic equipment on the market to test for compliance of rules. The financial cost associated with this testing shall be the responsibility of the government, whereas previously, this responsibility was of the producer.

He composed the fantasias in 1899 on two chorales: \\"\\" and \\"\\" They were published by in Munich in May 1900.  Background  Reger was raised Catholic but was fascinated by the variety of melodies of Protestant hymns, and used quotations from them throughout his life. He composed seven chorale fantasias in Weiden between 1898 and 1900, inspired by a fantasia on \\"Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern\\", Op. 25 (1895) of his teacher Heinrich Reimann. Reger's fantasias follow Reimann's model of setting individual stanzas, connected by interludes. Reger's works often end in a culminating fugue.  No. 1  The text of the first chorale was written and composed by Philipp Nicolai, published in 1599. Reger composed the fantasia in Erbendorf and Weiden, in September and October 1899, and dedicated it to Friedrich Spitta. It was first performed in Wesel on 24 October 1899 by Karl Straube. Reger described his fantasia as a program music work (Programmmusikwerk). It was the Reger's first chorale fantasias to end with a Choralapotheose (chorale apotheosis), following 19th-century symphonic conclusions.  No. 2  The text of the second chorale is a paraphrase of Psalm 6 by Johann Georg Albinus. Reger composed the fantasia in Weiden in November and December 1899, dedicated to Paul Gerhardt.

Built in 1899 and enlarged over the following 15 years, it is a prominent local example of Classical Revival architecture, and exemplifies city planning of the period, having been designed with growth in mind. The building, now converted to residences for homeless veterans, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The former Chapin School building is located in the Willimansett area of northern Chicopee, on a triangular parcel bounded on the east by Meadow Street and the west by Chicopee Street (Massachusetts Route 116). It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure with three sections. The central section, the oldest portion of the building, is flanked on its left (west) by a similarly- sized section that butts directly against it, and has a second such section on the right, to which it is joined by a full-height hyphen. The right sections are covered by dormered hip roofs, while that of the left section is flat. Some building corners are pilastered, and the right sections each have entrances recessed in rectangular openings. A stringcourse of rusticated red stone separates the elevated basement from the ground floor. Windows on the first floor have red stone lintels and sills, while the third-floor windows have stone sills and brick soldier headers with central stone keystones. The school was built in 1899 to a design by Holyoke architect George P.B. Alderman, and was named for the area's first English settlers, Jophet and Henry Chapin. Its construction was done by the city in response to the 1898 completion of the nearby Holyoke-Willimansett Bridge, which city planners expected to increase development in the area. Originally staffed by just three teachers, it had by 1915 grown to have seventeen, and it was the city's largest school. It served the city until 1995, when it was closed after fairview elementary opened . It then housed an alternative school into the early 2000s. It has now been converted into a cooperative residential complex for homeless veterans.

Early life and education  L√ºth completed her undergraduate education at Mainz University Institute of Physics from 1963‚Äì1966. In 1969 she completed a Master of Science in Physics at Heidelberg University; her Dr. rer. nat. work in particle physics was also completed there from 1966‚Äì1974, based on research at CERN. Her 1974 dissertation, titled Measurement of the Charge Asymmetry in the Decay K0 --> pi+- e-+ Neutrino as a Function of the K0 Decay Time, was advised by Jack H. Steinberger and Heinz August Adolf Wilhelm Filthuth. In 1977 she married Karl L. Brown (1925‚Äì2002) in Santa Clara County, California.  Career  L√ºth was hired at SLAC as a postdoctoral researcher from 1974‚Äì1984. She returned to CERN as a scientific associate from 1984‚Äì1985, working with Jack Steinberger and others to measure charge-parity violation in neutral kaon decay. By 1984, L√ºth had joined the permanent faculty at SLAC. Between 1992‚Äì1994, she was deputy associate director of research at the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) laboratory in Texas. When construction of the SSC was cancelled, she returned to SLAC as the first technical coordinator for the BaBar detector, with responsibilities for overseeing the detector's design and construction. Upon its completion, she turned her efforts to measuring decay of B mesons. According to Kelen Tuttle, writing for SLAC Today, \\"L√ºth was one of the leading physicists on both the magnetic detector built by SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the MARK II detector, which recorded data at SPEAR, the Positron Electron Project and the Stanford Linear Collider. L√ºth was also the driving force to build the first detector using silicon microstrips at a colliding beam machine.\\" In 2004 she was promoted to Professor of Research at SLAC. L√ºth served as a permanent member of the Helmholtz Association's Senate Commission from 2008 to 2011, and in 2011she was appointed a senator of the Helmholtz Association for the research field of the structure of matter. She has participated on numerous advisory committees and panels, including the German Wissenschaftsrat's Large Facilities Panel, and the Department of Energy and National Science Foundation High Energy Physics Advisory Panel.  Research  L√ºth has conducted research at CERN in Switzerland, Heidelberg University in Germany, and SLAC. According to SLAC theoretical physicist JoAnne Hewett, \\"Right from the beginning, Vera showed that every experiment she contributed to was the definitive experiment at the time.\\" Burton Richter said she proved her worth early, \\"playing an important role at the Stanford Positron Electron Accelerating Ring (SPEAR) during the 'November Revolution,' which launched a new era of particle physics with the discovery of the charm quark\\". Her research interests have included fundamental symmetries, heavy flavor particle weak decays, silicon vertex detectors, and precision tracking. In addition to co-authoring more than 700 publications on particle physics, Luth has contributed a historical biography of Wolfgang K.H.

He was one of the creators of the 1994 film The Clinton Chronicles.  Early life  Nichols grew up in Conway, Arkansas, where he was a star high school football player. He then made a living writing advertising jingles and also played as a guitarist in local rock bands.  Career  = Arkansas Development Finance Authority = Nichols was hired by Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton in 1988 as marketing director for the Arkansas Development Finance Authority. In 1988, the Associated Press reported he placed 642 long- distance calls at state expense on behalf of the Contras in Nicaragua, either to Nicaragua or to U.S. politicians backing them. At first, Nichols claimed the calls were related to the finance authority. However, when that story did not hold up, Clinton fired him. = Lawsuit against Clinton = Nichols filed a lawsuit against Clinton for improper dismissal. As part of this, during Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial reelection campaign, Nichols claimed the governor was using state funds to conduct affairs with five different women. His charges did not get much attention at the time, but when Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, achieved national prominence with the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992, Nichols came to the forefront of those proclaiming knowledge of local Clinton misdeeds. A January 23, 1992, article in Star Magazine about him named five women, including beauty contest winners Elizabeth Gracen and Lencola Sullivan, and Arkansas state employee Gennifer Flowers. Flowers alleged a prolonged affair with Bill Clinton and played tapes of telephone conversations she had with him, leading to an early crisis in the Clinton campaign, and an appearance on January 26 on 60 Minutes with Steve Kroft. The night before, January 25, 1992, Nichols announced he was dropping his lawsuit against Clinton. He said, \\"It is time to call the fight I have with Bill Clinton over.... I set out to destroy him for what I believed happened to me.\\" =Media figure= Throughout Clinton's presidency, Nichols was a frequent guest on conservative talk radio and promulgated various conspiracy theories about Clinton. These included tales about alleged goings on at Mena Airport in western Arkansas. The New York Times characterized Nichols as one of the \\"Clinton crazies\\". In a 1997 interview, Nichols said, \\"They may just kill me. You'll read one day that I got drunk and ran into a moving bridge. Or Larry Nichols got depressed over everything and blew his head off.\\" In 2013 Nichols claimed a career as a hit-man, stating on The Pete Santilli Show that he had murdered people, on command, for the Clintons. But he said in 2015 that he had been taking painkillers when he made the 2013 remark and he did not mean it. Nichols again received media attention in context of the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign. In early 2015, Nichols said that despite not liking Hillary Clinton, he might support her candidacy because he believed she was tough enough to combat Islamic terrorism.

The house was made famous as the fictional Glenbogle estate in the BBC series Monarch of the Glen. History The lands historically belonged to Clan Macpherson. The 20th chief, Ewen Macpherson, leased Benalder and Ardverikie in 1844 to the Marquess of Abercorn, \\"one of the trend setters in the emerging interest in deer stalking in Scotland.\\" The Marquess expanded the original shooting lodge. He served as Groom of the Stool to Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, who along with the prince spent three weeks at Ardverikie in the late summer of 1847. In 1860, Abercorn transferred the lease to Lord Henry Bentinck, another stalking enthusiast, who lived there until his death in 1870. Sir John Ramsden purchased the Ardverikie and Benalder forests in 1871 for ¬£107,500 (approximately ¬£6.5m today). In 1873, the house was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt from 1874 to 1878. It was rebuilt in the popular style of Scottish baronial architecture, designed by John Rhind. Ramsden's son, Sir John Frecheville Ramsden, inherited the lands after his father's death in 1914. The majority of the land was sold off following the two World Wars, and in 1956 Sir John transferred the Ardverikie estate to a family company under the chairmanship of his son, Sir William Pennington-Ramsden. The company, Ardverikie Estate Limited, still owns and manages the estate today. The estate does business renting cottages and letting the property for weddings.  Filming location Ardverikie House and its estate have been used as a location for filming. It is most recognisable as the Glenbogle estate in the BBC series Monarch of the Glen, that ran for seven series from 2000 to 2005. It was also used in Miss Marple: A Murder is Announced (1985), the films Mrs Brown (1997), Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011), and Outlaw King (2018).

Early life Smith was born on November 6, 1919 in Modoc Point, Oregon. He spent his early childhood on the Williamson River. At age seven, Smith was sent to a nearby Catholic boarding school at the insistence of local Indian agents. He was ultimately sent to a mix of catholic schools and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, as far away as Beaverton, Oregon and Stewart Indian School in Nevada. After leaving Chemawa Indian School, he began to live in Portland, Oregon as an alcoholic panhandler. He was drafted during World War II and was sent to federal prison for drinking on duty. He survived a bout of tuberculosis, and experienced the 1942 death of his sister and 1950 death of his mother. The United States Congress also voted to terminate the Klamath Nation in 1954, striking another blow against Smith. In 1957, Smith became sober with the help of an Alcoholics Anonymous program, ultimately celebrating 56 years of sobriety. He also became interested in Native recovery through culturally relevant practices and indigenous spirituality. Professional life Smith began working for the Portland Alcoholism Counseling and Recovery Program, helping alcoholics in a community he knew well. In 1972, the Bureau of Indian Affairs hired Smith to set up a number of tribal treatment programs across the United States. He also worked in the Klamath Basin on drug and alcohol recovery issues, where he was able to reconnect with his heritage and culture. In 1972, Al Smith began to work at Sweathouse Lodge, part of the Chicano-Indian Study Center of Oregon founded on the site of Camp Adair. His position as treatment coordinator allowed him to combine AA principles with traditional Native spiritual practices, particularly the daily sweat lodge ceremony. Employment Division v. Smith In 1982, Smith began working at a nonprofit Drug and Alcohol counseling program in Roseburg, Oregon. After his colleague Galen Black was fired for ingesting peyote, Smith indignantly attended a ceremony of the Native American Church, declaring \\"You can't tell me that I can't go to church!\\". Smith was fired for using peyote as part of the ceremony. At the time, intentional possession of peyote was a crime under Oregon law without an affirmative defense for religious use. The counselors filed a claim for unemployment compensation with the state, but the claim was denied because the reason for their dismissal was deemed work-related \\"misconduct.\\" The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed that ruling, holding that denying them unemployment benefits for their religious use of peyote violated their right to exercise their religion. The Oregon Supreme Court agreed, although it relied not on the fact that peyote use was a crime but on the fact that the state's justification for withholding the benefits--preserving the \\"financial integrity\\" of the workers' compensation fund--was outweighed by the burden imposed on the employees' exercise of their religion. The state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, again arguing that denying the unemployment benefits was proper because possession of peyote was a crime. The U.S. Supreme Court let stand the Oregon Supreme Court's judgment against the two employees and returned the case to the Oregon courts to determine whether or not sacramental use of illegal drugs violated Oregon's state drug laws (485 U.S. 660 (1988)). Writing for the majority, Antonin Scalia declared that the free exercise of religion did not protect minority religions from \\"neutral, generally applicable laws.\\" Scalia believed that \\"...[l]eaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in, but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.\\" References Native American activists American substance abuse counselors Freedom of religion 1919 births 2014 deaths People from Klamath County, Oregon Activists from Oregon ","title":"Alfred Leo Smith"},{"id":"51097752","text":"Camille Seaman (born 1969) is an American photographer who applies portraiture strategies to capture the changing natural environment.

It formed in September 2008 from a splintering of the Front for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FRPI) and coalescing of other armed actors, including combatants from the Nationalist and Integrationist Front, who had resisted national disarmament campaigns. The group has expressed opposition to a 2006 attempt to resolve the Ituri conflict, which granted amnesty to former participants in the conflict. In 2011, the group was estimated to have no more than 100 members. Whereas the FRPI was closely linked to the Ngiti ethnolinguistic group, the FPJC incorporated members of more varied ethnic backgrounds. In October 2008, the FPJC clashed with Congolese government forces near Bunia in Ituri District, displacing thousands of local residents before it was pushed back by government troops and MONUSCO, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC. In March 2009, the FPJC launched attacks on villages southeast of Bunia, which were followed by counterattacks from the FRPI. The UN Refugee Agency blamed fighting between the rebel groups for the displacement of more than 30,000 Congolese in Ituri. Government forces launched an operation in 2010 to repel the FPJC and other rebel groups operating in Ituri and to relocate at-risk populations. An early leader of the FPJC, Sharif Mandu, was arrested on September 2, 2010, in Arua, a town in western Uganda. Another FPJC leader, Jean-Claude Baraka, was arrested around the same time.

These highways were constructed, maintained, or funded by the Maryland State Roads Commission or Maryland State Highway Administration and assigned a unique or temporally unique number. Some time after the highway was assigned, the highway was transferred to county or municipal maintenance and the number designation was removed from the particular stretch of road. In some cases, a highway was renumbered in whole or in part. This list contains all or most of the state-numbered highways between 700 and 999 that have existed since highways were first numbered in 1927 but are no longer part of the state highway system or are state highways of a different number. Most former state highways have not had their numbers reused. However, many state highway numbers were used for a former highway and are currently in use. Some numbers have been used three times. The former highways below whose numbers are used presently, those that were taken over in whole or in part by another highway, or have enough information to warrant a separate article contain links to those separate highway articles. Highway numbers that have two or more former uses are differentiated below by year ranges.

MD 711 Maryland Route 711 was the designation for Dogwood Road, which ran from MD 545 east to MD 280 (now MD 213) near Elkton in northeastern Cecil County. The highway and a bridge across Dogwood Run were constructed as a wartime access project in 1942 and 1943 to provide better access to the Triumph Explosives plant along MD 545. MD 711 was transferred from state to county maintenance in a road transfer agreement on May 8, 1958. =References= MD 714 Maryland Route 714 was the designation for Rivers Edge Road, which ran from Rivers Edge West north to MD 291 west of Millington in eastern Kent County. The highway was created to re-establish access to the portion of Rivers Edge Road cut off by the construction of what is now US 301 near Millington between 1954 and 1957. MD 714 was transferred from state to county maintenance through a December 1, 1987, road transfer agreement. =References= MD 752 View east at the west end of MD 752 near Barstow in 2017, a short time before it was transferred to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Maryland Route 752 was the designation for Hallowing Lane, a spur south from MD 231 just east of the Benedict Bridge near Barstow. The route was transferred to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources in an agreement dated June 29, 2017. =References= MD 787 Maryland Route 787 was the designation for Flower Avenue, which ran from MD 195 north to MD 320 within Takoma Park in southeastern Montgomery County. Flower Avenue from Carroll Avenue to Piney Branch Road was paved as a concrete road by 1923. The pavement was extended from Piney Branch Road north to Franklin Avenue in Silver Spring between 1931 and 1933. Flower Avenue between MD 195 and MD 516 (Franklin Avenue), was designated MD 194 by 1939. MD 194 was widened to and resurfaced with asphalt concrete from MD 195 to MD 320 in 1947. The highway from MD 320 to MD 516 was resurfaced in 1954. In 1955, MD 194 was involved in a route number swap involving three routes in different parts of the state. At the time, MD 71 was assigned to the highway connecting Frederick with Taneytown, which connected with Pennsylvania Route 194 at the Maryland- Pennsylvania state line. MD 71 was reassigned to the new Blue Star Memorial Highway on the Eastern Shore; this designation would be replaced with US 301 in 1959. The Frederick-Taneytown highway was assigned MD 194 to match its Pennsylvania counterpart. Flower Avenue's designation was changed to MD 787. The portion of MD 787 from MD 320 to Franklin Avenue was transferred from state to county maintenance in 1999. This mileage swap, which included the transfer of MD 516 as well, was conducted to bring MD 119 (Great Seneca Highway) into the state highway system. The following year, a short segment of MD 787 south of MD 195 was removed from the state highway system. This segment, which extended south to Chaney Drive, had already been maintained by the city of Takoma Park. Chaney Drive had been where Flower Avenue intersected the Montgomery-Prince George's county line before the county line was moved in 1997 to place Takoma Park entirely within Montgomery County. The remaining state-maintained portion of Flower Avenue functioned as more of a city street than a state highway, and the city of Takoma Park desired to reconstruct it as a \\"green street\\" with improved stormwater management and complete sidewalks on both sides of the street. In November 2010, after a series of discussions on several state highways in the city, the Takoma Park city council proposed the city receive ownership of Flower Avenue from the state in exchange for a one- time payment of $696,000, which was the amount the Maryland State Highway Administration had planned to spend to repave MD 787. The city would use the state payment toward reconstructing Flower Avenue after ownership was transferred to the city. Flower Avenue from MD 195 to MD 320 was officially transferred from the state to the city of Takoma Park through a road transfer agreement on August 1, 2012. =References= MD 801 Maryland Route 801 was the designation for Irelands Corner Road, which ran between intersections with MD 313 on either side of MD 290 south of Galena in northeastern Kent County. The highway was originally paved in two segments. Kent County constructed the first segment, north of MD 290, with state aid as part of the concrete road from Galena south to Lambson Station between 1915 and 1919. The southern segment was built as part of the Galena-Massey highway; the concrete road was constructed in 1921 and 1922. MD 801 was assigned to Irelands Corner Road after MD 313 was reconstructed and relocated south from Galena in 1956 and 1957; the segment of MD 290 between MD 801 and MD 313 was constructed at the same time. MD 801 was transferred from state to county maintenance through a December 1, 1987, road transfer agreement. =References= MD 803 Maryland Route 803 was the designation for two segments of Edgar Price Road with a total length of near Warwick in southern Cecil County. The western segment paralleled the northbound side of US 301 from MD 299 to where it curved southeast from the U.S. Highway, where the county-maintained portion of the road began. The eastern segment of MD 803 began where Edgar Price Road curved northeast. The highway met the southern end of MD 822 before reaching its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line. The portion of the county highway west from the state line was reconstructed as the eastern section of MD 803 was reconstructed as a state highway in 1955. The western section was constructed as a service road to reconnect MD 299 with Edgar Price Road, which was cut off by the construction of MD 71 (now US 301) between 1954 and 1956. MD 803 was transferred to county maintenance through a December 27, 1979, road transfer agreement. =References= MD 809 Maryland Route 809 was the designation for a pair of sections of old alignment of MD 273 at Calvert and near Fair Hill in northern Cecil County. *MD 809 was the designation for Brick Meetinghouse Road, which ran between junctions with MD 273 on either side of Calvert.

The company played a vital role in the theater history of Scandinavia, where a local theater was not yet developed and where it toured from at least the 1690s onward: in 1707, it became the first professional theater to have performed in Norway.H.J. Huitfeldt: Christiania Theaterhistorie sid. 35-37 (1876) History The company was founded by Johannes Velten upon is marriage in 1678, from the theater company Hochdeutsche Hofcom√∂dianten, which was previously led by his father-in-law. The company had a monopoly in Saxony, and was regarded as one of the best in Germany. Upon the death of Velthen in 1692, the theater company was taken over by his widow Catharina Elisabeth Velten. In 1694-95, the company toured Germany, Poland and the Baltic. Its whereabouts in 1695-97 is unconfirmed, but it is possibly this company that performed in Copenhagen and Stockholm at that time.Gunilla Dahlberg: Komediantteatern i 1600-talets Stockholm (1992) In 1697, the Saxon monopoly of the company was repelled. From 1700 onward, the Velthen Company toured between Vienna, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Norway, Stockholm and Riga. Between 1707 and 1710, they toured all the Nordic countries and performed in Copenhagen in Denmark and in Bergen and Oslo in Norway: in Norway, they became the likely first professional theater to have performed. At the time of their visit in Norway, their cast were composed by Denner the Elder and Denner the Younger, Elisabet Denner Big M√ºller, Little M√ºller, Dorseus and Johann Christian Spiegelberg, and their repertoire included plays by Corneille and Moli√®re. When Velthen retired to settle in Vienna in 1712, the Velthen theater company was dissolved. However, the former members formed a new theater company under the leadership of one of the actors, Johann Christian Spiegelberg (died 1732), which was managed by his widow Elisabet Denner after his death, and which was also active in Germany and Scandinavia. ; Directors: # 1678-1692: Johannes Velten # 1692-1712: Catharina Elisabeth Velten References * Dahlberg, Gunilla (1992).

She lives and works in New York City. Grossen‚Äôs work has been acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC; and the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia.  Biography  Fran√ßoise Grossen was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland in 1943. She studied architecture for a year at the Polytechnical University, Lausanne, Switzerland (1962‚Äì63) before becoming a textile major at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel, Switzerland (1963‚Äì1967). In 1963 Grossen spent six months as a French instructor in a professional school in the Democratic Republic of Congo and lived in Gabon for two years, an experience that would influence her later career. Upon her return from Gabon in 1967, Grossen received her degree in Textile Design from Kunstgewerbeschule. In 1968 she moved to the United States to study with Professor Bernard Kester at UCLA, where she received an M.A. in 1969. Shortly after graduating from UCLA, Grossen moved to New York City to work for Jack Lenor Larsen Inc. It was Larsen who gave Grossen her first show in his showroom on east 59th Street. As her own work and commissions began to take off, Grossen left Larsen Inc. to establish her own studio practice, and to teach workshops at venues around the world. The artist received her American citizenship in 1983, and from 1980 to 2002 Grossen worked and lived in a studio near Almer√≠a in southern Spain. In 2002 Grossen returned to New York City, where she continues to live and work.  Artwork  Grossen's work breaks away from the wall, rejecting traditional approaches to textile-based work. The artist is best known for her large architectural sculptures made from materials including manila rope and sisal, most of which hang freely from the ceiling. Travels to Africa influenced the braiding, plaiting and knotting techniques present in many of her works. Shortly after arriving in the United States, Grossen was included in the seminal 1969 Wall Hangings exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, where her large-scale fiber sculptures stood alongside works by contemporaries like Sheila Hicks, Claire Zeisler, Lenore Tawney and Eva Hesse. Around the same time she received international recognition at the IV Biennale International de la Tapisserie in Lausanne, Switzerland. Grossen went on to exhibit at subsequent International de la Tapisserie Biennales (V-VIII). Throughout the 1970s and 80s the artist had solo exhibitions at the Museum Bellerive, Zurich, Switzerland, The Hadler Galleries in New York City, Kaplan Baumann Gallery in Los Angeles, Reed College Art Galleries in Portland, Oregon, and the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire, Neuchatel, Switzerland. Grossen's most recent solo exhibition was at Blum & Poe in New York City, June 4 - August 14, 2015. Recent group exhibitions include Fiber: Sculpture 1960‚ÄìPresent, which was held at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston and traveled to the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH and the Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines, IA (2014‚Äì2015) and Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947-2016 held at Hauser Wirth & Schimmel, Los Angeles. Over the course of her career, Grossen has created numerous large scale works for public places, institutions, corporate offices and hotels in New York, Chicago, Washington DC, Boston, Texas, California, and abroad. Her work is in international public and private collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Smithsonian Institution, Renwick Gallery, Washington, DC; and the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

En droppe f√∂ll ‚Äì En bok om Elvira Madigan. Norsborg: Recito. Libris 14840445. He was raised in an American circus family of Irish background. He is known for his work in U.S circus scenes between 1866 and 1869, but from 1872 he worked at Cirkus Myers in Central Europe.Slout, William L (1998). Olympians of the sawdust circle : a biographical dictionary of the nineteenth century American circus. San Bernardino, CA: Borgo Press. Libris 12467978. To this circus, the Swedish- Norwegian circus artist Eleonora Olsen, later known as Laura Madigan (mother of Elvira Madigan) came to work in 1875, the two became a couple. Johan Madigan at this time performed as a rider in vaultage, his specialty was a double somersault from the horseback, but exactly how the routine was made is not known today. He also performed a pas-de-deux standing on the backs of two horses along with his loved one Laura Madigan. He later would perform this act along with his stepdaughter Elvira Madigan, who had to at times replace her mother. In 1879, John tried to run his own small circus business in Finland, however as this proved unsuccessful the family looked for work in other circuses in Central Europe, were Elvira along with the fosterchild Gisela Bro≈æ did routines as tight-rope dancers.W√•hlberg, Per Arne (1992). Cirkus i Sverige : bidrag till v√•rt lands kulturhistoria. Stockholm: Carlssons. Libris 7666167. In 1887 Madigan along with his brother James Madigan, founded yet another circus, this time in Denmark. In the following year, Sixten Sparre visited Cirkus Madigan in Kristianstad, where he fell in love with Elvira, he persuaded her to leave the family, which she did in the end of May 1889. Less than two months later Elvira was murdered by Sparre who would then commit suicide. The murder of Elvira Madigan was a huge blow for the family but the circus lived on. In late 1889 and onward the circus toured mainly in Sweden, but also in Finland and Norway. Laura and John Madigan became parents of a daughter called Motalia Madigan (1891-1892). She died less than a year after birth and a half year after her death Laura and John married. When the circus visited G√§vle in August 1897, fire broke out in the building were the Madigan family was staying over night. The rest of the family managed to save themselves and get out of the building, but John got bad burns all over his body and died two days later. He was buried in G√§vle. Laura later had the gravestone (but not the casket) moved to their family plot in Lund. Laura ran the circus for a few more years on her own, but in 1902 she sold the business to a circus performer named Henning Orlando, and the circus was renamed Cirkus Orlando.

Life Elisabet Spiegelberg was the daughter of the German actor known as Denner the Elder and sister of the Harlequin actor known as Denner the Younger. The whole family was engaged at the famous Velthen Company, who often toured Scandinavia in Denmark, Sweden and Norway from at least the late 1690s onward.

He is a member of the Democratic Party and member of the Yuen Long District Council for Pek Long. He became a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in 2016 through the District Council (Second) \\"super seat\\". Biography Prior to entering politics, Kwong worked in a youth centre in Long Ping Estate, Yuen Long. In 2004 he became a community officer for Democratic Party's Yuen Long District Councillor Zachary Wong and subsequently joined the party. =Political career= In 2007 District Council elections, 24-year-old Kwong ran in Pek Long of the Yuen Long District Council, defeating a veteran pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) incumbent Chan Siu-kay. He went on to be re-elected in 2011, 2015, and 2019. As a 25-year-old, Kwong became the youngest candidate in the 2008 Legislative Council election, running in New Territories West with Cheung Yin-tung but was not elected. In the 2012 Legislative Council election, he ran with party chairman Albert Ho in the territory-wide District Council (Second) ‚Äúsuper seat‚Äù and successfully helped Ho to be elected. In the 2016 Legislative Council election, he became a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong through the District Council (Second) \\"super seat\\" with veteran James To in which he won nearly 500,000 votes, the largest votes ever to be received by a ticket. He was once considered as a marginal candidate in the election according to the election poll. However, the weaker pro-democracy candidates from Civic Party, Neo Democrats and ADPL openly suspended their election campaign in order to secure the third super seat of the pro-democracy camp. Besides, he was recommended by Benny Tai's ThunderGo plan. As a result, Kwong was elected with a record-breaking number of popular votes. Kwong has been a \\"familiar face\\" during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. He is often seen chanting protest slogans and calling on protesters and police alike to remain calm. On the morning of 24 September 2019, Kwong was assaulted near his Tin Shui Wai home. Three people pulled him from his car and began punching and kicking him, with one of them filming the attack. He was subsequently taken to Tin Shui Wai Hospital with injuries to his cervical vertebrae, as he was kicked in the back of the neck. The Democratic Party condemned the incident, alleging it to be an organised attack intended to intimidate supporters of the protest movement. Yuen Long district councillor Zachary Wong claimed that both he and Kwong had received threatening letters a month prior. The Hong Kong government condemned the attack and said the police would investigate. =Writing career= Kwong is also a romantic fiction writer. He published his successful debut book Love You Like the First Time We Met in 2014. His second book, There is a Kind of Happiness Called Forgetting, sold more than 10,000 copies at the annual Hong Kong Book Fair in the same year. He also drew attention online after he published a short love essay entitled \\"The Last Time You Were On Whatsapp\\" on the internet in 2012. Kwong had attracted over 92,000 \\"likes\\" on Facebook since the essay. Up to 2015, he has published seven romantic novels. His peculiar writing style is imitated and called ‚ÄúKwong- style‚Äù.

He belongs to the earliest identifiable professional actors active in Sweden, was the leader of the theater of the Swedish royal court in 1628-1645, and the founder of the likely first theater in Sweden and Scandinavia, Bj√∂rng√•rdsteatern (1640). Life Christian Thum was from Germany, but it is unknown from where. He himself stated that he had been active in Sweden since 1615, but he is confirmed as such for the first time in Kalmar in 1624. He performed a theater play for queen Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg in 1628, and was from that point until 1637 engaged at her court as an actor, though not much is known of his activity. In 1637, he was transferred to the court of queen Christina of Sweden and is explicitly named director of the royal court theater: the regency government regarded a theater as a useful pedagogic method for the child monarch, and Thum had the monopoly of theater performances at the royal court. Only fragments is known of the activity of Thum. It is assumed that he performed English style theater, which was still the dominating theater in Germany at the time, though often performed in the German language. The Thum court theater acted on temporary stages and was an all-male theater company: the actors of the theater is unknown, but assumed to have been members of the Hovkapellet, as well as craftsmen from the guild of craftsmen, which traditionally staged theater performances. Christian Thum bought the tavern Bj√∂rng√•rdsteatern in 1640 and was given permission to stage theater there, though nothing is known of this activity either. The last theater performance staged at the royal court by Thum was in 1645: three years later, three foreign theater companies performed in Stockholm, followed by a number of English, German, Dutch and Italian companies, and the monopoly of Thum is estimated to have been discontinued.

She is known for her mixed media sculptures made of fabric, wires, and other objects that are either found or given to her.  Background  Sonia Gomes was born to a black mother and white father in Caetan√≥polis, a small town considered to be the birthplace of the textile industry in Brazil, in 1948. Gomes joined the art world relatively late, at around the age of 45, but claimed the creative process was a way to free her from her upbringing.  Work  Gomes uses fabric, threads, and objects that are either gifts or found to create multi-dimensional sculptures and structures. Much of her work has been described as autobiographical. Formative to her practice has been her childhood memories of her paternal family‚Äôs Catholic customs and the rituals her maternal grandmother, a shaman, used to perform. Other influences include Brazilian dances and the history and culture of African diaspora in Brazil. Gomes often uses secondhand materials, purchased from thrift stores or donated by family; L√°grima (Tear) (2014), for example, was made with a blue tablecloth that once belonged to her friend‚Äôs family.

He participated in the 2008 and 2012 Paralympics and won a silver medal in the javelin throw in 2012. Personal history Kuznetsov was born in Saransk in the former Soviet Union in 1981. At the age of five he fell from a fifth floor of a building, resulting in a spinal trauma. He was educated at the International Independent University of Environmental and Political Sciences in Moscow where he studied philology. He is married to his wife, Daria, and they have two sons. Athletics career Before turning to athletics Kuznetsov was a world class arm-wrestler, but decided to take up track and field to become a Paralympic champion. He began training in Cheboksary in 2007 and by the following year he was representing Russia at his first Summer Paralympics, Beijing 2008. In China he entered the javelin throw in a mixed points F53-54 category event, finishing sixth overall. In the build up to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, he entered the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch. Competing in three throwing events, he found success in his favoured javelin, with a distance of 29.44 m giving Kuznetsov his first major international gold medal. The following year he travelled to Stadskanaal to represent Russia at the 2012 IPC Athletics European Championships. He won bronze in the discus and gold in the javelin. Just a few months later Kuznetsov was at his second Paralympics, in London, where he competed in the javelin throw. He led the field until the final round, where his leading throw of 27.87 was beaten by Mexico's Luis Alberto Zepeda Felix, leaving Kuznetsov with the silver medal. In the build-up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Kuznetsov managed to retain his European title in the javelin throw in both Swansea in 2014 and again in Grosseto in 2016. The world title proved more elusive, with a silver medal in the 2013 World Championships in Lyon and a bronze medal in the 2015 World Championships in Doha.

At one point, he held the title of Geheimrat (the title of the highest advising officials at the Imperial, royal or principal courts of the Holy Roman Empire). Biography Friedrich Opelt was the son of a weaver who specialized in fustian and owned a weavery mill. After he successfully completed his education at the City School of his home town in Rochlitz, he learned the trade of a weaver as his father wished. During this time, a musical autodidact, he could often accompany, on organ, the church service at the Petrikirche (City Church). Through further autodidactic studies, he learned French and Russian, in addition to several other languages. His financial successes at trade shows (Leipzig, Frankfurt) gave him the idea to expand his businesses, which were eventually halted during the Napoleonic Wars. Occupation After the German Campaign of 1813, Opelt became employed in the Municipality of Dresden as a tax auditor, and a few years later he was appointed as tax collector in Radeberg. In 1824 he became the county tax collector for Wurzen, and eight years later he was appointed as county tax collector to Plauen. The peak of Opelt's tax-auditing career was in 1839, during which he became a high-ranking member of the county council in Dresden. In 1847, Opelt became the Second Director of the Saxon- Bavarian Railway Company in Leipzig. The following year, he became a privy financial adviser to the royal treasury in Dresden. In the spring of 1863, he resigned from all his posts and retired into private life. Opelt died at the age of 69 years on September 22, 1863 in Dresden.

Her work is characterized by graphic abstraction, an embrace of color and difference in scale, and an array of techniques used to apply paint and other materials to canvas, ranging from cloths and rugs, to masking with tape, squeegee-ing and smearing, and collaging. She has also worked in film and video, most notably for her 2005 exhibition Her Black Flags at the Mills College Art Museum in Oakland, CA, and in sculpture and installation. Artforum critic Naomi Fry, reviewing a 2007 show at Edward Thorp Gallery, cited the artist's interest in landscape as subject and noted that Sandstr√∂m \\"also grapples here with painting‚Äôs essential difficulty in the face of the sublime. As the works consistently teeter on the verge of abstraction, the interplay between a more traditional naturalism and geometric fragmentation provides a salient tension.\\" Early life and education Sandstr√∂m was born in Stockholm, Sweden. She earned a bachelor's degree in fine art from Academie Minerva in the Netherlands in 1997 and spent a year studying at The Cooper Union in New York City on an exchange program. In 2001, she graduated with a master's in fine art from the Yale School of Art. She attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine in 2000 (later returning as faculty in 2014) and attended the Core Residency Program at Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas (2001-03). Work Sandstr√∂m's work has been shown at a number of museums internationally, including Moderna Museet in Stockholm; The Nationalmuseum in Stockholm; the Mills College Art Museum in Oakland, CA; the Contemporary Art Museum Houston and the Museum of Fine Arts, in Houston, TX. In 2006, she had a one-person exhibition at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, WA and in 2017 Sandstr√∂m had a survey one-person exhibition at Konstens hus in Lule√•. In 2018 she had a solo exhibition at V√§ster√•s konstmuseum. She also has exhibited work with Inman Gallery in Houston, TX; Anat Ebgi, Los Angeles; Edward Thorp Gallery, New York; and Galleri Gunnar Olsson and Cecilia Hillstr√∂m Gallery in Stockholm, Sweden. She is co-editor, with Gavin Morrison, of Ignorance: Between Knowing and Not Knowing (Axl Books, 2015), an anthology which aims to differentiate ignorance from \\"not knowing\\" and to determine the philosophical role of ignorance in the development and reception of artworks. Along with artists Kristina Bength and Jan Ryd√©n and curator Jonatan Habib Engqvist, she produced Studio Talks: Thinking Through Painting (Arvinius+Orfeus Publishing, 2014), a book documenting discussions and studio visits linking the practice of painting with the theoretical framework that undergirds it. She also published Grey Hope: The Persistence of Melancholy (Atopia Projects, 2006), which was awarded a grant from the Barbro Osher Foundation. In 2016 the monograph \\"The Site of Painting\\" was published on Sandstr√∂m's work (Art & Theory, 2016). In 2020 Sandstr√∂m was the editor for the publication \\"Material Matters - Painting and Its Materialities\\" published by Art & Theory in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm. In an interview in 2015, Sandstr√∂m said of her work, \\"I am after the simple sensation of retaining an awareness of the few elements that make up a painting: paint, canvas, stretcher bars, and yet those limited elements have the ability to communicate sensations of immediate presence that go beyond the obvious.\\" Recognition and awards Sandstr√∂m is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters and Sculptors Grant.

Libris 14840445. Her birth data are unconfirmed as she is not found in the Finnish registrations of birth records. Her parents were the Norwegian circus performers Olaj Elias Olsen (1819-1862) and Annamaria Olsen (1818-1908). During her childhood she lived in Finland and Sweden. In 1867 she toured with the French circus director Didier Gautier's Cirque du Nord in northern Germany. There she got to know Danish circus performer Frederik Jensen with whom she had a daughter - Elvira Madigan - who was born in Flensburg in December 1867.Hirn, Sven (1982) . Sirkus kiert√§√§ Suomea 1800-1914. Helsingfors: SKS. Libris 7916579. The couple never married. The tour continued to Denmark where she seems to have left Gautier's circus, and Elvira's father, to work instead for Cirkus Renz in Germany and Austria. At that time she started using the artistic name \\"Miss Ulbinska\\". In Berlin, on 30 March 1871, she gave birth to her second child, a boy she named Richard Henrich Olsen, who would later be a well known circus performer under the name Oscar Madigan (1871-1929). The father of this child is unknown. Between 1873 and 1874 her whereabouts remain unknown. She would later claim that she worked in America. In 1875 she reappeared in Europe with Cirkus Myers in Austria and Germany. There she got to know circus performer John Madigan who would become her husband. The couple moved to the French circus director Francois Loisset's Cirque de Paris that was touring first in northern Germany, and then in Scandinavia, between 1876 and 1877. When Loisset died in Norrk√∂ping in the summer of 1877, his circus wound up, and the Madigan family moved to Russia. Most of their time there was spent with Ciniselli's circus in Saint Petersburg and Hinne's circus in Moscow. In the summer of 1879 the family ran its own small circus in Finland, and now the couple's daughter, Elvira, performed as a tight-rope dancer. During the 1880s Elvira became known in the European circus scene, and the family toured around Europe with Elvira and Laura Madigan's foster child Gisela Bro≈æ. In 1887 the family started its second circus, this time in Denmark. From October of that year the tour continued to Sweden. In January 1888, the circus visited Kristianstad.W√•hlberg, Per Arne (1992). Cirkus i Sverige : bidrag till v√•rt lands kulturhistoria. Stockholm: Carlssons. Libris 7666167. There Sixten Sparre came to see the performance. He became infatuated with Elvira and the two started sending letters to each other. In May 1889 Sparre managed to persuade Elvira to leave her family and the circus to live with him instead. After just two months Sparre murdered Elvira and committed suicide. When the circus visited G√§vle in August 1897, fire broke out in the building were the Madigan family was staying over night. The family managed to save themselves and get out of the building but John, who was badly burned all over his body, died two days later. He was buried in G√§vle. Madigan later had the gravestone (but not the casket) moved to their family plot in Lund. She ran the circus for a few more years on her own, but in 1902 she sold it to a man named Henning Orlando, and it was renamed Cirkus Orlando.

It is found in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. This spider has urticating hairs, the first to be classified as type VII. These sword-shaped, bristly hairs are used as a defense mechanism by stinging or stabbing. Most other species of tarantulas attack by throwing their hairs from a distance. Kankuamo hairs cover the entire body and have penetrating tips which will embed themselves into the skin or mucous membranes and cause severe irritation. Humans often experience mild to severe skin irritation or rashes. Taxonomy The species Kankuamo marquezi and the new genus Kankuomo were first described in 2016 by Carlos Peraf√°n et al. The genus name honors the indigenous Kankuamo people of the Caribbean region of Colombia, where this species is found. The grammatical gender of Kankuamo is neutral. The species name marquezi was given in honor of Nobel prize-winning Colombian author, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, considered one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Peraf√°n et al. placed the genus Kankuamo in the subfamily Theraphosinae. Based on a morphological phylogenetic analysis, the genus was most closely related to Metriopelma. Description =Abdominal urticating setae= Urticating hairs are used to differentiate between the subfamilies, genera and species of the family Theraphosidae (tarantulas). Prior to the discovery of Kankuamo marquezi, six different kinds of urticating hairs were known, varying in their morphology, ornamentation, length and releasing mechanism. Two types (II and V) were found in subfamily Aviculariinae, the other four types (I, III, IV and VI) in subfamily Theraphosinae. A different type of urticating hair was found during the study of Kankuamo marquezi. The spider was covered with rust-colored bristles, including an unusual oval patch of sharp-tipped barbed hairs. Some lanceolated barbs are arranged with their tips towards the penetration tip of the hair, opposite to the main barbs. These unique urticating hairs were put in a new type of urticating hair, type VII. They were considered to have evolved to defend the spider against direct contact. The action of type VII urticating hairs was first observed while handling the specimen in alcohol. The upper part of the tarantula's abdomen was touched intentionally and it was noticed that the urticating hair easily pierced the human finger. After further examination of the finger with stereoscope microscope, the setae were seen to be embedded in the skin, but none penetrated more than one-third of their length. When attempts were made to remove the setae, they were found to break easily from their distal end, leaving a remainder inside the tissue. The lanceolated barbs (in the reverse direction), which are present at the distal end of the setae, serve as a natural breaking point.  Urticating hair, type VII  It is different from the other types because of its insertion feature, as it contains a penetrating tip with the barbs in the reversed that aid embedding them in the targets. Type VII is located in the dorsal of the abdomen intermixed with covering the setae and attached to the cuticle by thinner stalk that makes it easy to release. Length of the setae is 1122¬±40 Œºm and Width is 33¬±3 Œºm, length/width ratio is 34(n=10). Setae have a very sharp penetrating tip on its distal apex which is opposite to the stalk. The stalk of it is approximately 45¬±3 Œºm in length and 10¬±1 in width, which is larger than other urticating types. The main shaft is notably straight, which contains the main small barbs that extend along the whole setae. It also has a small oval patch of lanceolated reversed barbs near the penetrating tip. = Palpal bulb = Male spiders use palpal bulbs instead of a penis to transfer sperm to females. Males of this new species of Theraphosidae have a subconical palpal bulb with many conspicuous kneels distributed throughout the subtegulum and embolus, forming a completely unique pattern covered with zig-zag edges, which may resemble a musical instrument. These bulbs are especially developed on the dorsal and prolateral faces, most of them with serrated edges, additional dorsal kneels and supra-accessory kneels. The general shape of the palpal bulb resembles that of the genus Ami discovered in 2008, but with the subtegulum more elongated in Kankuamo. Females are different from other genera in a way that they have spermathecae with one notched receptacle, two granulated lobes and several irregular sclerotized longitudinal striations. Distribution and habitat Kankuamo marquezi inhabits Cuchilla San Lorenzo on the northwestern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, at an altitude of 2000 to 2300 m above sea level, in the lower montane wet forest ecozone. The location where it was found mainly consist of shrubs from the families Arecaceae and Chrysobalanaceae. The area is also inhabited by snakes of the genus Atractus and frogs of the genus Atelopus.

The routine became a sensation, and for years the girls performed as the \\"Daughters of the air\\" at circuses and varieties all over Europe. After a performance at Tivoli in Copenhagen in 1886 in front of the Danish royal family, the girls were each awarded one golden cross by the king of Denmark.

They were delivered between 1953 and 1955.Wardale, David (Uitlander) (1970). \\"Big Boy\\" of the Narrow Gauge - The S.A.R.'s \\"25\\" Class. Railway Digest International, Volume 1, No. 1, 1970. pp. 2-5.Henschel & Son works list, compiled by Dietmar StresowNorth British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Apart from the first engine and tender, another 60 tenders were built by Henschel, who held the patent, with works numbers in the range from 28780 to 28839. Another 29 tenders were built by NBL, who also built 89 of the 90 engines. The works numbers of these NBL- built tenders probably corresponded with the works numbers of the last 29 engines, in the range from 27372 to 27400, but this cannot be verified. One more tender was built by the SAR at its Salt River shops in 1963, on a spare cast water-bottom frame which had been delivered as part of the original order in 1953. Characteristics On the Class 25 condensing locomotive, spent steam was fed through a thick pipe on the engine's left side back to the tender, to be condensed back to water for repeated use. The Type CZ tender was built on a one-piece cast-steel water-bottom frame, supplied by General Steel Castings in the United States of America, and rode on three-axle bogies with Timken roller bearings. It had four diameter vacuum brake cylinders and the brake riggings of its bogies were independent of each other. Only the front bogie was equipped with a hand brake.Condensing Locomotives for South Africa - Class \\"25\\" locomotives with a total weight in working order 230.5 tons. The Railway Gazette, 26 February 1954. pp. 237-240. The tender was as long as the engine itself. Almost one-third of the total length of the condensing tender was taken up by the coal bunker, with a capacity of . This part of the tender included the oil separator equipment to remove any oil from the spent steam and the mechanical stoker equipment which had a maximum delivery rate of of coal per hour. The rear two-thirds of the tender's length was taken up by the water tanks and eight large radiators on each side, cooled by five exhaust steam-driven roof-mounted fans which drew air from outside through the radiators. The water capacity consisted of two tanks, a fresh water tank in the centre of the tender between the radiators and a condensate tank under the tender belly between the bogies. Feedwater for the engine's boiler was taken directly from the condensate tank's hot contents rather than from the main tank's cold contents. The water level in the condensate tank was controlled by a float valve which opened to replenish it from the fresh water tank as soon as the water level dropped to below and automatically closed again as soon as that level was reached again. To provide for any malfunction in the water supply, a hand-operated stop cock was provided on the fresh water tank. The condensing system proved to be extremely efficient and reduced water consumption by as much as 90% by using the same water up to eight times over. This gave the Class 25 locomotive a range of between water refills. In addition, the hot condensate feedwater resulted in a significantly reduced coal consumption. The condensing tenders were rather appropriately classified as Type CZ, since CZ is also the motor vehicle registration letters of Beaufort West, the capital town of the Karoo where the Class 25 was to serve. Locomotive thumb Only the Class 25 locomotives were delivered with Type CZ tenders, which were numbered in the range from 3451 to 3540 for their engines. An oval number plate, bearing the engine number and tender type, was attached to the rear end of the tenders. The additional tender, built by the SAR at its Salt River shops in 1963, was numbered 3541. Classification letters Since many tender types are interchangeable between different locomotive classes and types, a tender classification system was adopted by the SAR. The first letter of the tender type indicates the classes of engines to which it can be coupled. The two \\"C_\\" tender types were condensing tenders and could only be used with the specific locomotive class for which each was designed. * Type CL tender on the Class 20. * Type CZ tender on the Class 25. The second letter indicates the tender's water capacity. The \\"_Z\\" tenders had a capacity of . Rebuilding Between 1973 and 1980, after serving for twenty years and partially accelerated by the introduction of electric and diesel-electric traction over routes which were previously served exclusively by the Class 25, all but three of the Class 25 condensing locomotives, numbers 3451, 3511 and 3540, were converted to free-exhausting and non-condensing locomotives as they went through the workshops for major overhauls. The converted locomotives were reclassified to Class 25NC. The tender of the first locomotive to be converted to Class 25NC at Beaconsfield, no. 3452, was stripped of its condensing equipment, but retained its original fresh water and condensate tanks and feed pumps with the result that the boiler would now be fed with cold water, apparently with none of the ill effects which had been predicted earlier. The radiator framing and roof were panelled over. Its general appearance therefore changed little but, while the conversion of its tender was aesthetically superior when compared with subsequent conversions, it did not carry enough water.SAR-L Group Message #44177 by Phil Girdlestone on 10 November 2012.

(Accessed on 23 July 2016) The rest of the fleet was rebuilt at the Salt River shops in Cape Town at a rate of about fifteen per year. There, the condensing tenders were rebuilt to ordinary coal-and-water tenders by removing the condensing radiators and roof fans and replacing it with a massive round- topped water tank. These tenders were reclassified as Type EW2 and nicknamed Worshond tenders.

If not linked, the displayed name should be a redirect to this list. For example, the page forwards to the anchored table row using the astronomer's MPC-name as ID. * Discoveries: displays the total number of discovered and co-discovered minor planets made by the discoverer (numbered bodies only). It links to the corresponding \\"Discovery by...\\" category, which are subcategories of :Discoveries by astronomer and :Astronomical discoveries by institution, respectively. Note that these categories do not contain discoveries for which no page on Wikipedia exists. Astronomers with only a few discoveries often do not have their own discovery-category (redlinks). For those who have discovered only one single minor planet, the link in the discovery column directly points to the corresponding entry in the list of minor planets. There are typically no linked categories for astronomers with an unknown first name. * DOB‚ÄìDOD and Observatory code: displays the date of birth and death for astronomers, and alphanumeric IAU code(s) for institutions, respectively. * Country: nationality of the astronomer or location of the discovering dedicated institution, respectively. Some discoverers have assigned two flags, with the first being the most appropriate to allow for a sensible sorting by country. * Link-label; info, links and, notes: The link-label is used for piped discoverer links, intended for a consistent usage in minor-planet object articles and in the List of minor planets (see index). After the link-label, additional information is given: this includes links to external sources (Src), links to the MPC database (see here) for objects discovered or co- discovered by the astronomer, and trans-wiki links to existing articles on French, German and Italian Wikipedia. (Note that the link-label should be separated by a semi-colon from all other information). * Name(s) at MPC: displays the name of the discoverer as used by the MPC (non-diacritical version; where the abbreviated first name is written before the family name). Some discoverers have multiple names due to inconsistencies and typos. * Cite: minor-planet discoverers are often honored with the naming of (one or several) asteroids by their colleges. The associated citation typically gives the discoverer's full name, his or her date of birth and additional biographical information.

She is a member of the New People's Party (NPP) and the Civil Force (CF). She became member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong for New Territories East in 2016. Early life Yung was born in Hong Kong in 1977 and was educated at St. Francis' Canossian College and Rosaryhill School. She went on to study computer science at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and graduated in 2001. Unsuccessful in her bid to begin her chosen career as a gaming programmer, she stayed on as a research assistant and helped develop a journal research programme at UBC. After she returned to Hong Kong in the summer of 2003, she studied law at the City University of Hong Kong and qualified as a barrister in 2008. Political career Yung became a volunteer legal consultant of the New Home Association, a pro-Beijing non- governmental organisation that helps mainland Chinese immigrants and ethnic minorities integrate into Hong Kong society. She was also founding member of the Hong Kong Professionals and Senior Executives Association, a pro-Beijing professionals' association where she broadened her social circle by meeting with political and business figures. In 2015, she founded the Youth and Professional Network to help young people with start-ups. Yung joined Civil Force (CF), a pro-Beijing Sha Tin-based political group that formed an alliance with the New People's Party (NPP) in February 2014, effecting the expansion of Regina Ip's party from Hong Kong Island to New Territories East. In 2016, Yung became the NPP‚ÄìCF candidate in the Legislative Council election, leading a seven-member ticket in New Territories East and won a seat with 36,183 votes. Political views In securing her Legislative Council seat, Yung is widely considered to have received support from the central government's liaison office based in Sai Wan, with which she has confessed a \\"working relationship\\", earning her the nickname, \\"Goddaughter of Sai Wan\\". She is best known for her interest in the promotion of e-sports and her statement that \\"there should not be too much politics inside or outside of the legislature\\". She considers Regina Ip her political mentor. In May 2018, Eunice Yung caused controversy by stating that domestic workers in Hong Kong often gather in large groups in public areas, thus they affect the hygiene and daily lives of other members of the public and nearby shops. She suggested the government should segregate them by providing additional activity centres for them. Several groups representing Hong Kong‚Äôs domestic workers including The International Migrants Alliance, Asian Migrants Coordinating Body and Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions condemned the remarks as racist against migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, saying it contributed to discrimination against ethnic minorities.https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/05/24/group-slams- lawmaker-saying-hygiene-issues-arise-domestic-workers-public- gatherings/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2147803/hong- kongs-foreign-domestic-workers-plan-protest-march-over A few days later, around 150 people from the same groups held a protest outside the New People's Party Headquarters calling Yung to retract her remarks and apologise. Yung met with the protesters briefly and apologised for her remarks causing 'disrespect'.http://www.scmp.com/news/hong- kong/politics/article/2148011/lawmakers-brief-apology-hong-kongs-domestic- workers-just-not Personal life Yung is an avid gamer, describing herself as a \\"tech girl\\".

Some latter day Sanskrit enthusiasts ascribe the origin of the name to \\"Poorna Veda Puri\\" - the town of Vedas in its entirety. Another possible origin to name comes from the meaning \\"the land on the shores of Poorna river\\". Other stories play on the pun of \\"Pooni\\" or \\"Pooneeram\\" which means quiver. One of them relates that Arjuna - one of Pandavas - who once visited Lord Vishnu was given an idol and Arjuna carried it in his \\"pooni\\" (quiver). While searching for a place to install it, he met Lord Ganapati and sought help. Ganapati found this place and the idol was installed. Another story of the same variety is as follows. At the end of Dvapara Yuga, the period of Lord Krishna, the Lord himself presented an idol to Arjuna, one of the Pandavas, and asked him to install it in a proper place. He kept the idol in a bag used to keep arrows, which was called Pooneeram in local language. When he reached the place, he shouted Pooneeram Thura means 'open the bag' in local language. Thus the name Poonithura has come, according to this story. When the Kings of erstwhile cochin Dynasty made this place their capital, the area where the palaces and the fort are constructed came to known as Thiru Poonithura as the word \\"Thiru\\" shows respect.

History of Poornathrayesa Temple According to local folklore, it is said that Arjuna and Krishna requested Lord Ganesha to go ahead of them and select an appropriate place for the idol to be consecrated. Lord Ganesha travelled far and wide and finally reached a divine place which was the seat of the Vedas in its entirety[3] known as 'Poorna Veda Puri' which later became Tripunithura. Lord Ganesha was so pleased with the place that He chose a holy spot and seated there Himself. When Arjuna reached Tripunithura, he saw that Lord Ganesha has seated himself down in the place where he was to keep Lord Vishnu's idol. He requested Lord Ganesha to kindly move from there so that he may install the idol there. Lord Ganesha said that He could not move from there. As he could not place the idol anywhere on the ground other than at the appointed spot, Arjuna had no other choice and it is said that he gave Lord Ganesha a kick which caused Lord Ganesha to turn southwards and placed the idol there. The Poornathrayesa Temple is the only temple where Lord Ganesha faces southwards. All other temples traditionally have the idols facing the east and/or the west. This temple grew into the beautiful and magnificent Sree Poornathrayesa Temple we see today.

On February 5, 1924, it was the site of the Milford Mine Disaster, the worst mining accident in Minnesota history. During the accident, the mine was flooded by water from a nearby lake, killing 41 miners. Only seven men were able to climb to safety. Starting in 2010, the site has been under development by Crow Wing County as Milford Mine Memorial Park. The property was listed as the Milford Mine Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 for its state-level significance in the themes of industry and historical archaeology. It was nominated for its association with a significant event in Minnesota history, and for potential archaeological resources that could illuminate mining technology, the rise and fall of iron- ore mining on the Cuyuna Range, and the daily lives of its workers. Background First mined for manganese in 1917, the Milford Mine reached depths of by 1924 under its owner George H. Crosby; 70,000 tons of ore were mined and shipped this same year. Manganese ore, an ingredient used to make steel, was shipped from the Milford site to Duluth then to steel factories in cities including Detroit and Cleveland. Milford Disaster The disaster occurred when a surface cave-in at the mine's easternmost end tapped into mud that was a direct connection to Foley Lake. In less than twenty minutes the mineshaft flooded to within of the surface. Seven men made it to ground level, while 41 were overcome by the water or trapped in mud. The last victim's remains were recovered nine months after the disaster. Fifteen-year-old Frank Hrvatin, Jr., one of the survivors, worked alongside his father Frank Hrvatin, Sr. in the mine. On February 5, Hrvatin, Jr. was working with his senior partner Harry Hosford. When they saw the floodwater, they ran for the ladder that ascended to the surface. Miner Matt Kangas was ahead of them on the ladder. As the water rose and Kangas slowed because of the effort to climb such a distance, Hrvatin climbed between Kangas' legs and propelled the man up the ladder. Hosford was waist-deep in water when Hrvatin reached down and pulled Hosford out of the mine. They were the last three miners to make it out alive. Frank Hrvatin, Sr. was deeper in the mine and did not survive. =List of miners lost in the Milford Disaster= *Earl Bedard *Mike Bizal *Oliver Burns *George Butkovich *Emil Carlson *Valentine Cole *Evan Crellin *Roy Cunningham *Minor Graves *Clinton A.

Recovery efforts were both delicate and dangerous, as the mine was filled with mud and debris. Further, workers worried about potential cave-ins. It took months to recover the men's bodies. The last body was removed on November 9. The mine resumed operations soon after that. To investigate the disaster, Minnesota governor J. A. O. Preus appointed a five-man committee, which held hearings in May and June. The committee's final report said, \\"No blame can be attached to the mining company for this unfortunate accident. The real cause of the disaster was the fact that imminence and danger from such a rush of mud was not recognized by anyone.\\" With the decline of the need for steel during the Great Depression, the mine closed in 1932.

The paper is then presented to major donors such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank for approval. Approval allows foreign aid to be given to the country. Approval was given to Honduras on August 20, 2001. Honduras' goal was to reduce the rate of poverty in the nation from 70 percent to 40 percent by 2015. The PRS was a continuation of the \\"Master Plan for Reconstruction and National Transformation.\\" The PRS had an annual budget of 4.4 million Honduran lempiras which was distributed in about 300 million lempira lots to each of 18 of the Honduran Government departments. The funds were to be used for specific projects aimed at benefiting communities. History In 1999, 66 percent of Hondurans were poor. At that time, it was expected that an investment of $2.6 million US dollars would reduce this figure by 42 percent. A broad framework for reduction of poverty in Honduras was developed in consultation with the Honduran people. It was felt that consultation with the people was essential for community ownership and this in turn was essential for the strategy's long term sustainability. The broad framework was developed through a participatory process between January 2000 and May 2001. 3,500 people representing community organisations participated. In many cases, the representatives brought with them mandates which were based on grassroots consultations with their members. Strategies The PRS covered a number of areas. In the area of education and literacy, the PRS aimed to have 70 percent of children completing year 10 (junior) at secondary school by 2015. In the area of diet and nutrition, the PRS aimed to reduce childhood malnutrition; and provide access to potable water to 95 percent of the population. In the area of communication, the PRS planned to provide electricity to eighty percent of the general population; and provide landlines to at least 15 percent of the population. The PRS also aimed for Honduras to reach a score of 0.77 in an index of relative human development with respect to gender equality. Under the PRS, at least 20 percent of Honduran forest would be protected from clearing.  Finance  The PRS received an investment of US $2,666 million (53 billion Honduran lempiras) distributed over 15 years. That is, four billion lempiras per annum. Each department received about 300 million lempiras per annum. The funding came from the government and from the income of privatized entities. A PRS advisory board administered the funds with 1.55 percent allocated to economic development, 2.35 percent to education, health and cultural projects and 3.10 percent allocated to the development of public institutions and governance. The funding was supervised by representatives of the executive branch of the Honduran government; the PRS advisory board; the Fund for the Reduction of Poverty (FRP); members of the technical support unit (UNAT); members of the National Management Evaluation System (SINEG); the National Institute of Statistics (INE); the Unit for Efficiency and Transparency (UPET); local government; private institutions; and non-government organisations. Result In 2011, the PRS had been ineffectual in reducing poverty and outcomes were worse than prior to its implementation. From 2011 to 2012, rates of poverty in Honduras rose by five percent. Transparency Initially, the PRS website documented the project's spending but in 2010, the website was removed.

History  = Precursors = On 15 April 1878, the first antecedent was registered in this field with the establishment of a Drawing School and Paint located in Tegucigalpa; the Academy of Fine Arts and Applied Drawing to the Industrial Arts is created in 1890, founded and directed by Mr. Tom√°s Mur, of Spanish nationality. The National Academy of Drawing Claroscuro al Natual was created in 1934, under the direction of Carlos Z√∫√±iga Figueroa, and by 1938 the School of Arts and Crafts emerges, in this same year, the section of Artistic Drawing is opened, that suggested the creation of the National School of Fine Arts. = The School of Fine Arts = The National School of Fine Arts (ENBA in Spanish) was founded in 1940 by the President of the Republic, Doctor and General, Tiburcio Carias Andino. Carias Andino awarded the artists Arturo L√≥pez Rodezno, Maximiliano Ram√≠rez Euceda, Samuel Salgado, and Salvador Posadas, since a year before through a government mandate, the creation of a School of Arts; these artists had themselves proposed the creation of such school in accordance with the president. The same year they were located in the arts building of the ENBA, street 6, Avenue 2 and 3, in front of La Libertad park in Comayag√ºela, Central District. In its beginnings, the National School of Fine Arts (ENBA), students received drawing, painting, and sculpture classes; some models that were painted came in its majority from Europe, and captured by the students in a canvas mounted on an easel.  Mission  The ENBA is an educational institution that offers specialized services in the visual arts at middle level, formal and non-formal; to contribute with the development of Honduran plastic arts, the appreciation of art, national and universal culture.  Vision  The ENBA considers itself as a leading institution in the artistic- visual formation in every level of the National Educational System, promoting the different manifestations of the visual arts and cultures through the activities of teaching, investigation, and extension. Regarding their policies of cultural, academic growth and support for the teaching-learning process, the following are proposed goals in the short, medium, and long term: specify a process of reform that defines the administrative and academic regulations. Establish a mechanism of financial self-management to strengthen the academic process and cultural extension of the institution. To formulate and push a proposal for the creation of a bachelor's degree in the career of Visual Arts with different specialties. To achieve the construction of a new building that houses the facilities of what will be the New School of Fine Arts and the creation of an interactive-didactic Museum of the visual arts.  Historical and legal issues  In 1940, the National School of Fine Arts is created, ascribed to the Ministry of Development, Commerce and Industry, offering courses and diplomas to the graduates of the sixth grade in the modalities of: drawing, perspective, paint, sculpture, ceramic, wood carving and religious sculpture, studied in five years. In 1953, the school became part of the Ministry of Education. In 1956, the Plan for Bachelors and Professors of Primary Education was created, granting the title of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling, that is done in two years. This plan of studies disappeared in 1965. In 1966, the Plan of Teacher of Plastic Arts initiated for graduates of the common cycle of General Culture. This modality replaced the one of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling and was extended until the year of 1975; in this same year the agreement of Legalization of Titles and Diplomas granted since 1940 was issued. In 1976, the National School of Fine Arts is created by law and that same year, the Master Plan in Plastic Arts is created, that worked until 2005. In 1980, the bachelor's degree in graphic arts was created. In 1993, the Plastic Arts Plan for baccalaureates began, which is currently in place. In 2003, the Bachelor of Science with Orientation in Plastic Education was created within the framework of the Transformation of the National Schools, replacing the above mentioned Master Plan in Plastic Arts. = Institutional frame 1940 ‚Äì 2014 = The National School of Fine Arts is an educational public institution of plastic-artistic training of medium level, unique in its genre and academic degree. Depends on the Secretary of Education through the Departmental Direction of Education of Francisco Moraz√°n, and the District Direction No. 9. Its curricula was composed of three modalities of study at a diversified level: * 1. Bachelor's degree in Plastic Arts. * 2. Bachelor's degree in Graphic Arts. * 3. Bachelor's degree in Cultural Management. In the framework of the non-formal education it offers the following modalities: * 1. Free courses of Artistic Training. * 2. Drawing courses and Infantile Painting. This educational center, in its trajectory, has been very important in Honduran society because of its contribution to the development of visual arts and national culture. It has formed more than 90% of the creators, observers, and educators of art. = Academy = The formal academic activity is done through three modalities of study. Bachelor's degree in Plastic Arts: This plan of studies aims to endow its students of the basic and practical theoretical-artistic knowledge that allow them the elaboration of the work of art, aiming that the students become the representative artists of the national plastic arts. In addition to training them as professionals in this field, it prepares them to face their future personal challenges, of participation in society, and the ability of participating in higher studies. The aspects on which this plan is based are: aesthetic creativity, plastic artistic promoter, human relations and professional ethics, critical judgement, national identity; and democratic attitude. Bachelor's degree in Graphic Arts: This plan aims to provide to its students of technical-artistic and scientific knowledge that allows them to develop as professionals in the field of visual communication performing as graphic designers, it also forms them in the scientific-humanist area, which will enable them to opt for higher studies. School teaching in Plastic Arts: plan of studies that aims to provide its students of pedagogical, artistic, and scientific knowledge to initiate them in the development of necessary skills in the teaching of plastic art, besides preparing them to continue with higher studies in this field. Through these study modalities since year 1977 until 2006 they have graduated 1,034 young people coming from the different departments of the country. In the established study modalities in the 1957 to 1976 period graduated 154 young people, making a total of 1,188 professionals in this field. = Curricular reforms specific in educational training = The ENBA designs and executes curricular models in response to social demands and to specific historical moments. In the first years of its operation, the ENBA offers courses and diplomas to sixth grade graduates in the modalities or sections of: drawing, perspective, painting, sculpture, decoration, ceramic, carving in wood, and religious sculpture. These were developed with a duration of five years. By 1956, the Plan for Bachelors and Teachers of Primary Education was created. Giving them the title of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling, this plan was completed in two years. In 1966, the Teacher of Plastic Arts was initiated for graduates of the common cycle of General Culture, this modality replaced to one of Teacher of Drawing and Modeling and extends to the year 1975. This plan was completed in three years. In 1976, the plan of Teachers of Plastic Arts was initiated, which worked until 2005. In 1975 the agreement of Legalization of Titles and Diplomas granted from 1940 until 1975 was issued and it was \\"created\\" by law the National School of Fine Arts, ascribed to the Executive Department of Artistic and Normal. In 2003 the Bachelor's Degree of Sciences with Orientation in Plastic Education (BEP in Spanish) in the framework of the reforms of the normal and artistic education, presented by the Secretary of Education. This process lasted only five years. In 2008 under the agreement 1710- SE-2008, started again teacher training under the Teachers of Primary Education in Plastic Arts, which was completed in a three-year period, running to date. Since 2005, this institution has aimed to elevate the formation of its modalities of studies on a higher level.

Actuality of the National School of Fine arts  The National School of Fine arts (And. N. B. To.) survive with a small support of institutions and of the government, although his greater contribution to continue existing, bases in the fees paid by students. Initiated in the anniversary of the 50 years of the school, of 1990 to the 2007, the National School of Fine arts together with the Cultural Centre of Spain in Tegucigalpa and the Office of Culture, Arts and Sports, summoned each 15 November the Anthology of the Plastic and Visual Arts of Honduras for incentivar and document the annual creativity, as well as improve the social projection of the And.N.B.To. Equally, every year it surrendered homage to a teacher of the plastic Honduran. In the 2009 the number of alumni was of 260 students and it went to lower levels in 2015, when National School of Fine arts only has 236 students, in spite of the scholarships and helps awarded. = Careers = The institution offers artistic degrees that are a combination of art type and academic level. * Teaching Degree for Visual Arts * Bachelor In Graphic Arts * Bachelor In Visual Arts * Bachelor Professional Technician of Visual Artistic Design * Bachelor Professional Technician of Visual Arts * Bachelor In Humanities with Focus in Visual Arts Education  Budget  The government of Honduras decided to invest an additional 18 billion Lempiras (US$933 million) between 2001 and 2015, towards social projects in education, health and culture amounting to 35% of the budget for the reducing poverty strategy. This investment is one more component of the already decided and pre-established budget for these sectors, something the government has not made, instead maintaining the National School of Fine Arts working with a lowered budget and as of the date of May, 2014 has not delivered the 2013 budget, besides the scholarship of $15/month assigned for each student in school. Art has been ignored in Honduras, for example the maximum prize that a national artist can aspire to win is the National Prize of Art Pablo Zelaya Sierra, which only has an annual monetary reward of US$500 to the first place.

As of 2020 the Mexican Lucha libre or professional wrestling promotion known as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) promotes 28 different championships; 12 championships designated as World Championships in various divisions, 8 championships on a national level and 8 championships on a regional level. The championships are divided into weight limits as well as gender specific and size-specific divisions. The professional wrestling championships are not won through legitimate athletic competition; they are instead won via scripted endings to a match or on occasion awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. A total of 34 wrestlers hold the 28 officially CMLL promoted championships. There are thirteen male singles championships spread out over various weight classes, four championships for tag teams, three for Trios (three-man teams), three for female competitors and three for Mini-Estrella and Micro-Estrella competitors. The oldest CMLL championship is the Mexican National Welterweight Championship, created on June 17, 1934, which is also the oldest championship in professional wrestling still active. The titles branded as \\"World\\" level can or have been defended outside of Mexico, whereas the Mexican National championships are normally only defended in Mexico and only Mexican citizens are eligible to hold the championships, although occasional exceptions have been made. The regional championships are typically not promoted outside the area to which they belong, such as a specific Mexican state. The CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship was normally defended only in Arena Coliseo until 2016 when it was defended in Japan. In the 20th century CMLL strictly enforced the weight divisions, but since around 2000 the rules have occasionally been ignored. One example of this was Mephisto holding the NWA World Welterweight Championship, a belt with a upper limit, despite weighing . The Mexico City Boxing and Pro Wrestling Commission governs the Mexican National Championships but have granted CMLL control of the five championships listed. The Occidente (\\"Western\\") championships are endorsed by the Jalisco state boxing and wrestling commission and promoted by CMLL's Guadalajara branch.

Career Jim Roque debuted for Lake Superior State in the 1983‚Äì84 season helping the Lakers to their first NCAA tournament in his sophomore season. After graduating in 1987 Roque immediately turned to coaching and was behind the bench when his alma mater won their first national title in 1988. Roque stayed in Sault Sainte Marie until 1991 when he left to become the head coach for the Minot Americans. After a short stint in the SJHL Roque returned to Lake Superior State as an assistant for 1994‚Äì95 before heading out a second time to become an assistant coach for Clarkson. Roque was lured back to the Lakers once more when his old coach Frank Anzalone began a second tenure with the team and played assistant for four more years before Anzalone resigned and turned the team over to Roque. Anzalone's return was a disaster for the program, posting four consecutive seasons with single-digit wins (the first four in the 39-year history of the team). Roque responded immediately by getting the team their first winning season since the turn of the century and followed it up the year after with their first 20-win campaign since Jeff Jackson left in 1995‚Äì96. For the rest of his time with the team Roque kept them close to the .500 mark but could only get them one more winning season before the university announced that they weren't renewing his contract after the 2013‚Äì14 season.

He won the Golden Slipper Stakes, a Group One race. He amassed over three million dollars in winnings. Background Capitalist was purchased for $165,000 at the Magic Millions yearling sales from the Daandine Stud in Queensland early in 2015. He had his first trial on 21 September 2015. Racing career On 3 October 2015, Capitalist competed in the listed Breeders' Plate at Randwick Racecourse, winning by 3 lengths over 1000 metres. He was said to have \\"toyed with his opposition\\" as he, \\"streaked away.\\" Trainer Peter Snowden said, \\"He was travelling like a winner a long way out and put paid to them in a few strides without being put under any real pressure.\\" After a short spell, Capitalist returned to win the Magic Millions Wyong, a lead-in race to the Magic Millions Classic. Starting as a short-priced favourite, he won by over 2 lengths, collecting $124,000 in prize money. Capitalist was again $1.40 favourite when he raced in the Magic Millions Classic for 2-year-olds in January 2016. Despite some early trouble on the fence, he kicked in the straight to win easily and collect $1,205,000 prize money. Jockey Blake Shinn said, \\"It was tight, very tight. I thought for a second I was going up the fence, but he just held his position, that was it. That is his greatest asset ‚Äì his attitude and speed.\\" Capitalist then had a freshen before contesting the Group 2 Todman Stakes in March. Again a short-priced favourite, he was the 2nd placed of the four horses in the race, finishing behind the Gai Waterhouse-trained Kiss And Make Up. A post-race vet examination showed the horse to be mildly sore. Capitalist's sire, Written Tycoon, had won the same race in 2005. Capitalist next contested the Golden Slipper, the world's richest race for two-year-olds. After the previous loss, he was paying $8, the first time in his short career that he had not been favourite. With Extreme Choice badly missing the start, Capitalist won the race by half a length over Yankee Rose. Shinn said, \\"We never wrote this horse off after his last start defeat. You just have to have the faith and go in confident to every race. This is the best feeling ever. It is one of the greatest races in the world and to be able to win it, I can't thank everyone enough.\\" After a 147-day spell, Capitalist trialed twice before failing to place in the San Domenico Stakes on 13 August 2016. He had a freshen and another trial and then placed 3rd in the Group 2 Roman Consul Stakes.

She is credited with spearheading a movement that saved many of Providence's historic buildings from demolition in the mid 20th century and for her leadership was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1978. Biography Antoinette Forrester was born in Paxton, Illinois, in 1904, to Jay and Myrtle E. (Hartley) Forrester. She grew up in Springer, New Mexico, and developed an early interest in architecture and art. After studying art and English literature at the University of Chicago and receiving her B.A. in 1925, she went on to study architecture at Radcliffe College. She married art historian George Elliot Downing and moved to Rhode Island in 1932, beginning her career as an historical preservationist a couple of years later. After researching the state's historic buildings, she published a survey, Early Homes of Rhode Island (1937). Covering 17th, 18th, and early 19th century houses, it became the standard reference on Rhode Island buildings of those periods. Downing later worked with the newly formed Preservation Society of Newport County to develop a program to document and publicize the historic buildings of Newport. These efforts resulted in a publication coauthored with Yale architecture professor Vincent Scully, The Architectural Heritage of Newport, Rhode Island (1952). The book won the Alice Davis Hitchcock Award, offered by the Society of Architectural Historians for the year's most distinguished work in architectural history. In the 1950s and 1960s, Downing focused on preserving buildings in her College Hill neighborhood of Providence. Though many of these buildings were run-down and under threat of demolition to accommodate the expansion plans of Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, Downing recognized their historical value and with other area residents organized the Providence Preservation Society to save them. Her report on the neighborhood, College Hill: A Demonstration Study of Historic Area Renewal (1959), was adopted as the blueprint for restoring the neighborhood and led to the founding of the College Hill Historic District. Around 750 houses were restored in the district, and Downing's report became a model for other community-based historic restoration and renewal projects nationwide. As a direct result of Downing's efforts, Providence has one of the most extensive collections of habitable 18th- and 19th-century houses in the United States. Downing went on to become chair of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission in 1968, serving in that capacity for more than three decades. Under her leadership, the commission identified 50,000 historic buildings around the state, some 15,000 of which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Downing also consulted for the city of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the 1960s on a project to revitalize the district around the city's famed Whaling Museum. In the 1970s, she became a board member of SWAP (Stop Wasting Abandoned Property), an organization dedicated to managing urban renewal in ways that do not displace resident populations. Antoinette Downing died in 2001, aged 96. Her papers are held by the Rhode Island Historical Society. Honors and awards Downing's restoration efforts have been recognized by awards from the American Institute of Architects and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. She has received honorary degrees from Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, and Roger Williams College. In 1978, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame. In the 1980s, the Antoinette F. Downing Fund was established by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to support historic preservation efforts in Rhode Island. An interview with Downing forms part of the National Historic Preservation Program Oral Histories project housed at Cornell University. Personal life Downing's husband, George E. Downing (1904-1977), was chair of the art department at Brown University from 1949 to 1963. The couple had two children, Jay and Grace.

The largest Arab community in Honduras is the 250,000 people of Palestinian descent, the majority of whom (95%) are Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Estimates place the Muslim population at about 5,000-6,000.  History  Relatively few Arabs immigrated to Honduras during the 19th century. Under conservative General Captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Medina (1862-1876), the National Congress issued the first immigration law on February 26, 1866, allowing willing foreigners to reside in the country. Afterwards, the liberal reformer Dr. Marco Aurelio Soto (1876-1883) published the Political Constitution of 1876, which reflected the importance he placed on immigration for national development, including those from North America (many displaced by the aftermath of the Civil War), Europe, the Middle East and Asia, etc. The government of General Luis Bogr√°n (1883-1891) also emphasized immigration as a means to increase the national population, develop the labor force, further exploit the country's natural resources; in Honduras he offered foreigners the opportunity to treat with equality, a cordial welcome, security, and especially an influence on the Honduran national identity. Constantino Nini is cited as the first Arab to settle in Honduras in 1893, even before Christians were legally allowed to leave the Ottoman Empire in 1895. The early 20th century saw a major increase in Arab immigration to Honduras following crisis in the Ottoman Empire and World War I. In the early 20th century, Gonzalo \\"Chalo\\" Luque noted the names of many Palestinian-Arab heads-of-household in San Pedro Sula, and Mario Posas made a similar list for the developing banana plantations near La Ceiba. In 1920, Palestinian Arabs made up just 0.5% of the Honduran population according to documents from the Ministry of Foreign Relations,Ley de Inmigraci√≥n, Decreto No. 101 (Decree #101: Immigration Law) Honduras Gazette, No. 7,860, 2 Apr 1929. and the 1935 census showed just 47 \\"Turks\\" and 721 Palestinians out of a total population of 960,000. (Because many immigrants had passports from the Ottoman Empire, Arab Hondurans acquired the generic nickname of \\"Turcos\\".) However, several researchers suggest that there had been a wave of Middle Eastern immigrants to Central America in the 1920s and 1930s; hundreds of families settled primarily in Honduras, with nearly 25,000 Arabs in San Pedro Sula alone by 1930, and over 40,000 by 1940. Many of these immigrants were well-educated, and many came from Bethlehem or surrounding villages which allowed them to form cohesive and supportive social networks. Fluency in English allowed early coffee grinders to establish trade relationships with Belize and North America, and by the early 20th century, Arab families owned over 40% of local businesses according to one survey. In 1939 the Tegucigalpa Arab community organized the \\"Society Union Arab Youth\\" under the leadership of Gabriel Katt√°n and Nicol√°s Larach, which led to the founding of similar associations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Nicaragua. This organization published a weekly newspaper, Rumbos (\\"Directions\\"), and produced an exclusive radio program for Radio HRN.The Arabs and Palestinians in Honduras, 1900-1950, Publisher Guaymuras, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 2000. (Page 78) In 1968, eight Arab-Honduran members of this Society purchased six acres in a suburb of San Pedro Sula where they built a swimming pool. This eventually grew into the US$15 million Arab- Honduran Social Center complex, which included some 1,600 families as club members by 2001. Estimates placed the Palestinian Arab population at between 150,000 and 200,000 at the beginning of the 21st century, a percentage second only to Chile in the Americas. = Notable Arab-Hondurans = Despite comprising only approximately three percent of the country's population, Arab Houndurans are major players in the country's economy and politics.

The location of the capital remained there for almost 60 years, until being moved to Tegucigalpa, via Decree No. 11 on October 30th, 1880. Doctor Marco Aurelio Soto, the ‚ÄúReformer of the Republic‚Äù, also relocated the judicial and legislative headquarters, the federal reserve, and the state university to Tegucigalpa. The first presidential house in the city of Tegucigalpa was a two-story wooden building built by Juan Judas Salavarr√≠a, located on the south west side of Plaza de la Merced. Today it is the ground floor of the current Legislative Palace. The executive offices were housed on the second floor, where there were the offices of Mr. President Dr. Soto and the government Secretary General Dr. Ram√≥n Rosa . In 1883 the president of Honduras, the General Luis Bogr√°n, decided that the busy house by the Plaza de la Merced was not suitable enough, and moved the offices to another building, which was to the right of the session hall of the National Congress. This building had stone foundations, walls made out of adobe, and wide living rooms for the governmental administration, decorated with the national banner, pavilion, shields, and paintings of the national heroes. It also had a part allocated for the guard or presidential escort, which would later become the School of Capes and Sergeants. The following Honduran presidents lived in this house: General Luis Bogr√°n Barahona, General Ponciano Leiva Madrid, General Domingo V√°squez Toru√±o, Doctor Policarpo Bonilla V√°squez, Engineer Terencio Sierra Romero, General Manuel Bonilla Chirinos, Doctor Miguel Rafael D√°vila Cu√©llar and Doctor Francisco Bertrand Barahona. Doctor Francisco Bertrand Barahona would again move the governmental headquarters to a new building where today one finds the Central Bank of Honduras, and where there used to be the national post office. In 1914 Honduras undertook development for a new seat of government. The Barahona administration purchased a parcel of land from Jer√≥nimo Zelaya for 40,000 Honduran pesos. The Italian architect Augusto Bressani designed this new presidential mansion. It was a two story stone building with a classical Victorian fa√ßade, watchtowers, a presidential office, and a dome atop which flew the national flag. It also had apartments, offices on the ground floor called ‚Äúblue living rooms‚Äù for receptions, a meeting room known as the ‚Äúhall of mirrors‚Äù, a patio and cubicles for the presidential guard, ceilings with wood and clay tiling plastered and decorated with glass shard lamps, corridors lined with statues brought from Italy, and floors paved with mosaics and ceramics made in the workshops of Bellucci in Italy. Construction finished on the new presidential house in 1919 under the presidency of the General Rafael L√≥pez Guti√©rrez who was the first person to live in the new house. The following Honduran leaders lived in this house: General Vicente Tosta Carrasco, Doctor Miguel Paz Barahona, Doctor Vicente Mej√≠a Colindres, Doctor and General Tiburcio Carias Andino, Doctor Juan Manuel G√°lvez Dur√≥n, Accountant Julio Lozano D√≠az, the Military Triumvirate of 1956-1959, Doctor Jos√© Ram√≥n Adolfo Villeda Morales, General Oswaldo Enrique L√≥pez Arellano, Lawyer Ram√≥n Ernesto Cruz Ucl√©s, General Juan Alberto Melgar Castro, General Policarpo Juan Paz Garc√≠a, Doctor Roberto Suazo C√≥rdova, Engineer Jos√© Sim√≥n Azcona of the Hoyo. After 72 years of leaders living in this presidential house, and after the first two years of the administration of the Graduate Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, the presidential headquarters were moved to a modern building in the Governmental Civic Center on Miraflores Boulevard, next to the Palace of Justice. Callejas would order the restoration of the former presidential mansion, which would be urgent and costly, as the building had been given to the National Archive of Honduras (NAH) and a national museum, and the former presidential mansion had been elevated to the status of National Historical Heritage.

At the end the ex Presidential House of Honduras that occupy the president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, situated in The Governmental Civic Centre, Tegucigalpa, M.D.C. In the following two years of his government, the president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero would work in a six story building where there were also the offices of the executive, presidential appointees, presidential advisers, the paymaster, information and governmental press, the secretariat hall events, the chamber of ministers and other units. While still bigger than the former presidential mansion, even this new building didn't fulfill the needs of the executive branch. In the new building Callejas received his successor, Doctor Carlos Roberto Reina Idi√°quez, in 1994.  Current presidential residence  In 1998, the new constitutional president Engineer Carlos Roberto Flores Facuss√© was not satisfied with the building chosen by the ex president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero and decided to move the executive headquarters to a new building that was allocated for the Ministry of External Relations. The Palace Jos√© Cecilio of the Valley, originally built in 1988, designed by the architect Jorge Luciano Dur√≥n Bustillo, was chosen as the new executive headquarters. Since then, the following Honduran leaders have lived in this building: Carlos Roberto Flores Facuss√©, Graduate Ricardo Rodolfo Maduro Joest, gentleman Jos√© Manuel Zelaya Rosales, the provisional government of the gentleman Roberto Michelleti Bain, the Graduate Porfirio Lobo Sosa, and the current leader of Honduras, Lawyer Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez Alvarado.  Other presidential houses  * Between 1852 and 1853 under the presidency of the General Jos√© Trinidad Cabins the city of Santa Rosa of Cop√°n becomes the provisional capital of Honduras, and the building of the ‚ÄúNational House‚Äù turns into presidential house. Later, in 1862 during the provisional presidency of entrepreneur Victoriano Castellanos Cortes, he chose two houses he owned and made them the headquarters of the Executive and Legislative branches. It was also the temporary capital in 1863 to repel the attack of the Guatemalan General Jos√© Rafael Career Turcios. * Between 1875 and 1876 in the city of Gracias, Lempira, the General Jos√© Mar√≠a Medina occupied a house of adobe with a wooden coffer ceiling and tile clay as its seat of government.

It is part of the international organization Red Cross and Half Moon Red Crescent, which seeks to alleviate human suffering according to each particular situation.  Founding and history  The Honduran Red Cross was developed in 1924 during the second civil war. During the conflict, a group of people organized to tend to those who had been injured at the site of Tegucigalpa by rebels, following the example set by Henry Dunant during the first World War. This group of volunteers, which included Carlos Rivas, Delia Becerra, Emma Bonilla, Ernesto L√≥pez Alleys, Hern√°n L√≥pez Alleys, Isolina Guilbert, Luz Becerra, Marine Stair, Marieta Guilbert, Otilia Idi√°quez, Roberto Rivas, and Soledad Lozano, among others, became the first to carry the symbol of the Red Cross in Honduras, albeit without a concrete leader. Later, in 1932, Tiburcio Carias Andino created a national aid committee, designating civil engineer Abraham Williams Cald√©ron as its president. Williams Cald√©ron, along with Dr. Enrique Douglas Guilbert, an active member of Rotary International, decided to devise the founding of the Red Cross in Honduras. Thus, on 22 August 1934, the first board of directors was elected in a Honduran casino, which was as follows: * President Manuel Larios C√≥rdover, president of the Honduran Medical Association. * First Vice President Nicol√°s Cornelsen. * Second Vice President Abraham Williams Cald√©ron, civil engineer and general. * Vice President of the Republic and Minister of Governing, Justice, Health, and Welfare, Dr. Francisco S√°nchez Urbina. * Secretary Ricardo Diego Alduvin, director of the hospital and dean of the faculty of medicine. * Treasurer Donato Diaz Medina, leader of the bank of Honduras. * Salvador Paredes. In 1937, a group of women organized and sponsored the first group of Honduran aid workers; however, they were not yet defined as the Honduran Red Cross. Focused on their requests to the government to obtain legal status, they developed activities to benefit the Honduran society. On September 4 of the same year, the president, doctor, and general Tiburcio Carias Andino, in a meeting at the Presidential House of Honduras, granted a well deserved legal recognition to the group, organizing a board of directors. Original members included Adolfina Mej√≠a, Berta Garc√≠a de Saenz Rico, Elia Pineda de Fort√≠n, Ernestina de Landa, Enriqueta Gir√≥n de L√°zarus, Dr. Guillermo Dur√≥n, Dr. Hern√°n L√≥pez Alleys, lawyer H√©ctor Pineda Ugarte, Dr. Humberto D√≠az Banegas, Isabel Siqueiros de Pinel, Isolina Lozano de Guilbert, Josefina Mej√≠a, lawyer Jorge Fidel Dur√≥n, Dr. Juan A. Mej√≠a, Dr. Manuel C√°ceres Vijil, Dr. and future president Ram√≥n Villeda Moral, and lawyer Rub√©n √Ålvarez Channels. By means of Decree No. 475 issued on 6 October 1937, the institution was known officially as the Honduran Red Cross, with the intended function of engaging in humanitarian action in the national territory. In 1941, L√°zarus Henrietta, serving as president of the Honduran Red Cross, requested the National Congress of Honduras to issue a law establishing income for the organization. It was issued as the \\"law of the income of the seal of the Red Cross\\" so that the organization would receive finances in order to sustain themselves independently and continue providing social services. The economic funds received by the organization would help the organization to sustain itself independently and continue providing social services. In October 1937, the original group of volunteers from 1924 were recognized for the first time. In 1942, the first units were established in San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cort√©s, Tela, and La Ceiba. These units were authorized to retain 40% of donations collected by donors and benefactors and sending the other 60% to the central committee. In the same year, the Infant Consul was founded, with the goal of providing help and support to Honduran children. In 1950, the organization received its first ambulance, a Ford model. In 1954, the then president of Honduras, Dr. Juan Manuel G√°lvez, donated land for the construction of the official headquarters. In 1978, the official statutes of the Honduran Red Cross were published. The Honduran Red Cross has had a major impact on several Honduran events, such as the third civil war of 1931, the events of 1954, the Football War of 1969. Together with ACNUR and Doctors without Borders, they have backed the mobilization of civilians in the border zones with El Salvador and Nicaragua, as in the natural disasters caused by the Hurricane Fifi-Orlene of 1971 and Hurricane Mitch, which devastated the north and central zones of the Central American country in 1998.

The force is organised into regional headquarters, municipal headquarters, headquarters of fixed or mobile stations, and police posts. There are at least 360 police centres throughout Honduras. The National Police of Honduras has its headquarters in Tegucigalpa, the capital city of Honduras. The National Police of Honduras is the fourth largest police body in Central America by number of employees (more than Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Belize). It is the sixth largest force in Central America by police officers per capita. The force's patroness is the Virgin of Carmen. On 16 July of each year the \\"National Police Patroness Day\\" is celebrated.  History  =Origins= In 1866, the ruling general in Honduras, Jos√© Mar√≠a Medina made the \\"Law of Rural Police\\". A group of men were given powers similar to those of a Justice of the peace. This group of officers was later called the \\"Body of the Gendarmerie\\". In December 1881, the president of the republic, Marco Aurelio Soto, instituted the \\"Police of the Line\\" in Tegucigalpa and Comayag√ºela. There was a Commandant, a sub-commander, an assistant, four sergeants, and five policemen. On 15 January 1882, by order of President Marco Aurelio Soto, the National Police of Honduras was established. On 14 September 1888, the acting president, General Luis Bogr√°n, issued a decree that a port police unit be formed. The new unit became operational on 1 January 1890.Los deliberantes, el poder militar en Honduras. In the 1930s, the first National Directorate of Criminal Investigation was formed and in 1933, a division of traffic policing was created. =Military rule= In 1957, government and military relations in Honduras began to deteriorate. In June 1959, the National Police of Honduras was replaced by the \\"Civil Guard\\", a paramilitary force with policing duties. The 1963 Honduran coup d'√©tat led by Colonel Arming Vel√°squez Cerrato and Oswaldo L√≥pez Arellano removed President Ram√≥n Villeda Morales from power. On 9 October 1963, the Special Security Corps (CES) was formed by Chief of State Arellano. The first director of the CES was General Alonzo Flores Guerra. Rural and highway patrol units were formed. In 1969, during the Football War (conflict between Honduras and El Salvador), the CES fought on the side of the Honduras army. In 1974, a unit for the policing of inland revenue was created. On 30 January 1975, the CES was disbanded and \\"FUSEP\\", a public security force, was formed as a branch of the military. The officers of FUSEP were outfitted in green uniforms and armed with regulation 9mm Browning Hi-Power pistols and FN FAL (Rifle Automatique L√©ger) 7.62√ó51mm calibre NATO rifles. =Return to civil governance= From 1982, Honduras returned to civil rule and the police force was to be separated from the military. However, at the time, the police force kept some military characteristics. It operated under the auspices of the Office of National Defense and Public Security (SDNSP) and under the authority of the director of the FFAA, who was a representative of the president. There was continuation of a National Directorate of Investigation (DNI). The commander-in-chief, a general, was a graduate of the General Jos√© Trinidad Caba√±as National Police Academy of Honduras (ANAPO), and sometimes of the National Police University of Honduras (UNPH). On 4 January 1982, the Captain Jos√© Santos Guardiola Centre for Police Instruction (CIP-CJSG) (the Police Technical Institute (ITP- CJSG)) was established. In July 1984, the School for Qualification of Police Officials (ECOP) (\\"Upper Institute of Police Education\\" (ISEP)) was established. In 1993, a new division, the Directorate General of Criminal Investigation (DGIC) was created. On 17 December 1996, by Decree Number 229-96, Congress ordered the transfer of the police force to civil control. The governing body was a board chaired by Hern√°n Corrales Padilla. The board members were lawyers Jorge Ponce Turcios, Francisco Cardona Arg√ºelles, Germ√°n Leitzelar Vidaurreta, Felipe Elvir Sierra, Jos√© Zamora Bados, and the engineer, Alfredo Landaverde. On 28 May 1998, by Decree Number 156-98, the \\"Organic Law of the National Police\\" (LOPN) was created. The governing civil body was the Secretariat of State in the Dispatch of Security. The decree was administered by Hern√°n Corrales Padilla (1924 - 1999). On 22 May 2012, the General Director of the Honduran National Police, Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, known as \\"El Tigre\\" was appointed. On 19 December 2013, Valladares left office, replaced by Ram√≥n Antonio Sabill√≥n Pineda.El Heraldo (Honduras) (Consultado 9/enero/2014)Martinez O. \\"Honduras' Macho Cops\\" New York Times 8 March 2014.

In 1998, the president, Carlos Roberto Flores, and the National Congress of Honduras, passed legislation that would establish a new National Police of Honduras. The new force was formed by 2001. Organisation The National Police of Honduras operates under the legal framework of the \\"Organic Law of the National Police\\". Article 293 of the Constitution of Honduras by Decree 136-1995 and Decree 229-1996 in addition to Article 22 of its Organic Law by Decree No. 67-200815 defines the work of the National Police. The National Police of Honduras is governed by the office of the Director General of the National Police (DGPN). There is oversight by the Office of Security (one of sixteen secretariats of the Executive Branch of the government) headed by the Minister of Security. In 2010, the Office of Security operated with a budget of Lps. 3,129,454,629 (US$165.143 million). The main division of the force, the \\"Direcci√≥n Nacional de la Polic√≠a Preventiva\\", DNPP (preventive policing unit) had the highest expenditure at about Lps. 1.333.687.852 (US$70.3 million).

It combats the production, use, possession and illegal trafficking of arms and drugs. It enforces the legal order of transportation, transit and roads, and exercises security functions in immigration matters. The DNPP is managed by officers with a degree in Police Science.

He spent the bulk of his academic career at Marquette University, although he also spent several years teaching and researching in Central America.In the 1980s, Dr. Thompson received a Fulbright Fellowship, allowing him to study both in Mexico and Guatemala. He and an MU colleague, Dr. Adrian Dupuis, were involved in the Philosophy for Children program; their students were Mexican and Guatemalan teachers who, having been prepared under dictatorships, had to shift their pedagogy during the reconstruction to provide children with more astute critical thinking skills. After his retirement in 1988, he and his wife established a small coffee plantation outside Antigua Guatemala. They used the plantation as an educational tool, a fund-raising project (to provide scholarships and employment for local youth), and a tourist destination. Finca Los Nietos At his 1988 retirement from Marquette University, Thompson and his wife traveled to the small town of San Lorenzo de Cubo, 7 km southwest of Antigua Guatemala. They reclaimed a patch of mountainous land which had been used as a trash dump, and turned it into a coffee-producing tract. They created small artisanal bags of coffee, selling them to shops in town, shipping them to the States, and giving tours to tourists. They became a cherished part of their small community, sent many Guatemalan girls to school, employed the local teens, became part of the community, and were considered family by many of the locals. In addition to his work on the coffee plantation, Thompson painted, My Father's Paintings - Studio at the Herrmann-Hinton House, Antigua Guatemala (August 8, 2009) explored silversmithing, and designed the house that they had built on the plantation. He became a self-taught expert on the local fauna, and cultivated several species of orchids. Dan Piraro, Gagging for Medals, July 17, 2016 By 2003 their small plantation boasted 2000 coffee trees, with an annual production of 400 lb (180 kg) of red coffee beans. They also purchased neighbors' crops, and provided a roasted product for market. They sought ways to \\"localize\\" their product, bagging their coffee with local weavings, making and affixing small hand-made dolls on the bag cincture, and hiring a woman to hand-dip coffee beans (as well as peanuts and pretzels) in chocolate. In addition to growing and processing coffee, the Finca became a small cultural center. Beginning in 1996, visitors were invited to enjoy Dr. Thompson's \\"coffee class\\". They learned of soil composition, harvesting, processing and roasting coffee; observed the art of orchid growing; and toured gardens with over 150 different flowers, bushes and trees. By 2003, some 4000 visitors had been logged at the center. In 2008 the project was sold to a Cuban-American family, Ra√∫l and Christina Keilt. The new owners built on the foundation provided by the two decades of effort from the Thompsons, continuing the plantation's reputation as a combination resort/tourist-education site.

Established in 2014, Electric Kiwi has a focus on using cloud computing and smart meters to service customers in the major urban areas around the country. Its services depend on the presence of the smart meters in the customer's home. Over one million households in New Zealand were equipped with smart meters as of January 2014 . It is owned by Energy Collective limited, 66.8% of stock is owned by Scientific Investors Ltd. of the United Kingdom and the other 33.2% by private investors. Electric Kiwi offers a free off-peak hour of power to its customers between 9am-5pm and 9pm-7am every day. As at 31 March 2019, Electric Kiwi had 37,000 customers, giving it a 1.7% share of the retail market and making it the 10th-largest retailer in New Zealand.  History  Electric Kiwi was established in mid-2014 and took on its first ‚Äòtest‚Äô customers in December of that year, before launching to the public in May 2015. The company's founders, including Julian Kardos, saw an opportunity in the electricity retailing market for a provider which leveraged the capabilities of smart meters which it and Consumer advocacy group Consumer NZ believed were being under utilised at that time. Electric Kiwi used the information from smart meters to allow the more accurate purchase of electricity from wholesalers with the intent of passing on those savings to its customers. In April 2017, Electric Kiwi accused competitor Trustpower of intentionally slowing the uptake of smart meters with their customers to prevent them shifting to retailers that rely on smart meter technology. The Electricity Authority said they were satisfied with efforts by retailers to roll out smart meter use. In July 2018, it was reported that Electric Kiwi's free hour of power was causing local lines in northern Dunedin to overload, causing regular outages. The area is home to a large number of students from the University of Otago and Otago Polytechnic, many of whom had chosen the same hour for free power. Electric Kiwi claimed the issue was due to inadequate local lines infrastructure and low-quality housing in the areas, while local lines company Aurora Energy claimed that it would be uneconomical to provide extra capacity to deal with short term spikes and that retailers should ensure any promotion does not cause disruptions on their network. In September 2019 the Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority launched the 'Gen Less' campaign targeted at this demographic to encourage less energy use. During an October 2018 spike in prices in the New Zealand wholesale electricity market, Electric Kiwi announced a halt on customers switching from spot-price providers. Electric Kiwi CEO Luke Blincoe stated \\"Choosing a spot- based retailer is similar to not insuring your car. You can end up paying more if something goes wrong. While we would love to help, it's a bit like calling your insurance company to get cover after a car crash has happened.\\" Electric Kiwi laid a joint complaint to the Electricity Authority in October 2018 with Flick Electric, Pulse and Vocus Communications over the market spike, alleging an 'Undesirable Trading Situation'. In February 2019, the Electricity Authority found that the price spike had been a result of outages and a lack of information about gas supply, finding no evidence of anti-competitive behavior by generators. In June 2019 Electric Kiwi complained to the Commerce Commission and the Advertising Standards Authority that competitor Meridian Energy was 'greenwashing' in their advertising campaign stating that they generate power from 100% renewable energy sources. As most energy generated in New Zealand goes into the same lines for distribution, they argued this could mislead consumers to believe the power they were getting from Meridian was the power they generated. Both the ASA and CC dropped the complaint. In 2019, Electric Kiwi funded two studies by Auckland University of Technology on 'kiwi' identity. After heavy rainfall and flooding in Southland in November 2019, Electric Kiwi joined small retailers in lodging a complaint to the Electricity Authority over competitors Meridian Energy and Contact Energy's spilling of water from their hydro power stations. Both stated that they had acted correctly. In April 2020 Electric Kiwi complained to the Electricity Authority that competitor Genesis Energy were breaching the New Zealand Government Electricity Pricing Review Panel's ban on 'Win Backs', a practice where customers would be offered a better deal by their electricity retailer if they said they would leave. Genesis admitted fault and apologized. On May 16 while New Zealand was in isolation at home during the COVID-19 epidemic, Electric Kiwi sponsored the 'Jam on Toast' live music festival, streamed online through Facebook.
