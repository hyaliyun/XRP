In 1793 Martin or Jacques Fabien converted ten of them into chaloupes-canonni√®res (gun-vessels). One of these received the name Eclair. Sir Richard Strachan's squadron captured her in 1795 in Cartaret Bay, and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Eclair. She then sailed to the West Indies where she was probably out of service by 1801. In 1802 she was hulked under the name HMS Safety. She then served as a prison ship at Jamaica around 1808 to 1810. She may have been sold at Tortola in 1817/18, but in 1841 or so was brought back into service there as a receiving hulk. She was broken up in 1879. French service Between September and November 1793, the chasse maree that became Eclair was converted to a lugger and armed with three 18-pounder guns. Between 11 October 1794 and 30 December 1794, Eclair was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu Bonnaire. She escorted a convoy from Barfleur back to her station at Cherbourg roads.Fonds Marine, p.92. Then between 30 January 1795 and 29 April she was in the Cherbourg roads under the command of enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu Duport.Fonds Marine, p.150. Capture On 9 May 1795 Strachan, in , was in command of a squadron that attacked and destroyed a French convoy in Cartaret Bay. The British squadron spotted a convoy of 13 vessels and immediately gave chase. Twelve of the quarry escaped and got close to the shore where a small shore battery, their own armed escorts, and a brig and a lugger offered some protection. Strachan sent in the boats from the vessels in his squadron while Melampus and the ships provided covering fire. The French crews abandoned their vessels at the approach of the British and eventually the shore battery also stopped firing. The cutting out party retrieved all the vessels, save a small sloop, which was hard ashore and which they burnt. Melampus had eight men wounded and in all the British lost one man killed and 14 wounded. They captured a gun brig and a gun lugger, each armed with three 18-pounder guns. They also captured the convoy, which consisted of: Prosperitte (80 tons and carrying cordage), Montagne (200 tons and carrying timber, lead and tin plates), Catharine (200 tons and carrying ship timber), Hyrondelle (220 tons and carrying ship timber and pitch), Contente (250 tons carrying powder), Nymphe (120 tons and carrying fire wood), Bonne-Union (150 tons), Fantazie (45 tons and carrying coals), Alexandre (397 tons and carrying ship timber, cordage, hemp and cannon), and Petit Neptune (113 tons and carrying ship timber). A later prize money report added the names of two more vessels, Crachefeu and Eclair. was the gun-brig and Eclair the gun-lugger; the Royal Navy took both into service. British service The Royal Navy commissioned Eclair in July 1795 under the command of Lieutenant Joseth [sic] Withers. He then sailed her for the Leeward Islands on 12 April 1796. Eclair was converted to a schooner in 1796, presumably before she sailed. Eclair sailed for the Leeward Islands on the same day as Crachefeu, and so possibly in company with her. Eclair was probably paid-off and laid up before 1801. On 17 January 1801 the British captured the French schooner at Trois-Rivi√®res, in the French Antilles. The Royal Navy commissioned this Eclair as HMS Eclair, and throughout her subsequent career referred to her as His Majesty's schooner Eclair. Although there were a few cases where two vessels in the same theatre might share a name, generally as soon as the Admiralty became aware of the name conflict it would rename one of the vessels to remove ambiguity. That there were two Eclair schooners on active duty in the West Indies at the same time is highly improbable. In 1802 the Eclair of 1795 returned to service as the hulk HMS Safety. Safety was listed as a guardship in the West Indies in 1808 and as prison ship in 1810. However, Lieutenant Joseph Williams was appointed to command \\"the Safety prison ship, at Jamaica\\" in 1808.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 19, p.262. Furthermore, Lloyd's List reported that on 7 April 1808 HMS Safety had sent Tortola, Fotheringham, master, into Tortola.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4253. Safety was at Tortola in 1817, and the Navy may have disposed of her there in 1817/18. However, Safety then reappeared as a receiving hulk at Tortola in 1841. The Navy List of 1862 listed her as \\"Safety, Schooner. Receiving Hulk. Tortola.\\"Admiralty (1862), p.216. She was finally broken up in 1879.

Definition of a child The lack of legal protection for children in times of war, which allows for their exploitation, can be linked to the lack of a universally recognised definition of a child during World War II. Prior to the creation of the United Nations during World War II, protection of child welfare was predominantly embodied in the laws of war, jus in bello.Khan, Myra. \\"International Laws Concerning the Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers and the Case of Omar Khadr\\" , St Jerome's University, Retrieved on 13 April 2015.

Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment in Law and Practice in Sudan. December 2010 at p 15 Capital punishment in practice Procedural guarantees For a person charged with a capital crime in Sudan there are a number of procedural guarantees they should receive: *Innocent until proven guilty *The person charged with the offence should not be forced to self incriminate or be made to take any oaths except under limited circumstances. *There is a right to appeal *The person charged has the right to medical care, to be safe from harm and to be able to contact a lawyer and their family *Bail. However Article 106 (1) states that \\"the detained for crimes punishable with the death penalty or an amputation shall not be released\\". These guarantees are only available at trial stage meaning that during the investigation period individuals may be dangerously exposed, particularly because torture (though illegal under Sudanese law) has been documented on numerous occasions.African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies, Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment and Law in Sudan, December 2010 at p 15. Cases The following cases demonstrate the kinds of actions that have led to recent episodes of capital punishment in the country. Although Sudan is a signatory to the U.N Convention on the Rights of the Child until an amendment made in 2010, Sudan was still one of the few remaining countries whose death penalty extended to juveniles. One of the last juveniles to be killed by death penalty was Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed in May 2009. He had been found guilty of murder and robbery. The decision was decided based on two factors, as confirmed by the UN Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers; firstly, the prohibition of the death penalty for children did not extend to hudud offences, and secondly the Court believed that because the definition of 'adult' in the Criminal Act was \\"any person whose puberty has been established by definite natural features and who has completed 15 years of age and whoever obtains 18 years of age shall be deemed an adult even if the features of puberty do not exist\\". Using this definition of adult, the Court determined that Abdulrahman could be treated as an adult, even though he was only 17 at the time he was arrested. Also in 2009, four children between the ages of 15 to 17 were sentenced to death after being found guilty of armed robbery. In 2007 two young women in their early 20s were sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery under Article 146 (a) of the Criminal Act. The woman did not have legal representation nor assistance to help defend themselves.African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies, Widening the Scope: The Expanding Use of Capital Punishment and Law in Sudan, December 2010 at p 3 Criticism Criticism of capital punishment in Sudan usually centers on two rights protections: the protection to the right to life and the protection against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These rights are both recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights. There are a number of human rights violations that occur because of Sudanese law. For example, Article 126 (2) of the 1991 Criminal Act, which stipulates religious crimes that may result in capital sentencing, is a violation of the right to freedom of conscience and religious creed. Also, though the procedural guarantees are consistent with international standards, they are limited in practice and the lack of access to bail is evidence of this. Sima Samar, the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Sudan has noted in the past that the lack of sufficient guarantees of a fair trial for the accused facing the death penalty demonstrates serious doubts about compliance.Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Sudan, Sima Samar to the Commission on Human Rights, E/CN.4/2006/111, 11 January 2006 at para 54.

History The Cagayan de Oro City Central School opened for the children of Misamis Oriental in 1909. One of the oldest structures built in this school, the Gabaldon Building, still stands. In 1909, there were already 51 Gabaldon Buildings throughout the Philippines, including the Gabaldon Building in Cagayan Intermediate School (former name of the Cagayan de Oro City Central School). The Gabaldon Building of Cagayan de Oro City Central School was inaugurated on August 28, 1911, according to the Cagayan de Oro City Historical Commission. The construction was inspired by Isauro Gabaldon, the deputy to the First Philippine Assembly in 1909. He was noted for promulgating the Education Act of 1801, better known as the Gabaldon Law, endorsing the construction of school buildings across the archipelago. The land for construction of Cagayan Intermediate was donated by the philanthropist Tirso Neri ‚Äì the first municipal presidente or mayor of Cagayan during the American colonial period in 1901-1904. The donated lot has a total lot area of 37,766 sq. m. bounded on the north by the Pelaez Sports Center which used to be the stable of the donor, and Don Apolinar Velez Street on the eastern side. The Gabaldon building was at first used as a Multigrade building occupied by Grade I to VI and was the first venue of the first significant school event ‚Äì the graduation in 1916. The Department of Education and the Heritage Conservation Society embarked on a project to restore the historic school building through the Heritage Schoolhouse Restoration Program in 2009.

Specifically, it empowered the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to take enforcement action against individuals, employers, and labor unions which violated the employment provisions of the 1964 Act, and expanded the jurisdiction of the commission as well. It also required employers to make reasonable accommodation for the religious practices of employees. The employment provisions of the 1964 Act only applied to firms with 25 or more employees; the 1972 Act extended that to firms with 15 or more employees. The version of the bill reported out of the House Committee on Education and Labor would have decreased the threshold to eight employees; however, some senators, including Norris Cotton (R-NH), Paul Fannin (R-AZ), and John C. Stennis (D-MS), expressed concern for the impact on small businesses. (During the debate on the initial version of Title VII in 1964, Cotton in particular had proposed increasing the threshold to 100 employees)..

Multinational corporations in particular have been singled out as important figures, for better or worse, in the maintenance of human rights given their economic status and international dimension. As it currently stands there is no mechanism at the international level which can hold corporations legally accountable. Reliance has instead been placed upon a number of soft law instruments the most important one of which is the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. With the potential exception for redress under the Alien Tort Statute corporations are only legally accountable for human rights violations under the municipal law of the Nation in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or the company is based. Multinational corporations and human rights Multinational corporations emerged in the 1990s as one of the most significant challenges to the dominance of states in the social and economic international order.Robert C.

The power of multinationals has been recognized as diminishing the ability of weaker states to enforce human rights. Furthermore, concerns have been raised over the operation of multinationals in countries which have a poor human rights record. Numerous cases such as Doe v. Unocal Corp. alleging gross human rights violations carried out by multinationals or their associates in countries such as Burma (Myanmar) exist. Whilst concern has been raised over the role multinationals have played in human rights violations, recognition has also been given to the fact that multinationals have the potential to promote human rights in states with a poor track record beyond the ability of other nation states. Accountability under the International human rights framework Under the International human rights framework corporations can only be held directly accountable for human rights violations which constitute international crimes as provided for in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.Emeka Duruigbo \\"Corporate Accountability and Liability for International Human Rights Abuses: Recent Changes and Recurring Challenges\\" (2008) 6 Nw U J Int'l Hum Rts 222 at 224 Under the orthodox view States are the primary ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù of international law, and whilst International Organizations hold international legal personality, individuals and corporations hold limited standingDapo Akande \\"International Organizations\\" in Evans, MD (ed) International Law (3rd ed, Oxford, Oxford, 2010) at 256 There has been extensive debate on what status multinational corporations should hold at international law.

United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights stand as the authoritative statement on the human rights standards corporations should adhere to. The Principles consist of a three pillar framework: protect, respect and remedy. The Principles do not create new law or impose obligations on corporations, instead they provide what should constitute best practice.Robert C. Blitt, above n 1, at 43 The protect pillar retains the orthodox position that is the responsibility of states to protect human rights. The respect pillar holds that corporations should respect human rights, undertaking due diligence to ensure that their conduct does not infringe upon any rights. The remedy pillar calls for remedies both judicial and non-judicial to be provided for those whose human rights have been infringed by a corporation. The response to the Principles has been mixed. The OECD, European Commission, and the United Nations Global Compact have all endorsed the Principles as providing clarity and a point of reference for future developments.at 50 Of most significance the United Nations Human Rights Council formally endorsed the Principles shortly after their publication., \\"UN Human Rights Council endorses principles to ensure businesses respect human rights\\" UN News Centre (16 June 2011) The Principles not been met with universal favour. The International Federation for Human Rights, which represents numerous human rights groups, criticized the Principles for failing to provide an effective remedy for victims on an international level and failing to recognize the responsibility of states for the actions of their companies abroad., International Federation for Human Rights \\"UN Human Rights Council adopts Guiding Principles on business conduct, yet victims still waiting for effective remedies\\" (17 June 2011) Although currently non-binding there has been speculation by scholars that the Principles could provide a platform for a binding instrument or solidify into customary international law therefore creating legally binding obligations.John H.

The Guidelines require participating states to establish National Contact Points (NCP). Allegations from individuals can be brought forward to the NCP. These are referred to as specific instances. The merits of the claim are then addressed by the NCP and if a case is found then an investigation will be undertaken. Mediation may take place between the company in question and the complainant as one of the final stages in the process. If a company is found to be in breach of the guidelines then a Final Statement will be produced outlining the violations of the Guidelines which occurred along with an impact assessment. Although remedies for any breaches of human rights are sought they cannot be enforced under the Guidelines. Amnesty International has commented that the Guidelines provide a \\"lens for examining business conduct with regard to human rights.\\" , Amnesty International United Kingdom, Briefing for UK National Contact Point on Human Rights Implementation of OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (Amnesty International, June 2013) at 6 In this sense it has been argued that the OECD Guidelines have the potential to promote a degree of accountability. Amnesty International in its Briefing for the UK National Contact Point advised on the potential repercussions of a Final Statement for companies found to be non-compliant. Reputation, ability to operate, and value of shares may all be detrimentally affected by a finding of non-compliance.at 7 Amnesty believes that this may act as a deterrent, leveling the playing field for those companies who ensure they adhere to human rights standards.at 8 The rationale behind this being that the cost-benefit relationship is altered in favour of adherence to human rights. Company codes Many companies have taken it upon themselves to adopt their own codes of conduct which are self-imposed ethical standards. Most contain provisions on human rights. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre maintains a list of companies which have a human rights policy in place. Whilst codes promote accountability, critics have argued that given their voluntary nature, and generally speaking lack of enforcement mechanisms, they are of limited value.John C.

In Europe jurisdiction is granted to hear civil claims against via Resolution 44/2001 of the European Council but this requires that the corporation in question be domiciled in a Member State.International Federation for Human Rights, above n 21, at 216 The Alien Tort Statute is unique in that it in principle provides Federal courts in the United States of America with near universal jurisdiction to hear claims alleging serious violation of customary international law or the \\"law of nations\\", the only nexus required being that the defendant be present in the United States.at 181 However, the application of the statute to claims made against multinational corporations for human rights violations occurring abroad remains uncertain. Corporate liability for extraterritorial harms has been allowed by the Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and D.C. Circuits but an increasing number of procedural limitations restricting access of foreign plaintiffs to redress have emerged.Mirela V. Hristova, above n 6, at 106 The recent decision of the Supreme Court in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. ruled that there is a presumption against the extraterritorial application of the Alien Tort Statue.Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 621 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2010). The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre cites Kiobel as a turning point in the use of the Alien Tort Statue as a means for redress for human rights violations at the hands of corporations, and part of a wider trend globally in which avenues for extraterritorial claims are closing.

In 1960, when Stoessl was a child, he and his family moved from England to London, Ontario, after his father was offered a job in Canada. He received his medical degree from the University of Western Ontario in 1979, after which he completed an internship at McGill University and a residency in neurology at the University of Western Ontario, where he studied alongside Alastair Buchan. Career In 1984, Stoessl joined the faculty of the University of British Columbia, where he worked on the positron emission tomography program with Donald Calne for two years. He then worked at the Neuroscience Research Centre in the UK for two years in the late 1980s. In 1996, he joined the faculty of UBC again, where he has remained ever since. Scientific work In 2001, Stoessl published a paper in Science which found that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease might be due to patients' anticipation of benefit, and that substantial dopamine is released in the brains of Parkinson's patients in response to placebo administration. Subsequent research by Stoessl has found that dopamine is released in the brain of Parkinson's patients when they are given a placebo, but only if they are told the probability of it being a real drug is 75 percent. He has said that \\"In Parkinson's, as in many other conditions, there is an important placebo response and that can be measured with clinical outcomes.\\" Awards and honors Stoessl holds a Canada Research Chair.

On February 4, 1980, he and Vivien Thomas were the first to successfully implant an automatic defibrillator in a human patient at Johns Hopkins University. This took place only a mere seven months after Watkins completed his surgical education at Johns Hopkins. Today, millions of patients everywhere use this device, which detects irregular heart beats and corrects them. Watkins was known to be a determined, passionate, and caring individual. He used this compassion to fuel his movement for minorities within the medical field. Today, people still use his wisdom and ideas based on civil rights activism to make medical schools more representative of the diversity of the human race. Vanderbilt University even has a lecture series held annually in his honor, in order to discuss the importance of inclusivity within the university. Early life and education Watkins was born in Parsons, Kansas to Levi Watkins Sr. (1911‚Äì1994) and Lillian Varnado (1917‚Äì2013). He grew up with five siblings: two brothers, James Watkins and Donald V. Watkins Sr., and three sisters, Doristine L. Minott, Emma Pearl McDonald and Annie Marie Garraway. The family moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where his father served as the sixth president of Alabama State College from 1962 to 1983 and his mother worked as a high school teacher. As a child, Watkins was baptized by Ralph Abernathy in Birmingham, Alabama. Reverend Abernathy served as a leader in civil rights and worked diligently with Martin Luther King Jr. Watkins was the valedictorian of his class at Alabama State Laboratory High School. He was motivated to seek a career in the medical field by a Biology professor at Tennessee State University. Watkins graduated from Tennessee State University with a degree in Biology. Afterward, he attended the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and became the first African American to obtain a medical degree from that institution. He learned of his acceptance through a newspaper article about him in Nashville. By the time he graduated in 1970, Watkins was still the only black student at the school. He was a member of Alpha Omega Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Alpha Kappa Mu, and Beta Kappa Chi. Medical career Watkins began his medical residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1971. There, he became chief resident of cardiac surgery, acting as the first African American chief resident at the university. Two years after his research on angiotensin blockers at Harvard, Watkins returned to Johns Hopkins and joined the admissions department in 1979. In 1980, he began his work on the defibrillator, which he improved upon during his time at Johns Hopkins. Watkins also used this time to enhance techniques for open heart surgery, many of which are still used today. He was named a professor of cardiac surgery in 1991, and concurrently held the post of Associate Dean of the School of Medicine until his retirement in 2013. In 1993, his father, Levi Watkins Sr., had a stroke and required vascular surgery. His siblings requested that Watkins perform the surgery, as they knew he was an exceptional cardiac surgeon. He prayed before the surgery. The surgery was successful.  Work on angiotensin blockers  Watkins left Johns Hopkins in 1973 for Harvard University where he researched the use of angiotensin blockers in cases of congestive heart failure until 1975. Angiotensin blockers were created in order to avoid the side effects of ACE inhibitors, which were previously the drug of choice for lowering blood pressure and treating congestive heart failure. The research work that Watkins completed during those two years at Harvard contributed to the safety and efficiency of the drug. His research clearly paid off, as this drug is still used today in patients that cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors to treat their congestive heart failure. Civil rights activism Watkins with fellow surgeon Ben Carson in 2000 As a young boy, Watkins and his family met Martin Luther King's family through their church. Watkins was eight years old when he met King, who served as the family's pastor. From that point on, he became invested in the civil rights movement, and spent the rest of his life fighting for other fellow African Americans and other minorities who were struggling in their advance in the medical field. In 1955, when Watkins was only 11 years old, he took part in the Montgomery bus boycott that took place after the bus incident with Rosa Parks. He also worked closely with King, serving as a volunteer driver for the civil rights leader. Later in his life, he was selected to serve on the admissions board at Johns Hopkins University where he spent his last years making the school more fair to all ethnicities, especially minorities. He improved conditions at the school so much that between the years of 1978 and 1983, the school's population of African American students increased 5-fold. Watkins acted as an adviser to several important African American figures, such as James E. K. Hildreth and Selwyn M. Vickers. Hildreth was the dean of the College of Biological Sciences at UC Davis and is also an immunologist who spent much of his career helping with AIDS research. Vickers acted as the first African American dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Death and legacy Watkins died in Baltimore on April 11, 2015, at the age of 70, due to a heart attack and subsequent stroke. Vanderbilt University established the Levi Watkins Jr., M.D. Chair in his honor on April 30. A lecture series called the Levi Watkins Jr., M.D. Lecture on Diversity in Medical Education was named after him in 2002, and is held each year at Vanderbilt University. Students and faculty receive rewards based on their efforts in creating communities for minorities at the university. A plaque with his picture and description of his life is installed at The Marble Fountain in Patterson Park, in Baltimore. Today, much of his work is still represented in the field of medicine. Watkins contributed to the advancement of surgical techniques and to the defibrillator, which are all still used today. In addition, his work on angiotensin blockers has helped many patients in need of treatment for congestive heart failure, even those who are unable to tolerate other drugs.

Langer (born 1929) is an American scholar, Holocaust analyst, and professor of English and Holocaust education. Early life and education Lawrence L. Langer is U.S. scholar of Holocaust literature and professor of English emeritus at Simmons College in Boston. He was born to Irving and Esther (Strauss) Langer in the Bronx, New York in 1929. He received his BA from City College of New York in 1951 and an MA (1952) and PhD (1961) from Harvard University. He married his wife, Sondra, in 1951, and together they have two children and five grandchildren. They currently live in West Newton, Massachusetts.  Biography   Career Beginnings  Langer‚Äôs interest in the Holocaust began in 1963, after he received a Fulbright grant to teach American literature at the University of Graz in Austria. In May 1964 he drove with an American colleague through Czechoslovakia to Poland and spent two days at Auschwitz, inspecting the main camp (with several Soviet soldiers) and the remains of the killing facilities at Birkenau. After this trip, Langer began exploring the imaginative literature written about the concentration and death camp experiences. Upon his return to Simmons College he introduced a seminar on the Literature of Atrocity, versions of which he taught for the next 25 years. In 1968-69 he took a sabbatical year in Munich, Germany, where he completed his first book on Holocaust literature, ‚ÄúThe Holocaust and the Literary Imagination.‚Äù  Career  Lawrence L. Langer began teaching at the University of Connecticut in 1957 and moved to Simmons College in 1958, where he remained until his retirement in 1992. In 1965 Langer became the first professor in the United States to teach a course on Holocaust literature, which he initially titled ‚ÄòThe Literature of Atrocity.‚Äô In 1976 he was awarded the Alumnae Endowed Chair, and in the Fall of 2002 he was the Strassler Distinguished Visiting Professor in the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University. Presently, Langer remains the Alumnae Chair Professor of English, emeritus. A major theme in Langer‚Äôs work over the years derives from his skepticism regarding efforts to deflect attention from the atrocities of the Holocaust by stressing the role of resistance and rescue in the ordeal of European Jewry. In his writing he understands and deplores the need to extract some positive meaning from a destructive event like the Holocaust, and argues that the impulse to learn something of value from the Holocaust experience may represent nothing more than an unconscious desire to avoid confronting its brutal realities. In Versions of Survival he established the idea of ‚Äúchoiceless choice‚Äù to describe the disintegration of moral reality for camp inmates and the general unprecedented situations of conflict that Jews found themselves in during the Holocaust. Additionally, he also developed the notion of an ‚Äúafterdeath‚Äù of the Holocaust to accompany the ‚Äúafterlife‚Äù that most survivors returned to with admirable resilience following liberation. His writing shares the essential historical reality of the Holocaust by describing the event as a story of mass murder, and challenges the belief that the Holocaust sanctifies the dignity of the human spirit. In recent years, Langer has collaborated with the artist and child Holocaust survivor Samuel Bak in a series of volumes that combine critical commentary and interpretation with paintings whose vivid visual imagery seeks to challenge the difficult task of finding spiritual and intellectual comfort in a disordered Post-Holocaust world. With the publication of Sexual Violence against Jewish Women during the Holocaust by Sonja Hedgepeth, CNN carried an article that included Langer stating \\"I have no doubt that some women were raped... [though] the significance [or rate] of rape is small,\\" with Langer stating the low rate being due to the Nazi racial hygiene indoctrination, brothels in each concentration camp which 'aryan' women from the surrounding environs visited and the risk of typhoid and disease. Langer's statements and view, derived from testimony interviews, is supported by Lenore Weitzman and Myrna Goldenberg with all three contributing in various degrees, to the similar book Women in the Holocaust.http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/24/holocaust.rape/  Awards  Langer received an NEH Fellowship for Independent Studies and Research between 1978 and 1979. Between September and December 1996, he was the JB & Maurice Senior Scholar-in-Residence at the US Holocaust Research Center of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. From September to December 1997, Lawrence L. Langer was named as a Koerner Fellow for the Study of the Holocaust, Oxford Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, Yarnton Manor, Oxford, England (1997). In May 2003, Langer served as the Resident Scholar at the Rockefeller Foundation Study and Conference Center in Bellagio, Italy. In 1996, Lawrence L. Langer was awarded the honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters from Simmons College, which he also received in 2000 from Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles and in 2002 from Ohio Wesleyan University. In 2016, Langer received The Holocaust Educational Foundation's Distinguished Achievement Award in Holocaust Studies.

It had only one button that was used to power on and off, channel up, channel down, and mute. The Flash-matic's phototechnology was a significant innovation in television and allowed for wireless signal transfer previously exclusive to radio.  Design and production  Earlier remotes could turn sets on/off and change channels, but were connected to the TV with a cable. The Flash-matic came in response to consumer complaints about the inconvenience of these cables running from the transmitter to the TV monitor. Earlier remotes served as the central control system for transmitting complex signals to the receiving monitor. The Flash-matic instead placed the complexity in the receiver as opposed to the transmitter. It used a directional beam of light to control a television outfitted with four photo cells in the corners of the screen. The light signal would activate one of the four control functions, which turned the picture and sound on or off, and turned the channel tuner dial clockwise and counter-clockwise. The bottom receptors received the signal to mute and power on/off, and the upper cells received signals to channel up/down. In order for the various signals to be received by the monitor, the remote control had to be directed towards one of the four photocells. The system responded to full-spectrum light so could be activated or interfered with by other light sources including indoor light bulbs and the sun. Despite these defects, the Flash-matic remained in high demand. In September 1955, Zenith released an apology for its inability to meet the high demand of consumers.Chicago Tribune, September 12, 1955, A3.Dawson, Bret Maxwell. TV Repair: New Media \\"solutions\\" to Old Media Problems. UMI, 2008, 67. The Flash-matic was quickly replaced by new control systems. The \\"Zenith Space Command\\" remote control went into production in 1956 with aims to improve upon the Flash-matic's design.Benson-Allott 2015, p. 41 Advertisement Campaign The Flash-matic was marketed as an interactive technology for tuning device for the television. Muting was the first control feature to be included on a remote control while unavailable on the monitor. The advertisement campaign for the Flash-matic remote control noted its ability to \\"shut off annoying commercials while the picture remains on the screen.‚Äù The mute button was explicitly designed for the purpose of tuning out of commercials. As a result of this new feature as well as the Flash-matic's pistol shape, the Flash-matic's ad campaigns invited viewers to \\"shoot\\" the annoying commercials or announcers that they were tired of listening to, while leaving the image present so that the viewer would know when to turn the sound back on.Dawson, Bret Maxwell.

Hugh Finn wanted to attain the king of Oriel‚Äôs ever-powerful shield, so he asks Dall√°n to demand it from him as payment for a poem. Dall√°n agrees to this and arrives at the King of Oriel‚Äôs home reciting poetry, asking for the shield. Hugh son of Duach offers Dall√°n all sorts of riches in return for his poetry but did not want to part with his shield as it was not appropriate for a poet to demand something of the sort. Dall√°n persists with his demands but to no avail and so he satirises him. On his way home he becomes ill and dies soon after because he had unjustly satirised the King of Oriel. Dall√°n was the ollam, or head poet of the Bardic Order and after his death the other poets decide that Sench√°n should become the new ollam. Sench√°n in turn decides that he and the poets should pay a visit to Guaire, who boasts his reputation of having never been satirised. Guaire pays them all a very warm welcome by feeding them and accommodating them with great hospitality and generosity. Over the time of their visit however, the poets become very demanding and needy, ordering a number of impossible tasks they want Guaire to complete for them. Guaire must meet these demands or else he will be satirised by them. In his despair, Guaire prays that he is killed, because he would rather die than have his reputation damaged. Marb√°n, Guaire‚Äôs brother and swineherd, chief prophet of heaven and earth helps him complete all the tasks they ask. Although Marb√°n helped Guaire, was not happy with the poets because their demands were ridiculous and unreasonable. However, all the requests were carried out just as asked. One night when the poets are feasting, Sench√°n decides he is very unhappy with the situation. This worries Guaire, as he fears Sench√°n may satirise him. He does everything he possibly can to tend to his needs but nothing will please the ollam. Sench√°n then becomes restless and rowdy and begins to satirise even the mice on the floor. He then moves on to satirise the cats, and the chief cat, Irus√°n. Irus√°n hears of this and arrives at Guaire‚Äôs home to attack Sench√°n. Sench√°n is terrified of Irus√°n and is being brutally attacked by him so he begins to sing praise poetry of him, but it is too late. Irus√°n however does not end up killing Sench√°n and so, Guaire is not satirised and the poets return home to their lodge. One day some time later, Marb√°n decides he will seek revenge from the poets because of their atrocious behaviour and abuse of power. He travels to their lodge and demands they entertain him with performance. They are obliged to meet his request because he is related to the granddaughter of a poet. He requests that they recite for him the story of the Cattle Raid of Cooley, an T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge. They cannot meet his request however because they do not know the tale, nor have they ever heard of it. Marb√°n finds this incredibly ignorant and puts a curse on them so that they shall not rest under the same roof two nights in a row until they find an T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge and can recite it for him. The poets travel Ireland and Scotland for a year until they eventually find out that the only person who knows the story is Fergus mac R√≥ich. Fergus who is dead, is summoned from the grave and recites the story while the poets write it down. When Fergus returns to his grave, shortly after the poets recite an T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge for Marb√°n and the curse is lifted. Marb√°n gives them only one condition that they must follow from now on, the company of professional poets would be abolished and each poet would return to his home town to work independently. They all swear to this and the story says that since that day, the professional poets have never worked collectively ever again. Distinctiveness There are a number of factors that make this piece of writing unique. First of all, the language of the text is not of classical modern Irish like most pieces of literature from the era. Writing poetry and prose was largely dominated by the professional poets and so the vast majority of surviving texts were written in their high-register. It is unlike the formal language of professional poetry, but similar to the language that was spoken at the time.Feargal O B lecture Secondly, it is unusual because of its focus on the poet as a prominent character. Tromd√°mh Guaire was notably produced by an author who was outside the circle of professional poets, but who knew of the Bardic Order and the tradition of professional poets. This is apparent when reading the text.√ì Coile√°in, Se√°n, ‚ÄúThe making of Tromd√°m Guaire‚Äù, √âriu 28 (1977): 32‚Äì70. Thirdly, the text contains at least one riddle,Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 37. examples of which are very rare in medieval Irish literature.Patrick Sims-Williams, Irish Influence on Medieval Welsh Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 114‚Äì15. Thus, when Marban returns to the hall to punish the poets, his wisdom is tested through a number of questions, including the following riddle: 'What good thing did man find on earth that God did not find?‚ÄîA worthy master.'Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 37.

The letter affirmed that society can reap great potential benefits from artificial intelligence, but called for concrete research on how to prevent certain potential \\"pitfalls\\": artificial intelligence has the potential to eradicate disease and poverty, but researchers must not create something which cannot be controlled. The four- paragraph letter, titled \\"Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence: An Open Letter\\", lays out detailed research priorities in an accompanying twelve-page document.  Background  By 2014, both physicist Stephen Hawking and business magnate Elon Musk had publicly voiced the opinion that superhuman artificial intelligence could provide incalculable benefits, but could also end the human race if deployed incautiously. At the time, Hawking and Musk both sat on the scientific advisory board for the Future of Life Institute, an organisation working to \\"mitigate existential risks facing humanity\\". The institute drafted an open letter directed to the broader AI research community, and circulated it to the attendees of its first conference in Puerto Rico during the first weekend of 2015. The letter was made public on January 12.  Purpose  The letter highlights both the positive and negative effects of artificial intelligence. According to Bloomberg Business, Professor Max Tegmark of MIT circulated the letter in order to find common ground between signatories who consider super intelligent AI a significant existential risk, and signatories such as Professor Oren Etzioni, who believe the AI field was being \\"impugned\\" by a one-sided media focus on the alleged risks. The letter contends that: > The potential benefits (of AI) are huge, since everything that civilization > has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we > might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may > provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable. > Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to > reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls. One of the signatories, Professor Bart Selman of Cornell University, said the purpose is to get AI researchers and developers to pay more attention to AI safety. In addition, for policymakers and the general public, the letter is meant to be informative but not alarmist. Another signatory, Professor Francesca Rossi, stated that \\"I think it's very important that everybody knows that AI researchers are seriously thinking about these concerns and ethical issues\\".  Concerns raised by the letter  The signatories ask: How can engineers create AI systems that are beneficial to society, and that are robust? Humans need to remain in control of AI; our AI systems must \\"do what we want them to do\\". The required research is interdisciplinary, drawing from areas ranging from economics and law to various branches of computer science, such as computer security and formal verification. Challenges that arise are divided into verification (\\"Did I build the system right?\\"), validity (\\"Did I build the right system?\\"), security, and control (\\"OK, I built the system wrong, can I fix it?\\").  Short-term concerns  Some near-term concerns relate to autonomous vehicles, from civilian drones and self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car may, in an emergency, have to decide between a small risk of a major accident and a large probability of a small accident. Other concerns relate to lethal intelligent autonomous weapons: Should they be banned? If so, how should 'autonomy' be precisely defined? If not, how should culpability for any misuse or malfunction be apportioned? Other issues include privacy concerns as AI becomes increasingly able to interpret large surveillance datasets, and how to best manage the economic impact of jobs displaced by AI.  Long-term concerns  The document closes by echoing Microsoft research director Eric Horvitz's concerns that: > we could one day lose control of AI systems via the rise of > superintelligences that do not act in accordance with human wishes - and > that such powerful systems would threaten humanity. Are such dystopic > outcomes possible? If so, how might these situations arise? ...What kind of > investments in research should be made to better understand and to address > the possibility of the rise of a dangerous superintelligence or the > occurrence of an \\"intelligence explosion\\"? Existing tools for harnessing AI, such as reinforcement learning and simple utility functions, are inadequate to solve this; therefore more research is necessary to find and validate a robust solution to the \\"control problem\\".  Signatories  Signatories include physicist Stephen Hawking, business magnate Elon Musk, the co-founders of DeepMind, Vicarious, Google's director of research Peter Norvig, Professor Stuart J. Russell of the University of California Berkeley, and other AI experts, robot makers, programmers, and ethicists. The original signatory count was over 150 people, including academics from Cambridge, Oxford, Stanford, Harvard, and MIT.

He is a son of Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was once the richest person in Russia. In 2010, the younger Khodorkovsky co-founded Enertiv, an energy monitoring firm for commercial facilities. Khodorkovsky, who like his father is a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin, is the founder of the Institute of Modern Russia, an NGO that is devoted to the cause of freedom in Russia. According to the New York Observer, Khodorkovsky \\"possesses the familial resolve.\\" In April 2014, Jewish Business News wrote: \\"It is always difficult to follow in the footsteps of a successful father, and that is what Pavel Khodorkovskiy has done, successfully too.\\" Early life and education Khodorkovsky was born on June 14, 1985 to Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his first wife Elena Dobrovolskaya. He is Mikhail Khodorkovsky's eldest son. His parents were divorced when he was three years old. He is one of four children of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The younger Khodorkovsky later described his childhood relationship with his father as \\"excellent\\" and said that his mother often let him see his father after the divorce. Khodorkovsky told Le Figaro in 2013 that his father had \\"always struggled not to spoil his children. He wanted the rewards to be progressive. Because if it was immediately the best toys, the best cars‚Ä¶we would no longer want anything. I will do the same thing with my daughter.\\" At the age of 14, Khodorkovsky was sent to boarding school in Switzerland. He attended the school for four years,\\" after which he decided to continue his studies in the U.S. According to the Moscow Times, Khodorkovsky \\"said he chose to study in the United States on his own and his decision was not connected with what was going on with Yukos,\\" his father's firm, which had come under pressure from the Russian government. Khodorkovsky later said that his father had \\"advised [him] to study at a university abroad\\" but that the decision to go to the U.S. was his own. Khodorkovsky moved to the U.S. at age 18 in the autumn of 2003 to study business administration at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, which is near Boston. Khodorkovsky later said that he saw his father \\"frequently\\" in Moscow during the summer of 2003 before leaving for the U.S. At the time of his departure, he later said, Yukos was plainly \\"under pressure, but it was unclear how serious the attack against the management would be.\\" In September 2003, his father visited him in Massachusetts. At that time, according to the younger Khodorkovsky, \\"his father seemed to sense his looming arrest.\\" The younger Khodorkovsky later told the Moscow Times:\\"I asked him how things were going, and he said that imprisoning him was the only thing left to do.\\" Still, the younger Khodorkovsky said, \\"it seemed so unreal at the time. A merger with Sibneft was under way. They were making the world's fourth-largest company by production volume.‚Ä¶ And it seemed that things would come out all right and nothing would happen.\\" In a 2011 interview, he told Forbes: \\"When I left for Boston, I knew there was a problem but it wasn't critical.\\" Mikhail Khodorkovsky's visit to his son in Massachusetts in the September 2003 marked the last time the two would see each other before the senior Khodorkovsky's arrest on October 26, 2003. At the time of the arrest, the younger Khodorkovsky was 18 and \\"had just been really getting to know his dad, who was divorced from his mother and had spent much of Pavel's childhood building his business and fortune.\\" According to the Daily Telegraph, one of Pavel Khodorkovsky's \\"greatest regrets is that his father's imprisonment came just as he was beginning to understand his passion for business, spending the odd day as a teenager at the offices of Yukos.\\" Khodorkovsky's was distraught by his father's arrest and imprisonment and \\"had to learn to make his way alone.\\" The ensuing \\"decade-long separation\\" between the younger Khodorkovsky and his father \\"defined his adult life,\\" stated The Telegraph in December 2013. He graduated in 2007 with a degree in business administration.\\" Career In 2007, after receiving his bachelor's degree from Babson, Khodorkovsky moved to New York City. He began working as a project manager for New Media Internet, a firm owned by Russian businessman Vladimir Gusinsky, who had relocated to the U.S. New Media Internet oversees technical support for Russian news websites. This was Khodorkovsky's first job. Interviewed in New York in November 2010, Khodorkovsky said, \\"I never thought that I would stay here. I had another plan initially,\\" namely to \\"return to Russia after graduating from college.\\" Following his father's arrest, however, \\"coming to Moscow made no sense anymore.\\" According to The Moscow Times, he \\"received word through his father's lawyers\\" after the arrest \\"that he should stay away from Russia for safety's sake.\\" The Telegraph later stated that he had decided it was unwise to return to Russia, even for a visit, because he feared arrest or official harassment. His only contact with his father during the latter's incarceration was therefore by letter and telephone. In January 2011, Khodorkovsky told the New York Observer that he was afraid \\"to go back to Russia\\" because if anything happened to him \\"it would break my father.\\" He expressed concern, moreover, that a \\"bag of coke could end up in my luggage,\\" and pointed out that there \\"is very little recourse in Russia\\" in cases of unjust persecutions. He told Le Figaro in 2013 that the reason why he had not returned to Russia was that he had feared \\"being sent for military service.\\" Enertiv In 2010, Pavel and his Babson classmate Connell McGill Jr. co-founded Enertiv, a firm that manufactures \\"smart-meters and energy-saving software\\" to remotely monitor energy consumption. Enertiv provides services for businesses and organizations to monitor the amount of electricity consumed by every circuit in a building and help bring down energy costs. As of September 2010, the firm reportedly had no U.S. rivals. Enertiv was one of five finalists in the NYU Stern New Venture Competition. It lost the competition in April 2011, but later that week won its first big contract \\"from a school in New Haven where it had completed a pilot project.\\" Khodorkovskiy serves as chief technical officer., while McGill is Chief Executive. The firm's offices are headquartered in New York. Investors in Enertiv include Vaidya Capital Partners and R/GA Ventures, the latter of which was set up by branding agency R/GA, part of The Interpublic Group. Other investors include Jerry Kestenbaum, president of BuildingLink; Cameron Drummond of Mastodon Capital Management; Daniel Feldman, a New York investor; Stephen Plumlee, chief operating officer of R/GA and manager of R/GA's venture unit; and Asad Husain of Bald Eagle Capital and Interpublic Group. Both Khodorkovsky and McGill invested in the first round of seed funding. Part of Khodorkovsky's job with the firm involves \\"flying around the country and running around New York City installing Enertiv's hardware devices in customer locations like schools and office buildings.\\" In a detailed account of Enertiv's product, the Jewish Business News noted that the firm \\"offers a device which monitors the energy consumption in buildings in real time. It informs the building's owner and/or superintendents if and when any lights or electrical devices, such as air conditioners, are still operating after working hours. It can also detect malfunctions in different systems, such as when a motor is not working properly and therefore drains more electricity.\\" The device provides information about energy use \\"in a user friendly format, allowing clients to access the current status of their energy usage on line.\\" The firm's software platform, moreover, \\"lets building owners or managing superintendents measure performance levels from an individual piece of equipment, an office suite, a single building and even an entire portfolio of properties, thanks to the advanced algorithms developed by the company.\\" In addition, the firm works with clients \\"to incentivize, to maximize savings through competition.\\" Khodorkovsky has said that the company's system \\"has proved to be popular among property owners and operators through its ability to pinpoint each energy inefficient behavior with simple language in real-time.\\" In April 2014, Enertiv predicted that it would soon be ready to complete its first round of seed funding, in which it hoped to raise between $500,000 and $750,000. Industry reports stated that there appeared to be \\"no shortage of potential investors.\\" In July 2014, it was reported that the firm had \\"just closed on a $700,000 seed investment round.\\" The investment, said Khodorkovsky, provided \\"validation from other investors,\\" including his father, who had invested in the company \\"as part of a $550,000 friends-and-family round.\\" Enertiv has completed seven rounds of funding, the latest being in 2017 with two rounds of venture funding totaling $1,460,000. Total value of investment into Enertiv is $3,4 million. Khodorkovsky said that his father had not originally been impressed by his plan to launch the firm. \\"He was very skeptical for a while,\\" the younger Khodorkovsky said. \\"He thinks in different orders of magnitude.\\" But when the firm managed to raise money, his father \\"believed we were on the right track.\\" After his father was released from prison, the younger Khodorkovsky said he was optimistic to discuss plans with him. He said that his father had been \\"giving me advice through the years, but now we are able to have a proper conversation, I'm going to be picking his brains a lot, you can bet on that.\\" The elder Khodorkovsky has encouraged the younger to expand the venture's goal to eventually cover global electronic needs. His father, he told Le Figaro in 2013, \\"is tougher than me in business. Sees everything, thinks quickly. He keeps telling me that this is the key to success in business. He often criticizes me for not going fast enough and that I have a tendency to 'think too much about my decisions!'\\" In 2017, an article noted that Enertiv was one of eight companies using big data to change the way real estate is tracked and priced. Activism In February 2010, Khodorkovsky founded the Institute of Modern Russia, a non-governmental human-rights organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy in Russia. Underwritten by the Eurasia Fund and by his father's group Open Russia, which \\"promotes democratic development in Russia,\\" the institute's objectives include \\"strengthening Russia's 'rule of law', promoting democracy, and improving relationships between Russia and other nations.\\" Khodorkovsky said in November 2010 that \\"he missed his father and regretted only growing especially close to him in the months before his arrest.\\" He stated the greatest difficulty was their relationship had only grown just before the arrest. He described himself as optimistic about the outcome of his father's trial \\"but did not expect an outright acquittal because that would allow his father to be freed\\" at the end of his sentence in 2011. \\"The presidential elections are in 2012,\\" observed Khodorkovsky. \\"Who will release him in 2011, right before the elections?\\" Khodorkovsky declared that his father had planned to quit business in 2008 to focus more on politics, but he dismissed rumors that his father ever planned to run for government office. The younger Khodorkovsky had hoped his father would win, but stated he was prepared for his father's imprisonment. He stated that he would continue his activism despite the outcome of his father's case. Khodorkovsky's father was convicted in December 2010. \\"On the eve of his father's sentencing,\\" reported the New York Observer, Pavel sent his father a note asking for advice regarding the corporate structure of Enertiv. The elder Khodorkovsky reportedly answered \\"Limit your personal liability.\\" \\"My dad's fight is for something above and beyond his own freedom,\\" Khodorkovsky said in January 2011. \\"I still have friends in Russia. They tell me he's not alone. There are many similar cases. They just don't get the media attention.\\" In May 2011 he told Forbes that he had decided several months earlier, \\"when it was becoming clear how the trial would go,\\" that he had to \\"raise my own profile\\" and \\"step up my role and start speaking to media and officials\\" about the situation in Russia generally and his father's case in particular. Consequently, he lobbied U.S. officials, including members of Congress, about his father's case, and \\"also attended the first U.S. screening of Khodorkovsky, a documentary about his father's life including his power struggle with Putin that first premiered at the Berlin Film Festival.\\" In addition, he \\"organized rallies in Times Square\\" and helped arrange a July 2011 charity concert in Strasbourg, France, for political prisoners in Russia. \\"We know we're in for a long haul,\\" he told Forbes.\\" Also in May 2011, Khodorkovsky called on supporters of his father to write letters on his behalf to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. He asserted that any official condemnations of the ruling would incite the Russian government. He added that his father's case underscored the risks faced by foreign investors in Russia. He noted that the appeal rejection would present itself as a substantial risk for investors. He also promised that he would will keep fighting for his father's freedom and for a free Russia. \\"It's very important to keep my father's story in the public domain, it ensures his well-being in prison,\\" he maintained. In the same month, he told Forbes that \\"Putin doesn't see a way to release my father without admitting fault or defeat....Keeping him in jail makes him more powerful.\\" As of 2013, Khodorkovsky was allowed to speak to his father by telephone \\"every fortnight for a few minutes.\\" Khodorkovsy has stated that he had two interrelated goals: one to get his father out of prison, the other to improve Russian rule of law. Khodorkovsky told Le Figaro in that year, before his father's release. \\"He has become one of the few political prisoners in Russian history to celebrate a full decade in prison, but contrary to what was expected by the government, he has not been forgotten or broken. Instead, by trying to destroy the opposition, deprive it of funds and scare it off, Putin has created an Opposition figure of opposition and awakened society.\\" Pavel Khodorkovsky met with Minister for Europe, David Lidington, in October 2013, to discuss his father's imprisonment and urge Europe to put pressure on Russia for the release of his father. In 2017, the Institute of Modern Russia was banned by the Prosecutor General of Russia. The reason for the ban on the US-based NGO was given as \\"undesirable\\". Any association with the organization as well as its two sister organizations, UK- based Open Russia and Open Russia Civic Movement, is outlawed. Father's release Pavel Khodorkovsky flew to Berlin with his daughter Diana to be reunited with his father after the latter's release from prison in December 2013. \\"I certainly knew that it hasn't been easy for him,\\" the younger Khodorkovsky told the Telegraph. \\"He knows that he has had a lot of support form a lot of different people across the world, but he knows how much the family has been waiting to see him. He said to me: 'thank you for not giving up on me' which was so important to me.\\" He described his father's release as \\"a big surprise ‚Äì to my father as well ‚Äì because no-one thought it was going to happen....Once we knew from the press conference we had no idea when or how it would happen. Certainly, no-one knew it would happen so quickly.\\" The younger Khodorkovsky had made it clear in an October 2013 interview with the Telegraph that he viewed his father's decision to stay in Russia and go to prison as a decision \\"to put principle before family ‚Äì above the needs, even, of his own son.\\" This decision, the Telegraph stated after the elder Khodorkovsky's prison release, had left Pavel \\"with a complicated set of emotions, which he now looked forward to talking through when the time came.\\" After his father's release, the younger Khodorkovsky assured the Telegraph, \\"We're definitely going to have those conversations, but later. I don't want to go there now because so much has happened, there is so much emotion.\\" For him, reportedly, \\"the only concern is that his father is now free, and that he has an opportunity to rebuild a relationship that was snatched away from him on the very cusp of adulthood.\\" Khodorkovsky said, \\"There is so much to say, but for now, I just want to enjoy him being here. This Christmas is literally the best ever, the best to date.\\" Views on Russia Khodorkovsky said in a January 2013 interview with Business Insider that the Kremlin's clampdown on its domestic opponents meant that the \\"criteria by which we judge the progress\\" in Russian democracy \\"will have to change.\\" He also called the Magnitsky Act passed by the U.S. Congress important, \\"not just in the Hermitage Capital case, but also for other jailed dissidents, such as his father.\\" Khodorkovsky has severely criticized Russia's ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. In his Business Insider interview, he described it as \\"a bargaining chip for Russia, and one that Russian orphans would lose out from.\\" He noted that \\"1,500 kids...are dying in orphanages every year in Russia, and those are just the official statistics....It certainly looks like they have a much better chance of getting proper medical care, and frankly surviving, here in the U.S.\\" He stated that he was surprised at the passage of the ban, having thought that it would sweep the United Russia Party but be opposed by other parties; but \\"then it flew through all the three readings, almost unanimously voted for.\\" Describing the ban as a result of the anti-Americanism that had been \\"fostered over the past 10 years\\" in Russia, he noted that many of the children in Russian orphanages that were being adopted by U.S. parents were \\"of Tartar, Kyrgyz, Kazakh origin, and, frankly, they're not popular with Russian foster parents.\\" The adoption ban, he suggested, was the product of a desire \\"to create an additional lever\\" to hurt the U.S. after the realization that the prohibition of visits to Russia by U.S. officials was a non-starter, given that \\"not many [U.S.] officials travel to Russia. I don't think that McCain is going skiing in the Ural Mountains anytime soon.\\" About Putin, Khodorkovsky told Business Insider: \\"He cannot show any mercy, any weakness.\\" Khodorkovsky stated that \\"a year ago, both my father and I were thinking we'll have major changes [in Russia] in two years. But you ask me today, I don't know.\\" Personal life Khodorkovsky and his wife, Olesya Livanova, met in the U.S. and married in 2007. She is from Penza, Russia. They live with their two children in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.\\" An article in The Observer reported that Khodorkovsky paid just $3,76 million for the apartment, in stark comparison with many other offspring of oligarchs.

Ancient Chinese texts record that he wore a bearskin with four golden eyes, and carried a lance and shield to expel malevolent spirits. His primary duties were orchestrating the seasonal Nuo ritual to chase out disease-causing demons from houses and buildings, and leading a funeral procession to exorcize corpse-eating wangliang spirits away from a burial chamber. From the Han dynasty through the Tang dynasty (3rd century BCE to 10th century CE), fangxiangshi were official wu-shaman specialists in the imperially sanctioned Chinese state religion; after the Tang, they were adapted into popular folk religion and symbolized by wearing a four-eyed mask. In the present day, the fangxiangshi is a masked character in Chinese Nuo opera, and continues as the Japanese equivalent h≈çs≈çshi ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞è exorcist in Shinto ceremonies. Etymology The obscure etymology of fƒÅngxi√†ngsh√¨ is a subject of disagreement. The name combines three words, with the following Old Chinese pronunciations and meanings (Schuessler 2007: 231, 531, 466): *pa≈ã Êñπ \\"square, a regular thing, side, region, country; two boats lashed side by side, raft; just now, to begin; method, law, norm, standard\\" **sa≈ãh Áõ∏ \\"look at, inspect; assist, help; assistant, minister\\" (also pronounced xiƒÅng < *sa≈ã Áõ∏ \\"each other, mutually\\") **ge î Ê∞è \\"an honorific which is suffixed to place names (\\"the lord of X\\"), kinship terms (\\"uncle X\\"), feudal and official titles (\\"lord/lady\\" X); clan\\" Scholars agree that shi < *ge î is the Chinese honorific suffix translating \\"master; lord\\", but construe fangxiang < *pa≈ãsa≈ãh in various ways. Fang Êñπ is also a common Chinese surname. The earliest interpretation was Zheng Xuan's (2nd century CE) Zhouli commentary (see below). Zheng explains fƒÅngxi√†ng(sh√¨) as f√†ngxi«éng ÊîæÊÉ≥, substituting f√†ng Êîæ \\"put away; banish\\" for fƒÅng Êñπ and xi«éng ÊÉ≥ \\"think; imagine\\" for xi√†ng Áõ∏. This ambiguous f√†ngxi«éng ÊîæÊÉ≥ gloss is translated as \\"expellers of formidable things\\" (Laufer 1914: 198), \\"to give release to one's thinking . . . so as to have an awesome and terrifying appearance\\" (Bodde 1975:79), and \\"to cause visions to be forthcoming; to conjure up visions\\" (Boltz 1979: 431). Boltz says Bodde misunderstood this term because Zheng was reaffirming that xi√†ng Áõ∏ means not just \\"observe; scrutinize\\", but \\"vision; image; phantasy\\", cognate with xi«éng ÊÉ≥ \\"to draw up a mental image; vision\\", as well as with xi√†ng Ë±° \\"image; representation\\". Therefore, Boltz (1979: 431) concludes it was not the appearance of the fangxiangshi that is important, but \\"the visions which he brings forth (and which presumably only he can see) that are crucial. In this sense he should be called the Master of Visions, or Imaginator, or Phantasmagoricist.\\" Zheng Xuan's commentary to the Zhouli description of a fangxiang striking the four corners of the burial chamber with his lance and expelling the fangliang (see below) identifies this fangliang ÊñπËâØ demon with the wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© demon, also known as wangxiang ÁΩîË±°. Ying Shao's (c. 195 CE) Fengsu Tongyi quotes this Zhouli passage with wangxiang for fangliang in explaining the origins of Chinese customs of placing thuja (arborvitae) trees and stone tigers in graveyards. > On the tomb a thuja is planted and at the head of the path a stone tiger. In > the Chou li, \\"On the day of burial the fang-hsiang chief enters the pit to > drive out the Wang-hsiang.\\" The Wang-hsiang likes to eat the liver and brain > of the deceased. People cannot constantly have the fang-hsiang stand by the > side of the tomb to bar it. But the Wang-hsiang fears the tiger and the > thuja. Thus the tiger and thuja are placed before the tomb. (tr. Harper > 1985: 482) The common interpretation of the fang in fangxiang is that it denotes the s√¨fƒÅng ÂõõÊñπ \\"the four quarters/directions; every side/direction\\", as ritually symbolized by the four golden eyes on the bearskin signifying the ability of a fangxiangshi to see in all directions. According to Dallas McCurley (2005:137), the early Chinese believed that \\"the forces of rain, wind, flood, and drought often came to the climatically vulnerable Yellow River Valley from the sifang.\\" Boltz's (1979: 431) review of Bodde's (1975) book agrees that taking the fundamental sense of fangxiang as \\"seer\\" is generally accurate, but believes that the binomial term fangxiang < Old Chinese *pjwang-sjang originated as a dimidiation of the word *sjang- < Proto-Chinese **bsjang- \\"seer\\". Thus meaning \\"not so much \\"one who sees in all directions\\" (though it may well have already been semanticized as that very early) as \\"one who conjures up visions, or images, phantasies.\\" Many writers have noted the remarkable phonetic similarities among the names for the ritual fangxiangshi and the fangliang, wangliang, and wangxiang demons he exorcised; and some scholars such as Chen Mengjia, Kobayashi Taichir≈ç, and William Boltz have theorized that the fangxiangshi exorcist was a personification of these demons, and was \\"in effect exorcising himself\\" (Boltz 1979: 423). In this understanding, the devouring exorcist and devoured creatures were ultimately identical. Boltz (1979: 431) suggests the possibility that the matching names fangxiang(shi), fangliang, wangliang, and wangxiang are all derived from the same Proto-Chinese **BZjang \\"see\\" etymon, with him as a \\"Master of Visions\\" or \\"Imaginator\\" and them as \\"visions\\" or \\"specters\\" from the Latin spectrum \\"appearance; apparition\\", and to use the same root, the fangxiangshi \\"was in fact exorcising images, or visions, of himself.\\" Translations While it is comparatively easier to transliterate Chinese ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞è alphabetically than to elucidate it, some scholars have made translations. The first in a Western language may have been French sinologist √âdouard Biot's (1881 1:6) \\"inspecteurs de region\\" or \\"preservateur universel\\". English translations include *\\"Rescuer of the Country; inspectors or rescuers of the country to the four quarters\\" (de Groot 1910 1: 162; 6: 974) *\\"a 'doctor' who has two functions, he prescribes medicines, and practises the art of physiognomy\\" (Laufer 1909: 198) *\\"he who scrutinizes for evil in many directions\\" (Bodde 1975: 79-80), *\\"one who conjures up visions ... Master of Visions, or Imaginator, or Phantasmagoricist\\" (Boltz 1979: 431) *\\"one who sees in all (four) directions\\" (Childs-Johnson 1995: 89) *\\"square-faced exorcist\\" (Benn 2002: 270) *\\"direction (fang)-orienting master; one who orients unwanted spirits in the direction to which they belong\\" (McCurley 2005:137) Laufer's interpretation takes fang to mean fangshi ÊñπÂ£´ \\"alchemist; doctor; exorcist\\" and xiang to mean r√©nxi√†ng ‰∫∫Áõ∏ \\"look at and appraise; practice physiognomy\\". Bodde's (1975: 79) translation \\"he who scrutinizes for evil spirits in many directions\\" is based upon taking fang as meaning sifang \\"four/all directions\\" and taking xiang in its verbal sense of \\"observe, scrutinize\\" comparable with \\"physiognomize\\". Early references According to the Chinese classics, fangxiangshi originated in the late Eastern Zhou dynasty (771-256 BCE), were officially employed by emperors from the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and subsequently continued as a private practice up to the present day. Han dynasty The earliest detailed description of fangxiangshi is found in the (c. 3rd century BCE) Zhouli \\"Rites of Zhou\\" Xiaguan Â§èÂÆò \\"Offices of Summer\\" section. The first context details the types and numbers of assistants for each official rank, including over 40 to support the fangxiangshi: 4 ku√°ngf≈´ ÁãÇÂ§´ \\"crazy men; mediums\\", 8 diviners with 6 subordinates, 2 accountants, 2 scribes, 2 menials, and 20 runners (see von Falkenhausen 1995: 283-285). The second Zhouli context includes the fangxiangshi under the section describing official duties of the n√°nw≈´ Áî∑Â∑´ \\"male shaman/medium\\": > At the annual Great Exorcism (nuo ÂÑ∫), when the Nanwu play a central role: > after either presenting offerings or shooting arrows (which of the two > remains unclear) at the evil spirits in the four directions, they (according > to Zheng Xuan) accompany them outside, away from human habitations\\" (tr. von > Falkenhausen 1995: 291) The received Zhouli text has z√®ng Ë¥à \\"to present\\" but Zheng Xuan mentions an old variant of z√®ng Áü∞ \\"to shoot arrows\\". The subsequent fangxiangshi context says, > In his official function, he wears [over his head] a bearskin having four > eyes of gold, and is clad in a black upper garment and a red lower garment. > Grasping his lance and brandishing his shield, he leads the many officials > to perform the seasonal exorcism (Nuo), searching through houses and driving > out pestilences. ... When there is a great funeral, he goes in advance of > the coffin, and upon its arrival at the tomb, when it is being inserted into > the burial chamber, he strikes the four corners [of the chamber] with his > lance and expels the Fang-liang. (48, tr. Bodde 1975: 78-79) Zheng Xuan's commentary (Fong 1991: 189-190) glosses m√©ng Ëíô \\"cover; dark; blind; ignorant\\" as meaning m√†o ÂÜí \\"to cover; see\\", that is \\"to wear over one's head\\"; and explains \\"the bear skin worn over one's head to expel the demon of pestilences is [what is known] today as qitou [È≠åÈ†≠ \\"ghost head; demon mask\\"].\\" As mentioned above (see Etymology), Zheng's commentary identifies the fangliang ÊñπËâØ demon with the wangliang ÁΩîÂÖ© or wangxiang ÁΩîË±° demon. Zhouli scholars concur in interpreting the four golden eyes on the bearskin to symbolize the ability of a fangxiangshi to see simultaneously in all s√¨fƒÅng ÂõõÊñπ \\"four directions\\", as well as striking all s√¨y√∫ ÂõõÈöÖ \\"four corners\\" of the tomb with a lance to scare away the corpse-eating wangliang. However, Zhouli interpreters differ whether the fangxiangshi was covered by a bearskin cloak or mask, owing to the ambiguous Classical Chinese phrase ÁÜäÁöÆÈªÉÈáëÂõõÁõÆ literally \\"bear skin yellow gold four eyes\\", and Zheng Xuan's comparison with a qitou \\"demon mask\\" (see Childs-Johnson 1995). Translations are frequently a bearskin (\\"don the hide of a young bear ornamented with four eyes of gold\\", von Falkenhausen 1995: 291), sometimes a bearskin mask (\\"four-eyed bear mask\\", McCurley 2005:137), or even both (\\"covered with a bear's skin and donning a face mask with four golden eyes\\", Fukushima 2005: 258). The Han polymath Zhang Heng's (2nd century CE) \\"Dongjing fu\\" poem about the capital Luoyang contemporaneously describes fangxiang(shi) at the Nuo ritual. > At the end of the year the great no takes place for the purpose of driving > off all spectres. The fang-siang carry their spears, wu and hih hold their > bundles of reed. Ten thousand lads with red heads and black clothes, with > bows of peach wood and arrows of thorny jujube shoot at random all around. > Showers of potsherds and pebbles come down like rain, infallibly killing > strong spectres as well as the weak. Flaming torches run after these beings, > so that a sparkling and streaming glare chases the red plague to all sides; > thereupon they destroy them in the imperial moats and break down the > suspension bridges (to prevent their return). In this way they attack ch‚Äòi > and mei, strike at wild and ferocious beings, cleave sinuous snakes, beat > out the brains of fang-liang, imprison keng-fu in the clear and chilly > waters, and drown n√º-pah in the waters animated by gods. They cut asunder > the khwei and the h√º, as also the wang-siang; they mutilate the ye-chung, > and exterminate the yiu-kwang . The eight spirits (cardinal points of the > Universe) thereby quiver; how much more must this be the case with the ki, > the yuh and the pih-fang. The land of Tu-shoh, affords protection by peach > branches, the effects of which are enhanced by Yuh-lei and Shen-tu, who on > the other side, with ropes of rush in their hands, by means of their sharp > eyesight spy out the darkest corners, in order to catch the spectres which > still remain after the chase. The houses in the capital thus being purged to > their most secluded parts, and delivered from everything undesirable, the > Yin and the Yang may unite harmoniously, and all beings and things thus be > produced in due time. (tr. Groot 1910 6: 978-979) The (5th century) Book of the Later Han also describes fangxiangshi in the Nuo exorcism. > One day before the sacrifice of the end of the year the great no is > celebrated, called expulsion of epidemical disease. The ritual of it is the > following ‚Äî From among the apprentices of the inner Yellow Gate of the > Palace, one hundred and twenty of ten, eleven or twelve years are selected > to act as 'lads'; they are dressed with red bonnets and black coats, and > they carry large hand-drums. The fang-siang shi with four eyes of gold and > masked with bearskins, wearing black coats and red skirts, grasp their > lances and wield their shields. There are also twelve animals with feathers > or hairs, and with horns. These people start their work at the inner Yellow > Gate, under command of a Chamberlain in general employ, to expel maleficent > spectres from the Forbidden Palace. [Shortly before dawn, the 120 boys and > all the court officials gather together and repeat a chant listing 12 demon- > eating spirits, \\"Jiazuo Áî≤‰Ωú devours calamities, Feiwei ËÉáËÉÉ devours tigers > ...\\"] These twelve divinities are herewith ordered to chase away evil and > misfortune, to scorch your bodies, seize your bones and joints, cut your > flesh in pieces, tear out your lungs and bowels. If you do not get quickly > away, the stragglers among you will become their food. Now the fang-siang > are set to work. Together with those twelve animals (representing these > twelve demon-devourers) they lump about screaming, making three tours round > about the inner Palace buildings in front and behind, and with their torches > they escort the pestilential disease out of the front gate. Outside this > gate, swift horsemen take over the torches and leave the Palace through the > Marshal‚Äôs Gate, on the outside of which they transfer them to horsemen of > the fifth army-corps, who thereupon drive the spectres into the Loh river. > In every mansion of the official world, men with wooden masks and > representing animals may act as leaders of the performers of the no. When > the ceremony is finished, keng of peachwood are put up, with Yuh-lei and > ropes of reed, after which the performers and the officers in attendance on > the throne stop their work. Ropes of reed, lances, and sticks of peach wood > are presented by the emperor to the highest ministers, commanders, and > special and general feudal rulers. (tr. Groot 1910 6: 976-977) The syntax of this fangxiangshi description differs from the Zhouli: ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞èÈªÉÈáëÂõõÁõÆËíôÁÜäÁöÆ \\"the fangxiangshi [wears] four golden eyes [and] is covered by a bearskin\\". Southern and Northern dynasties Han-era fangxiangshi and Nuo ritual traditions continued to be followed during the turbulent Southern and Northern dynasties period (420-589), which was an age of civil war and large- scale migration. The Book of Qi history of the Southern Qi dynasty (479-502) records that Nuo rituals were > performed on the last day of the year by two groups, each of 120 lads, and > twelve animals headed by drums and wind instruments. The gates of the wards > and of the city walls were flung open, and the emperor in everyday attire > contemplated the no from his throne, in the midst of his offices. With > rolling drums the procession entered the Palace through the western-gate, > passed through all parts of it in two divisions, even mounting the storeys > and towers; the fang-siang and the twelve animals hopped, jumped, and cried, > and having passed through the south gate, they spread in six directions till > they reached the city-walls. (tr. Groot 1910 6: 978-979) During the Sui dynasty (581-618 CE), the official ritual (tr. Groot 1910 6: 1151) restricted using fangxiangshi exorcists to funerals of higher-ranking shi \\"scholar-officials\\"; officers of the 1st-4th degrees could use fangxiang, but those of the 5th-7th degrees could only use qitou ghost masks. Japanese H≈çs≈çshi ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞è exorcist illustration from the (c. 1781) Konjaku Hyakki Sh≈´i Japanese Shinto ceremonial H≈çs≈çshi at Yoshida Shrine, (1928) painting by Nakajima S≈çy≈ç ‰∏≠Â≥∂ËçòÈôΩ Japanese Shinto ceremonial H≈çs≈çshi at Heian Shrine (2010) Tang dynasty The Tang dynasty (618-907) was a golden age in Chinese history during which the state religion continued fangxiangshi traditions and further regulated their details. The (732) Great Tang Ritual Regulations of the Kaiyuan Era (713-742, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang) says that in funeral processions (tr. Groot 1910 6: 1151), \\"behind the carriage in which the soul- tablet was conveyed, came the carriage of the fang-siang, which, however, was to be replaced by a carriage with an ugly head [qitou] at funerals of officers of any grade below the fifth.\\" This ritual text also gave instructions for celebrating the Nuo ritual in the provinces. > Four fang-siang were to be used, with four precentors [ch√†ngshu√†i Âî±Áéá \\"song > leaders\\"], and by chiefs of first class governments sixty lads besides; > chiefs of governments of the second or the third order might employ forty > lads, and in the districts no more than twenty lads might be employed, with > one fang-siang and one precentor; besides there might be four drummers and > four whip-bearers. Such purification of official mansions and cities was to > be accompanied by a sacrifice at the gates to the yin spirits, and concluded > by burial of the sacrificial flesh and wine. (tr. Groot 1910 6: 980) Duan Chengshi's (8th century) Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang (tr. Groot 1910 6: 1152-1153) differentiates qitou È≠åÈ†≠ \\"ghost mask\\" types, those with four eyes are named fangxiang and those with two eyes are named qƒ´ ÂÉõ \\"dancers\\". The Da Tang liudian book of Tang institutions (tr. Fong 1991: 189) states that a person who performed the task of fangxiangshi would put on \\"a mask with four golden eyes and wear a bear-skin outfit.\\" The (1060) New Book of Tang (tr. Groot 1910 6: 980) notes that for Nuo rituals, \\"the lads should be between twelve and sixteen years old, masked, and arranged in four groups of six, and that, besides the whip-bearers, drummers and trumpeters, there should be two wu [shamans] in the procession. The exorcising song was to the very letter that of the Han dynasty.\\" Later periods After the Tang dynasty, the official Chinese state religion discontinued performances of Nuo rituals led by professional fangxiangshi, and popular folk religion adapted them into local Nuo festivals. During the Song dynasty (960-1279), the tradition of burying protective wood or pottery figures of fangxiangshi in tombs was changed into figures made of perishable straw or bamboo. The Tang-Song handbook on burial practices, the Bicanq jing (tr. Fong 1991: 189), says the fangxiang figures were \\"woven in five colors, had four eyes and held tree branches in their hands\\". The official ritual of the Song dynasty (tr. Groot 1910 6: 1152) said funerals for officers of the four highest ranks could have one fangsiang exorcist, and those below in rank could only have a qitou ghost mask. This text also records that in 970, Emperor Taizu of Song decreed that for funerals in the capital of Kaifeng, \\"it was forbidden to all families who had a burial to perform, to occupy themselves with Taoist and Buddhist observances, or to employ a van of men masked as strange men or animals.\\" Similarly, during Ming dynasty (1368-1644) funeral rituals (tr. Groot 1910 6: 1152) were delimited to four-eyed fangxiang for officers of the 1st-4th ranks, two-eyed ones for officers of the 5th-7th ranks, and none for lower-ranking officers. De Groot (1910 6: 980) describes popular exorcising processions as \\"noisy, and even amusing, agreeably breaking the monotony of daily life\\" on the last day of the year, with boys wearing ghost-masks of old and young people and numerous gods and spirits, men dressed in costumes of fearsome door gods to scare away evil spirits, and male and female wu-shamans dancing with drums, all under the guidance of men and women acting as \\"fathers and mothers of the Nuo\\" ritual. In the 1980s, the Chinese government officially recognized Nuo rituals as the folk religion of the Tujia people, who primarily live in the Wuling Mountains of Central China (Li 2006). Interpretations Lisa Raphals (2009: 61) suggests that the Zhou dynasty ritual fangxiangshi ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞è may have been a predecessor of the Han dynasty professional fangshi ÊñπÂ£´ \\"recipe masters\\". Bodde (1975: 124) identifies the fangxiangshi with the demonic \\"God of War\\" Chiyou, who, according to legend, opposed the Yellow Emperor, citing Zhang Heng's (2nd century CE) Xijing fu poem that describes Chiyou similarly with how other texts portray the appearance and behavior of the fangxiangshi. Japanese h≈çs≈çshi During the Heian period (794-1185), the Japanese adopted many Tang dynasty (618-907) Chinese customs, including the fangxiangshi known as h≈çs≈çshi ÊñπÁõ∏Ê∞è who would lead a funeral procession and exorcise demons from a burial mound. This practice was amalgamated with traditional Japanese exorcism customs such as the Shinto ofuda \\"talisman with the name of a kami\\". The earliest record was the (c. 797) Shoku Nihongi history (Gras 2004: 45), which mentions a h≈çs≈çshi exorcist officiating at the burial ceremonies for Emperor Sh≈çmu (756), Emperor K≈çnin (781), and Emperor Kanmu (806).

The island has an coastline, five beaches, a mangrove swamp, and is covered in of dense jungle. It has a total surface area of , which makes it the 12th largest island in the archipelago. Isla Gibrale√≥n rises to a height of above sea level, and is in the Eastern Time Zone (UTC‚àí05:00). Climate The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), known by sailors as the doldrums, governs the climate of Isla Gibrale√≥n. March is the warmest month, with an average temperature of ; January is the coldest, averaging at night. Due to its proximity to the equator, Isla Gibrale√≥n does not have distinct seasons. Variations in the location of the ITCZ drastically affect rainfall in many equatorial regions, resulting in the wet-and-dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold-and-warm seasons of higher latitudes. Isla Gibrale√≥n's wet season occurs from May to December, when the ITCZ is over (or slightly north of) Panama. This period is characterised by light, variable winds and heavy rainfall. The dry season, characterised by clear skies and predominantly northeastern Caribbean trade winds, is from January to April (when the ITCZ is south of Panama). The island's location in the Pearl Islands archipelago protects it from the effects of El Ni√±o and allows the surrounding waters‚Äîusually between during the wet season‚Äîto sustain the uninterrupted evolution of new marine species, including whale and tiger sharks, sperm whales, sea turtles, angel rays and large schools of fish. In popular culture Isla Gibraleon was used for the Morgan Tribe on the television show Survivor: Pearl Islands in 2003. Isla Gibrale√≥n was the men's island in the first series of The Island with Bear Grylls, and the women's island in the second series.

He is specialized as a left-arm fast-medium bowler. He has taken the most wickets (13) in a debut One Day International (ODI) series. He is the first player to win the ‚ÄòMan of the Match‚Äô award on both Test as well as ODI debuts. Rahman made his international cricket debut in a Twenty20 International (T20I) match against Pakistan in April 2015. Later that year, he played his first One Day International and Test matches against India and South Africa, respectively. Before his international career, Rahman played in the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He also represented Dhaka Dynamites in the 2015 Bangladesh Premier League and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2016 Indian Premier League.  Early and personal life  Mustafizur Rahman grew up in the small town of Satkhira in Khulna, Bangladesh. He is the youngest of Abul Qasem Gazi and Mahmuda Khatun's six children. His father is an enthusiastic fan of cricket. Rahman's interest in cricket rose when he started practicing the game away from home every morning, with his brother Mokhlesur Rahman. This affected his education as he occasionally missed school to play cricket. Prior to discovering his bowling talents, Rahman played as a batsman with a tennis ball. According to him, he took inspiration from Pakistani pacer Mohammad Amir, who is his idol. On 15 March 2019, along with several members of the Bangladesh test team, he was moments from entering the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand when a terrorist attack began. All members of the team were \\"deeply affected\\". Rahman went on to get married on 22 March. Rahman's brother was hopeful that marriage could help him \\"overcome the shock\\" of witnessing the attack in New Zealand.  Early career  In 2012, Rahman travelled to Bangladesh's capital Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowlers camp. Prior to that, scouters first encountered him in an Under-17 tournament in his hometown. He was admitted to the Bangladesh Cricket Board's foundation of fast bowling. Soon he was selected to the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in UAE, where he took a total of eight wickets. Rahman started both his First-class cricket and List-A cricket from 2014, representing Khulna Division and Abahani Limited, respectively. He was picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. International career Emergence Mustafizur began his international career in a twenty overs match against Pakistan on 24 April 2015, where he took the wickets of Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez, two veteran Pakistani batsmen. In June, India toured Bangladesh for one Test and three One Day Internationals. Rahman was picked in the ODI squad. In his first match of the series, Rahman gave signs of his potential against the strong Indian batting line-up by taking a five- wicket haul off 9.2 overs in the first match. Bangladesh won the match and Rahman became the tenth bowler in the history of ODIs to take five wickets on debut. In the second ODI, Rahman took another six wickets. This helped him to earn the record of most wickets of any bowler after two ODIs, surpassing the record previously held by Zimbabwe's Brian Vitori. He completed the last ODI with 2 wickets and made history by taking 13 wickets in a three-match ODI series. The following month, Rahman took 5 wickets in three ODIs to help Bangladesh win the series against South Africa by 2‚Äì1. He made his Test debut in the same series versus South Africa where he picked up 4 wickets. Injury problems In the month of November, Bangladesh hosted Zimbabwe for three ODIs and two T20s. Rahman played a salient role in the ODI matches, taking a total of 8 wickets. For his performances in 2015, he was named in the World ODI XI by ICC. He was also named in the ODI XI of the year 2015 by ESPNcricinfo and Cricbuzz. He captured his third five-wicket haul in the last game. He could not contribute much in the T20 series, though he bowled economically, which resulted both sides sharing a win. The next year in January, Bangladesh again played with Zimbabwe in four T20s. Rahman played in the first two matches, which they won. While bowling in the second T20I against Zimbabwe in January 2016, Mustafizur injured his shoulder. Following that, he was dropped from the squad for the first time since debut. During the Asia Cup held in the next month, he was again sidelined from the team due to his side strain, playing only the first three games. He was able to play against Australia, India and New Zealand in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 held in India in March. He became the first Bangladeshi bowler to grab five wickets in the history of T20 World Cup after taking five wickets for 22 runs against New Zealand. He took total of 9 wickets in three matches in the 2016 edition. He was named as 12th man in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the ICC.https://www.cricket.com.au/news/icc-world-t20-team-of- the-tournament-india-roy-de-kock-kohli-root-buttler-watson-russell/2016-04-04 Rahman was again unable to play all matches when Bangladesh toured New Zealand during December 2016 and January 2017. He played his first Test match since August 2015 against Sri Lanka at Galle in March 2017, taking eight wickets in the series. In April 2018, he was one of ten cricketers to be awarded a central contract by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) ahead of the 2018 season. On 29 May 2018, Rahman was ruled out of an upcoming three-match T20I series against Afghanistan due to a toe injury. 2019 Cricket World Cup In April 2019, he was named in Bangladesh's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. On 5 July 2019, in the match against Pakistan, Mustafizur took his 100th wicket in ODIs. He finished the tournament as the leading wicket-taker for Bangladesh, with twenty dismissals in eight matches. Following the World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Mustafizur as the rising star of the squad. Domestic career Bangladesh Premier League Rahman's first professional Twenty20 career outside international cricket was the Bangladesh Premier League, where he played for Dhaka Dynamites in its 2015 season. He took 14 wickets in 10 matches in that tournament. In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Rajshahi Kings team, following the draft for the 2018‚Äì19 Bangladesh Premier League. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Rangpur Rangers in the 2019‚Äì20 Bangladesh Premier League. Indian Premier League In the Indian Premier League auction of the 2016 season, Rahman was drafted by Sunrisers Hyderabad. He took 17 wickets in 16 matches in the tournament where his team won the title. He was named as \\"Emerging Player of the Tournament\\", the first overseas player to receive this award. In January 2018, he was bought by the Mumbai Indians in the 2018 IPL auction. NatWest T20 Blast In March 2016, English side Sussex announced that they had signed Rahman as their second overseas player for the T20 Blast competition. He picked up four wickets while giving away 23 runs in his debut match against Essex. After another match, he faced a shoulder surgery which sidelined him for six months. Pakistan Super League Mustafizur was selected by Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League. The BCB was reluctant to let him play there. However, the issue was resolved when Rahman got a shoulder injury in early 2016, thus preventing him from playing in the PSL.  Playing style  Rahman achieved success in the beginning of his international career by bowling off cutters, a type of bowling which moves away (from the right-hander) off of the pitch. Rahman stated on a press conference in June 2015 that he first discovered the technique after his fellow cricketer, Anamul Haque insisted he bowl a slower delivery.

The physical border separating Mexico and the United States (which can be found near Otay Mountain) has received criticism for the harm it allegedly perpetuated to the environment, both in its construction and in its very nature.  History  The name \\"Otay\\" comes from the Kumeyaay word otie, which means \\"brushy\\". On March 16, 1991, a Hawker Siddeley HS-125 airplane carrying seven members of singer Reba McEntire's band, plus her business manager and two pilots, crashed into the side of the mountain after taking off from nearby Brown Field Municipal Airport, killing all ten on board.

XXXIV) commemorating the fifth centenary of his invention William Buckels, also known as Willem Beuckel, Willem Beuckelsz or William Buckelsson, and sometimes Willem Beuckelszoon by the Dutch, was a 14th-century fisherman from Biervliet, Zeeland, whose discovery of a preservation process for herring led to the Dutch as a maritime power. Buckels has been recognized as a Dutch National Hero for his accomplishment from that day to this. Now called Willem Bueckelszoon by the Netherlands Board of Tourism and Conventions, on September 9, 1886 the Pall Mall Budget featured an article (pictured at right) marking the 500th Anniversary (fifth centenary) of William Buckels' discovery that \\"salt fish will keep, and that fish that can be kept can be packed and can be exported\\". It was reprinted in The New York Times later that month. In 1386 William Buckels salted and packed (into barrels) the first hundred herring ultimately leading to Holland's monopoly in a new market which was subsequently created by Buckels' discovery. Holland and especially Amsterdam, said to be \\"built on Herring bones\\", reaped great wealth from its herring fishery in subsequent years, made possible by its ability to preserve fish through Buckel's salting process. The Dutch Herring Fleet (c. 1656 to 1730), by Pieter Vogelaer The process that Buckels discovered (and is accredited with the invention of) is known as the gibbing process. The gills and part of the gullet of the fish are removed eliminating any bitter taste, and the liver and pancreas are left in the fish during salt-curing releasing enzymes that flavour the fish. After the fish is initially prepared by gill and gullet removal, it is put into barrels for curing with a 1:20 ratio of salt to herring. Following his discovery, the Dutch began to build ships, to transport salt herring to export markets, which eventually led to the Holland becoming a seafaring nation. In the 1807 work The Naturalist's Cabinet, the author identifies Buckels' name as the etymological source of the English word pickle. However, the Oxford English Dictionary provides \\"Middle Dutch pƒìkel, pƒìkele (Dutch pekel)\\" and other language cognates, and does not mention Buckels.

It is found in Chile.  Species description  thumb thumb Chilean glory creepers are a many branched perennial vine or climbing shrub with a woody base that is evergreen or deciduous in colder climates. The plant has thin pinnate leaves alternating on the stem and leaflets that are light green. The leaves can have small fine hairs but are mostly glaborous. Leaves are 2 cm long with the younger branches hosting 2 leaves and the older branches having 3-7 leaflets. Leaf shape is oval with obvious pinnate structured veins, size of leaves may vary. Flowers consist of a tubular structure with rounded petals rounding back at the tip and bright orange-red outer rings with a red centre. Tendrils have the ability to 'hook' onto surroundings for grip and structure support. Flowering from September to May with a glossy, oval wrinkled fruit capsule that contains black seeds and a prominent wing helping with wind dispersal. Fragments of the stem can also spread seeds. The fruit capsule size is roughly 4.5 high by 2 cm girth. This climbing vine is considered a weed in New Zealand which is recognised by the National Pest Plant Accord. It gets this reputation due to its rapid growth and large amounts of seed production, combined with the nature of its growth habits i.e. covering growth of smaller plants and trees which can be of native species. Varieties with pink, yellow or deep scarlet flowers are also available.  Geographic distribution and habitat  thumb Chilean glory creeper vines tend to prefer forest edges, roadsides and waste areas where there is abundant sun and the ability to drain well, being located on the outskirts it can tolerate some shade. Areas such as the North Island and warmer temperatures of the south island i.e. Canterbury, southland and central Otago.  Natural global range  Native to Chile these include Chilean Andes, Peru, Colombia, equador, the Americas and Mediterranean Europe (tropical climates).  New Zealand range  Grown as an annual plant, it cannot tolerate too-cool climates, nor is it winter hardy. Generally found in the forest outskirts of the North Islands and the South Islands warmer climates of Canterbury and Otago.  Habitat preferences  Preferring warmer, well-drained areas, they are generally found on the outskirts of forests, roadsides and waste areas requiring a soil ph. of 5.5-7.5. These vines thrive wherever conditions are right and so much so they are considered a pest/weed, yet are generally employed as an ornamental.  Life cycle/phenology (timing of events)  The Chilean glory vine is a (half) hardy evergreen perennial vine that flowers in summer, taking around 8 weeks to germinate at 16-21¬∞C. The speed at which growth can occur can be as much as 8‚Äì10 feet. Flowering continuously from spring to autumn. At the first planting stage the plants are not hardy enough to survive a harsh winter however if the roots are shaded by another plant and the tops are getting adequate sun they may die down (foliage can survive the winter) and reappear larger and stronger the following year. They are considered perennials but many gardeners will grow them as annuals. Consisting of four stems and growing in clusters of 4 to 6 inches long, Eccremocarpus scaber flowers from late spring to autumn and can flower the first year if planted early.  Predators, parasites and diseases  When growing, parasites to be aware of are spider mites when grown outside and whiteflies if you are using a greenhouse. Green fly may be present but generally disease free.  Other information  An award-winning vine (the prestigious RHS award of garden Merit (AGM)) is a welcome addition to any gardener's collection weaving through a trellis, fencing, decking other roses and clematis (leather flower) this vine is considered to be gold within the ornamental gardener's community.  History  Eccremocarpus was first described in 1794 by Ruiz and Pavon, who soon after 1798 described two species Eccremocarpus viridis from Peru and E. scaber from Chile\\"  References  External links Bignoniaceae ","title":"Eccremocarpus scaber"},{"id":"46505097","text":"The Net, formerly known as The Marion, is a planned high-rise office building in Downtown Seattle, Washington, United States. In its current iteration, it is planned to be 36 stories tall and include of office and retail space. The project is being developed by Urban Visions, which previously proposed a 77-story tower on the site that would have become the tallest building in the city. It was later downsized to 60 stories after a design competition and 36 stories after further refinement. Earlier proposals Urban Visions filed preliminary plans in 2013 to build a 77-story supertall skyscraper on property it owned between Marion and Columbia streets in Downtown Seattle. The tower, named the 888 Tower, would have eclipsed the Columbia Center as the tallest building in Seattle. A competition was held in 2014 to select a design for the supertall tower, resulting in Urban Visions favoring NBBJ's 60-story proposal over a 77-story proposal from Gensler. The NBBJ proposal featured a atrium in the middle of the tower that would function like a skylight; the 60-story tower also incorporated floor layouts that would have allowed for 10 to 15 more people per floor despite the loss of a central core, allowing for the height to be reduced. It would have been mixed-use, consisting of retail space on the ground floor, and offices and condominiums on higher floors. The tower would have occupied the full city block between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and Columbia and Marion streets. When completed, it would have become the second- tallest building in Seattle and the fifth-tallest on the West Coast of the United States. Current proposal In October 2017, Urban Visions announced that it would scale back its plans and build a 28-story tower on the eastern half of the block with of office space. The project was renamed The Net and given a new design by NBBJ, featuring a steel exoskeleton that wrapped around the building. Another design revision in early 2018 increased the height of the building to 36 stories and added a marketspace at street level with of public space. A prominent glass staircase would connect all floors of the building. The top three stories of the building would have an outdoor terrace that sloped downwards from the 36th floor.

The company was originally built on CVac, a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In late 2014 the privately held French immunotherapy company Immutep SA was purchased by Prima Biotech. Prima currently has three main products in its pipeline, all acquired with Immutep: Eftilagimod alpha, (lab name: IMP321) which is recombinant soluble LAG-3, used as an activator of antigen presenting cells. This product has completed a Phase IIa clinical study, where it doubled the expected response rate in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. IMP731, a depleting monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases, targeting LAG-3+ activated T cells. This antibody has been licensed to GlaxoSmithKline. IMP701, an antagonist monoclonal antibody to LAG3 for use in cancer. This product has been licensed to Novartis  History  Immutep (formerly Prima BioMed) originated from four early-stage biomedical research projects which scientists at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006) were working on in the late 1990s. These projects were packaged together and taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources. The most advanced of these projects is what became CVac.  CVac  CVac was taken into the Phase II 'CAN-003' study in epithelial ovarian cancer in July 2010. In September 2013 Prima reported top-line interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of Progression-free survival (PFS),http://www.primabiomed.com.au/announcements/pdf/2013/announcement_2013_09_18.pdf however in May 2014, when Prima reported final data from CAN-003, it was able to show median PFS for CVac patients in second remission of 12.91 months versus 4.94 months for the control group. This result had statistical significance (p=0.04). After this data was received Prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients, however in February 2015 the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its CVac studies. Prima reported final Overall Survival numbers for CVac in May 2015 showing that median survival number for second remission CVac patients had still not been reached at 42 months, versus the median for the treatment group of 25.5 months. The p value for this comparison was 0.07. Immutep acquisition Since February 2015 Prima's main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with Immutep. Prima had announced the acquisition of Immutep in October 2014 and completed the transaction in December 2014. The final purchase price was US$25m. Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Fr√©d√©ric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990 and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3's mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Immutep are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.  Eftilagimod alpha  Eftilagimod alpha (lab names: IMP321 or LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion. Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo- immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark. There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines. Immutep has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.IMP321 as Adjunctive to a Standard Chemotherapy Paclitaxel Metastatic Breast Carcinoma Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in late stage melanoma.Phase 1 Study of IMP321 Adjuvant to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma (TACTI-mel)  IMP731  IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ‚Ç§64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody. Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781's commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015. There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.  IMP701  IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.  Prima stock  Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1. On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US- based specialist healthcare investor. On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.

Kim wrote and directed YMCA Baseball Team (2002), When Romance Meets Destiny (2005), Scout (2007), Cyrano Agency (2010), and C'est Si Bon (2015). He also directed 11 A.M. (2013), and wrote If the Sun Rises in the West (1998) and Joint Security Area (2000). Career Born in 1972, Kim Hyun- seok was a college student studying business administration at Yonsei University when he wrote the screenplay for A Good Day to Fall in Love. It was instantly turned into a 1995 film directed by Kwon Chil-in. His second screenplay Agency, written while Kim was doing his mandatory military service, won him Best New Screenwriter at the prestigious Grand Bell Awards, but it was never made into a film. After that, Shim Jae-myung welcomed him to her production company Myung Films, and he wrote If the Sun Rises in the West (1998), which was directed by Lee Eun and starred Im Chang-jung and Ko So- young as a baseball umpire and an actress who fall in love. Kim also worked as assistant director on that film and Kim Ki-duk's The Isle (2000), as well as co-screenwriter on Park Chan-wook's Joint Security Area (2000). Despite his screenwriting success, Kim wanted to pursue directing, so he majored in filmmaking at the Graduate School of Advanced Imaging Science, Multimedia & Film at Chung-Ang University. He then made his directorial debut in 2002 with YMCA Baseball Team starring Song Kang-ho, Kim Hye-soo, and Kim Joo-hyuk. About Korea's very first baseball team, which was formed in 1906 against the backdrop of Joseon's waning years and the onset of Japanese imperialism, it won the top prize at the 17th Fukuoka Asian Film Festival in Japan, and Kim won Best New Director at the Chunsa Film Art Awards in 2002 and the Baeksang Arts Awards in 2003. In 2005, Kim wrote and directed his second film, When Romance Meets Destiny starring Kim Joo-hyuk, Bong Tae-gyu, Lee Yo-won and Kim Ah-joong. Titled \\"Gwang-sik's Younger Brother, Gwang-tae\\" in Korean, it focused on the romantic challenges of two brothers who are polar opposites: one is a photographer who's too shy to confess his feelings to the girl he's loved for seven years, and the other is a commitment-phobic playboy who finally meets his match. The film drew a solid 2.4 million admissions at the box office. Kim returned to a period setting and baseball with Scout (2007), in which an assistant scout played by Im Chang-jung is sent to Gwangju in May 1980 (amidst the escalation of demonstrations against the dictatorial government) to convince a young pitching phenomenon named Sun Dong-yeol to sign with his team. Kim not only directed and wrote Scout, he was also the film's executive producer; it was also his third film related to baseball. The film was unsuccessful at the box office with 315,187 admissions, but critics praised how Kim ambitiously intertwined painful history and sports in his narrative, and he won Best Screenplay at the Baeksang Arts Awards and the Buil Film Awards in 2008. He then reworked his old script Agency, changing almost everything in the first draft but the film's basic framework. Comparing the original draft to the final script, Kim said \\"(What) changed the most was that in my 20s I had a fantasy of love‚Äîlike I believed if I lived well, then I could meet a beautiful woman. But years later, when I began the movie, my idea of love changed. It's not that you trust someone and therefore fall in love, but that you trust someone because you love them.\\" Upon the suggestion of director Bae Chang-ho, Kim overtly referenced Cyrano de Bergerac into a contemporary Korean setting, as a struggling theatre troupe turned dating agency helps a dorky fund manager court the woman of his dreams, not knowing that she's the troupe director's ex-girlfriend. Starring Uhm Tae-woong, Choi Daniel and Lee Min-jung, Kim's fourth film Cyrano Agency became a critical and commercial success; a sleeper hit at 2.7 million admissions, it further cemented his reputation for making intelligent, character-driven romantic comedies told from a male perspective. Kim won Best Screenplay at the Blue Dragon Film Awards. Kim tackled a new genre in 2013, with the science fiction- psychological thriller 11 A.M.. It starred Jung Jae-young and Kim Ok-bin as scientists who time travel 24 hours into the future as a test run of the time machine they've developed, but find to their horror that in that intervening time, the CCTV files reveal chaos and dead colleagues in their deep-sea laboratory. Kim said he had no idea how much energy and expense went into a single action sequence, calling the experience \\"daunting\\" and that he now \\"understood (why) Korean filmmakers have steered clear of the genre.\\" Instead of trying to understand the science and philosophy behind time travel, he said he focused instead on depicting the characters' emotional truths. 11 A.M. was Kim's first directorial effort where he didn't use his own script, and the film received mixed reviews. Following 11 A.M.'s less than positive reception, Kim returned to more familiar terrain with C'est Si Bon in 2015. A biopic of the folk music duo Twin Folio set in the eponymous iconic music lounge where acoustic singers performed live, the screenplay added a third fictional member who falls for the group's muse (played by Jung Woo and Han Hyo-joo in the 1970s, and by Kim Yoon-seok and Kim Hee-ae 30 years later). Kim said, \\"When writing the script, I considered their music as the protagonists and just used some parts of their lives as the film's basis.\\" Despite a rich soundtrack and visuals, C'est Si Bon failed to amass word of mouth and had a lackluster theatrical run.

Unemployment was estimated to be 6.6% by the CIA World Fact Book, lower than in other European Union countries. The Nordic model of a social welfare society exemplified by Sweden and its near neighbours has often been considered a European success story compared internationally with the socioeconomic structures of other developed industrial nations. This model of state provided social welfare includes many unemployment benefits for the poor, and amply funded health, housing and social security provision. within essentially corruption free nations subscribing to principles of a measure of openness of information about government activity. The Income inequality in Sweden ranks low in the Gini coefficient, being 25.2 as of 2015 which is one of the lowest in the world, and ranking similarly to the other Nordic countries; although inequality has recently been on the rise and several central European countries now have a lower Gini coefficient than Sweden. Inflation has lately - since around 2007 - been at a historic low in Sweden. However, Swedes pay very high taxes, some 52.1% of GDP (2014 est.) but correspondingly enjoy a very generous universal welfare state. Sweden's highest earning households have a somewhat lower share of income capital when compared to other countries; with the highest earning 10% having 24% of income or consumption (compared to the USA, in which the highest earning 10% percent have 30%,of income or consumption and Germany, have 24%, while Norway has 21.2%), and very low absolute poverty rates.

Moreover, the wealth inequality highlighted by the bank is accumulated wealth, not income inequality. Other studies have shown that the top 10% made 90% of 'capital income' (defined as income from the sale of housing and shares, which hardly equates exactly to 'investment income'), but still maintaining relatively low poverty rates. A study by InequalityWatch in 2010 concluded that, considering the thresholds at 50% of national median income of EU countries, Sweden's rate of relative poverty is 7%, still significantly lower than in some other countries. [Since this 'study' is mentioned repeatedly herein, it would be helpful to cite it so that others could go to the source of the claims attributed to it.] However, this present assertion (quite apart from other definitional questions) is informationally deficient since it fails to specify whether 'poverty' is defined as absolute or relative. Workers and growing inequality In 2005, Sweden's labor force was estimated at 4.49 million persons. As of 2003, the services sector accounted for 75.1% of the workforce, with 22.6% engaged in industry, 2.1% in agriculture, and the remainder in undefined occupations. About 80% of Swedish wage earners are members of trade unions, and within certain industrial branches the percentage is even higher. The trade union movement is based on voluntary membership, and there is neither a closed shop nor a union shop. Although workers have the right to strike, employers also have the right to use the lockout. The labour workforce is mixed [In what sense?], and productivity has slightly weakened in recent months, but GDP per hour worked in Sweden remains very high. In the last decades, there has been a growing number of low-skilled workers in the labor force competing for fewer and fewer occupations with lower educational and experience requirements. These types of job can include certain occupations in industry, and a number of occupations in services, administration and sales such as child care workers, kitchen and restaurant assistants, shop assistants, and cleaners. Many of these jobs are characterized by high staff turnover, which may initially appeal to people who want to gain a foothold in the Swedish labor market, but also entail potentially frustrating precarity. Many Immigrants to Sweden are by Swedish standards poorly educated and unskilled. According to a news report by thelocal.se, a 2008 change to Sweden's labour migration laws designed to make it easier for companies to recruit non-Europeans to hard-to-fill high-skilled jobs, has instead been used primarily to bring low-skilled workers to Sweden. \\"Only one third of the 60,000 jobs filled since the law came into effect have actually landed in the hands of the much-needed specialists.\\" This suggests that non-EU workers may have a tougher time finding high-skilled jobs than getting low-skilled work. Although income inequality between low-skilled and high-skilled workers is increasing, low-skilled workers are generally very well paid, inequality remains low and the lower and higher classes alike enjoy a very generous universal welfare state. Income taxes and cash benefits traditionally play an important role in redistributing income in Sweden, reducing inequality among the working-age population by about 28% (the OECD average [Of what?] is 25%). This redistributive effect has diminished over time, however, as it [What?] used to range between 35% and 40% prior to the mid-2000s. Sweden still belongs to the group of the most equal OECD countries, despite a rapid surge of income inequality since the early 1990s. The growth in inequality between 1985 and the early 2010s was, though, the largest among all OECD countries, increasing by one third. In 2012, the average income of the top 10% of income earners was 6.3 times higher than that of the bottom 10%. This is up from a ratio of around 5.75 to 1 in 2007 and a ratio of around 4 to 1 during much of the 1990s. Inequality has been rising subtly but measurably in recent years. The 2010 Inequality Watch study reported that there was a new feature of inequality: it is increasing in the most egalitarian of rich countries, the Nordic countries of Europe. In Sweden the Gini coefficient increased from 0.21 to 0.26 in 25 years; the ratio of disposable incomes between the richest and poorest population deciles increased from 4.1 to 5.8.\\" In the same study, it was reported that the gap (of the percentage of population living in relative poverty) between those of immigrant status or foreign background and those of native origin was some 11%. And when comparing only those coming from non-EU countries with natives, it increased to 14.6%. Immigration and poverty Sweden has a relatively high population of immigrant born and native population born to foreign-born parents. As of 2011, Statistics Sweden reported that around 19.6% or 1.858.000 inhabitants of Sweden were of non-native heritage, defined as born abroad or born in Sweden to two parents born abroad. Although Sweden does not officially record all residents' ethnic backgrounds, migrants' nationalities are recorded. The largest immigrant populations as of 2014 were from Finland, Iraq, and Poland (see Immigration to Sweden). According to a study by Torun √ñsterberg and Bj√∂rn Gustafsson in 2014, when comparing the poverty rate between the immigrant population (in particular those of Turkey and Muslim countries) and the native population, it has been found that the most recent poverty rates among children with a Turkish background are three times higher than among native children. It has been a recent labour market trend that a high and increasing proportion of occupations require higher education, which many immigrants lack, resulting in increasing unemployment and poverty. This focus may, however, underplay the extent to which, prior to the era of mass migration, natives involuntarily out of paid employment were or were not in a certain degree of poverty. Howbeit, it is known that ethnically heterogenous groups, with or without fluent Swedish, find it difficult to integrate into the native community, resulting in increasing marginalization. Another possible group of explanations for the employment problems of many immigrants is the difficulty of finding a job even if a person is qualified. The same study reported: \\"Results from a number of recent field experiments convincingly shows [sic: for 'show'] that many Swedish employers do not invite job applicants who are according to documents as qualified as natives but have attributes signaling a Muslim or another non-western foreign background.\\" This would suggest that native Swedes nurtured in a homogeneous, relatively egalitarian social welfare society are not necessarily cosmopolitan or inclusive in their social attitudes. In this study, it has been reported that the adjusted percentage difference compared to children with Swedish-born parents in the second generation, in 2008-2010 in Iraqi descendants is 37%, while in those from Greece and Hungary it is 23%.There has been a rapidly increased gap in income between the second generation of people with a background in 'Muslim' countries, compared with those with a heritage in other countries and with native Swedes. This first took place from the early 1980s to the late 1990s, when the economy contracted and employment shrank. (see, Economy of Sweden;).However, if the foregoing reference to \\"'Muslim' countries\\" implies the inclusion of Turkey within that group, it raises the question of the authors' recollection of the political history and constitution of Turkey.

Life  Jo√£o was born in Portugal, son of Martim Louren√ßo da Cunha and Maria (or Margarida) Gon√ßalves de Briteiros, maternal granddaughter of Martim Afonso Chichorro, whose first husband was Martim Afonso de Sousa, having by him a daughter, Beatriz de Sousa, wife of Enrique Manuel de Villena, whom Leonor Teles would call her sister-in-law. In 1365, he married Leonor Teles to whom he was still married when she met King Ferdinand I of Portugal and abandoned her husband to marry the Portuguese king. Two children were born of this marriage; a daughter who died in infancy, and a son Alvaro da Cunha, heir to the lordship of his father. In 1379, King Ferdinand confiscated Jo√£o Louren√ßo's properties and gave them to Fern√£o Afonso de Albuquerque. He left his country and returned to Portugal at the end of 1383 after the king's death. According to the legends and traditions of Valladolid collected by Juan Agapito y Revilla, a 19th20th century architect and local chronicler, Jo√£o Afonso Teles fled from the Portuguese court and found refuge in Valladolid where he lived the rest of his life and where he walked around the city wearing a hat with a string to which were attached silver horns manifesting his condition as a cuckold. This is in contradiction with Portuguese sources according to which, after the death of King Ferdinand, he returned to Portugal at the end of 1383 where he received several donations from the master of Aviz who, at Jo√£o Afonso's behest, on 17 April 1385, issued a letter confirming that √Ålvaro, up to then considered a bastard son of Lope Dias de Sousa, was actually his son whose real name was √Ålvaro da Cunha.

One day, a PhD research student named Yamini joins Kaashmora, only to gather evidence and expose him to the public. Kaashmora's fame brings him to a superstitious and fraudulent minister. Kaashmora earns the minister's trust. When the income tax department raids the minister's house, the minister asks his henchmen to transfer all of the illegal money to Kaashmora's house. Seeing this as an opportunity to escape and settle abroad, Kaashmora's family escapes with the money. Meanwhile, Chelapathy Rao seeks Kaashmora's help and brings him to a haunted bungalow in Andhra Pradesh. In the bungalow, Kaashmora is haunted by actual ghosts. Back in Chennai, the minister learns that Kaashmora is a fraudster and sends his henchmen to kill his family. The henchmen try to get Kaashmora from the bungalow but are unable to do so as the ghost beats them all and drags Kaashmora and his family inside the bungalow. Inside, they meet a broker who got trapped inside the bungalow for a long time. The broker says that the bungalow was once a princess's palace. Ever since her death, residents and owners of the bungalow had met with an ill-fate. He also tells that there are 13 ghosts in the bungalow. The trapped people meet the ghost of Raj Nayak, the head of all 12 ghosts. Raj Nayak asks Kaashmora to help him and his subordinates reach the spiritual world. He then locks them in the castle. That night, a young girl in Kaashmora's dream leads him to a locked door within the castle. Waking up, Kaashmora follows the same route, but is stopped by Yamini, who reveals to him that Chelapathy Rao, the man who led him here, died 75 years ago, and it was his ghost that led Kaashmora, as well as Yamini, to the bungalow. Kaashmora searches the castle and gets hold of an old book that dates back 700 years. Raj Nayak was a self-obsessed warlord and a womanizer. The king remained silent and did not interfere with Raj Nayak's growing atrocities because of his military prowess. One day, Princess Rathna Mahadevi elopes with her lover, who is the enemy kingdom's prince. The king announces that he will marry off Rathna and give away half of his kingdom to the man who finds her. Raj Nayak kills the prince and forcibly brings Rathna back. He demands to be wed to the princess and wants the other half of the kingdom as dowry. When opposed, he kills the crown prince and the king. Raj Nayak then marries Rathna and crowns himself King. However, Rathna has other plans. She and her friends seduce Raj Nayak and his subordinates. While Raj Nayak's subordinates are burned alive, Raj Nayak is beheaded by Rathna. However, he kills her before dying. Before breathing her last, Rathna places a curse on the 13 men, preventing them from reaching the spiritual world. Since then, Raj Nayak and the other 12 ghosts had haunted the palace and its occupants. An exorcist once had predicted that Raj Nayak and the other ghosts would reach eternal power if they are able to sacrifice the lives of five people belonging to the same family with the same birth star (Rohini). The sacrifice should be performed by a lady who is the only woman in her generation. This should happen during the Navakaali Pournami that occurs once every millennium. Kaashmora recollects that his family members all have the same birth sign and that Yamini is the only woman in her family. That night, Navakaali Pournami occurs, and Raj Nayak forces Kaashmora and his family to a guillotine. The young girl from Kaashmora's dream appears, and turns out to be Rathna's reincarnation. While Rathna and Raj Nayak fight each other, Kaashmora fends off the subordinate ghosts with the help of a magical sword. Rathna's conscience leads him to a chamber within the castle where Raj Nayak's remains are. Using the sword, Kaashmora destroys the remains, making Raj Nayak vulnerable. Rathna destroys Raj Nayak's spirit, and it goes to the underworld. The other spirits flee the castle to the spiritual world. Kaashmora and his family get out of the castle, and he claims that he has destroyed the spirits and cleansed the centuries-haunted bungalow. Kaashmora's family told the politician that the money stolen from the politician has been kept by the ghost.

The a-process is in large part responsible for the initial, usually fast and immediate emotional reaction to a stimulus. The theory considers it a primary process and may be affectively positive or negative, but not neutral. The theory also proposes that this process automatically causes a b-process, which is subjectively and physiologically opposite in direction to the a-process. There is a peak response to any emotional stimuli which usually occurs rapidly, usually out of shock, but last only as long as the stimuli is present. In a physiological sense, the a-process is where the pupils dilate, the heart rate increases, and the adrenaline rushes.  A and b process  The \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" processes are consequently and temporarily linked but were believed to depend on different neurobiological mechanisms. B-Process, the other part of opponent-process theory, occurs after the initial shock, or emotion and is evoked after a short delay. A-process and B-process overlap in somewhat of an intermediate area. While a-process is still in effect, b-process starts to rise, ultimately leveling out a-process' initial spike in emotion. A-process ends once the stimulus is terminated, leaves, or ends. Physiologically, this is where breathing returns to normal, pulse slows back to its normal rate, and heart rate starts to drop. The B-process can be thought of as the \\"after-reaction\\". Once B-process has ended, the body returns to homeostasis and emotions return to baseline. Research on the brain mechanisms of drug addiction showed how the a-process is equated with the pleasure derived from drugs and once it weakens, it is followed by the strengthening of the b-process, which are the withdrawal symptoms.

He is best known as the author of the earliest published history of the parish of Naseby. Background and family John Mastin was born at Epperstone on 30 September 1747, a son of William Mastin and his wife Ann Baguely. In 1772, John eloped with 16-year-old Mary Gurney and they married in Scotland, as her guardian did not approve of the match. The couple had seven children born between 1773 and 1791; their two sons died in infancy and only two of the children outlived their father. Career John was the son of a grazier and early in his life worked as a land-agent in Hertfordshire. He was unusual amongst Anglican clergy of the 18th century in that he did not hold a university degree; his academic preparation for ordination was solely by private tuition and study. He was ordained deacon on 21 September 1777 and appointed curate of Husbands Bosworth on the following day. Two years later, he was ordained priest. In 1783, John was presented as Vicar of Naseby, where he had already served as curate - a living that he held for the remainder of his life. In due course, he was appointed vicar of additional two parishes ‚Äì Dunton Bassett (1802) and Cold Ashby (1822). It is clear from his memoirs that for most of his life after ordination, John was actively involved in agricultural matters, and submitted essays to the Board of Agriculture. Writings In 1792, John published by subscription the first edition of ‚ÄúThe History and Antiquities of Naseby, in the County of Northampton‚Äù. A second edition was published in 1818. As might be expected, the book records the Civil War battle that took place in the parish in 1645. Other material there includes an account of agricultural practices, references to contemporary residents and details of at least some of the memorials and tombstones that were then present in Naseby church and churchyard. In his later years, John compiled memoirs, the manuscript of which is deposited at Northamptonshire Record Office.Northamptonshire Record Office: ZB 1276. As well as details of his life as a clergyman, this manuscript records at length the various land transactions and agricultural activities in which he actively participated until a few years before his death. The texts of both these works are included along with a learned introduction, annotations and a number of relevant appendices in the book titled ‚ÄúA Georgian Country Parson‚Äù. Death John died on 15 January 1829 and was buried at Naseby nine days later. Probate of his will was granted by the Archdeaconry Court of Northampton on 21 March 1829. John‚Äôs wife had died in 1811.

Sources  Gesta Regum Francorum excerpta, ex originali ampliata.  Background  This battle is a part of the Hungarian - German war which started in 900, after the Hungarian conquest of Pannonia (Transdanubia), and lasted until 910, the battles of Augsburg and Rednitz, both ending in disastrous German defeats, which forced the German king Louis the Child, and the German duchies to accept the territorial losses, and pay tribute to the Hungarians.  Prelude  After the Battle of Pressburg ended with a catastrophical defeat of the attacking East Francian armies led by Luitpold prince of Bavaria, the Hungarians following the nomadic warfare philosophy: destroy your enemy completely or force him to submit to you, first forced Arnulf prince of Bavaria to pay them tribute, and let their armies cross the lands of the duchy to attack other German and Christian territories, then started long range campaigns against the other East Francian duchies. The Hungarian campaign of 908, and the battle of Eisenach The first of these was the attack of one Hungarian army to Thuringia and Saxony. However this was not the first attack of the Hungarians in Saxonia, because two years earlier two Hungarian armies devastated one after another the duchy, being asked to come by the Slavic tribe of Dalamanci, which lived near Meissen, which were threatened by the Saxons attacks and plunderings. In their campaign of 908, the Hungarians used again the Dalamancian territory to attack Thuringia and Saxonia, coming from Bohemia or Silesia, where Slavic tribes lived, like they did in 906. The Thuringian and Saxonian forces, under the lead of Burchard, Duke of Thuringia met the Hungarians on the battlefield at Eisenach. The number of the forces are unknown, and the leader of the Hungarian forces neither, although it is possible that it was the same commander who led the Hungarians to great victories in the battles of Pressburg in 907, Augsburg and Rednitz in 910, because of the categorical outcome of those battles (annihilation of the enemy forces together with their leaders).  Battle  We do not know many details about this battle, but we know that it was a crushing defeat for the Germans, and the leader of the Christian army: Burchard, Duke of Thuringia was killed, along with Egino, Duke of Thuringia and Rudolf I, Bishop of W√ºrzburg, together with the most part of the German soldiers.

Formed from local Lithuanians, the unit was directly subordinate to the Wehrmacht. Their German commander was Hellmuth M√§der who was hoping to raise a division. However, only two ill-equipped and ill-trained regiments were actually formed. The total membership is estimated at 6,000 men. On October 7, TAR took defensive positions in Seda against the of the 6th Guards Army. TAR suffered heavy losses and retreated towards Klaipƒóda (Memel). In East Prussia, the remaining men were reassigned to various pioneer units. Formation As a result of the Operation Bagration, Soviet 1st Baltic Front reached eastern borders of Lithuania in summer 1944 and continued to push forward during the Baltic Offensive. In occupied territories, young men were forcibly mobilized into the Red Army. Lithuanians, having suffered the repressive Soviet occupation in 1940‚Äì41, began evacuating towards the west and forming armed groups in Samogitia. On 28 July 1944, Lithuanian officers met in the village of and discussed options for defending Lithuania: either join the Wehrmacht and fight openly or become partisans and wage a guerrilla war, a tactic chosen by the Lithuanian Freedom Army. The former option won by a narrow margin of votes and these improvised units were organized into TAR, commanded by Captain Izidorius Jatulis. The Lithuanians established contacts with Hellmuth M√§der, an officer in the 9th Army, via priest Jonas Steponaviƒçius. M√§der agreed to support the new unit and provide it with weapons and uniforms. The staff headquarters were soon moved from Pievƒónai to a school of agriculture in .  Organisation  The 1st Lithuanian Volunteer Regiment, commanded by Major Alfonsas Urbonas, was formed during August 1944. On August 26, it had two battalions and about 1,200 men, but only 47 officers. The 2nd Lithuanian Volunteer Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Meƒçys Kareiva, was formed during September 1944. There were plans for the 3rd Regiment that would have included the remaining Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions and elevated TAR to the status of a division, but they were not realized. In total, TAR had about 6,000 men.  Officers and men  TAR sorely lacked experienced officers: there were only 112 officers and even fewer had relevant combat experience. Five generals were present in the area and were asked to join TAR. One, Kazys Navakas, accepted but only as the head of the Provisions and Finance Department. Povilas Plechaviƒçius, just released from his arrest due to his command of the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, accepted the invitation on a condition that Germans would grant him full authority over TAR. The Germans never replied and Plechaviƒçius never joined TAR. Three other generals refused as they considered the effort to be futile and a waste of men's lives. Majority of the men were enthusiastic but inexperienced 18- to 20-year-olds, including 17-year-old Valdas Adamkus, future President of Lithuania.  Equipment  TAR also lacked weapons, radios, and other provisions. Activities Soviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944: From the first days, the men were involved in strengthening and guarding the front line along the Venta River. The period of August‚ÄìSeptember was a relatively quiet period as part of the Soviet Army was attacking towards Riga while the other was regrouping and reorganizing in preparation for the offensive towards Klaipƒóda (Memel). From July 18 to September 19, TAR published five issues of its own newspaper Lietuvos Gynƒójas (Defender of Lithuania). TAR also established a relief fund to provide aid to war refugees, firstly to family members of TAR soldiers. On October 5, 1944, Soviet 1st Baltic Front began the Memel Offensive. The main strategic goal of the offensive was to separate German armies and create the Courland Pocket. The Lithuanians were tasked with defending the towns of Seda (1st Regiment) and Barstyƒçiai (2nd Regiment). Despite promises, Lithuanians were not reinforced by German troops. The 1st Regiment was commanded by Major Pranas Puod≈æi≈´nas, former commander of the 4th police battalion, and Lieutenant Liudas Norkus, who also had experience in the Eastern Front. However, the regiment took a poor defensive position: the trenches were dug about in front of the Varduva so that retreating soldiers would have to cross the river which had only one bridge. Germans intended to sacrifice the unit so that main German forces could regroup. On October 7, Seda was attacked by the , commanded by General , of the 6th Guards Army. Lithuanians, armed with Panzerfausts, managed to destroy eight Soviet tanks T-34 but quickly ran out of ammunition and were forced to retreat. The regiment lost about 100 men, most of them during the retreat, particularly across Varduva. About 30 were taken captive by the Soviets. Order 193, signed by Stalin on October 8, mentioned Seda as a point of strong resistance and ordered to award most distinguished Soviet fighters. The remaining men retreated to Barstyƒçiai where TAR unsuccessfully attempted to regroup. Facing further attacks form the Soviets, TAR retreated towards Kretinga and Klaipƒóda. The men faced a difficult choice ‚Äì retreat west with the Germans or return home and join underground resistance that would become the Lithuanian partisans. Perhaps as much as half of the men joined the partisans. About 1,000 men reached East Prussia where they were organized into eight pioneer companies and used them to construct military defenses near Gda≈Ñsk, ≈Åom≈ºa, L√ºbeck. Evaluation Overall, TAR is a rather obscure and poorly researched event in the history of Lithuania. One of the issues is lack of archival date. Archives of the 1st Regiment were saved by Captain Jonas ƒåƒósna, who after the war immigrated to the United States. After the restoration of the independence, the archive was transferred to Vladas Kazlauskas, a former member of TAR who wrote several books on the topic. However, these writings are disorganized and self-contradictory. The archives still await attention from scholars. Archives of the 2nd Regiment did not survive; therefore, very little is known about its structure or activities. The unit was organized by Lithuanian initiative when German forces were becoming more and more disorganized. Unlike the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, which shared the same goals, TAR was not controlled by the Germans. For example, the oath, which had to be signed by each TAR recruit, mentioned only defending the fatherland and combating Bolshevism making no mention of the Third Reich. Lithuanian historians consider TAR as one of the attempts to reestablish the Lithuanian Army and fight for Lithuania's independence.

It lived during the late Late Eocene (in the Divisaderan and Tinguirirican of the South American land mammal ages (SALMA), 37.2-33.9 million years ago) and its fossil remains have been found in the Sarmiento Formation of Argentina, South America.Astraponotus at Fossilworks.org  Description  This animal was probably similar in shape and size to a modern tapir. Unlike most astrapotheres, Astraponotus was equipped with an unusually high, short, narrow skull. The nasal bones were quite withdrawn, which suggests the presence of a short proboscis. Other unusual features of Astraponotus includes the extreme reduction of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the absence of an antorbital circle, and the reduction of the frontal region. The canines were long and strong, as in all astrapotheres.Kramarz, A. G., Bond M. and Forasiepi, A. M., 2010. New remains of Astraponotus (Mammalia, Astrapotheria) and considerations on Astrapothere cranial evolution. Pal√§ontol Z. DOI 10.1007/s12542-010-0087-4.  Classification  Astraponotus was first described in 1901 by Florentino Ameghino, based on teeth fossils.F. Ameghino. 1901. Notices pr√©liminaires sur des ongul√©s nouveaux des terrains cr√©tac√©s de Patagonie [Preliminary notes on new ungulates from the Cretaceous terrains of Patagonia]. Boletin de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias de C√≥rdoba 16:349-429 The type species, Astraponotus assymetrum, comes from Eocene terrains known as Gran Barranca, in Patagonia (Argentina). The area was later was nicknamed capas Astraponotenses (\\"Astraponotus' layers\\" in Spanish) due to the abundance of the peculiar fossils of this animal. Other species were described later (for example, A. dicksoni and A. holdichi), but always based just on the remains of the teeth and jaws. A a nearly complete skull was not described until 2010, which has allowed hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships of this animal more precisely. The features observed in the teeth of Astraponotus are intermediate between the Middle Eocene astrapotheres and those of the Oligocene-Miocene in the degree of hypsodoncy, the reduced dental formula, and the development of accessory occlusal elements. Moreover, the skull retains plesiomorphic features also observed in the archaic genus Trigonostylops, while the auditory region and the skull base are much closer to those of Parastrapotherium, Astrapotherium, and Granastrapotherium. Furthermore, the Astraponotus skull differs from all astrapotheres known in its disproportionate height, the narrowness of the skull, and other numerous cranial specializations that are opposite to Astrapotherium. These features seem surprisingly derived for an Eocene astrapothere, and suggest that these extreme cranial specializations were developed independently during the evolution of this order; Astraponotus could represent a lineage distinct from Astrapotherium and other Miocene forms.

Duchy of Bronte Whilst Alexander's eldest brother Arthur Hood, 2nd Viscount Bridport succeeded their father by law as Viscount Bridport, a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, the Duchy of Bront√©, an ancient title in the Peerage of the (defunct) Kingdom of Sicily and Naples, was bequeathed to him by their father and thus he became the 5th Duke of Bront√©. This was possible because of a special remainder in the letters patent granting the duchy (issued in 1799 by King King Ferdinand III of Sicily), which allowed the holder to choose as successor whomsoever he wished. The Dukedom of Bronte with its vast estate (about 15,000 hectares and feudal rights over the City of Bronte, population about 9,000http://www.bronteinsieme.it/2st/Bridport/nelson_ducea6.htm) had been granted in 1799 to Admiral Horatio Nelson by King King Ferdinand III of Sicily, for services rendered in saving his kingdom from Revolutionary French invasion. The Duchy had been inherited by the Hood family by the marriage of Alexander's grandparents Samuel Hood, 2nd Baron Bridport (1788-1868) and Lady Charlotte Mary Nelson (d.1873), suo jure 3rd Duchess of Bronte, niece and eventual heiress of Admiral Nelson. In his book The Duchy of Bronte (1924) he speaks of his father's great generosity in entrusting him with his Sicilian estate, and his constant reply when asked for advice: \\"I leave it to you, I know you'll do your best\\".http://www.bronteinsieme.it/2st/Bridport/nelson_ducea1.htm He first visited Bronte in Autumn 1868, aged 14, with his father, mother and sister Adelaide, only the third time Bronte had been visited by a family member since the creation of the Duchy (Admiral Nelson never set foot in it). He stayed his only night in the Palazzo Ducale,http://www.bronteinsieme.it/2st/Bridport/nelson_ducea5.htm the family's townhouse in the town of Bronte, before moving on 5 1/2 miles north, accompanied by a long mule train (roads being non-existent), to the Castello di ManiaceMontague-Smith, P.W.

His first impressions were \\"extremely favourable\\", and he was sad at the prospect of returning to England at the end of the four week visit. In 1873, aged 19, he was sent to Maniace (with Jane Thomson, the governess of his brother and sister, who stayed for 20 years) by his father to take full control of the estate, where during his father's lifetime he was known as the Duchino (\\"little duke\\").http://www.bronteinsieme.it/2st/Bridport/nelson_ducea1.htm He was the first resident Duke and made great improvements to the estate. La Falconara, Taormina La Falconara, Taormina, built c. 1908-11 by the 5th Duke, where he entertained the British royal family in April 1925 in 1867 his grandmother the 3rd Duchess of Bronte had purchased land at Taormina, on the coast 40 miles east of Maniace, in the Contrada Sant Leo.Lady Charlotte si trov√≤ a visitare Taormina ma le preferiva Maniace essendo rimasta sconcertata dalla situazione locale; tuttavia intorno al 1867 la famiglia acquist√≤ un terreno a Taormina, in Contrada S. Leo. Nel 1873 il figlio di Charlotte, il visconte Bridport, affid√≤ le sue terre al figlio Alec Nelson Hood che nel 1904 divent√≤ il quinto duca di Bronte ed avendo ereditato anche il terreno di Taormina, il 15 aprile 1911 inizi√≤ a costruire la Villa della Falconara. In 1903 he purchased additional land in Taormina, on which he built a large villa called \\"La Falconara\\" (aliter \\"Villa Nelson\\"), still under construction at the time of the 1908 Messina earthquake.Il Duca stesso vi aveva acquistato un terreno nel 1903, sul quale aveva dato inizio alla costruzione de ‚ÄúLa Falconara‚Äù, la villa da lui stesso progettata, i cui lavori nel 1908 erano ancora in corso; many modern sources (estate agents) state (seemingly erroneously) that it was built by Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1780Building of La Falconara by 5th Duke confirmed in Under the Volcano: Revolution in a Sicilian Town By Lucy Riall, p.169 The entrepreneur Maricchiolo laid the first stone.http://sicilianflavors.blogspot.com/p/postcards-cartoline.htmlFor records of the building works at La Falconara see Archives of the Nelson & Hood families, State Archives, in Palermo Situated at 99 Via Luigi Pirandello, on the steep hillside 400 yards below (south of) the Teatro Greco, it comprises 20 rooms, including 8 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and 50,000 square metres (c. 12 acres) of gardens and greenery. With his close friend and frequent guest the writer Robert Hichens he helped to further establish Taormina (like Capri) as a \\"holiday resort for wealthy homosexuals from Northern Europe\\".Under the Volcano: Revolution in a Sicilian Town By Lucy Riall, p.169 That reputation had been initiated by the German photographer Wilhelm von Gloeden (1856-1931), who first visited Taormina in the 1870s, where he subsequently lived and died, together with other British expatriots such as the artist Robert Hawthorn Kitson (1873-1947)http://sicilianflavors.blogspot.com/p/postcards-cartoline.html and Colonel Thomas Shaw-Hellier (1836‚Äì1910). In April 1925 the 5th Duke entertained the British royal family at La Falconara, as is memorialised by a white marble tablet on a garden wall inscribed: \\"Their Majesties King George V and Queen Mary with TRH Prince George and Princess Victoria honoured this house and garden with a visit on 4th April 1925\\".See photos in Lucy Riall, Under the Volcano: Revolution in a Sicilian Town, Oxford, 2013 of the \\"5th Duke with King George V on the Loggia at Villa La Falconara 1925\\" (p.168, fig.15) and \\"5th Duke with Queen Mary, after her landing at Palermo on 7/4/1925, accompanied by Lady Jane Verney (1877-1951), wife of the courtier Sir Harry Lloyd Verney.

This resulted from a complaint by his aunt Jane Sarah Hood (Lady Hotham) when visiting with his father in 1888, that no monument existed, to which the Duke replied in jest that Wren's epitaph in St Paul's Cathedral states Si monumentum requiris circumspicehttp://www.bronteinsieme.it/2st/Bridport/nelson_ducea2.htm (\\"if you seek his monument look around you\\"). Lady Hotham promptly sent him the requisite funds, with which he erected the monument.

Early life and education Saiidi lost his father at the age of four. He was a teenager when he emigrated alone from Afghanistan to Pakistan and then to Iran. In 1987 he entered Zulfiqar School in Isfahan and after four years of education he went on to study in Qom. There, he spent ten years studying Arabic language and Literature and Islamic Studies at the World Centre of Islamic Sciences, English Language in Baqer-al Ulum University and Political Science at the University of Mofeed. He left Iran in 2001 to settle in Sweden. In Sweden, he first started learning the Swedish language and re-studied his intermediate and high school education from scratch. He later obtained a degree in International Relations at the University of Gothenburg, and another degree in department of Oriental Studies in Persian Language and Literature (Persian, Swedish, English) at the University of Uppsala. Poetry Saiidi began poetry in childhood. By staying in Iran, he gained a deeper acquaintance with literature, especially poetry. His first poems were published in 1989 in the Hablollah journal in Tehran. By sending the first poem to this journal, he obtained the permanent membership of the Poetry section of the journal and continued to publish his poems thereafter. At that time, Hablollah was the best Afghanistani refugee journal in Iran and had a great reputation and credibility. It was during that time that Saiidi‚Äôs poem found its way to Iranian media. His first poems were published in poetry section of Etela‚Äôat Haftagi journal, which gave rise to his status and encouraged him to continue. In those years he became familiar with the literary associations of Isfahan. He joined the Saba Poetry Association headed by Tabar Esfahani, which gave him the opportunity to know more about Ode and classic poetry. He left Saba because he found it limited to the classical poetry and joined the poetry recital sessions of Association of Poets of Isfahan in the library of Chaharbagh. In these sessions, more than a hundred classic and modern poets gathered for poetry readings and poetry critique. One of the Iranians‚Äô famous Sonneteer, Saeeid Biyabanaki, emerged from such gatherings. Biyabanaki has commented about Sharif Saiidi‚Äôs presence in the Association of Poets of Isfahan that ‚Äòwhen Saiidi goes starts reciting his poem on the microphone, all poets hold their breath‚Äô (Farkhar Journal with a special issue for Mohammad Sharif Saiidi). During his four-year stay in Isfahan, Saiidi compiled a collection of his poems. The collection was stolen in 1990 in a terminal in Tehran. The thief was a soldier who thought to have stolen a bag with valuables and money, which was in reality Saiidi‚Äôs first collection of poems. Some of poems of this collection had already been published in journals of Hablollah and Etela‚Äôat Haftegi. In 1370, there was a weekly gathering of poetry recital at the Art Association of Qom, which was of great significance. In this programme, there were tens of renowned poets from Qom and Tehran and other cities. Ahmad Shahdadi, Sadeq Rahmani, Naser Faiz, professor Mohammad Ali Mujahedi and few other important figures criticized and assessed the poems. Each week, there was a guest poet. These guests included Ali Mousavi Garmaroudi, Mohammad Salmani and Aghasi. Mohammad Sharif Saiidi first introduced himself to this gathering through reciting his poems and later he established his position as a poetry critique. In the same year, Muhammad Sharif Saeedi along with a group of young poets including Qanbar Ali Tabesh, Asif Javadi, Sarwar Taqwa, Mohsen Saeedi set up the programme of Literature and Poems of Afghanistani refugees in Qom. In these programmes sessions relating to poetry such as Prosody, Rhythm, Versification, Literary Techniques and introductory sessions on Poetry Criticism were arranged for other poets. Due to lack of space, these sessions used to take place in mosques or classrooms of World Centre of Islamic Sciences. Later, the Art Association of city of Qom provided the Afghanistani poets and writers with a room to meet twice a week to hold poetry and story writing related sessions. Since then, Mohammad Sharif Saiidi became in charge of managing this programme in Qom. Various prestigious poets took part in this programme. Many poets including Qanbar Ali Tabesh, professor Sayed Movahed Balkhi, Mohsen Saeedi, Asef Javadi, Salman Ali Zaki, Ali Madad Rezvani, and ladies including Shokria Erfani, Zahra Zahedi, Hakima Arefi recited their poems and criticized one another‚Äôs poetry. These sessions were held on Thursdays and carried the title of ‚ÄòBluer than Thursdays‚Äô. In the programme of ‚ÄòBluer than Thursdays‚Äô, there was a session on Sonnets of Bidel. Saeedi was responsible for managing this programme but other poets including but not excluding to professor Movahed Balkhi, Sayed Fazel Mahjoob and Mohsen Saiidi were involved in analyzing the sonnets of Bidel. These sessions were recorded by the Art Association of City of Qom to be used by the Iranian poets of this association as many Iranian poets had difficulty in understanding the language, thoughts and imagination of Bidel. In 1373, the Tales and Poetry Forum of city of Qom invited Sharif Saiidi for collaboration. He began working as a poetry critique of this forum. This collaboration continued until 8 years when he left Iran for Sweden. In this forum there were several sessions a week for poetry critique and many young poets welcomed the sessions. Amongst the young poets who started poetry in this forum and later had active presence in the forum, one can name: Najmeh Zare, Shirin Khosravi, Zahra Rasoul Zadeh, Shokria Erfani, Zahra Zahedi, Hakima Arefi, Salman Ali Zaki, Ali Madad Rezvani, Sayed Reza Jafari, Taqi Akbari, etc. During the 8 years of teaching in this forum, around 800 students took lessons on poetry critique and story writing and graduated successfully. Apart from poetry critique, Sharif Saiidi also taught Prosody, Versification and matters related to poetry. One of the most important programmes of this forum was the literary programme of Poets of Poetry Council of Qom broadcast in the Iranian TV. In this programme, around 50 top student poets were selected and sent to Tehran under supervision of Sharif Saiidi. The programme was held and broadcast on a weekly basis. The programme raised profiles of many young poets in the forum. Mohammad Sharif Saeedi first gained fame in Qom. Later, many Iranian poets throughout Iran welcomed his particular poems. He has been repeatedly invited to many poetry congresses in cities of Tehran, Mashad, Shiraz, Isfahan, Kashan, Tabriz, Yazd, Kerman, Sabzevaran, Saveh, Sanandaj, Qazvin, Khomeini Shahr, Mazandaran. These congresses welcomed the contemporary poetries. For example, one can mention the poetry congress in Khomeini Shahr that was held for 12 years consequently and had more than 10,000 poet audiences. Every year and for three days, the city of Isfahan turned into a city of poetry. It goes without saying that the poetry congress was accompanied with music and songs that added to the glory of the congress. Apart from studying in Qom, Saiidi had wide range of literary activities. He was the chief editor of the first literary and artistic bi-weekly called Golbang. This bi-weekly was published every two weeks from 1992 to 2001. This bi-weekly dealt with the literary and artistic topics. Poems, stories, photographs, reports, travelogues, poetry criticism, story criticism were amongst the permanent topics of the journal. Besides these subjects, he also dealt with artistic matters such as calligraphy, singing, music, etc. Among those who were introduced to literary circles through this bi-weekly one can mention the poet Mohammad Shams Jafari and the storywriter Batool Sayed Haidari and the filmmaker and photographer Puya Alami. After Saiidi‚Äôs migration to Sweden, the journal continued for one more year with the chief editor Javad Khavari and then went to an end. Saeedi was a member of Cultural Center of Afghanistani writers in exile. In this centre, he cooperated with the journals of Siraj and Dor-e Dari. According to many cultural experts and figures and as Rahnaward Zaryab commented: Dore-e Dari is the best Persian journal in the field of literature and art. This journal had a special status amongst the literary and artistic circles. Sharif Saiidi was a member of editorial board as well as managing poetry and translation section of the journal. Several articles of Saiidi on various topics have been published in this journal. ‚ÄòModernism and the obstacles of Afghanistan poetry‚Äô was amongst the most influential articles of Saiidi. He has also translated and published various stories and poems from English to Persian in Dor-e Dari. Saiidi was the responsible person in literature section of magazine \\"Solidarity\\" and was also the editor of the magazine. He published poetry, stories and travelogues in this weekly journal. His multi-part travelogue of his trip to Mazar-e-Sharif and Bamiyan was considered as one of the most read texts of the journal. Saiidi has also collaborated with the literature section of scientific journal of ‚ÄòSiraj‚Äô, which is publication of Cultural Centre of Writers of Afghanistan in Qom. Amongst Saiidi‚Äôs works one can mention the modification of the book ‚ÄòNaqd‚Äôe Bidel‚Äô i.e. critique of Bidel written by Salahuddin Saljoughi. Saiidi prepared this book for the Ehsani Publications in Qom in 1995 but the book did not get published as another publication managed to publish it quicker than Ehsani Publication and that limited the market for the book. The literary and academic community welcomed Saeedi‚Äôs poems. For example, his poems were cited in the textbooks of the Kabul University and Isfahan University. Many thesis and dissertation were dedicated to analysis of his poems and prose in Afghanistan universities. Ms. Somaye Arab Nezhad in Kashan University wrote her PhD thesis on sonnets of Saeedi. Dr. Zaher Fayez‚Äôs PhD research was about Saeedi and three other poets‚Äô poems in Isfahan University. In Iran, Saiidi has been involved in teaching literature and journalism. In Sweden, he has been engaged with interpreting and translation centers of the Swedish Ministry of Defense, cooperation with the international Swedish Radio and finally with Swedish schools in teaching mother tongue and tuition. Articles about Saiidi People who have written about books or poetry of Saeedi include: * Kazem Kazemi * Latif Nazemi * Sakhidad Hatef * Mohammad Vaezi * Mahmoud Jafari * Dr. Mohammad Jafar Yahaghi * Dr. Sarwar Mowla'ii * Abutaleb Mozaffari * Syed Zia Ghasemi * Seyed Reza Mohammadi * Mir Hossein Mahdavi * Wasef Bakhtari * Wali Parkhash Ahmadi * Ganbar Ali Tabesh * Sarv Rasa Rafi-Zadeh * Saeed Biabanaki * Dr. Ismail Amini * Dr. Ali Khairi * Abdul Khaliq Toronto * Kaveh Ahang * Sayed Nader Ahmadi * Khaleda Forough * Humaira Nekhat Dastgir Zada * Parto Naderi * Abdul Hadi Ayoubi * Saboorollah Sia Sang * Somaye Arab Zadeh * Mohammad Hossein Hashemi * Dr. Hafizillah Shariati * Hamid Reza Shekar Sari * Dr. Esmat Esmaili * Dr. Mahmoud Hassan Abadi * Dr. Yousof Bina Books by Saiidi Saiidi translated poetry and stories from English and Swedish to Persian.

He was also influential in bringing Russian Freemasonry under the Control of Prussian lodges, through which he exerted diplomatic influence. Life' Theden was the youngest of 23 children. Despite beginning as a mere barber's apprentice, he reached the pinnacle of the medical profession. One of his teachers was the City Doctor Johann Siegmund Hahn (1696‚Äì1773) of Schweidnitz, who co-founded spa treatment in Germany so that Theden also became a practitioner. A reference to his own origins can be found in Theden's own writings: \\"Our German army doctors, unfortunately! for the most part are trained by barbers. For three years they work for barbers and imbibe their teaching. After this they are apprenticed having learned nothing more than how to wash a beard and put on plaster and poultices... many can barely read and, even if they can, they learn no more than their teachers before them\\" (Source: Unterricht f√ºr die Unterwund√§rzte bey Armeen - Report on the army medical service) After the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) Theden was appointed Third Surgeon-General of the Prussian Army and after the death of Johann Leberecht Schmuckers (1712‚Äì1786) became First Surgeon-General at the Charit√© in Berlin (till his death in 1797). His successor was Surgeon-General Johann Goercke (1750‚Äì1822). Theden performed his greatest service to Surgery. His \\"Inflamed Wound- or Shot-water\\" made of brandy, honey or sugar, vinegar and diluted sulphuric acid for treating inflamed wounds - a development of the method of his predecessor Schmucker - came into general use as \\"Tinctura Antimonii Thedenii\\". He designed the Elastic Catheter, a new method for stemming bloodflow used in treating broken knees etc. He married Juliane Sophie Engel (1723‚Äì78), daughter of Johann Gottlieb Engel (1689-1754), Alderman, and Catharina n√∂e Haupt (1701‚Äì50). Their daughter Christiane Wilhemine (1753-1831) married Archdeacon Bolzius and, following his death, Major-General Gottfried Ludwig Matthias von Hartmann (1738-1807), commander of the Prussian Artllery Corps, who was decorated with the Pour le M√©rite in 1775.

The top unit has three lithium- manganese dioxide cells internally, the bottom two are lithium-iron disulfide single cells physically and electrically compatible with 1.5 volt zinc batteries. As widespread economic turmoil in the first decade of the 21st century resulted in the broad destabilization of many traditional investment products and venues alternative investment options began to realize an increase in popularity among investors who may not have otherwise strayed from established investment practices under previous markets. Speculation in metallic or base Lithium is an example of such a trend. Speculators hope to make a viable play on a perceived growth in demand for lithium metal due to the widespread adoption of lithium batteries in emerging technologies. Lithium batteries have become a preferred power source for energy-hungry devices such as cell phones because they are more efficient and scalable than previous- generation nickel-metal hydride batteries thus they are in high demand in support of automobile and electronics manufacturing. Factors that could result in limitations affecting overall lithium supply are seen by some as prescient; with predicted supply chain volatility potentially overpowering other market factors and becoming the primary price driver, essentially resulting in a seller's market and thereby making the metal a profitable investment. However this model tends to disregard the influence of other factors outside basic supply/demand curves such as market regulation and the increased tendency for costlier components to be targeted for replacement by new technologies. Current projections of the global market for lithium-ion batteries range from $26 billion in 2023 (Navigant Research) to a very optimistic $33 billion in 2019 (Transparency Market Research). Metal Lithium metal is an extremely soft, highly reactive, and flammable element. It is most frequently found in deposits such as spodumene and pegmatite minerals, with larger resources in the U.S., Canada, Australia, China, Zimbabwe, and Russia. Lithium possesses a unique chemical profile making it the lightest metal in the periodic table and the least dense solid element. Its atomic number is 3 (right behind helium at 2 and hydrogen at 1), and its density is just 0.53 kg/L. This alkali metal is probably best-known for its wide use in lithium batteries common in all sorts of electronics devices. Other industrial applications include manufacturing heat-resistant glass and ceramics, high-performance alloys used in aircraft, and lubricating greases. Lithium deuteride is used in staged thermonuclear weapons as a fusion fuel. Compounds of lithium are also used as mood stabilizing drugs in psychiatry. The breakdown of the global end-use lithium markets is estimated as follows: ceramics and glass, 31%; batteries, 23%; lubricating greases, 9%; air treatment, 6%; primary aluminum production, 6%; continuous casting, 4%; rubber and thermoplastics, 4%; pharmaceuticals, 2%; and other uses, 15%. Global resources and production The global production of lithium is set to quadruple from 20,000 tons in 2000 to 80,000 tons in 2020. Mining lithium metal is not expensive, especially at high mountain plateaus, where lithium is collected from brine ponds evaporated by the sun. In the five years to 2018 the largest increase in world lithium production has come from hard rock mines in Western Australia, with 7 mines now in production. Identified lithium resources total 5.5 million tons in the United States and approximately 34 million tons in other countries, so lithium is not, in fact, a rare commodity. Identified lithium resources for Bolivia and Chile are 9 million tons and in excess of 7.5 million tons, respectively. Identified lithium resources for Argentina, China, and Australia are 6.5 million tons, 5.4 million tons, and 1.7 million tons, respectively. Canada, Congo (Kinshasa), Russia, and Serbia have resources of approximately 1 million tons each. Identified lithium resources for Brazil total 180,000 tons. The world‚Äôs top 3 lithium-producing countries from 2016, as reported by the US Geological Survey. Australia In 2016, Australian companies delivered 14,300 tons of metal, an increase of 1,300 tons from 2014. The country develops the Greenbushes lithium project, which is owned and operated by Talison Lithium. Greenbushes is the world‚Äôs largest known single lithium reserve and has been operational for over 25 years. The location also provides easy access for Asian electronics companies, which are the global top lithium consumers. All Australian production to date has been in the form of spodumene concentrate containing approximately 6% LCE, all of which was shipped to China for refining. In 2017-18 Australian production had increased to 2.1 million tonnes of spodumene concentrate worth $1.6 billion. Three separate refineries are under construction which will produce lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate. Chile In 2016, Chilean mines delivered 12,000 tons of lithium, providing the second-highest amount of lithium. Overall, Chile possesses the largest confirmed lithium reserves in the world, with over 7.5 million tons of the element. By that estimate, the country hosts roughly five times more lithium than Australia, which features the second-largest reserves. In particular, the Atacama salt flat is the most significant source of country‚Äôs massive lithium production, and it has been reported that one project alone encompasses approximately 20% of the world‚Äôs total lithium. While Australia extracts lithium from traditional hard-rock mines, Chile‚Äôs lithium is found in brines below the surface of salt flats. These brines are collected and treated in order to separate the element from wastewater. Argentina In 2016, for the first time, Argentina overtook China to become the third largest producer of lithium. Argentina has lithium reserves of 9,000,000 tons and the Salar del Hombre Muerto district is a part of the so-called lithium triangle which is believed to be home to half of the World's lithium reserves. Due to increased demand worldwide, lithium mining in the country shows no signs of slowing down with output set to triple by 2019. Canada Canada is a new entrant into lithium market as a potential supplier. The Lithium Triangle The intersection of Chile, Bolivia, and Northwest Argentina make up the region known as the Lithium Triangle. The Lithium Triangle is known for its high quality salt flats including Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni, Chile's Salar de Atacama, and Argentina's Salar de Arizaro. The Lithium Triangle is believed to contain over 75% of existing known lithium reserves.\\"The Lithium Triangle\\"http://latintrade.com/the-lithium-triangle/. Latin Trade. Retrieved 2017-8-13. Investment vehicles Currently, there are a number of options available in the marketplace to invest in the metal. While buying physical stock of lithium is hardly possible, investors can buy shares of companies engaged in lithium mining and producing. Also, investors can purchase a dedicated lithium ETF offering exposure to a group of commodity producers. Lithium Index The performance of the global lithium industry is covered by Solactive Global Lithium Index.

He currently works for Dotonbori Pro Wrestling and has also worked for Kaientai Dojo and Osaka Pro Wrestling in Japan. For several years he formed a tag team with Japanese wrestler Hideyoshi and was also part of a group known as Bad Force. Professional wrestling career The masked wrestler known as Masamune made his professional wrestling debut in Mexico in April 1999, after being trained by Mexican Luchador Lizmark. Initially he wrestled under the ring names Dragon Furia or Furia del Dragon (\\"Dragon Fury\\" or \\"Fury of the Dragon\\") but later adopted the ring name Masamune. The Masamune character was inspired by Japanese Daimyo feudal lord Date Masamune, which in part is reflected in his mask, which has what looks like an eye patch over one eye just like Date Masamune only had one eye. Due to his mask design Masamune earned the nickname dokuganry≈´ (the \\"one-eyed dragon\\"), just like the original Masamune. Masamune in June 2016. After initially working as a freelancer, by 2005, Masamune had made Osaka Pro Wrestling his home promotion, teaming with Hideyoshi, another masked wrestler with a \\"samurai\\" ring character, collectively known as Sengoku, after the Sengoku period in Japan. The team's first notable achievement came in July 2005, where they competed in the first ever Osaka Tag Festival. In the first round Sengoku defeated Kuishinbo Kamen and Ebessan II, in the semi-finals they defeated Tsubasa and Billyken Kid and finally the team of Super Delfin and Tigers Mask to win the entire tournament. The tournament victory also meant that Sengoku won the vacant Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship at the same time. The championship reign was ended 56 days later, when they lost to a team known as Universal Global Members (Billyken Kid and Tsubasa). On February 12, 2007, Sengoku defeated the team of Gaina and Zeus to win the Osata Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship once more. At some point in 2007, Masamune and Hideyoshi joined up with Atsushi Kotoge, Black Buffalo, Condor, Gaina, Kazushi, Zero and Zeus to form a group known as \\"Bad Force\\". On August 26, 2007, they lost the championship to Kagetora and Rasse. Sengoku competed in, and won the 2009 Osaka Tag Festival, defeating Asian Cougar and Miracle Man in the first round, Tigers Mask and Black Buffalo in the second round and Orochi and Tadasuke in the finals. Sengoku's third Osaka Tag Team Championship run began on July 18, 2009, when they defeated former \\"Bad Force\\" partners Black Buffalo and Tigers Match to win the championship. The third reign was their longest, at 208 days, until they lost the championship to Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada. On July 19, 2009, Masamune won a battle royal to win the Osaka Pro Wrestling Battle Royal Championship The title had the special stipulation that it could only be defended in battle royals, which is how Masamune lost the championship to Kanjyuro Matsuyama on March 21, 2010. Masamune began working for El Dorado Wrestling in 2010 as well, teaming with Minoru Fujita to defeat Speed of Sounds (Hercules Senga and Tsutomu Oosugi) to win the UWA World Tag Team Championship, holding the title for 344 days until Speed of Sounds regained the title. In 2013, Osaka Pro Wrestling announced that they were closing, which led to a number of wrestlers jumping to Dotonbori Pro Wrestling (DPW). By the time Osaka Pro Wrestling revealed that they had secured financial backing and was not closing, a number of wrestlers, including Masamune, had already committed to DPW. The Joker group reformed in DPW, consisting of Kuuga, Gamelas, Kazuaki Mihara and Masamune, effectively ending Sengoku after being a regular team for seven years. Masamune teamed up with former rival Billyken Kid to win the Second Dotonbori Tag King tournament when they defeated Super Sonic (Daisuke Masaoka and Rapid) to win the tournament as well as the WDW Tag Team Championhship. In April 2015, it was announced that Masamune had been selected to represent All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in the Lucha Libre AAA World Wide promoted Lucha Libre World Cup, despite having only wrestled a few matches for AJPW. Masamune and his partners Kenzo Suzuki and Tiger Mask III were eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Team MexLeyendas (Blue Demon Jr., Dr. Wagner Jr. and El Solar).

It was written by Mike Benner and directed by Don MacKinnon. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 30, 2014. Plot Bob enters the first annual Best Burger competition at Wonder Wharf, hosted by Chuck Charles, where he competes against Jimmy Pesto and charismatic celebrity chef Skip Maroosh. The chefs have 20 minutes to cook their burger entries before they are judged by a panel. Skip's entry is the Pomegranate Green Chili Chutney Burger, Jimmy Pesto's is the Oregano Burger, and Bob's is the Bet It All On Black Garlic Burger, which uses an expensive, speciality ingredient: Korean black garlic. Bob is wracked with anxiety, questioning why he entered a competition he knows he will likely lose, and has to deal with constant jabs from Chuck, who still holds a grudge against him for getting him fired from his job as a morning talk show host. Things become worse when Bob realizes that the black garlic is not in their cooler. Bob entrusted Gene to pack it, but Gene became distracted and forgot it on the kitchen counter. Bob sends Gene to retrieve it in time to prepare, but Linda sends Louise and Tina to ensure he does not mess up. At the restaurant, Gene smashes the black garlic into his shirt in a moment of distraction, rendering it unusable. They call Bob, who instructs the kids to go buy some at the specialty food store, Fig Jam, which is the only store that carries it. The kids are reluctant, because an earlier argument with the store owner, Ray, resulted in him banning them. Ray is willing to sell them the black garlic, but they cannot pay because Gene foolishly gave their money to a grifter. With no other options, Louise steals the black garlic and Ray chases them. The kids run into Mickey driving a pedicab, and jump into his coach with Ron, his passenger. As they ride to the wharf, Gene is shocked to learn from his sisters that everyone in the family view him as a screw up, to the point that his name is a common verb for losing focus and messing up: \\"Gene-ing out\\". Back at the competition, Bob is pessimistic at their chances of winning, but Linda points out that Bob may be subconsciously sabotaging himself by assigning the most crucial task to their least responsible child, Gene, all as a way to have an excuse for failure. Bob realizes she is right and they get a text from the kids saying they got the garlic and are on their way. The kids are being chased by Ray in a pedicab behind them. Gene elects to make the final run to bring the garlic to Bob, despite knowing that Wonder Wharf is full of distractions, feeling that he must prove himself as reliable. Rob, Louise, and Tina stall Ray, ultimately getting rid of him by pointing out that Fig Jam is unstaffed with him gone and a likely target for looters. Gene runs through Wonder Wharf, and despite encountering numerous delicious food attractions, manages to reach Bob. As Gene attempts to apologize for being a screw up, Bob grabs the black garlic and finishes his burgers in the nick of time. His burger is excellently reviewed by the judges, but Skip's burger ultimately wins. Walking home, Bob decides he is proud of what they all accomplished even though he lost, and tells Gene that despite sometimes getting distracted, he loves Gene for who he is and appreciates how hard he worked today. The family arrives to find a line of eager customers at their restaurant, including Skip, who all want to try Bob's black garlic burger. Bob asks Gene if he wants to help him fire up the grill, but Gene decides to take the day off and finally enjoy the Wonder Wharf food spectacles. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, stating that the show could face difficulty creating a good story for Gene, and managed to do so quite well: \\"Bob‚Äôs Burgers has long struggled to know quite what to do with Gene as a character‚Äîhe‚Äôs an asset as a ready source of one-liners and farts, but that isn‚Äôt quite the same thing as emotional depth‚Äîbut ‚ÄúBest Burger‚Äù unexpectedly pulls out one hell of a story for the Belcher boy, as he faces up to just how much of a colossal screw-up he is and strives to get things right, just this once...Gene and Bob‚Äôs story strikes just the right balance between being funny and being poignant; about the worst you can say about it is that 'Best Burger' takes a little while to wind its way to that specific story.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode a 9.1 out of 10, praising the episode delivering a true victory for The Belchers, compared to the half-victories they usually encounter: \\"Bob doesn‚Äôt win the titular contest for Best Burger, but what does come out of his efforts is a little bit of personal growth and a way to express his affection for his strange and easily distracted son Gene.\\" The episode received a 1.0 rating and was watched by a total of 2.23 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Fox that night, losing to Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Family Guy, and The Simpsons.

He is the longest-serving character, having played the role of Charlie for over 30 years, and the only remaining original character to have appeared continuously since the first episode on 6 September 1986. Thompson chose to take a nine-month break from the show in early 2004. Charlie left the show in series 18 on 17 July 2004 and after five months, returned on 1 January 2005 in series 19. At the end of series 19, Charlie left again as Thompson returned to his break from the show, with Charlie's exit scenes airing on 20 August 2005. After four months off-screen, Charlie returned in the series 20 Christmas crossover with Holby City, which aired on 24 December 2005. Thompson has remained with the show since, but regularly takes breaks of around two months every year. Thompson has so-far made four appearances in Casualty sister show Holby City: the show's first episode in January 1999; the second episode to the Christmas crossover in December 2005; another crossover to Holby City in February 2010 when Charlie has a heart attack; and the most recent appearance in October 2012 when he interviewed Chantelle Lane (Lauren Drummond) for a full-time nursing position. Thompson also made an appearance in Casualty spin-off police drama, HolbyBlue for its first episode in May 2007. Storylines Charlie is the lynchpin of the emergency department. He's been there since the beginning (having joined the department more than a decade before Casualty was first aired) and has always proved to be an indispensable, trustworthy and diplomatic member of the team. People look up to him, and he always tries to be there when the ED family need him. In the early days of Casualty, he was depicted as a leader figure with a good sense of humour, but a short temper, which occasionally got him caught in strife when dealing with people higher than himself. During his time in Casualty, the character has come close to death on several occasions. In Series 5, Charlie is shot in the chest with a handgun by a schizophrenic man, holding Megan Roach hostage in CRASH. He is seen to recover by Series 6. In Series 12, Episode 24, Charlie and Baz Hayes are held hostage by an armed man who stormed the solicitors office where Baz was finalising plans to leave Charlie and Holby, with custody of Louis. In a derelict building, Baz and Charlie have to repair a stab wound in the man's stomach. As he is about to shoot Baz, Charlie pushes him from Baz, just in time for a police sniper to kill the man. Upon their return to Casualty, Charlie proposes and Baz accepts, to the delight of the rest of the staff. Next episode, it is the day of Baz and Charlie's wedding, however the ceremony is postponed when the staff are called back to Casualty to deal with a fire at another Casualty department. As Charlie walks outside to find a walkabout patient, he sees the man run down by a stolen ambulance. Charlie races out to help the patient, but he himself is run down by the ambulance while pulling the patient from the road. After much concern from the rest of the staff, it is discovered that Charlie has only broken his wrist and the wedding ceremony goes ahead. In the final episode of Series 14, Charlie finds himself fed up, after many weeks of trying to help an alcoholic mother called Leona. After an argument, Charlie storms off to the Men's, with Leona in close pursuit. He pushes himself up against the door to prevent Leona form coming in. All of a sudden, Charlie clutches at his chest and collapses, at which point the episode ends. At the start of Series 15, it is discovered that Charlie has suffered a pulmonary embolism and slowly comes back to health. In Series 19, Charlie and paramedic Luke are asked by nurse Claire Guildford to scatter the ashes of her accidentally murdered brother, Peter at the seaside. After discovering that Luke had tried to protect the killer, his former wife, receptionist Bex Reynolds, and that Charlie knew of this as well, Claire plunges her car into the harbour, taking Luke and Charlie with her. She dies, but Charlie and Luke make a full recovery. In Series 24, Charlie is stressed after he relentlessly attempts to help Louis' pregnant girlfriend Shona from harming herself and the baby as Louis can't be bothered. He eventually finds Shona extremely drunk and high, slumped in a graveyard. As they are driving back to the ED, Shona plays ACDC far too loudly through Charlie's car radio. Charlie begins to cough up blood and crashes into a gutter. Shona races off to find help. Charlie is brought back to the ED with Shona, where it is found he has had a heart attack. He is operated on by Elliot Hope, one of his oldest friends, and he makes a slow but full recovery. At the beginning of Series 30, after Zoe Hanna and Max Walker's explosive wedding reception, Charlie races into the freezing water to rescue Zoe, who is being drowned by her wedding dress. After arriving back at the ED, Charlie refuses treatment as he feels he does not need it despite being immersed in the freezing water for several minutes. Whilst trying to get on the phone to Louis, Charlie collapses. At first, he insists that he just pulled a muscle in his back whilst swimming, but the ECG results say that he has had a massive heart attack and he quickly loses consciousness and falls into Cardiac Arrest. After over half an hour of CPR and defibrillation, the team feel it is time to stop when Charlie's heart comes back to a normal rhythm. He is slowly recovering. He eventually returns to work. In March 2020, Charlie quit his job at the emergency department, following a stressful several weeks after the death of Duffy. He rejoined the ED in May 2020, after being held as a hostage by a mentally ill man.  Relationships He has dated numerous women during the show. The most notable is Barbara Hayes - another original character - who was eventually his wife. Baz left Casualty after series one but returned nearly a decade later. Unhappily married, she reconciles with Charlie and gets pregnant with their son, Louis. Baz divorces her husband and marries Charlie in 1998 but they separate when Baz gets a job in Canada two years later. She briefly returns in late 2003 to visit her father but dies after a road accident so Charlie gets full custody of Louis. Charlie has come close to death on several occasions since 1990 as a result of a shooting and later a hit and run involving a stolen ambulance, a pulmonary embolism, attempted drowning and a heart attack. Charlie's son, Louis, sets him up with Maggie Coldwell (Susan Cookson). They date for a while and he proposes but she refuses, agreeing inside to stay in touch. In series 22, Charlie celebrates thirty-five years in nursing. However, he struggles with childcare issues and the news that he or Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer) will be made redundant. Although Tess volunteers, Charlie is asked to leave after a fight with a patient. He returns several months later, working in the private sector and becomes a grandfather after Louis's brief relationship with Shona Wark results in a daughter. Shona, unable to cope, leaves her with Charlie and he named her Megan, after his long-term friend and one time colleague, Megan Roach (Brenda Fricker), whom he and Tess recently helped commit suicide. While searching for his missing granddaughter, who had been taken by a mentally ill patient, Charlie sees Ruth Winters (Georgia Taylor)'s husband kissing his lover, James. Charlie debates whether to tell Ruth and confesses when comforting her. Hurt and humiliated by his deception, Ruth has Charlie transferred, but he moves back when Ruth is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Ruth later returns to the ED and makes amends with Charlie. When Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) begins looking for a new consultant, following her promotion to clinical lead, and Charlie recommends a former nurse of Holby, Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (Patrick Robinson), and he later wins the job and begins working in the ED. He also begins mentoring new student nurse, Ally Hunter (Rebecca Newman), but after realising that she doesn't want to be a nurse and that she doesn't need to follow her mother and grandmother's footsteps she leaves the ED and decides to travel the world. Charlie later visits Louis in New Zealand. Charlie returns from New Zealand, in August 2014, and clinical lead, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) raises her concerns that Charlie doesn't seem interested in his job anymore, but little does she know of the nurse's health problems. Charlie arranges an appointment with Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) where he believes Charlie has a high possibility of angina. Charlie later becomes irritable towards Tess when she recommends a retirement care plan. When Connie, Tess, Ash, Ethan and Lily are involved in a minibus crash, Charlie takes charge of the ED and ensures that Connie does not attempt a risky procedure on Ethan due to her own injuries. When Connie goes to him later in his office, he launches a tirade about how he loves his job too much and refuses to retire. Connie concedes and states that the team will need him, when she discovers that paramedic Jeff was killed when the minibus exploded. In February 2015, Charlie gives Connie a few harsh words after she makes the rash decision to ask Caleb Knight (Richard Winsor) for his letter of resignation. Later, Charlie discovers that Louis is in Romania, has accumulated a large amount of debt and is addicted to heroin. Accompanied by Connie, he rescues his son on the verge of illegally donating a kidney for money and whisks him back to England. He tries to support his son in his recovery, but Louis relapses several times; Charlie shows Louis a dead drug addict and even threatens to take heroin himself to highlight the danger of Louis' addiction. A case of deep vein thrombosis and a potentially contaminated needle finally seems to shock Louis into recovery. On the verge of independence, Louis attends the wedding of Zoe Hanna and Max Walker, but gets drunk and starts a brawl with the groom, causing an accident that sends the wedding marquee up in flames. Charlie is seen diving into the water to save Zoe; however the exertion and hypothermia brought on a massive heart attack. Attempts to restart Charlie's heart were shown in real time, in parallel with other plot threads, with the episode ending with Charlie completely flatlining, and some of his colleagues contemplating giving up and declare him dead. After a lengthy resuscitation attempt by Connie, Rita and Lofty, he eventually regained consciousness and recovered by the end of the episode. Development He is described by the BBC as \\"the lynchpin of Holby's ED. [...] an indispensable, trustworthy and a diplomatic member of the team.\\" Series producer Oliver Kent has described Charlie as \\"by far our most important character\\" and \\"absolutely core to the show's success\\". In 2012, Inside Soap described Charlie and Tess as 'the mum and dad of Casualty'. Current producer Nikki Wilson talked about the importance of Charlie and Tess saying, \\"I think it's really crucial that we keep them around. Charlie has been in the show for nearly 30 years, and he's such an iconic character. It's fantastic he's still here. His relationship with Tess is quite important - as you say, they're like the parents of the whole department - so long may it continue.\\" In 2014, series producer, Erika Hossington spoke to Digital Spy about the show's plans for Charlie, saying, \\"We've got a small story that will show in the first third of series 29. However, we've also got bigger plans for him, which will begin in the final third of series 29 and continue towards the thirtieth anniversary.\\"Casualty producer Erika Hossington shares show gossip - part two - Casualty News - Soaps - Digital Spy She continued to say how Charlie will be \\"centre of the thirtieth anniversary\\" and \\"in order for that to be impactful, they have to really build up to that\\". \\"Charlie's older fans will have complete satisfaction. I think Charlie is the heart of the show and always should be central, hence why he is going there.\\"  Reception  In August 2017, Thompson was longlisted for Best Drama Star at the Inside Soap Awards, while Charlie's wedding to Duffy was longlisted for Best Drama Storyline. Both nominations made the viewer-voted shortlist, but Thompson did not win any awards. Charlie and Duffy's partnership was nominated for Best Soap Couple at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; they came in tenth place with 3.8% of the total votes.

Amaterasu decreed that Ame-no- oshihomimi (Â§©ÂøçÁ©ÇËÄ≥ÂëΩ), one of the five sons born to Amaterasu when Susanoo chewed her magatama beads, shall take possession of the earth and ordered him to go down to it. Ame-no-oshihomimi, inspecting the land below from the bridge connecting heaven and earth, deemed it to be too tumultuous and refused to go any further, instead going back to report what he saw.Chamberlain (1882). Section XXX.‚ÄîThe August Deliberation for Pacifying the Land. ≈åkuninushi meeting the Hare of Inaba, who helped him win the hand of Yagami-hime in exchange for his kindness towards it.

Ame-no-hohi, however, began to curry favor with ≈åkuninushi and did not send back any report for three years. The Nihon Shoki adds that Ame-no-hohi's son, ≈åsobi-no-mikuma- no-ushi (Â§ßËÉåÈ£Ø‰∏âÁÜä‰πãÂ§ß‰∫∫) was sent afterwards, but like his father, he did not report back to Takamagahara. Ame-no-wakahiko After Ame-no-hohi's failure to return, the amatsukami sent another messenger, Ame-no-wakahiko (Â§©Ëã•Êó•Â≠ê, Â§©Á®öÂΩ¶). However, he too came to side with ≈åkuninushi, even marrying his daughter Shitateru-hime (‰∏ãÁÖßÊØîÂ£≤ÂëΩ, ‰∏ãÁÖßÂß´). After eight years of waiting, the heavenly deities sent a female pheasant to question Ame-no-wakahiko, but he shot it with his bow and arrow at the prodding of a goddess named Ame-no-sagume (Â§©‰ΩêÂÖ∑Â£≤, Â§©Êé¢Â•≥). The blood-stained arrow flew straight up to Takamagahara at the feet of Amaterasu and Takamimusubi, who threw it back to earth with a curse, killing Ame-no-wakahiko. Ame-no-wakahiko's relatives, hearing the wailing of his bereaved wife, erect a mortuary house (Âñ™Â±ã moya) for Ame-no-wakahiko's corpse at the place where he died (Kojiki) or at Takamagahara (Nihon Shoki). They then celebrated his memory with song and dance for eight days and nights. A friend of Ame-no-wakahiko during his time on the earth who closely resembled him in appearance, Ajishiki-/Ajisuki-takahikone (ÈòøÈÅÖÂøóË≤¥È´òÊó•Â≠êÊ†πÁ•û, Âë≥ËÄúÈ´òÂΩ¶Ê†πÁ•û), went to attend Ame-no-wakahiko's funeral.

After Ame-no-wakahiko's death, the gods of heaven convened another assembly to decide about whom to send next. In the Kojiki, the selected candidates were the god Itsu-no-ohabari (the sword Izanagi used to slay the fire god Kagutsuchi, the birth of whom caused Izanami's death) and his son, Takemikazuchi.Chamberlain (1882). Section VIII.‚ÄîThe Slaying of the Fire-Deity. As Itsu-no-ohabari was busy damming the headwaters of the heavenly river, Takemikazuchi, accompanied by the bird-boat deity Ame-no-torifune, was sent instead. In the Nihon Shoki, meanwhile, the gods choose the sword god Futsunushi as their messenger; Takemikazuchi is chosen as his companion after he indignantly demanded to be sent as well. The two messengers arrive at the shores of Inasa (‰ºäÈÇ£‰Ωê‰πãÂ∞èÊµú Inasa no ohama; Kojiki) or Itasa (‰∫îÂçÅÁî∞Áãπ‰πãÂ∞èÊ±Ä Itasa no ohama; Nihon Shoki) in the land of Izumo (modern Taisha-machi, Izumo, Shimane Prefecture). Sitting on the points of their upturned swords, they questioned ≈åkuninushi what his intentions were with regard to the land, which was the possession of Amaterasu's descendants. ≈åkuninushi asked to confer with his son Kotoshironushi first before giving his decision. Kotoshironushi, who had gone hunting and fishing, immediately acceded to the messengers' demands. After counseling his father to do likewise, he then disappeared.Chamberlain (1882). Section XXXII.‚ÄîAbdication of the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land. The Kojiki adds that a younger son of ≈åkuninushi, Takeminakata, carrying a giant boulder on the fingertips of a single hand, challenged Takemikazuchi to a test of strength. When Takeminakata tried to seize Takemikazuchi's arm, the latter transformed it into an icicle and then a sword blade, preventing Takeminakata from grabbing it. When Takemikazuchi grasped Takeminakata's arm in return, he crushed it like a reed and threw it aside. Pursued by Takemikazuchi, the injured Takeminakata fled to \\"the sea of Suwa in the province of Shinano\\" (ÁßëÈáéÂõΩÂ∑ûÁæΩÊµ∑), where he pleaded for his life and surrendered, vowing not to leave Shinano.Ashkenazi (2003). pp. 267‚Äì268. With Kotoshironushi's counsel (and Takeminakata's surrender), ≈åkuninushi finally agreed to cede the land to the descendants of Amaterasu. As a condition, he asked that a magnificent palace ‚Äì rooted in the earth and reaching up to heaven ‚Äì be built for him on Tagishi beach (Â§öËä∏Âøó‰πãÂ∞èÊµú Tagishi no ohama) in Izumo, where special foods from the sea will be offered (Kojiki). Bequeathing a broad spear he used to pacify the land to the two divine messengers (Nihon Shoki), ≈åkuninushi disappeared and became the ruler of the unseen world. After ≈åkuninushi's assent and withdrawal, the two messengers proceeded to destroy everyone and everything who refused to submit to their authority. They then send the god of weaving, Takehazuchi (Âª∫ËëâÊßå), to subdue the star god Kagaseo (È¶ôÈ¶ôËÉåÁî∑), the last remaining rebel against Takamagahara (Nihon Shoki). With all resistance finally gone, the two gods went back to heaven to report the success of their mission. =Alternate version= A third version of the story also found in the Nihon Shoki has Kagaseo ‚Äì here given the alternative name Amatsu-mikaboshi (Â§©Ê¥•ÁîïÊòü) ‚Äì being put to death in Takamagahara by Futsunushi and Takemikazuchi before they descend to Izumo. In this version, ≈åkuninushi ‚Äì as ≈ånamochi (Â§ßÂ∑±Ë≤¥Á•û), the name used for the god in the Nihon Shoki ‚Äì initially refuses the demand of the two envoys. After Futsunushi goes back to Takamagahara to report, Takamimusubi sends the two messengers back to ≈ånamochi, this time with promises of rewards should he comply: in exchange for his political authority, he (≈ånamochi) will be given authority over religious matters, a magnificent palace to dwell in, and festivals in his honor presided by Amaterasu's son Ame-no-hohi. Finding these too good to refuse, ≈ånamochi finally accepts their terms. Introducing the god of roads and borders, Kunado-/Funado-no-kami (Â≤êÁ•û) to the envoys as his replacement, ≈ånamochi disappears into the unseen world. Appointing Kunado-no-kami as guide, Futsunushi proceeds to go around Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, slaying those who resisted him and rewarding those who rendered obedience. The now-invisible ≈ånamochi, under the name ≈åmononushi (Â§ßÁâ©‰∏ª), and Kotoshironushi go up to Takamagahara to swear fealty to the gods of heaven. Takamimusubi rewards ≈ånamochi/≈åmononushi by giving him his daughter Mihotsu-hime (‰∏âÁ©ÇÊ¥•Âß´) as his wife, and sends him back to earth with \\"the eighty myriads of deities.\\" Aftermath The earth now under their possession, the amatsukami sent the \\"Heavenly Grandson\\" (Â§©Â≠´ tenson), Ame-no-oshihomimi's son Ninigi, to rule over Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni,Chamberlain (1882).

Similar myths In addition to the Izumo myth cycle recorded in the official histories, other sources provide stories with a similar theme: the transfer of power from one god to another. Ise: Isetsuhiko The Fudoki of Ise Province, which survives only in excerpts quoted in other writings, relates the story of an obscure god of the wind, Isetsuhiko, who was said to have surrendered his land (what would become Ise) to Amenohiwake-no-mikoto (Â§©Êó•Âà•ÂëΩ), who claimed it in the name of Ninigi's great-grandson Jimmu, who launched a military campaign to conquer the eastern lands of Japan. Isetsuhiko is himself apparently identified as the son of a god hailing from Izumo, hence his other name Izumonotakeko-no-mikoto (Âá∫Èõ≤Âª∫Â≠êÂëΩ).Kurita (1927). pp. 44‚Äì45. Suwa: Moreya Local myths in the Suwa region of Shinano (modern Nagano Prefecture) speak of a foreign deity who was challenged upon his arrival in Suwa by a local god named Moreya. After subduing Moreya and other kami who resisted him, the outsider finally established himself as the region's chief god, being enshrined at the Suwa Grand Shrine by the shores of Lake Suwa.Moriya, Sanae (1991).

Analysis It is believed that the two earliest official chronicles, the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki, which purport to contain the 'correct' early history of Japan, were compiled as propaganda designed to legitimize the rule and increase the prestige of the Yamato dynasty, which claimed descent from Amaterasu via Ninigi. As such, the Izumo kuni-yuzuri cycle has often been interpreted as a mythic retelling and justification of the rise to power of the Yamato state and its subjugation of other clans and tribes, such as those of Izumo (represented by its deities). Futsunushi and Takemikazuchi Both the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki agree in naming one of the two messengers the gods of Takamagahara send to ≈åkuninushi to be Takemikazuchi, the god of Kashima Shrine in Hitachi Province (modern Ibaraki Prefecture) who was worshipped by the influential Nakatomi clan, which oversaw the religious rituals of the Yamato court, and its offshoot, the Fujiwara clan.Miyasaka (1987). pp. 18‚Äì20. The second messenger meanwhile is identified in the Nihon Shoki as Futsunushi-no-kami (ÁµåÊ¥•‰∏ªÁ•û), the deity of Katori Shrine in Shim≈çsa Province (modern Chiba Prefecture) worshipped by the Mononobe clan. While in the Kojiki it is Takemikazuchi among the two messengers who takes center stage, the two versions of the myth found in Nihon Shoki and other sources imply that the central role was originally occupied by Futsunushi. For instance, both the Fudoki of Izumo Province and the Izumo-no-kuni-no- miyatsuko-no-kanyogoto (Âá∫Èõ≤ÂõΩÈÄ†Á•ûË≥ÄË©û \\"Divine Congratulatory Words of the Kuni-no- Miyatsuko of Izumo\\"), an address the chieftain or governor (kuni-no- miyatsuko/kokuz≈ç) of Izumo offered to the Emperor on behalf of Izumo's deities as a sign of his allegiance to the imperial (Yamato) court, mention or imply only Futsunushi (recorded in both texts as Â∏ÉÈÉΩÊÄíÂøóÂëΩ/Â∏ÉÈÉΩÂä™ÂøóÂëΩ Futsunushi-no-mikoto) as descending from heaven, with no mention of Takemikazuchi. It is therefore thought that Takemikazuchi gradually came to take on Futsunushi's attributes and roles, coinciding with the decline of the Mononobe and the rise of the Nakatomi. ≈å no Yasumaro, compiler and editor of the Kojiki. Takeminakata Takeminakata's abrupt appearance in the Kojiki's version of the myth has long puzzled scholars, as the god is mentioned nowhere else in the work, including the genealogy of ≈åkuninushi's progeny that precedes the kuni-yuzuri narrative proper.Chamberlain (1882). Section XXVI.‚ÄîThe Deities the August Descendants of the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land. Aside from the Sendai Kuji Hongi (aka the Kujiki), which nearly-verbatim replicates the Kojiki's kuni-yuzuri narrative and adds the information that Takeminakata is a son of Nunakawa-hime,ÂÖà‰ª£Ëàä‰∫ãÊú¨Á¥Ä Â∑ªÁ¨¨Âõõ (Sendai Kuji Hongi, book 4), in he is altogether absent from the Nihon Shoki as well as from early sources dealing with Izumo such as the province's Fudoki. While earlier authors tended to explain this absence by equating Takeminakata with certain minor deities who are thought to share certain parallels with him (e.g. Isetsuhiko), claiming that these were actually Takeminakata under a different name,Motoori, Norinaga (1937). Âè§‰∫ãË®òÂÇ≥ (Kojiki- den), vol. 14 in Motoori Toyokai (ed.), Êú¨Â±ÖÂÆ£Èï∑ÂÖ®ÈõÜ (Motoori Norinaga Zensh≈´), vol. 2. Tokyo: Yoshikawa K≈çbunkan. pp. 683‚Äì684. (Original work written 1764‚Äì1798) more recent scholars suggest instead that the god was an original invention by the Kojiki's compilers, who, for one reason or another, then grafted him to the Izumo myth cycle.. Due to Takeminakata being associated with the Suwa region in historical Shinano Province (modern Nagano Prefecture), scholars look for his origin in this area. It is believed that the Kojiki's chief compiler, ≈å no Yasumaro, might have created 'Takeminakata' based on either local legends or recent history (cf. Moreya's resistance against Suwa-my≈çjin, thought to be a mythicization of local resistance against the encroachment of the Yamato state on the Suwa area) and/or the indigenous pre-Yamato belief system revolving around the nature god(s) Mishaguji and the subsequent adaptation and reorganization of that system under Yamato rule.Miyasaka (1987). pp. 17‚Äì26. Scholars point out Yasumaro's clan, the ≈å, being distantly related to the clan of the kuni-no-miyatsuko of Shinano, the authorities set up by the Yamato court to govern the area, as one possible motivation for inventing a new god based on the legends, the religious practices and the history of Suwa.Miyasaka (1987). p. 19.

She lives in Port Lincoln where she has developed several properties. She has worked as a presenter on the seafood, fishing and boating television program Out of the Blue, is a friend and business advisor to multi-millionaire tuna rancher Tony Santic and is a former girlfriend of retired South Australian treasurer, Kevin Foley. In 2013, Forster was co-managing her family's business, Calypso Star Charters and her partner was abalone diver David \\"Bucky\\" Buckland. In 2014, Forster served as Secretary for the Port Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and Tourism. Forster is a fisher, and holds longstanding national and South Australian women's and junior records for an eagle ray she caught in Spencer Gulf in 1987 on 10 kg line. The fish weighed 68.5 kilograms and was caught off Thistle Island.  Career   Swim with the Tuna  Forster is a director of Port Lincoln-based tourism venture, Swim with the Tuna. Operations were first trialled in South Australia's Boston Bay in 2010 before commencing commercial operations in 2011. The business intended to move to Kangaroo Island, but has faced opposition from conservationists and residents. Proposals to relocated the facility comprising a modified tuna pen and floating pontoon to Nepean Bay have been rejected on two occasions, most recently in 2012. Oceanic Victor (another business for which Forster works as an advisor) proposes to offer a very similar experience to that offered by Swim with the Tuna, located off Granite Island in Encounter Bay. The Swim with the Tuna business was sold in 2015 ahead of the possible relocation to Victor Harbor. Forster claimed that they had held some of their fish captive for five years, the largest having reached a weight of 85 kilograms.  Granite Island observatory  Emma's father Ron Forster built a floating underwater observatory in 1989. Her father's construction was first used in Port Lincoln, where it assisted the development of the tuna industry. It was later sold to Stephen Edwards, who moored it off Granite Island. It operated there as a tourist attraction and educational facility from 1997 to 2004. In 2015, Forster was revealed to be working as an advisor for Oceanic Victor, a company which intends to re-establish a similar facility off Granite Island. The venture intends to offer people the opportunity to swim with Southern bluefin tuna and other marine species, feed fish and observe them underwater. The two directors of Oceanic Victor are also the CEO and Operations Manager of Tony's Tuna International, Tony ≈†antiƒá and Michael \\"Mick\\" Dyer. Tony ≈†antiƒá is a long-term friend of Forster's who provided her with a character reference after she was charged after crashing her Mercedes and recording a blood- alcohol level of 0.224% in August 2006. She returned to the road in March 2007 with a provisional driver's license.  Great white sharks  Forster has co-managed her father's business, Calypso Star Charters, which offers shark cage diving experiences to tourists. Forster's partner David \\"Bucky\\" Buckland has encountered many great white sharks while diving for abalone. In 2013 Forster said of Great white sharks: > \\"The sharks are like rabbits now. They can breed and no one can catch them.\\"  Early life  Forster grew up on Fleurieu Peninsula, where she attended Rapid Bay Primary School and Yankalilla Area School. She undertook a Rotary Youth Exchange to Japan in 1993, at the age of 17. In September 2020 Emma was named as one of the 10 Most Powerful People in Port Lincoln.  Ron Forster OAM (father)  Emma Forster's father Ron Forster is fisherman, land developer and charter business owner. With Rolf Czabayski, Forster founded the Port Lincoln Tuna Classic fishing competition, originally known as \\"The Shootout\\" in 2005. In 2006 he purchased Calypso Star Charters. The company offers tourists shark cage diving with Great white sharks and swimming with Australian sea-lions out of Port Lincoln. In 2007, Forster set a Game Fishing Association of Australia record for the largest samson fish caught by a male fisherman. The fish weighed 25 kilograms and as of 2015 the record remains unbroken. He is a member of the Game Fishing Club of South Australia and owns a boat called Long Shot. Circa 2007, Forster began planning a major residential and holiday land development project called Sleaford Cove. The proposal covers 200 hectares overlooking Sleaford Bay and comprises approximately 350 housing allotments and 50 holiday units. In 2013 community concerns were raised regarding the Sleaford Cove project's potential environmental impacts. In 2014 Ron Forster was awarded at the South Australian tourism awards for \\"outstanding achievement by an individual\\". As of 2015, Ron Forster is involved in the sale of land at Point Boston. Forster was involved in the development of the Lincoln Cove marina in the 1990s. Forster's land development company Sea Marine Holdings Pty. Ltd. was established in 1992. His wife Janet Forster is a fellow director and company secretary. in 2019 Ron was awarded an Order of Australia medal for his contribution to the fishing & tourism sectors.

Biography  The \\"Carlotto case\\"  Carlotto was at the center of one of the most controversial legal cases in Italian contemporary history. The Carlotto case In 1976, a 25-year-old student, Margherita Magello, was found dead at his home, killed by 59 stab wounds. Massimo Carlotto, a 19-year-old student member of Lotta Continua happened upon the victim, bleeding and dying. Instead of notifying the police, he panicked and fled. He was soon arrested and charged with homicide. He never wavered in maintaining his innocence. In the first trial, he was acquitted for lack of evidence by the Criminal Court of Padua but was then sentenced upon appeal to 18 years imprisonment by the Court Call the Venice. This sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1982. He became a fugitive, first in France and then in Mexico, where he was captured after three years on the run and extradited to Italy. A large popular movement took up Carlotto's cause; in addition, a number of prominent figures signed a petition on his behalf including Ettore Gallo, Jorge Amado, Nilde Iotti, Norberto Bobbio, Giandomenico Pisapia, and Ferdinando Imposimato. In 1989 the Supreme Court ordered retrial, sending the case back to the Court of Appeal of Venice to establish whether Carlotto should be acquitted in accordance with the old or the new penal code. In 1990, the question of constitutional legitimacy was raised. In 1991, the Italian Constitutional Court rendered its decision, but the President of Court's retirement meant yet another trial was necessary, during which Carlotto (suffering by a serious metabolic disease) was sentenced to 16 years in prison. This new conviction violated, Carlotto's lawyers argued, the principle of double jeopardy/ne bis in idem. Public opinion was on Carlotto's side and in 1993 the Italian President, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, granted him a pardon. Writer Massimo Carlotto begins literary activity, particularly writing novels noir genre, with Il fuggiasco (\\"The Fugitive\\", 1995), fictionalized autobiography about his time on the run. The book was made into a film in 2003, directed by Andrea Manni, with Daniele Liotti as Carlotto. His most famous character is the Alligator, alias Marco Buratti, an original private detective. In 1998 he published Le irregolari, and the autobiographical novel of inquiry in which is told the Argentine civil war and repression of the seventies, during the so- called dirty war; knows and interview the founder of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, Estela Carlotto, who out to be her relative and seeking news of her daughter and newborn grandson, desaparecidos. In 2001 he released Arrivederci, amore ciao (which was adapted into the movie The Goodbye Kiss by Michele Soavi, 2005). In 2004 he published L'oscura immensit√† della morte (\\"Death's Dark Abyss\\"), a particularly dark and nihilistic noir centered on the theme of revenge, which was adapted into the Hindi film Badlapur. His books have been translated in France, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Czech Republic and United States.

The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, mostly long, wide, linear to narrow elliptic in shape, and with three prominent, parallel longitudinal veins. The flowers are a shade of pink or mauve, and arranged in heads at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter, long and contain up to four groups of flowers in threes. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle with 7 to 13 stamens. Flowering occurs from August to February but mainly in early summer. The fruit which follow are woody capsules long in oval or oblong clusters up to in diameter and long. Esperance wetlands Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca striata was first formally described in 1806 by the French biologist, Jacques Labillardi√®re in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The specific epithet (striata) is derived from the Latin stria meaning a \\"furrow\\", \\"channel\\" or \\"pleat\\" referring to the striated appearance of the leaves. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in coastal areas between Albany and Israelite Bay including the Stirling Range and Cape Arid national parks in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in heath, shrub and scrub vegetation associations in sandy and gravelly soils. Conservation Melaleuca striata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Although difficult to grow, M. striata often produces a massed display of pink to mauve flowers mostly between November and January, making it a showy plant in the garden. It is hardy in a well-drained soil in full sun or in acidic, sandy soils in areas where winter rains exceed .

Early life and junior football Drummond grew up in Mooroopna, a Victorian country town 181 kilometers north of Melbourne. He played junior football with the local Mooroopna Football Netball Club. He attended Notre Dame College, Shepparton. As a teenager, Drummond moved to Melbourne to board at Melbourne Grammar on one of the school's Indigenous scholarships. He travelled home regularly though, including to player with the Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup in 2013. He also played for the Victorian Country side that year, representing the team at 2013 National Championships. Despite strong form in his underage years, Drummond passed unselected through the national and rookie drafts in 2013. In 2014, he returned to the family home in country Victoria, taking up a part-time job at a sports store and playing again for the Bushrangers. Drummond ultimately won the club's best and fairest award for his performances that season. In addition, he played three matches with the Richmond Football Club's VFL side that year. Drummond impressed at the 2014 draft combine, recording top three results in the repeat sprint, beep test, standing vertical jump, goalkicking and clean hands tests. AFL career Drummond was drafted by Richmond with the club's third pick and 52nd selection overall in the 2014 AFL draft. He made his debut in round 4, 2015 against the Melbourne Football Club. He was stretchered from the ground during the second quarter however, after injuring his right knee in a marking contest. The subsequent diagnosis of a severe anterior cruciate ligament injury resulted in a season ending knee operation. Drummond returned to football in 2016 through the club's reserves side in the VFL. He made his return at AFL level in round 18 against at the MCG. He kicked his first career goal in the match, as well as recording 10 disposals. He was dropped from senior side following four consecutive matches however and would return to the VFL to play out his year with the reserves. Drummond finished the season with averages of 9.8 disposals and 4.5 tackles per game across his four appearances. In April 2017 Drummond suffered an injury to his knee while playing with Richmond's reserves side in the VFL. Subsequent scans revealed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament again, though this time on his left knee. The injury would end his season prematurely for the second time in two years and kept him from playing AFL football that year. Drummond's second injury rehabilitation progressed faster than with his first knee reconstruction, having completing lengthy running drills by early December 2017. His summer also included a role change, with coaches shifting him into a hybrid forward-midfield position. Initial estimates had Drummond to return to full skills work by the first week of February with a return to full fitness and selection consideration in time for round 1 of the AFL season. He missed this deadline by one week however, making his return through a practice match in the VFL in late March. After five matches at the reserves level Drummond suffered a hamstring strain in a VFL match against . He missed three matches as a result of the injury before making his return to VFL football in early June. Later that month he suffered a re-occurrence of his earlier hamstring strain while completing a club training session. Drummond returned to training in July but suffered a third hamstring strain in the same location before he could make a return to match play. He spent the back-half of August on light training duties while club officials considered him some chance to return in time for the club's VFL finals series. Drummond's return to full fitness would come too late however, with the club's VFL season ended in the second round of the finals series following consecutive losses to and . He had managed just seven games at the reserves level and did not play an AFL match in 2018. Drummond was delisted at season's end, after a four year stint at the club that included playing in five AFL matches.

The aim of the festival is to bring together local, national and international artists for collaborations, jam sessions and workshops. Every year between 2000 and 3000 festival participants visit the festival, and bring more life to Bod√∏ in wintertime. Bod√∏ Jazz Open brings jazz to Bod√∏'s nightlife, and organizes gigs at local venues like Topp 13, Dama di, Paviljongen, Sinus, Bod√∏ Kulturhus and Syd√∏st.  Biography  Jan Gunnar Hoff at Bod√∏ Jazz Open 2013. Bod√∏ Jazz Open was initially called Bod√∏ International Jazz Festival, then Bod√∏ Jazz Fest. In autumn 2010 it was proposed to change the name to Bod√∏ Jazz Open. This name seemed more appropriate for a festival open to all genres and rhythmic expressions. Bod√∏ Jazz Open was initiated in November 15, 2010 by Jan Gunnar Hoff, Tore Johansen and Erik Johansen. In 1921 'Bod√∏ Jazz Band', with a lineup of 15 musicians, was established as the first jazz band in Bod√∏. Bod√∏ Jazz Open took place for the first time in January 2011, and was a celebration of 90 years of jazz in Bod√∏. Since the city has a long tradition of jazz, it was a natural thing to establish a jazz festival here. Bod√∏'s downtown is small, with hotels and airport easily accessible. This makes Bod√∏ an ideal place for a jazz festival.  Concerts  The number of events during the festival rose from 25 in 2011 to 33 in 2012. The goal for 2013 was not to increase the number of events, but to consolidate and ensure the quality of the festival. In addition to evening concerts Bod√∏ Jazz Open also arranged gigs called \\"After Work Jazz\\". Musicians are set up in different caf√©s, and give free performances for caf√© visitors and others who come by. Marius Neset with JazzKamikaze 2013.

Location It is situated about south east of Adelaide River and south east of Darwin. The property shares a boundary with other pastoral leases including Mount Ringwood and McKinlay River to the north, Bridge Creek to the west, Douglas to the south and Mary River to the East. The Stuart Highway is found from the homestead and cuts through the eastern side of the property. Several watercourses flow through the property including Hayes Creek, McCallum Creek and the McKinlay river. The Margaret River also cuts through the property and the Mary River forms the eastern boundary. Description Currently occupying an area of with a carrying capacity of approximately 12,000 head of cattle, it has an typical annual rainfall of to . The land systems are a mixture of plains interspersed with creek beds bordered by flood out country and boulder strewn ridges. The plains vary from sediment rich soils to gravelly areas with the ridges mostly being gently undulating with areas of steep shale and dolerite. Areas of black soil can be found around the extensive floodplains for the Margaret, Mary and Mackinley rivers and the springs and other low-lying areas. The soils tend to be nutrient poor. The plains are typically open savanna woodlands which contain the usual overstorey of trees and shrubs over kangaroo grass, but with annual and perennial sorghums. History The station was first registered in the 1880s. Robert and Phoebe Farrar acquired the property in 1925, drove a mob of cattle in and chose a site for a homestead. In 1935 Phoebe Farrar was charged by a bull and gored while branding cattle. It took two days for a doctor to reach the station and she was later transported to Darwin for an operation on her broken hip. She survived and returned home soon after where she continued riding until she and Robert retired in about 1942 and turned the property over to their son, Harry. In 1948 Norman and Winifred Whatley and their three sons arrived at the station from England. They soon took over a neighbouring property, Hayes Creek Station (now Douglas Station), and established a store and inn along the Stuart Highway. The family remained in the area until 1959. Tom Starr managed the property from 1984 to 1998. In 1998 Ban Ban springs was owned by Gunter Gschwenter, the Tyrolian born entrepreneur who owned the Britz rental business. The property was placed on the market in 2010, and in 2014 the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others.

The offensive quickly gained ground after the HV advanced north of the Drava River into Baranja. The defending force of the Croatian Serb Territorial Defence Force supported by the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) artillery were caught unprepared and offered light resistance. However, the offensive was not authorised and it was cancelled six hours after it had been launched. An investigation was launched by the HV, and two senior officers were relieved of their duty, before being reassigned to new positions. According to General Martin ≈†pegelj, the decision to abort the offensive was wrong as it meant a missed opportunity to recapture Baranja which had been lost to the JNA in 1991. Admiral Davor Domazet-Lo≈°o pointed out that the offensive presented a significant political problem to Croatian leadership as it meant that the political leaders of Croatia had poor control over its military, or that Croatia was violating its international obligations towards the United Nations (UN) in respect of the Vance plan at the time the country sought to become a member of the UN. During the fighting, and in its aftermath, the JNA shelled several Croatian settlements and three Croatian civilians living in Croatian Serb-controlled Baranja were killed in retribution. The battle is commemorated annually in the towns of Beli≈°ƒáe and Valpovo. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence Force's (Teritorijalna obrana ‚Äì TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. Following the Pakrac clash between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March 1991, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents. In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde ‚Äì ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, and a month later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska ‚Äì HV). Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. Prelude The JNA attacked Osijek, the largest city in Slavonia region of Croatia, for the first time on 31 July 1991, and heavily bombarded the city's center on 19 August. The attacks came from positions north, east and south of the city. By 23 August, the JNA had secured its control over the bulk of Baranja region, just across the Drava River north of Osijek. The intensity of the shelling increased thereafter, peaking through November and December. After JNA captured Vukovar on 18 November, the JNA, supported by the Serbian Ministry of Interior-trained Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitaries, started to advance west between Vinkovci and Osijek on 20 November. The city of Osijek appeared to be the next target of the JNA, which was later confirmed by the commander of the JNA 1st Military District. Later that month, Croatia, Serbia and the JNA agreed upon the Vance plan, contained in the Geneva Accord. The plan entailed a ceasefire, protection of civilians in specific areas designated as United Nations Protected Areas and UN peacekeepers in Croatia. In late November, JNA units south of Osijek advanced westward, threatening ƒêakovo and potential encirclement of Osijek. In early December, the JNA continued to achieve modest advances south of Osijek, while being held back by Croatian defences on the eastern outskirts of the city. The HV managed to contain the JNA attacks, even though the fighting continued south of Osijek until January 1992. Advances of the JNA north of Osijek threatened HV control of a narrow bridgehead in Baranja. By mid-December the bridgehead was reduced to a strip of land comprising suburban settlements of Podravlje and Tvrƒëavica. In response, the HV launched an offensive codenamed Operation Devil's Beam on 17‚Äì18 December. The offensive successfully pushed the JNA north about north of Osijek. The JNA also withdrew from the village of Kopaƒçevo towards Darda and Vardarac, but the HV did not have resources to exploit the development. The ceasefire envisaged by the Vance Plan came into effect on 3 January 1992. In December 1991, the European Community announced its decision to grant a diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992. SAO Krajina renamed itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December 1991. Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind for up to eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Timeline In the first few months of 1992, after the comprehensive ceasefire took effect in Croatia, the command of the 107th Brigade of the HV was tasked with manning the front line along the Drava River. The brigade's positions were centered on the towns of Beli≈°ƒáe and Valpovo, spanning between the villages of Gat and Nard on the south (right) bank of the river. A battalion of the unit also held a small bridgehead on the northern bank of the river, an area prone to flooding. Faced with the prospect of abandoning the bridgehead in case of a flood, the commanding officer of the 107th Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Miroslav ≈†targl formulated a plan to reinforce the battalion on the northern bank of the Drava River and capture more favourable positions in Baranja before the UNPROFOR deployed to the area. Later on, intermittent shelling of Valpovo by the JNA was also cited as a motivation for the offensive. ≈†targl forwarded his plan to the Osijek Operational Zone for approval, which was granted by the zone commander Colonel Karl Gorin≈°ek on 30 March. Furthermore, Gorin≈°ek authorised artillery support for the advance and earmarked the 136th Brigade to support the initial push by the 107th once the advance gained ground. ≈†targl issued the order for Operation Baranja on 2 April, designating the Nard‚ÄìJagodnjak‚ÄìPetlovac line as the objective of the offensive, encompassing the area of so-called Baranja Triangle (Baranjski trokut). The brigade had earmarked 1,800 troops for the operation. The offensive was launched on 3 April, at 5:45. The 107th Brigade started to advance and moved tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery earmarked for direct fire support. Croatian Serb TO units north of the Drava River were caught unprepared, and by 11:00 the 107th Brigade had placed approximately 70% of the river bank opposite Gat‚ÄìNard line under its control, sustaining light casualties. In the process, the HV captured approximately 30 Croatian Serb troops and recovered bodies of another 30 Croatian Serb soldiers killed in the combat. However, at 11:45, the brigade received orders from Zagreb cancelling the offensive and ordering the HV to withdraw to its initial positions of that morning. Similarly, the 136th Brigade was held back and never deployed to support the offensive, while long-range fire support was cancelled. At the same time, Gorin≈°ek was relieved of his duty. The 107th Brigade withdrew the same day. A part of the force was cut off and could not reach Drava anymore. Instead they advanced onto Hungarian soil and returned to Croatia via Donji Miholjac border crossing the following day. In response to the HV offensive the JNA shelled HV positions and a large number of settlements in the eastern Slavonia on 3 April. The shelling was expanded the following day to Slavonski Brod, where the city centre was targeted, while Osijek was targeted for more than ten days after the fighting in Baranja had ceased. On 4 April, the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps of the JNA ordered mobilisation of six brigades of Croatian Serb TO in Baranja and eastern Slavonia, expecting further HV attacks both in Baranja and in the eastern Slavonia. Aftermath General Martin ≈†pegelj investigated Operation Baranja There are conflicting reports about the number of killed troops of the 107th Brigade in the battle‚Äîreported variously as 15 or 16. The HV also sustained 85 wounded in the offensive. General Martin ≈†pegelj claims that all the fatalities and approximately 30 wounded were sustained during the pullout. An investigation into the offensive was launched by a three-member commission appointed by Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman. It comprised ≈†pegelj, General Janko Bobetko and Major General Slobodan Praljak. The commission convened in Bizovac on 7 April and moved to the 107th Brigade's headquarters in Beli≈°ƒáe the following day where it conducted interviews with brigade personnel. ≈†pegelj drafted a report the same day, commending combat performance of the 107th Brigade, but rebuked its commander for the unauthorized deployment of the HV. Ultimately Gorin≈°ek was assigned to serve in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia. ≈†targl was removed from command of the 107th Brigade, but only to serve with the Osijek Operational Zone staff. In the immediate aftermath of the fighting, three Croatian civilians were killed in Croatian Serb-controlled Baranja in retribution for Croatian Serb TO fatalities in the fighting of 3 April. Furthermore, all Croats living in the village of Popovac were interned overnight for two to three days. ≈†pegelj concluded that the decision to cancel the offensive was political one, but Tuƒëman did not tell him why was the operation cancelled when ≈†pegelj submitted his report to Tuƒëman on 15 April. In ≈†pegelj's opinion the offensive should have been carried on and its objective extended to Croatian recapture of entire Baranja, i.e. the municipality of Beli Manastir, which was designated a UN Protected Area under the Vance plan. According to Admiral Davor Domazet-Lo≈°o, the offensive caused political damage to Croatia because it meant that Croatia was either in breach of its obligations towards the UN at the time when it was requesting to be admitted to the UN, or that its political leadership had questionable authority over its military. The offensive is commemorated annually in Valpovo and Beli≈°ƒáe by a procession from the bridge spanning the Drava River in Beli≈°ƒáe to the monument to the killed soldiers of the 107th Brigade in Baranja.

In Taiwan, one custom has been to hire professional entertainers to perform at funerals, such as a professional mourner, to assist a family with setting a proper mood, particularly when relatives were distant or had trouble attending the funeral. The practice of hiring funeral strippers may have grown out of this practice. According to BBC News, hiring professionals to assist with funerals is undergoing change.Allie Jaynes, BBC World Service, Taipei, 26 February 2013, BBC News, Taiwan's most famous professional mourner, Retrieved April 24, 2015, \\"Traditional Taiwanese funerals are elaborate, combining sombre mourning with louder, up-tempo entertainment to fire up grieving spirits\\" Historical records of women stripping at temple events dated back to the late 1800s.Funeral strippers in Taiwan Description The purpose of the strippers is not only to attract crowds but to \\"appease wandering spirits\\" as well as give the deceased \\"one last hurrah\\". What happens in a performance can vary considerably, and may include climbing poles, sound systems, professional musicians, electric \\"flower carts\\", neon-lit stages, fireworks and gas-driven fire flames. One report found that in rural parts of China, there were a dozen \\"funeral performance troupes\\" which put on shows regularly, sometimes twenty in a month, and were paid roughly 2,000 yuan (about $322) for each performance.April 23, 2015, Wall Street Journal, China Says Please Stop Hiring Funeral Strippers, Retrieved April 24, 2015, \\"In China, friends and family of the deceased may have to do without a special form of funereal entertainment: strippers ... a dozen funeral performance troupes offering such services in every village in the county, putting on as many as 20 shows a month at a rate of 2,000 yuan ($322)\\" Sometimes dancers remove bras or panties in front of young children, which can cause consternation. In some Asian cultures, particularly in Taiwan, the impetus for exotic dancing is that the family members want to have a well-attended funeral \\"to ensure that the deceased travels well into the afterlife\\"; in addition, like having a well-attended wedding, having many people at a funeral is a mark of prestige, and bringing entertainment to a funeral is one way to accomplish this. The practice is controversial in places such as China, where authorities have taken steps to discourage mourners from hiring erotic entertainment.

Nikhil Pahwa is an Indian journalist, digital rights activist, and founder of MediaNama, a mobile and digital news portal. He has been a key commentator on stories and debates around Indian digital media companies, censorship and Internet and mobile regulation in India. He is the founder of 'Save the Internet' (now the Internet Freedom Foundation) that was instrumental in successfully opposing Facebook's Free Basics programme in India on the basis that it limited competition and violated net neutrality. Pahwa was earlier an editor of ContentSutra, now a part of the Guardian Media Group. He was named a TED fellow in 2016. Medianama After working at ContentSutra for two years, Nikhil Pahwa founded MediaNama on 27 June 2008. The portal provides news and analysis of the digital and telecom businesses of India. It also monitors the digital policies set by the government of India. Activism When the Indian government invited comments on net neutrality in 2014, Nikhil Pahwa was a notable activist in the debate which helped the government reach a decision in favour of net neutrality. Later that year, when Facebook announced its plans of launching a service to provide free Internet access to selected sites and apps on the Internet, Pahwa was one of its most vocal critics and, being a \\"respected voice in the field\\", he was invited for a discussion with Facebook executives. In 2015, after Facebook nevertheless launched its Free Basics programme in partnership with Reliance Mobile, a major telecom company, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) invited public comments on a ruling on net neutrality. Pahwa believed this to be a worrying development as TRAI's judgements tended to come down on the side of the phone companies. He believed that only a grassroots campaign would save net neutrality and contacted coders, lawyers, and policy wonks to form a movement dubbed, Save the Internet. A website, savetheinternet.in, was launched on 11 April which allowed visitors to easily make submissions to TRAI with their answers to the 20 questions posed by TRAI on net neutrality. The movement took off when a video by the comedy group, All India Bakchod, explaining net neutrality to the viewer directed the public to make their submissions via savetheinternet.in. By 24 April, 1.1 million Indians had e-mailed the regulator not to licence or sanction plans such as Free Basics that violated net neutrality.

Personal life Miralles, son of a dressmaker and an erudite office clerk, was born on 27 August 1968 in Barcelona, Spain. Having studied for eight years at a Catholic school in La Ribera, next to the Palau de la M√∫sica, he decided to continue his education by attending secondary school at the now defunct Almi Academy and at Montserrat High School. Despite his bad high-school records he was admitted to the faculty of Journalism at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), but dropped out after four months. That year he worked as a waiter in Les Puces del Barri G√≥tic, a bar located on Montsi√≥ Street, where he learnt to play the piano. The following year he returned to university, to study for a degree in English, and he worked as a language teacher in a primary school at the same time. After 5 years of apathy, at a standstill in the third year of his university course, he once again abandoned his studies. Having been bitten by the travel bug since the age of 17, he decided to leave it all and travel the world. He lived in Croatia and Slovenia during the Balkan Wars, an experience that, years later, would be the basis for his book Caf√® Balc√†nic (Balkan Caf√©). When he returned to Barcelona, he went back to university once again, this time studying for a degree in German at the University of Barcelona. After finishing his degree, he did a post-graduate course in editorial studies. His entry into the editorial world had started the previous year, as a translator of books about spirituality and alternative therapies, from German to English. After finishing his degree, he was hired as an editor by a publishing house specialised in self-help books. There he was in charge of different collections and wrote all kind of works under a pseudonym. His thirteen months working for the publishing house were so full of incidents that they might, in some ways, be considered equivalent to the military service he hadn't done; in his first novel written in Spanish, Barcelona Blues, he recounts this experience. Literary work After leaving the publisher, he promised himself never to work for a company again. He decided to try his luck with the young adult novel Un haiku per l'Al√≠cia (A Haiku for Alice), for which he was awarded the 2001/02 Gran Angular prize. Since then he has been making a living mainly as a writer, but also as a literary consultant for several publishers and an agency. Other young-adult literature he has published are El Quinto Mago (The Fifth Wizard), with a backdrop of fine magic, Alison Blix, El Cuaderno de Aroha (Aroha's Notebook), as well as Retrum, a young-adult novel that has been translated into eight languages and which is linked to his later trilogy called √òblivi√∏n by the presence of the Gothic-inspired urban tribe known as Los P√°lidos (The Pale Beings). In autumn 2009, he and his co-author and friend Alex Rovira received the Torrevieja Prize for the novel La √∫ltima respuesta (The Last Answer), and the two have also jointly published El Laberinto de la Felicidad (The Labyrinth of Happiness), Un Coraz√≥n lleno de Estrellas (A Heart Full of Stars) and El Bosque de la Sabidur√≠a (The Forest of Wisdom), which have been translated into more than twelve languages. The novel El mejor lugar del mundo es aqu√≠ mismo (The Best Place in the World is Right Here) (2008), co-authored by Care Santos, has been translated into a similar number of languages. Among the adult novels written by him, a highlight is Ojal√° estuvieras aqu√≠ (Wish You Were Here) (2009), a melancholic story full of love and mystery. This novel tells of Miralles's experiences in a band called Hotel Guru, and it is redolent of the artistic atmosphere of l'Astorbari, a bar in the Barcelona district of Gr√†cia where live concerts are performed . Wabi-Sabi, a story about the beauty of imperfection and the ephemeral, will appear this coming spring; it is the long-awaited sequel to Amor en min√∫scula (Love in Lower-Case Letters), which has already been translated into twenty languages. Since 2012, he has been working on the novel La luz de Alejandr√≠a (The Light of Alexandria), which he is writing together with √Ålex Rovira. Activity in music and journalism As a musician, he released the album Hotel Guru, in 2007. After a break with his band Nikosia, which has released four albums, he currently dedicates his time to both literature and journalism, combining monthly contributions to newspapers and magazines like El Pa√≠s Semanal and Mente Sana with his work as a literary pathfinder. List of novels In addition to having written a number of self-help books, Miralles is a prolific novelist; his literary works include * Perdut a Bombai (Lost in Bombay) (2001) * Un haiku per l'Al√≠cia (A Haiku for Alice) (2002) for which he was awarded the Gran Angular Prize * El somni d'Occident (The Dream of the West) (2002) * Caf√© balc√†nic (Balkan Caf√©) (2004) * Jet Lag (2006) * Barcelona Blues (2004) * Amor en min√∫scula (Love in Lower-Case Letters) (2006) * Interrail (2007) for which he was awarded the Columna Jove Prize * El viaje de √çndigo (Indigo's Journey) (2007) * El cuarto reino (The Fourth Kingdom) (2008) * La profec√≠a 2013 (The 2013 Prophecy) (2008) * \\"Ojal√° estuvieras aqu√≠\\" (Wish You Were Here) (2009) * Retrum (2009) * El llegat de Judes (The Legacy of Judas) - written in collaboration with Joan Bruna (2010) Non-fiction publications His non- fiction works include * Barcelona rom√°ntica (Romantic Barcelona) (2004) * La Barcelona ins√≥lita (Incredible Barcelona) (2005) * L'autoajuda al descobert (Self-Help Uncovered) (2006) * Conversaciones sobre la felicidad (Conversations about Happiness) (2007) * and El laberinto de la felicidad (The Labyrinth of Happiness) (2007) - written in collaboration with √Ålex Rovira and already translated into ten languages.

In the editorial, Schurer lectured the judge on a defendant's rights, and called Mr. Wolthers' behavior childish, offensive and harassment. Schurer continued to state that civil servants ought to learn Frisian as recommended by the decentralisation commission.

In fact, although Schurer is known as both a writer and a poet, his body of prose, consisting only of the short story collection Beam en Bast (1963) and his posthumously published autobiography De Besleine Spegel (1969), is diminutive when compared to his poetry oeuvre.

It was first published in July 1994 in the United Kingdom as a paperback original by HarperCollins. The book is about an isolated city bounded by nothing that transforms itself every 20 years through magic evoking rituals. The novel has been compared to Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast (1950), and M. John Harrison's fictional city Viriconium. Ings said that he wrote City of the Iron Fish in six weeks while in a brothel in Oporto, Portugal, \\"on the run from my reputation as a cyberpunk writer\\". Plot summary The story opens when a 12-year-old Thomas Kemp experiences his first Ceremony of the Stuffing and Hanging of the Iron Fish. Tom lives in the , which is built on two steep hills separated by a deep gorge with a marble river running through it. The hills are connected by a bridge. The is located in the middle of a desert, surrounded by mountains, beyond which, it is said, there is nothing. The inhabitants' dream of the ocean, have boats and fishing nets, yet have never seen the sea. Every 20 years Ceremonies are performed to renew the . The construction of the huge fish and the associated rituals are performed according to rules passed down over generations, and the magic enacted changes the in unpredictable ways: streets and houses move, the ground rises and falls. Tom's father is a dedicated follower of the rituals and has access to ancient books detailing their procedures. But the has modernized, and less attention is paid to these rituals, resulting in fewer changes with each Ceremony. One day a gypsy from outside the visits Tom's father, and Tom learns that there is literally nothing beyond the mountains. The gypsies believe there was once a world of oceans and forests, but that it was lost. They still search the borders for a way back to this \\"given world\\". Later Tom queries the gypsy beliefs but is told by his father that they are just stories. To quell Tom's curiosity, he tells him to perform the ritual of making a doll, climbing the huge girders that support the bridge, and placing it at their apex. After Tom's father dies, he enters the Academy. There he is exposed to philosophies on the nature of the , its isolation, and the role of the Ceremonies, which, it is believed, evoke real magic to keep the from degrading. Tom meets Blythe, an art student, and takes her to the bridge to show her the doll he placed in the girders as a child. They argue that if they dream of forests and oceans, a wider world must exist, a Greater Realm in which the resides. Tom and Blythe decide to see if they can break out of the \\"bubble\\", but find that beyond the mountains there really is nothing. At the edge, they see that objects become blocky, like crude drawings, and reality breaks down. Tom observes that \\"shade by shade, subtlety by subtlety, the world was going out‚Äî\\". Back in the , and disillusioned by their discovery, Tom immerses himself in art. But later black-clad women invade the . Originally thought to be beggars, they are gypsies disillusioned by their inability to break out of the bubble. They become destructive, attack artists and their art, and burn books. Disturbed by these events, Tom abandons art, believing that \\"the time for art was past and the time for bonfires was upon us\\". As the next 20-year Ceremony approaches, Tom discovers that Dr. Binns from the Academy, with the aid of his father's books, is determined to save the by reenacting the rituals exactly as they used to be performed. He shows Blythe how to make a new Iron Fish. However, very few people are interested in these \\"superstitions\\", and the new Ceremony is performed by a small band of devotees. But as it nears completion, black-clad women interrupt proceedings by building a pyre. Unbeknown to Tom, Binns plans on sacrificing the Fishmaker (Blythe) on the pyre in accordance with the rituals. He had enlisted the help of the black-clad women, who believed they would be disrupting the Ceremony. But Tom rescues Blythe and Binns is murdered by the women who realise he was using them. Believing that the Ceremony has failed, Tom and Blythe are surprised to see Tom's doll rise from the bridge, tower over the and proceed to consume it. They realise that it was not Binns's rituals that evoked the magic, but Tom's doll that was waiting for the next Ceremony. The transforms and reassembles itself on an island surrounded by an ocean. Tom and Blythe, still convinced that there is a Greater Realm, set out once again to try to break out of the bubble. Reception Regina Schroeder wrote in a review in Booklist that she found City of the Iron Fish a \\"compelling\\" book, and described it as \\"a strangely fascinating view of a terribly bounded existence\\". A reviewer on Novel Reflections described it as \\"a deeply strange book\\", and was pleased that Ings made no attempt to resolve the city's mystery, or explain how the iron fish's magic transforms it. American writer and critic Gary K. Wolfe called City of the Iron Fish \\"baroque and wildly inventive\\". In a review in Locus, Wolfe described the novel as \\"dense with imagery and incident\\" and full of \\"hints and mysteries\\". He described Ings as having \\"a genuinely original visual imagination\\", and said the novel is \\"a rare treat\\" for those \\"willing to enjoy mysteries of artifice and meaning\\". In a review in Vector, the critical magazine of the British Science Fiction Association, Steve Jeffery called City of the Iron Fish \\"a fabulous construct\\" filled with characters equally \\"strange and fabulous\\", all trapped in a \\"desperate fatalism\\". In it he saw shades of Harrison's Viriconium, the ritual observations of Peake's Gormenghast, and Delany's Nev√®r√øon, The work's \\"baroque architectur[e] ... and distorted perspectives\\" reminded him of Bosch, Esher and Miller. Jeffery said City of the Iron Fish \\"is as often disconcerting as it is both funny and occasionally horrifying\\".

Opened in 1661, it was situated on the south bank of the River Thames on a site almost opposite the present-day Tate Britain. In 1728 Tyers signed a thirty-year lease of the land on which New Spring Gardens was sited. At that time it was little more than a rural brothel, and Tyers set himself the task of transforming the gardens into a family-friendly venue by installing lights and commissioning new entertainments. But with one eye on his profits, he left some areas unlit, to allow sex workers to continue plying their trade. Tyers set out a quite different style of garden at his weekend home of Denbies, near Dorking in Surrey. In contrast to the merriment of Vauxhall Gardens, The Valley of the Shadow of Death, as the garden at Denbies was known, was designed as a reminder of man's mortality. Tyers died at his home in Vauxhall Gardens in 1767, and his sons Thomas and Jonathan became joint proprietors of the pleasure garden. Life Jonathan Tyers was born on 10 April 1702, probably in Bermondsey, Surrey, and was the son of Thomas Tyers, a wool- stapler, and his wife, Ann. Jonathan married Elizabeth Fermor (1700‚Äì1771) some time in the early 1720s, and together they had four children: Margaret (1724‚Äì1786), Thomas (1724/5‚Äì1787), Jonathan, and Elizabeth (1727‚Äì1802). Prior to Tyers securing a thirty-year lease of New Spring Gardens from Elizabeth Masters in 1728, little else is known about his early life, except that he had worked in Bermondsey trading skins for the fellmongering company owned by his family. According to the scholar John Lockman, when Tyers leased the gardens ‚Äì for an annual payment of ¬£250 () ‚Äì the venue was little more than a \\"much frequented rural brothel\\". Under Tyers' management, and later ownership, however, the gardens gradually gained a degree of respectability. Vauxhall Gardens The first major event Tyers organised at the gardens was on 7 June 1732. Styled as a Ridotto al Fresco ‚Äì a ridotto in Italy was a fancy-dress ball held outside ‚Äì 400 visitors paid the one guinea entrance charge. Frederick, Prince of Wales, who owned the land the gardens were on, was among the paying visitors. The entertainment on offer was advertised as scenes portraying pieces entitled \\"The House of Ambition\\", \\"The House of Avarice\\", \\"The House of Bacchus\\", \\"The House of Lust\\" and \\"The Palace of Pleasure\\". But the moralistic undertones of the presentations were a disappointment to their audiences; the next ridotto, staged a fortnight later, was poorly attended and a financial disaster. Shortly after the second ridotto, the artist William Hogarth, who had an apartment near to the gardens at South Lambeth, found his friend Tyers in a depressed state trying to decide whether it was better to commit suicide by drowning or hanging himself. Hogarth's artworks were satires designed to communicate a moral lesson in a humorous manner and he suggested Tyers should use similar methods to educate those seeking entertainment at the Gardens. As an art collector with diverse interests Tyers already had a wide variety of friends in the artistic community and he commissioned several artists including Francis Hayman, ‚Äì who Tyers later employed as his artistic director, a role he held for thirty years ‚Äì Hubert-Fran√ßois Gravelot, Louis- Fran√ßois Roubiliac as well as Hogarth to undertake the task of transforming the gardens. The venue and its entertainments were promoted as being family friendly, yet to retain his profit margins Tyers ensured some areas remained unlit for the benefit of the sex workers. Denbies In 1734 Tyers purchased Denbies, a farmhouse and grounds near Dorking, Surrey, where he built himself a weekend retreat. Tyers heard a milkmaid singing near there and arranged for Isabella Vincent to be trained as a singer and brought to London from in 1751. She was employed at his Vauxhall Gardens for ten seasons. The house Tyers built by converting some of the farm buildings appears to have been of little architectural significance as very little is known about it, but the Gothic garden he installed in the grounds became notorious. In contrast to the cheerfulness and merriment of Tyers' Vauxhall Gardens, The Valley of the Shadow of Death as it was known was designed to constantly remind visitors of their mortality. David Coke and Alan Borg, authors of Vauxhall Gardens: A History (2012) have suggested that the contrast between the two gardens may have been symptomatic of \\"some sort of psychological imbalance\\" within Tyers, perhaps even \\"a form of bipolar disorder\\". Death and legacy Tyers died at his home in Vauxhall pleasure gardens on either 26 June or 1 July 1767. The Denbies estate was subsequently sold, and his sons Thomas and Jonathan became joint proprietors of the pleasure garden.

If the change of management from private to municipal control continues to be an ongoing trend, it could mean a complete redesign of the global water sector.

The game is played only for leisure and does not involve serious rules or regulations. It is also called as Tokkudu Billa or Tangidi Billa in Andhra Pradesh and Kunte Bille in Karnataka History The exact time period pin pointing the origin of the game cannot be established since it is a part of Folklore games. However, it is believed to be in existence from very early centuries even being mentioned in ancient Tamil literatures.we can pronounced it as by Nondi ‡Æ®‡Øä‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æø Playing conditions Any land surface without any potholes and other serious damages (which may potentially harm a player) can be used as a field. Generally, it is played on evenings where there is little breeze and players can be free from the scorching sun prevalent in the tropical region where the game is mostly played. Although, rainy season makes playing area damp and potential injury to the players, it is not hindrance to those who are really interested in this game. A small piece of stone, usually a Rubble is all that is needed for playing the game. Rules and scoring Usually, a series of boxes that are connected with each other is drawn with the first three boxes being single followed by two connected boxes and one single box, with the last two boxes connected. The boxes look like a series of three boxes stacked on top of each other (The Top Section), which is stacked on two boxes placed touching each other that are stacked on a single box (The Middle Section) which are stacked on the bottom section of two touching boxes (The Bottom Section). The person to pass through each boxes through hopping and walking with eyes closed without touching the borders is the winner. There are different levels the player has to pass through in order to become the ultimate winner. Usually a group of players of up to 4 players (although there can be any number of players involved) decides by playing Saa-boo-Three on who should start first. The first player throws the rubble in the 1st box, without touching the corners and has to hop directly from the start line to Box 2 without touching the first box and has to hop from Box 2 to Box 8, not spending more than 10 seconds in each box and has to repeat the process in reverse, where he collects the rubble in the first box only with one hand and jumping straight to the starting point. the person who does this step without any fumbles is eligible to the next box. This time the rubble has to be thrown at the 2nd Box and repeat the process again but he is allowed to hop on Box 1 and stay as long as he wants (although most won't take more 15 seconds) as he has conquered that box. The Process goes on until he conquers all eight boxes. However, a person is out if he touches edges of any box in his attempt or he throws the rubble in other boxes than the one which he is supposed to throw. The Players take turn until a winner is emerged. There is high possibility for a person to win without other players getting turn. Ultimate Paandi This is most toughest stage of Paandi and is only played by more experienced players. The player now has to hop through the boxes with their eyes closed or blinded. Recreation This sport is mainly played for leisure and as a pastime. The sport is now losing its sheen with children shifting their interests in playing video games and other street games such as cricket.

Thompson and Walbourne first met during the recording sessions for Versatile Heart by Thompson's mother Linda Thompson in 2007. The band signed to Island Records in January 2014 and released their debut album on 5 May 2014 on the label's Pink Label imprint, the first band to do so since the 1970s. History Background Kami Thompson is the daughter of British folk rock singers Richard Thompson and Linda Thompson and her brother is the alternative rock musician Teddy Thompson. Kami Thompson had been in her mother's band as a backing singer and had worked with Sean Lennon and Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy before issuing solo album Love Lies in 2001. James Walbourne is from Muswell Hill in London and has been in various bands, including Peter Bruntnell's band, the Pernice Brothers, Son Volt and The Pretenders, before releasing solo album The Hill in 2010. He has also been a touring member of Ray Davies's band and has played with Uncle Tupelo, Edwyn Collins and The Pogues. Formation (2011‚Äì2013) Linda Thompson was recording her solo album Versatile Heart in 1997 which featured Kami Thompson alongside Teddy Thompson. Walbourne appeared on the album after being recommended by the author Nick Hornby and first met Kami Thompson at the session, but the relationship was not developed any further at this time. They met again by chance in 2011 at the 50th anniversary show for McCabe's Guitar Shop in Los Angeles, this time forming a professional and personal relationship, marrying in October 2012. In the same year they also formed folk rock duo Dead Flamingos and released the Habit EP. Soon after the band was renamed The Rails and in January 2014 they signed a recording contract with Island Records. Kami Thompson has been quoted as stating \\"our long-term goal is to make the perfect divorce album, obviously.\\" This is a humorous reference to the album Shoot Out the Lights, recorded by Richard and Linda Thompson at the end of their relationship, whilst Linda was pregnant with Kami, and considered by many to be a notable break-up album. Fair Warning (2014‚Äì2015)  On 5 May 2014 The Rails released their debut album Fair Warning which peaked at number 95 on the UK Album Chart. Martin Kelly, the manager of the band, convinced Island Records to resurrect its pink label design for the release of the album. The pink label imprint had previously been used in the 1960s and 1970s on records by prominent folk rock artists such as John Martyn, Nick Drake and Thompson's father's original band Fairport Convention. The album was co-produced by the band, Scottish musician Edwyn Collins (best known for his work in the band Orange Juice) and Sebastian Lewsley. Many of the songs feature English folk musician Eliza Carthy, herself a member of another large musical family (the Carthy's and the Watersons), playing the fiddle. All but two of the songs on the album, including three re- recorded tracks from the Dead Flamingos Habit EP, are written by Thompson and Walbourne. The other two songs, \\"Bonnie Portmore\\" and \\"William Taylor\\", are traditional ballads retrieved by the band from the folk archive at Cecil Sharp House. The Guardian gave the album 4 out of 5 stars in their review and wrote that The Rails are \\"a duo to watch\\". Mojo also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing that the album \\"rings with the joy of a golden history while also pointing to an exciting future\\". Folk Radio UK gave the album a positive review stating that \\"Richard and Linda Thompson established themselves as enduring British folk rock legends...daughter and son-in-law seem highly likely to follow in their footsteps\\". Mojo named Fair Warning as their 2014 Folk Album of the Year and it was a runner-up in the fRoots 2014 New Album of the Year list. In 2015 The Rails performed at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards and were presented with the Horizon Award, which is given to the best emerging artist of that year. Both Thompson and Walbourne appear on the album Family (2014) by the band Thompson (the band being named for all the Thompsons that appear) having written two songs for the project. The album was produced by Teddy Thompson and features Richard and Linda Thompson as well as other related musicians, including Walbourne's brother and Richard Thompson's son from his second marriage. Kami Thompson commented on the project: \\"The whole album is like a family songwriting competition‚Äîit's a bloody nightmare. I mean, what could possibly go wrong\\"? Influences and musical style The Rails have been called folk, folk rock and folk pop by music writers. AllMusic write about The Rail's \\"classic folk-rock pageantry\\" and feel that their music \\"blends bits of Celtic, soul, blues, and folk so agelessly that it could belong in 1974 or 2014\\". Similarly, Mojo write that \\"anyone else debuting in 2014 with an album of early '70s-style folk should likely get short thrift from people\\" but feel the band have the \\"proper pedigree\\", going so far as to state that Walbourne's guitar \\"is as immaculately understated as, well, his father-in-law\\". Walbourne has been described by the author Nick Hornby as \\"an unearthly cross between James Burton, Peter Green, and Richard Thompson\\", describing guitar solos that \\"drop the jaw, stop the heart, and smack the gob, all at the same time\\". The band aspire for a simple sound with \\"no tricks\\" where \\"you can hear everything\\", adding that \\"it's hard to convince people to make a record like that now but the sound is fantastic, it's so direct.\\" Walbourne grew up with \\"a fascination for early rock 'n' roll and roots Americana and was exposed to the music of Frank Sinatra and Bo Diddley by his father. Regarding the legacy of her parent's music, Thompson admits that folk music was formative for her and states that \\"at the time folk was a box I didn't want to be in, and I did my best to avoid it\\". The Rails decided that \\"it made more sense to embrace tradition than fight it\\" acknowledging that comparisons would be made to Richard and Linda Thompson by making a folk-rock record and releasing it on Island Records.

Throwback Thursday can be attributed to any photo in your past memories whether it be childhood, old relationships, past vacations, old songs, or anything that gives you a happy and nostalgic feeling. Origin Like many internet trends, it is hard to determine who exactly started the #TBT hashtag trend. The earliest usage on instagram was by a @bobbysander22.Sports Illustrated attributes the origin of the term to a sneaker-specific blog named Nice Kicks. According to SI, this blog began a practice of regular postings (on Thursdays) of photos of old basketball footwear in 2006, titling the series \\"Throwback Thursday\\". Since then, the slogan has blown up to the point where #TBT has been used on Instagram over 500 million times. While the trend has origins outside of social media, it only gained popularity once major apps such as Instagram began to rise in popularity as well. Popularity In February 2012, Kim Kardashian and her family frequently started using the hashtag which caused it to start gaining traction.

It was originally known as the New Government Offices, and after that a succession of names reflecting its tenants, including as New Public Offices, the Lands Title Office, and Engineering Supply Department. It has been home to a number of government departments for much of its existence. The construction of the building created some controversy in 1880 when it was reported that the Government of South Australia was going to import freestone for its construction from Sydney, rather than use stone from local quarries. The building was heritage-listed in 1978 and 1981, and underwent a major renovation in the 1990s, after which it was renamed the Torrens Building at its reopening in 1997. It has housed the Australian campus of the Carnegie Mellon University since 2006 and Torrens University opened its first campus there in 2014. Cranfield University (UK) had a campus in the building from 2007 to 2010 and the University College London from 2009 to 2017. History left The building at 220 Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga was built in 1881 as public service offices, and initially known as the New Government Offices. It created some controversy in 1880 when it was reported that the Government of South Australia was going to import freestone for construction from Sydney, rather than use stone from local quarries. For a long time it went by a number of names, such as New Public Offices, the Lands Title Office, and Engineering Supply Department, after its main occupants. In 1979 it was renamed as the Torrens Building, after Sir Robert Richard Torrens and the system of lands title registration introduced by him to South Australia and the world, the Torrens title system. In 1993, after 112 years of continuous governmental occupation, the Torrens Building was closed for restoration. Since its reopening in 1997, it has become host to a number of Australian campuses of prestigious foreign universities. Restoration and Renovation left From 1991 or 1993, after over 110 years of continuous governmental occupation, the building was closed and major refurbishment undertaken. After its reopening by then Premier of South Australia, John Olsen, on 19 September 1997, the building was used to accommodate a number of community groups and organisations including Amnesty International (S.A. & N.T. Branch), the Amputee Association of South Australia, and the United Nations Association of Australia (S.A. Division) and Volunteering SA, for some years. Universities From 2005, with the intention of creating the \\"University City Adelaide precinct\\", Torrens Building has housed the Australian campus of Carnegie Mellon University, running programs of the Heinz College. The British Cranfield University ran a campus in the building from 2007 to 2010 and University College London's School of Energy and Resources was based there from 2009 until December 2017. The new Torrens University, the first new university in Australia for 20 years, opened in the Torrens Building 2013 and started teaching in 2014. However, on 3 August 2015 it opened a new campus on Wakefield Street, and no longer lists Torrens Building as another campus. In 2015, the Torrens Building was offered for sale as part of the State Administration Centre precinct by the Government of South Australia, previously having been excluded from the sale plans, but as of 2019 had not been sold and has apparently been withdrawn from the market. Heritage listings On 21 March 1978, it was added to the Register of the National Estate (now a non-statutory archive, viewable on the National Heritage Database), described as \\"the best remaining example in Adelaide of Italian Renaissance or Neo Classical style with a Palladian composition\\". On 28 May 1981, it was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Notable Features The plaque commemorating the centenary of the Real Property Act 1858 A plaque on the Western wall exterior commemorates the centenary of the Real Property Act 1858, which provides for the Torrens Title system of land registration and transfer, developed in South Australia and adopted around the world. The plaque was unveiled on 1 July 1958 by then Lieutenant Governor of South Australia, Sir Mellis Napier.

Built in 1859, it occupies a central position in the city's West Market Square at the junction of Main, Broad, and Hammond Streets. It was the state's first commercial Second Empire building, and notably survived both Bangor's devastating 1911 fire, and its major urban renewal programs of the late 1960s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Wheelwright Block stands at the northern end of West Market Square, at the southeast corner of the junction of Main Street (United States Route 202) and Hammond Street (United States Route 2). It is four-story brick building, which is roughly L-shaped due to the angled corner lot, with a flared metal mansard roof with no dormers except for a single one facing the square. The floors are set off from one another by bands of projecting brickwork, and each have slightly different window treatment, although the number and arrangement of windows is consistent on the upper floors. The ground floor had mid-20th-century plate glass store fronts at the time of the building's listing on the National Register; this treatment has since been altered to have a reconstruction of the buildings original cast iron arched window frames. The window hoods on the upper floors are all original Italianate cast iron elements, with those on the third floor particularly elaborate. The building was designed by Benjamin S. Deane, one of a handful of architects working in Maine in the first half of the 19th century, and was completed in 1859. It is believed to be the first commercial Second Empire building in the state, predating such buildings in the larger cities of Lewiston and Portland. It was built for Wheelwright & Clark, a local clothing business. The block survived Bangor's 1911 fire, which destroyed a large number of commercial buildings, and its 1968 urban renewal program, which also resulted in the demolition of a great many 19th-century commercial buildings.

In August 2014 the United States implemented a series of sugar tariffs on Mexican plantation owners in order to establish minimum prices on sugar. These tariffs were issued after U.S sugar growers criticized the United States for allowing Mexican sugar growers to flood the United States market with a much cheaper supply of sugar. Opposing positions Mexico Spanish settlers brought sugarcane to Mexico, where large plantations quickly began to rise, due to Mexico‚Äôs high native population, plantation owners were able to find a large neighborhood workforce. After the Mexican revolution in 1910 the Mexican sugar industry took a dramatic change and is now run by government agencies. Today, Mexico is one of the top ten largest sugar producers in the world. Sugar is the second largest crop in Mexico (after corn). Sugar crops span 1.6 million acres throughout 12 Mexican states and employ 2.5 million of Mexico‚Äôs people. As a part of North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States enabled free trading of all goods and services free of quotas. According to the United States quotas were mentioned in a previous letter, while Mexico claims that the letter does not take into account the amount of consumption, and that exports were not limited in the letter. If the United States were to maintain their stand on banning Mexico's sugar, Mexican plantation owners would be forced to lay off thousands of workers. Mexico also stands that they should not be punished for being able to produce the same good as U.S. farmers at a cheaper price. The United States Sugarcane crops were brought to the United States borders in 1619 in Jamestown, Virginia. During the mid eighteen hundreds the United States began to import half of their sugar from Cuba, while the other half was grown locally in Louisiana through America‚Äôs Haitian slave population. The United States is the fifth largest sugar producer and also the fifth largest sugar consumer. The United States sugar industry has had trade protection from the federal government since 1789. In 1990 the United States enacted the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, which protected United States sugar producers at all-time high through price support that was given to farmers through loans, domestic market control, and tariff-rate quotas established to minimize sugar imported to the United States. Through the Farm Bill, sugarcane farmers are able to sell the federal government their produced product as repayment of the loan or sell their sugar on the market if the going price is higher than the loan amount. The Farm Bill also states that domestically produced sugar must make up for at least 85% of the country's domestic sugar demand, leaving the rest of the world to makeup for the other 15%. According to the American Sugar Alliance, sugarcane farmers are to face losses of $1 billion due to foreign competitors selling their crops at a lower price then what it takes to produce them. World Trade Organization In 2008 the United States met the minimum World Trade Organization standard of imports of 22,000 tons of refined sugar that must be allowed into the country. In March 2014, United States sugar producers began a petition stating that the Department of Commerce and the United States International Trade Commission were promoting Mexican sugar producers. In October 2014, Mexico urged that if a settlement between the two were not reached they would bring the case to the World Trade Organization. Mexico urged that United States resolve the issue before harvest began later in the year. Resolution In December 2014, the United States and Mexico agreed to get rid of tariffs on imports of Mexican sugar. The United States agreed to enact measures that will limit the amount of sugar they will allow into the country from Mexico.

The Quays was constructed on the site of the old coal yards which served the Albert Basin. An old warehouse, which was part of these yards was incorporated into the centre and is now used as office and retail space. Roches Stores opened their first store in Northern Ireland in the centre in 1999, but this store was closed in February 2003 to make way for a new Debenhams store which opened in October 2004. In February 2018, Marks & Spencer relocated from the Buttercrane Centre to The Quays where a new 30,000 sq ft store was built on the site of the old Sainsbury's filling station. Cross-border shopping The centre has experienced shoppers from the Republic of Ireland, who cross the border to Newry to buy cheaper goods due to difference in currency. This remarkable increase in cross-border trade has become so widespread that it has lent its name to a general phenomenon known as the Newry effect.

History   Formation and Operations  The bank was established in 1863 as the 'East London Bank', with its offices located in Cornhill in the City of London. Its early business was closely related to the East End trades, and so branches were soon opened at Southwark, Shoreditch and Whitechapel. Deposits had reached ¬£495,000 by 1865, and by 1870 the bank was renamed the 'Central Bank of London'. In the mid 1870s further branches opened in Mile End, Blackfriars, Tottenham Court Road, Newgate Street and Clerkenwell. Deposits grew to ¬£1 million in 1877 and further branches were opened at Shaftesbury Avenue and Bethnal Green during the 1880s. In 1889 the bank acquired the failing Bethnal Green Bank.  Fate  Still relatively small when compared to other competing London banks, the bank was acquired by the Birmingham and Midland Bank (established in 1836), which was looking for a London operation to serve its expansion. At the point of acquisition the bank's deposits had peaked at ¬£1.6 million, with paid-up capital at ¬£156,000 and ten open branches. The amalgamated bank was renamed the 'London and Midland Bank', occupying the Central Bank's headquarters in Cornhill. This bank eventually became the 'Midland Bank' and then was finally acquired by HSBC in 1992.

It has been called \\"the first even remotely comprehensive, social history of Western art-music.\\" In the American edition the series was called Music and Society. The studies in it tried to develop the social context of classical music beyond the issue of patronage, as far as British music was concerned. Contents The series editor was Stanley Sadie. The programmes examined the development of music in particular places and periods in the history of Western Civilisation between Antiquity and the end of the 20th Century. As well as Continental Europe, music in Spain, Scandinavia, Russia and the Americas is discussed. The series is not a history of music as such but discusses the context in which music flourished ‚Äî social, cultural and intellectual. The books are aimed at the general reader, and the Preface in each volume states ‚Äî 'We want to explain not what happened, but why it happened, and why it happened when and where it did'. The series was published in England by The Granada Group and The Macmillan Press Ltd. The American edition, with the title Music and Society, was published by Prentice Hall. Each volume comprises an introductory essay by that volume's editor, and a series of chapters by different specialists of the musical life of specific localities. Each of the 111 chapters has footnotes, and a section of bibliographical notes for further reading. Each book includes a comprehensive Chronology, with events listed under Music & Musicians; Politics, War & Rulers; Literature, Philosophy & Religion; Science, Technology, & Discovery; Fine & Decorative Arts, Architecture.

It supplies high quality art prints and products to museums, galleries and retail stores as well as art prints direct to consumers through its online retail site. Production is based in their factory in Newhaven, Sussex. The company was set up in Sussex in 1982 by three brothers Gyr, Quentin and P2erry King under the name King Publishing, as a silkscreen printing company. The company designed upmarket posters for art galleries and small boutique shops. The brothers negotiated the rights to works of art by new artists and photographers, as well as established artists such as Bridget Riley, Howard Hodgkin and Terry Frost. King & McGaw Warehouse in Newhaven The company rebranded to King Posters by the late 1980s with the business developing into other areas including framing and product development for museum shops such as the Tate, National Gallery, Louvre, Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. In 1989 King Posters was making annual sales of ¬£2 million but later that year a fire destroyed the warehouse and resulted in ¬£3 million worth of stock being lost. The company's bank loaned an additional ¬£5000 so the stock could be reprinted and an American supplier, Bruce McGaw, offered to replace some of the missing stock for free, which, in turn, triggered a business deal. As a result, the company was renamed in 1990 to King & McGaw. During the 1990s, King & McGaw's focused on turning to supplying department stores with pictures and posters as well as museums and galleries resulting in partnerships with John Lewis, Next and Debenhams. As a result, sales had reached $35 million a year by the end of 2000. Further developments occurred in 2007 when the company switched to digital printing, allowing them to print-to-order. Pop Up Shop in Soho, London By 2011 the company decided to expand into retail by acquiring the online retailer Easyart.com. Easyart was set up by Simon Matthews in 1999 during the dot-com boom and in 2002 faced legal allegations from Sir Stelios Haji- Ioannou, the founder of EasyJet, over its use of the easy name, accusing Easyart of \\"passing off\\" on easyGroup's good name. Easyart won the court battle when easyGroup discontinued its legal action, saying it had bigger targets to go after. In March 2015, the company, then under CEO and co-founder Marc Lickfett, discontinued the Easyart brand and merged the site within the King & McGaw brand. In May 2015 King & McGaw used a pop-up shop to showcase lithographic posters from the Mourlot Studios archives on D'Arblay Street, Soho, London. Contributions from artists such as Picasso, Matisse, Masson, Leger, Miro, Le Corbusier, Yves Klein, Raoul Dufy and Ren√© Magritte were included in the exhibit. Classes in drawing with artist Anna-Louise Felstead and screen printing classes with Print Club London, a screen printing company based in Dalston were also held at the shop.

He was the first artist to have hung a coloured print work at the Royal Academy. Born in Notting Hill, London, to a Belgian father (also called √âmile Antoine Verpilleux) and a Scottish mother (Edith Verpilleux, n√©e Beard), he was educated in France for two years at the age of 10, but was otherwise brought up in England. He began his art education at the Regent Street Polytechnic and then at the age of 18, moved to the Antwerp Acad√©mie des Beaux Arts. He returned to the UK after three years and worked as an occasional illustrator for monthly magazines. A commission to illustrate the book The Charm of Beautiful Nonsense, by E Temple Thurston, resulted in more illustration work and gave Verpilleux the financial freedom to spend time developing his woodcut printing techniques. His work, including multi-coloured woodcuts such as St Paul's From Cheapside and St Pancras Railway Station, was taken up by the publishers Colnaghi & Co who helped to popularise his distinctive style in the run up to, and following, the First World War. He served with the rank of Captain in the Royal Air Force in the First World War, was mentioned in despatches and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours. Several of his works are in the Royal Air Force Museum. A series of murals Verpilleux painted of 1930s Bermuda that were on display in St. George's Town Hall have been restored after being damaged by Hurricane Fabian.

An apocalyptic song, it serves as a sequel to the song \\"Citizen Erased\\" from their 2001 album Origin of Symmetry. Part of this song contains music based on \\"Nimrod\\" from Enigma Variations, composed by Edward Elgar. The song follows \\"Aftermath\\", which centers on the album's protagonist discovering love. Matt Bellamy has said that the album's negative stories, \\"The Globalist\\" and \\"Drones\\", serve as epilogue. At ten minutes and seven seconds, it is the second longest song in Muse's discography, after \\"Exogenesis: Symphony\\". Concept \\"The Globalist\\" tells the story of the protagonist's decision to become a dictator intent on destroying everything and everyone by using drones. The song is divided into three parts. The first part details the protagonist's origin, as he begins to revolt against the system that didn't raise him with love and made him want to \\"transform the Earth to his desire\\". After the protagonist receives a code, which Muse word-for-word had hid in the song, he began World War Three. A backwards code has fragments from the first seven songs on the album and consists of the lines: * Dead inside * A fucking psycho (from \\"Psycho\\") * The world just disavows (from \\"Mercy\\") * Kill by remote control (from \\"Reapers\\") * Programmed to obey (from \\"The Handler\\") * I'm a Defector (from \\"Defector\\") * Our freedom's just a loan (from \\"Revolt\\") In the second part, the protagonist becomes insane and destroys the world via nuclear weapons transferred through drones. The third part of \\"The Globalist\\" deals with the aftermath of the protagonists' decision, as he bemoans there is \\"nothing left to love\\". Reception \\"The Globalist\\" received mixed reviews. Rolling Stone described the song as \\"a grand hymn of despair with a hot jam in the center\\", praising the song's message.

The canonical novel Barometer Rising (1941) by the Canadian writer Hugh MacLennan is set in Halifax at the time of the explosion and includes a carefully researched description of its impact on the city. Following in MacLennan's footsteps, journalist Robert MacNeil penned Burden of Desire (1992) and used the explosion as a metaphor for the social and cultural changes of the day. MacLennan and MacNeil exploit the romance genre to fictionalize the explosion, similar to the first attempt by Lieutenant-Colonel Frank McKelvey Bell, a medical officer who penned a short novella on the Halifax explosion shortly after the catastrophic event. His romance was A Romance of the Halifax Disaster (1918), a melodramatic piece that follows the love affair of a young woman and an injured soldier. There is also a young adult fictional story in the Dear Canada series, named No Safe Harbour, whose narrator tries to find the other members of her family after the blast. The World War II-era spy movie, Yellow Canary (1943), also uses the Halifax Explosion as a plot device. In the movie, the character Sally Maitland assumes a public persona as a Nazi sympathizer but she is really an undercover spy for British intelligence. Insinuating herself into a Nazi spy ring in Halifax, she discovers a German plot to destroy the port, inspired by the actual events of 1917. More recently, the novel Black Snow (2009) by Halifax journalist Jon Tattrie followed an explosion victim's search for his wife in the ruined city, and A Wedding in December (2005) by Anita Shreve has a story-within-the-story set in Halifax at the time of the explosion. The explosion is also referred to in some detail in John Irving's novel Until I Find You (2005) as well as Ami McKay's The Birth House (2006) in which protagonist Dora Rare travels to Halifax to offer her midwifery skills to mothers who go into labour after the explosion. In 2011, Halifax writer Jennie Marsland published her historical romance Shattered, which is set before the explosion and in its aftermath. An award-winning play entitled \\"Shatter\\"Davies, Trina, Shatter, Playwrights Canada Press by Trina Davies is set in the explosion and explores the racial profiling of German-speaking citizens after the event. Keith Ross Leckie scripted a miniseries entitled Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion (2003), which took the title but has no relationship to Janet Kitz's acclaimed non- fiction book Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery (1989). The miniseries follows soldier Charlie Collins through a romantic affair and his recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder. The movie exploited computer technology in order to achieve impressive special effects on a budget. However, the film was panned by critics and criticized by historians for distortions and inaccuracies. Aspects criticized were the representation of German spies in the city and countless other distortions of historical fact. Jim Lotz's The Sixth of December (1981) also toys with the fictional idea that Halifax was home to a network of enemy spies during the war. The Heritage Minute episode on the Halifax Explosion tied for the most popular in a 2012 Ipsos Reid poll. The event was also featured in an episode of Ghostly Encounters. The Longest Johns' (sea shanty band) has a song titled \\"Fire & Flame\\" (on their album \\"Cures What Ails Ya\\", published in 2020) that talks about the event.

Because of the high cost of attending law school, the ability of graduates to find employment that pays well enough to recoup that cost is a concern to prospective law students. In some cases, law schools have been criticized for allegedly misrepresenting the difficulty of finding employment. Employment statistics and salary information According to the National Association for Law Placement (NALP), only 63% of law graduates from the class of 2015 obtained full time, bar passage required employment. Almost 11% of 2015 graduates were unemployed despite a U.S. unemployment rate of 5%. Over 500 graduates (1.4% of graduates) worked in non-professional positions. NALP reports that within the legal field, salaries are bimodal. A small percentage of graduates from prestigious law schools working for large law firms earn salaries near $160,000. However, most graduates working for smaller law firms, government, and non-profit organizations earn about $40,000 to $60,000. According to IRS data, the average solo practicing attorney earned $49,130 in 2012. By comparison, the average starting salary of a 2012 college graduate was $44,000 and the median household income in the U.S. was over $51,000 that year. According to the BLS, median attorney pay was $115,820 in 2015. However, the BLS data is skewed upward because of the bimodal distribution of salaries in the legal profession and because the data does not include self-employed attorneys. In addition, the BLS predicts that competition for jobs should continue to be strong because more students are graduating from law school each year than there are jobs available. The BLS also predicts that more price competition over the next decade may lead law firms to rethink their project staffing to reduce costs to clients. Clients are expected to cut back on legal expenses by demanding less expensive rates and scrutinizing invoices. Work that was previously assigned to lawyers, such as document review, may now be given to paralegals and legal assistants. Some routine legal work may also be outsourced to other lower-cost legal providers located overseas. Brian Tamanaha, a law professor and legal theorist at Washington University, has questioned the accuracy of employment statistics provided by some law schools.Brian Tamanaha, Failing Law Schools, University of Chicago Press, 2012 He notes that employment and salary information provided by law schools is based on surveys of recent graduates. This information is consolidated and made available by the American Bar Association. In his book entitled \\"Failing Law Schools,\\" Tamanaha concludes that because of the debt loads and job prospects facing law graduates, \\"Many law professors at many law schools across the country are selling a degree to their students that they would not recommend to people close to them.\\"Tamanaha, Brian Z. (2012-06-18). Failing Law Schools (Chicago Series in Law and Society) (Kindle Locations 3413-3414). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition. Lifetime value of a law degree According to a peer reviewed study published in the University of Chicago's Journal of Legal Studies and authored by labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre, a law degree increases lifetime earnings by $1,000,000 compared to a bachelor's degree.The Economic Value of a Law Degree, 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014)Steven M. Davidoff, Debating, Yet Again, the Worth of Law School, N.Y. TIMES DEALBOOK, July 18, 2013Dylan Matthews, Ignore the haters.

POST, July 18, 2013Jordan Weissmann, Is Law School a Good Deal After All?, THE ATLANTIC, July 19, 2013Brian Leiter, Reflections on The Economic Value of a Law Degree and the Reactions to It, Brian Leiter's Law School Reports, July 30, 2013 This is present value, as of the start of law school, and includes opportunity costs and financing costs. After taxes, the mean present value will be around $700,000. At the median, or 50th percentile, the pretax present value is $610,000 and the after tax value is $430,000. After tuition, the median law graduate becomes around $330,000 richer. Even toward the bottom of the distribution, the value of a law degree will typically exceed its costs by hundreds of thousands of dollars.The Economic Value of a Law Degree, 43 J. Legal Stud. 249 (2014) The study was funded by Access Group, a student loan lender. Law Professor Paul Campos criticized the study because only a very small number of lawyers surveyed graduated in the last decade. Campos also criticized the study for not addressing the fact that the number of law graduates far exceeds the number of legal jobs available. In recent years the ratio of new law graduates to available legal jobs has been about two to one. Campos argues as a labor market becomes more saturated, wages for participants in that market will decline, all other things being equal. In addition, Simkovic and McIntyre failed to address other economic indicators suggesting changes in the market for legal services. According to Georgetown University's ‚Äú2016 Report on the State of the Legal Market,\\" 2015 saw a sixth consecutive year of largely flat demand, weakening pricing power and falling productivity. The report notes that since 2008, the law firm market ‚Äúhas changed in significant and fundamental ways.‚Äù Clients have assumed active control of the organization, staffing, scheduling and pricing of legal matters, where previously they had largely left those decisions in the hands of law firms. Despite claims that the value of a law degree typically exceeds its cost by hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Department of Education terminated ABA accredited Charlotte Law School's access to federal student financial aid. The Department concluded that Charlotte Law School did not prepare students for participation in the legal profession and misled current and prospective students. The action was taken to protect students and safeguard taxpayer dollars. Ohio State law professor Deborah Meritt examined job outcomes of the Class of 2010. Her study found that job outcomes for the Class of 2010 improved only marginally five years after graduation. She also found that job outcomes for graduates are stratified by the prestige of the schools they attended. 6.3% of the study population was still not working five years later. Almost 20% of graduates worked in jobs that required no law license. Almost a quarter of graduates working in public service held positions that did not require bar admission. The non-lawyering positions also rarely involved policymaking. Members of the study population held positions as police officers, customer service clerks, parole officers, and government auditors. More than 10% of the study population worked in business jobs that did not require bar admission. About 2.5% of the population worked in non-professional jobs including tennis instruction, office management, lingerie sales, and pest control. Almost 10% of the research population worked as a solo practitioner. However, she found that some of these solo practitioners supplemented their income with jobs that did not require a law license, such as insurance sales, investment, firefighting, party planning, and substitute teaching. Lawsuits related to American legal education In 2011, several law schools were sued for fraud and for misleading job placement statistics. Prior to 2011, law schools typically advertised that more than 90% of their graduates were employed after graduation earning six figure salaries. In fact, these claims were false. Most of these suits have been dismissed on the merits.http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2013/02/nlj-update- on-.htmlhttp://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2014/09/three-chicago-law- schools-.htmlhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OzBU3w89StcJ:www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id%3D1202671671262/Dismissal- of-Fraud-Claims-Against-Law-Schools- Affirmed-%3Fmcode%3D1202615432217%26curindex%3D0+&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us Judges dismissed the lawsuits because they determined that college graduates considering law schools are a sophisticated subset of education consumers, capable of sifting through data and weighing alternatives before making a decision regarding their postcollege options. In MacDonald vs. Cooley Law School, the court found that although Cooley Law School's employment statistics were \\"objectively untrue,\\" the graduates reliance on the statistics was unreasonable. In dismissing the lawsuit against New York Law School, Judge Melvin Schweitzer noted ‚Äúit is also difficult for the court to conceive that somehow lost on these plaintiffs is the fact that goodly number of law school graduates toil ‚Äî perhaps part-time ‚Äî in drudgery or have less than hugely successful careers.\\" Many of the lawsuits were filed against low ranked law schools with poor reputations. Courts noted that graduates could have deduced it would be difficult to find full-time legal jobs after graduating from a poorly ranked school. In December 2016, students of ABA accredited Charlotte Law School filed a $5 million class action lawsuit against the school for deceptive and unfair trade practices, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The students claimed that Charlotte Law School took advantage of their position of trust, and made substantial misrepresentations to current and prospective students, in order to realize financial benefit from the tuition and fees paid by current and prospective students.

He married Elizabeth Benwell (buried 1754) of Henley-on-Thames and they had seven children: * Elisabeth (1734- * William (1735/6-1785) * Anne * John (1738-1775) * Nanny (1741- * Mary (1743- * James (1745- Career James was ordained deacon in 1725 and priest in 1725/6. Clergy of the Church of England Database does not contain any later record of his clerical career.

He was presented to the living of Brixworth in 1735 and remained there as vicar until his death 35 years later. Index to the Brixworth parish register During the latter part of his incumbency at Brixworth, James compiled an analytical index to Brixworth families since the 16th century which incorporates information from his personal knowledge as well as entries from the parish register. It therefore includes much information about the origins and destinations of people who arrived in or migrated from the village during the 18th century. Entries are arranged in surname groups, setting out the relationships of the individuals concerned and clarifying which entries of christenings, marriages and burials refer to the same person. Various additional events that took place during the first few years after Jackson‚Äôs death were added to the work. The book has not been published and its manuscript is kept at Northamptonshire Record Office. Death James died on 23 December 1770 and was buried at Brixworth four days later.

History The concept of a pseudotranslation was initially proposed by Israeli scholar Gideon Toury in Descriptive Translation Studies‚Äìand Beyond (1995). The technique allows authors to provide more insight into the culture of the work's setting by presupposing that the reader is unfamiliar with the work's cultural setting, opening the work to a wider world audience. Writing a pseudotranslation involves using features that usually indicate to a reader that the text is a translation. As some translators have argued, pseudotranslations can be a way of publishing literature that is stylistically different or critical.\\" Scholars such as Gideon Toury also note that readers are more likely to accept texts that differ from the norm if they are culturally distant. Many works of science fiction and fantasy can be regarded as pseudotranslations from nonexistent languages. J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings explicitly claims to have been translated from the ancient languages of Middle-earth, while Gene Wolfe, in the afterword to its first volume, claims that The Book of the New Sun series is translated \\"from a language that has yet to achieve existence\\".

Life He was the elder son of John Haygarth, and was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1801. He graduated B.A. in 1804 and M.A. in 1808. He travelled in Greece from August 1810 to January 1811, supported by a fellowship from Trinity College, starting in the north- west, and journeying to Athens. While there he joined Lord Byron's circle. Haygarth bought property at Holly Hill, Sussex in 1818, and married Frances Parry the following year. By 1824 he was seen to be suffering from consumption, and was treated as an invalid. He died on 25 September 1825; a memorial tablet to him was placed in Epsom church. Works Sparta, 1814 mezzotint after William Haygarth Greece, a Poem, the work for which Haygarth is known, was mostly written in Athens. He worked on it at Lambridge House, his parental home near Bath, Somerset, in 1813; and it was published in 1814. One of its themes is the valuing of artistic achievement over power. Haygarth's strong philhellene reaction to Corinth has been characterised as making it a \\"Tintern Abbey\\" for the Ottoman Empire. The main theme, the regeneration of Greece, was already a literary commonplace, to be followed shortly in Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, which eclipsed its rivals; the reason being, it has been argued, because he knew better the rhetoric to give the British audience, not because he knew more about Greece. Haygarth also wrote articles for the Quarterly Review and the British Critic. For the Quarterly, he reviewed the ancient Roman history of William John Bankes, and the ancient Greek counterpart of William Mitford. He found fault with Mitford's history, as far as the writing went; Mitford and his anti-democratic views went down well with the Quarterly's Tory readership. Against the odds, given his moderate liberal politics, Haygarth was in with a chance of becoming its editor for much of 1823, as the publisher John Murray and outgoing editor William Gifford frustrated each other's plans for the succession. Murray wanted to break up the monolithic Toryism of the Quarterly, while Gifford insisted on a Canningite (liberal conservative), one of John Taylor Coleridge and William Nassau Senior. After an impasse, Murray agreed to Coleridge, who was in post only briefly, leaving Haygarth, already ailing, with a sense of grievance, to break off the relationship. A substantial collection of Haygarth's paintings went to the Gennadius Library, purchased at auction in 1886.William Randel, \\"William Haygarth: Forgotten Philhellene\\", Keats-Shelley Journal Vol. 9, Part 2 (Autumn, 1960), pp. 86‚Äì90, at p. 89.

There are many ancient structures still present in the town built during the regime of Matsya Kingdom. Traditionally in some mythological stories the city is believed to be associated with the mythology of Hiranyakashipu and Prahlada mentioned in Bhagavata Purana. Local tradition tells us that Hindaun(Hindon) was the capital of Hiranyakashyapu, father of Prahlada. because of this fact the area is known as Hiranakus Ki Kher. Kher in local language means \\"capital\\". This is further confirmed by the existence of monuments like Hiranakus Ka Mandir, Prahlada Kund, Nrisinha Temple, Hiranakus Ka Kua, and Dhobi Pachhad. About 40 year back there was a sculptor of Hiranakus in Hiranakus Ka Mandir but now it has been replaced by that of Rama and temple has become famous as Raghunath Mandir. Hiranakus Ka Kua is situated in the heart of city and ruins nearby are that of Bharon temple. Langda Bharon (Langur) is very popular in Karauli area. Dhobi Pachhad is believed to be the spot where Prahlada was thrown out from the Palace. There is also a place called Holika Dah where Holika tried to burn Prahlada but she herself was destroyed in the fire. Hindaun is named after the name of ancient ruler king Hiranyakashipu, father of Prahlada. The temple to Narasimha, an Avatar of Hindu God Vishnu who killed Hiranyakashipu, demonstrates the city's connection to the mythology surrounding Hiranyakashipu and Prahlada. Hindaun and the Mahabharata Hindaun is also associated with the era of Mahabharata. It is believed that the name of the city is derived from ‚ÄòHidimba‚Äô, sister of Hidimb, a demon. The Kauravas had tried to kill the Pandava when they were staying in the Lakshyagriha but the Pandavas managed to escape and they went into the then Matasya Kingdom, currently known as Alwar region. Bheema, one of the Pandava Brothers, met Hidimba when he was wandering in the Hiranya Karan Van or forest. Hidimba fell in love with Bheema and wanted to marry him. Hidimba's brother Hidimb, a demon fought with Bheema but he got killed by Bheema.

Richardson President Ulysses S. Grant signed a series of laws during his first and second terms that limited the number of special tax agents and prevented or reduced the collection of delinquent taxes under a commissions or moiety system. The public outcry over the Sanborn incident caused the Grant administration to abolish the practice of appointing special treasury agents to collect commissions or moieties on delinquent taxes. Revenue Act of 1872 In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Revenue Act, which restricted the number of informers who collected taxes from delinquent taxpayers and who received a percentage of commissions, known as moieties, from the collected taxes. This was the first restriction of the federal moiety system that had been authorized by Congress in 1853. The Revenue Act of 1872 was considered a first step towards Civil Service Reform by President Ulysses S. Grant. The Revenue Act restricted the U.S. Treasury Department to contract to no more than three informers to collect taxes from delinquent taxpayers or businesses. The law was initially designed to prevent or reduce the number of false accusations and blackmail by the informers appointed by the Secretary of Treasury to collect taxes.Hinsdale 1911, pp.212‚Äì213McFeely 1981, p.397 The appointed informers were to receive a percentage of delinquent taxes collected.

An 1874 House Ways and Means Committee revealed that Richardson had authorized regular treasury collector agents to reduce their amount of regular collections so Sanborn could receive more delinquent accounts. Sanborn immediately began to collect taxes by intimidation, receiving upwards of $420,000 in profit commissions which he split with unknown partners. Sanborn himself retained $213,000 in profits. The investigation revealed that the whole power of the Internal Revenue Bureau was placed under the authority of Sanborn. During the investigation, Grant quietly appointed Richardson to the Court of Claims and replaced him with Benjamin H. Bristow.Smith 2001, p.578 Revenue Act of 1874 Concerned over the public outcry over the Sanborn incident, President Grant on June 22, 1874, signed a bill into law that completely put an end to the moiety contract system prohibiting the Secretary of Treasury to appoint special agent moiety Treasury collectors.

The available capacity of the power plant is 6.0 MW and is limited by the amount of geothermal steam supplied. In 2010, reconstruction began to increase the capacity of the power plant to 14.5 MW (the project \\"Establishment of a pilot binary power unit with a capacity of 2.5 MW\\"). In July 2011, the main work was completed on installing the unit's equipment, laying additional pipes from the wells of the Pauzhetskoye field and laying water conduits for cooling (total length ‚âà 3600 m).–ù–∞ –ü–∞—É–∂–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –≥–µ–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∞ —É–Ω–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –ø–æ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–µ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±–æ—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –±–∏–Ω–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–ª–æ–∫–∞, –û–ê–û –†—É—Å–ì–∏–¥—Ä–æ (–ì–µ–æ—Ç–µ—Ä–º), 21.07.2011 The new block was planned to be launched in 2011.

In most examples, boost-glide roughly doubles the range over the purely ballistic trajectory. In others, a series of skips allows range to be further extended, and leads to the alternate terms skip-glide and skip reentry. The concept was first seriously studied as a way to extend the range of ballistic missiles, but was not used operationally in this form as conventional missiles with extended range were introduced. The underlying aerodynamic concepts have been used to produce maneuverable reentry vehicles, or MARV, to increase the accuracy of some missiles like the Pershing II or to avoid interception as in the case of the Avangard. More recently, the range-extension has been used as a way to allow flights at lower altitudes, helping avoid radar detection for a longer time compared to a higher ballistic path. The concept has also been used to extend the reentry time for vehicles returning to Earth from the Moon, which would otherwise have to shed a large amount of velocity in a short time and thereby suffer very high heating rates. The Apollo Command Module used what is essentially a one-skip reentry (or partial skip), as did the Soviet Zond and Chinese Chang'e 5-T1. More complex multi-skip reentry is proposed for newer vehicles like the Orion spacecraft. History Early concepts The conceptual basis for the boost-glide concept was first noticed by German artillery officers, who found that their Peenem√ºnder Pfeilgeschosse arrow shells traveled much further when fired from higher altitudes. This was not entirely unexpected due to geometry and thinner air, but when these factors were accounted for, they still could not explain the much greater ranges being seen. Investigations at Peenem√ºnde led them to discover that the longer trajectories in the thinner high-altitude air resulted in the shell having an angle of attack that produced aerodynamic lift at supersonic speeds. At the time this was considered highly undesirable because it made the trajectory very difficult to calculate, but its possible application for extending range was not lost on the observers. In June 1939, Kurt Patt of Klaus Riedel's design office at Peenem√ºnde proposed wings for converting rocket speed and altitude into aerodynamic lift and range. He calculated that this would roughly double range of the A-4 rockets from to about . Early development was considered under the A-9 name, although little work other than wind tunnel studies at the Zeppelin-Staaken company would be carried out during the next few years. Low-level research continued until 1942 when it was cancelled. The earliest known use of the boost-glide concept for truly long-range use dates to the 1941 Silbervogel proposal by Eugen S√§nger for a rocket powered bomber able to attack New York City from bases in Germany and then fly on for landing somewhere in the Pacific Ocean held by the Empire of Japan. The idea would be to use the vehicle's wings to generate lift and pull up into a new ballistic trajectory, exiting the atmosphere again and giving the vehicle time to cool off between the skips. It was later demonstrated that the heating load during the skips was much higher than initially calculated, and would have melted the spacecraft. In 1943, the A-9 work was dusted off again, this time under the name A-4b. It has been suggested this was either because it was now based on an otherwise unmodified A-4, or because the A-4 program had \\"national priority\\" by this time, and placing the development under the A-4 name guaranteed funding. A-4b used swept wings in order to extend the range of the V2 enough to allow attacks on UK cities in the Midlands or to reach London from areas deeper within Germany. The A-9 was originally similar, but later featured long ogive delta shaped wings instead of the more conventional swept ones. This design was adapted as a crewed upper stage for the A-9/A-10 intercontinental missile, which would glide from a point over the Atlantic with just enough range to bomb New York before the pilot bailed out. Post- war development X-20 Dyna Soar is the project that has come closest to actually building a crewed boost-glide vehicle. This illustration shows the Dyna Soar during reentry. In the immediate post-war era, Soviet rocket engineer Aleksei Isaev found a copy of an updated August 1944 report on the Silbervogel concept. He had the paper translated to Russian, and it eventually came to the attention of Joseph Stalin who was intensely interested in the concept of an antipodal bomber. In 1946, he sent his son Vasily Stalin and scientist Grigori Tokaty, who had also worked on winged rockets before the war, to visit S√§nger and Irene Bredt in Paris and attempt to convince them to join a new effort in the Soviet Union. S√§nger and Bredt turned down the invitation. In November 1946, the Soviets formed the NII-1 design bureau under Mstislav Keldysh to develop their own version without S√§nger and Bredt. Their early work convinced them to convert from a rocket powered hypersonic skip- glide concept to a ramjet powered supersonic cruise missile, not unlike the Navaho being developed in the United States during the same period. Development continued for a time as the Keldysh bomber, but improvements in conventional ballistic missiles ultimately rendered the project unnecessary. In the United States, the skip-glide concept was advocated by many of the German scientists who moved there, primarily Walter Dornberger and Krafft Ehricke at Bell Aircraft. In 1952, Bell proposed a bomber concept that was essentially a vertical launch version of Silbervogel known as Bomi. This led to a number of follow-on concepts during the 1950s, including Robo, Hywards, Brass Bell, and ultimately the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar. Earlier designs were generally bombers, while later models were aimed at reconnaissance or other roles. Dornberger and Ehricke also collaborated on a 1955 Popular Science article pitching the idea for airliner use. The introduction of successful intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the offensive role ended any interest in the skip-glide bomber concepts, as did the reconnaissance satellite for the spyplane roles. The X-20 space fighter saw continued interest through the 1960s, but was ultimately the victim of budget cuts; after another review in March 1963, Robert McNamara canceled the program in December, noting that after $400 million had been spent they still had no mission for it to fulfill. Missile use Through the 1960s, the skip-glide concept saw interest not as a way to extend range, which was no longer a concern with modern missiles, but as the basis for maneuverable reentry vehicles for ICBMs. The primary goal was to have the RV change its path during reentry so that anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) would not be able to track their movements rapidly enough for a successful interception. The first known example was the Alpha Draco tests of 1959, followed by the Boost Glide Reentry Vehicle (BGRV) test series, ASSET and PRIME. This research was eventually put to use in the Pershing II's MARV reentry vehicle. In this case, there is no extended gliding phase; the warhead uses lift only for short periods to adjust its trajectory. This is used late in the reentry process, combining data from a Singer Kearfott inertial navigation system with a Goodyear Aerospace active radar. Similar concepts have been developed for most nuclear-armed nations' theatre ballistic missiles. The Soviet Union had also invested some effort in the development of MARV to avoid US ABMs, but the closure of the US defenses in the 1970s meant there was no reason to continue this program. Things changed in the 2000s with the introduction of the US's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, which led Russia to reanimate this work. The vehicle, referred to as Object 4202 in the Soviet era, was reported in October 2016 to have had a successful test. The system was revealed publicly on 1 March 2018 as the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) Avangard (; ), which officially entered active service as an ICBM payload on 27 December 2019. Vladimir Putin announced that Avangard had entered serial production, claiming that its maneuvrability makes it invulnerable to all current missile defences. China has also developed a boost-glide warhead, the DF-ZF (known to US intelligence as \\"WU-14\\"). In contrast to the US and Russian MARV designs, the DF-ZF's primary goal is to use boost-glide to extend range while flying at lower altitudes than would be used to reach the same target using a purely ballistic path. This is intended to keep it out of the sight of the US Navy's Aegis Combat System radars as long as possible, and thereby decrease the time that system has to respond to an attack. DF-ZF was officially unveiled on 1 October 2019. Similar efforts by Russia led to the Kholod and GLL-8 Igla hypersonic test projects, and more recently the Yu-71 hypersonic glide vehicle which can be carried by RS-28 Sarmat.http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/680167/Russia-tests- Yu74-hypersonic-nuclear-glider-capable-carrying-24-atomic-warheads Boost-glide became the topic of some interest as a possible solution to the US Prompt Global Strike (PGS) requirement, which seeks a weapon that can hit a target anywhere on the Earth within one hour of launch from the United States. PGS does not define the mode of operation, and current studies include Advanced Hypersonic Weapon boost-glide warhead, Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic aircraft, and submarine-launched missiles. Lockheed Martin is developing this concept as the hypersonic AGM-183A ARRW. =Countermeasures= Boost-glide weapons are generally designed to avoid existing missile defense systems, either by continually maneuvering or by flying at lower altitudes to reduce warning time. This generally makes such weapons easier to intercept using defensive systems intended for lower-altitude \\"low-tier\\" targets. Flying at lower speeds than short-range ballistic missile warheads makes them easier to attack. Those that approach with very low terminal attack profiles are even subject to attack by modern hypervelocity guns and railguns. However, Russian sources claim that its Avangard HGV travels at Mach 27 and \\"constantly changes its course and altitude while it flies through the atmosphere, chaotically zigzagging on its path to its target, making it impossible to predict the weapon's location\\", thus making it supposedly \\"invulnerable to interception\\". Reentry vehicle use The technique was used by the Soviet Zond series of circumlunar spacecraft, which used one skip before landing. In this case a true skip was required in order to allow the spacecraft to reach the higher- latitude landing areas. Zond 6, Zond 7 and Zond 8 made successful skip entries, although Zond 5 did not.http://www.astronautix.com/l/lunarl1.htmlThe Soviet Space Race with Apollo, Asif Siddiqi, pages 655 and 656 The Chang'e 5-T1, which flew mission profiles similar to Zond, also used this technique. The Apollo Command Module used a skip-like concept to lower the heating loads on the vehicle by extending the re-entry time, but the spacecraft did not leave the atmosphere again and there has been considerable debate whether this makes it a true skip profile. NASA referred to it simply as \\"lifting entry\\". A true multi-skip profile was considered as part of the Apollo Skip Guidance concept, but this was not used on any crewed flights. The concept continues to appear on more modern vehicles like the Orion spacecraft, using onboard computers.  Flight mechanics  Using simplified equations of motion and assuming that during the atmospheric flight both drag and lift forces will be much larger than the gravity force acting on the vehicle, the following analytical relations for a skip reentry flight can be derived: gamma_F = -gamma_E Where gamma is the flightpath angle relative to the local horizontal, the subscript E indicates the conditions at the start of the entry and the subscript F indicates the conditions at the end of the entry flight. The velocity V before and after the entry can be derived to relate as follows: frac{V_F}{V_E} = e^{frac{2 gamma_E}{L/D}} Where L/D equals the lift-to- drag ratio of the vehicle.

Early life and family Felix-Emmanuel Callet was born in Paris, the son of Antoine Callet (1755‚Äì1850), architect of civil buildings and highways of the city of Paris, known for his biographical works on French architects of the sixteenth century and his rich collection of books and antiques, amassed at his house in the Rue de la P√©pini√®re and completed by his son. Felix was the elder brother of Adolphe Apollodorus Callet (1799‚Äì1831), historical painter and cousin of Antoine-Fran√ßois Callet (1799‚Äì1850), also an architect (not to be confused with the painter of the same name). Education Felix Callet was admitted to the School of Fine Arts in 1809. A pupil of his father and Pierre- Jules Delespine, he won the Grande m√©daille d'√©mulation in 1818 and achieved first class in 1819. He finished second in the Prix de Rome in 1818 with the topic: \\"a public promenade\\" before winning the Grand Prix the following year with his subject \\"a cemetery\\", tied with Jean-Baptiste Lesueur. Resident at the Villa Medici, his time in Rome included a project for reconstruction of the Forum of Pompeii in 1822. In collaboration with Lesueur, he published a book entitled Architecture italienne, ou palais, maisons et autres √©difices de l'Italie moderne, of which some plates were exhibited at the Salon of 1827. Career He was appointed architect for the city of Paris and taught his art to future architects. The architects Adolphe Azemard, Lucien-Dieudonn√© Bessi√®res, Amant Constant-Mathurin Chalange, Jules Duru, Laurent-Amable Fauconnier, Jean Charles Geslin, Jean Jordan, Jean-Jacques Mellerio, Louis- Alphonse Nassau, Leon Ohnet, Pierre-Christophe Quinegagne, Jacques-Alfred Ruelle, Fran√ßois-Alexandre-Tingry Lehuby and Victor Nicolas Vollier, were all taught by Felix Callet or possibly his father. Felix Callet was one of the founding members of the Soci√©t√© centrale des architectes in 1840. Halles centrales In 1845, he partnered with Victor Baltard, who had been working for two years on the proposed new central market, Les Halles. After the first plan was presented in 1848, the two architects accepted a new project, whose works commenced in 1851. Their part of an outdoor stone structure bearing a type of metal frame in the style of Polonceau however was quickly criticised, by Hector Horeau, who called for a project that did not hide the metal, and by those who scoffed at the massive aspect of this \\"Fortress Halles\\". Work stopped in 1853 and the first pavilion was finally dismantled in 1866. A new project more in line with the wishes of the administration, with visible metal structures and simple brick fillings instead of stone fa√ßades, was proposed by the two architects between the end of 1853 and the beginning of 1854. The first two pavilions (demolished in 1972) were inaugurated in October 1857, three years after the death of Callet, Baltard continuing the work until 1874. Grandson of the architect, politician Marcel Habert demanded in 1912 that covered walkways in the central Halles should be named in Callet's honour.

Now in the Allen Memorial Art Museum of Oberlin, Ohio, the piece depicts the Roman Catholic subject of Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene, after Irene of Rome and her maid rescued him following his attempted martyrdom by the Roman authorities. An exemplary piece of the Italianate Baroque tendency in Dutch Golden Age painting, the painting employs dramatic uses of light and skillful chiaroscuro to depict its religious subject, evidence of influence from Caravaggio and Ter Brugghen's fellow Utrecht Caravaggisti. It was described by Seymour Slive as ter Brugghen's \\"masterpiece\\": \\"the large, full, forms of the group have been knit together into a magnificent design, and what could have been hard and sculptural is remarkably softened by the soft, silvery light which plays over Sebastian's half-dead, olive-grey body as well as the reds, creamy whites, and plum colours worn by the women who tend the saint\\".Slive, 22 Provenance The piece is recorded in the collection of Pieter Eris in Amsterdam during the 1660s. Its full provenance remains speculation; perhaps it was intended for a charitable institution where the sick were cared for, such as those with the plague which became prevalent in the Netherlands around the 1600s. Others supposed it was intended for a hidden church or private chapel, and then later reached the art market. It has also been suggested that the painting was commissioned by a schutterij (militia company) though this idea has generally been dismissed. It seems most likely to have been commissioned by Catholics, as the subject is virtually specific to Counter-Reformation art, though Ter Brugghen was himself Protestant. The painting eventually found its way to a Frederick Mont, from whom the painting was purchased by Oberlin College in 1953. The piece has been exhibited in the Washington, D.C.'s National Gallery of Art, Utrecht's Centraal Museum and New York's The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene was a mainly 17th-century subject, though found in predella scenes as early as the 15th century.Boeckl, p. 77 It was painted by Georges de La Tour, Trophime Bigot (four times), Jusepe de Ribera,. and others. It may have been a deliberate attempt by the Church to get away from the usual single nude treatment of the subject, which is already recorded in Vasari as sometimes arousing inappropriate thoughts among female churchgoers.Barker, 117 The Baroque artists usually treated it as a nocturnal chiaroscuro scene, illuminated by a single candle, torch or lantern, in the style fashionable in the first half of the 17th century, and typically set it in an interior, after Sebastian has been carried away. Ter Brugghen's outside setting and choice of the earlier moment are unusual, though shared by the treatment of the subject by Dirck van Baburen. Subject Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene and her Maid by Dirck van Baburen. Oil on canvas. 1615. Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid. This painting depicts Sebastian, slumped in pain as he is tended to by Saint Irene and her maid. According to the traditional story, the Emperor Diocletian, in the Diocletianic Persecution, has the soldier Sebastian shot by archers as punishment for his treason. Looking for his body to bury, Irene found Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and miraculously alive, then nursed him back to health. Rather than painting the scene of Sebastian being shot with arrows, in the midst of his attempted execution, Ter Brugghen chooses to show the moments afterwards where Irene and her maid untie him from the tree. Some attribute this narrative shift to the emergence of the plague within Utrecht in the 1620s: several artists desiring a subject saved from agony, turn to painting the rescue of the Catholicism's personification of suffering. Ter Brugghen's depicts Sebastian with a sickly green pallor, his limp body lying in suffering and resembling much of the diseased or dead one would encounter in Utrecht at the time. Formal Elements Composition A diagonal line spans the length of the canvas from the top left corner to the bottom right. It stretches down Saint Sebastian's tense arm, across his body and down to his feet, an arrow protruding from the center of his chest continuing the form. Sebastian's lifeless right hand in the air forms a triangular shape at one end of the line with the hands of Irene's maid, at balance with Sebastian's feet and left hand that touches the ground in the opposite corner. At the apex is Irene and Sebastian's faces in the foreground, turned away from each other with their positions juxtaposed, highlighting their symbolic relationship and them as the painting's prime focus. Irene's upturned face toward the source of light, graced with a gentle smile, furnishes her with a sense of hope and rescue. It stands in contrast to Sebastian's head, stricken with anguish as his expression is cast in shadow. The heads of the figures create a \\"pyramidal form,\\" echoing the arrangement of trios prominent in the piece. Iconography Irene's curved form faces away from the lone tree in the background, distantly resembling a crucifixion, counterbalancing Sebastian's arching back and posterior. The opposition of these figures is also highlighted by an arrow that protrudes from his leg. Sebastian rests upon the most vivid object in the piece is a bright red fabric adorned in gold, often used symbolically by Caravaggisti like Ter Brugghen to symbolize the Blood of Christ and martyrdom. The tree in the background contrasts the thick tree of the group, its slender and seemingly flimsy form highlighting the tragic ambiance. The consistent use of groups of three, whether it be the three heads in a formation, the trio of the maid's hands and Sebastian's hand, the leaves of the distant forlorn tree in the background or simply the subject of three biblical figures is symbolic of the Holy Trinity. Crucifixion with the Virgin and St John by Hendrick Ter Brugghen. Oil on canvas. 1625. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Ter Brugghen subtly imbues the association of the figures in this piece through both disparity and similarity of their hands. Sebastian's left hand, free of bondage, lies limp and obscured from view, symbolic of his unattainable relief from pain and lack of freedom. Irene's left hand rests on his chest, above his heart and provides support in a benevolent embrace, forming their relationship in the composition as one who tends to the other in suffering. The triangular form in the top left corner represents the connection between the maid and Sebastian; as Stechow describes it, \\"‚Ä¶the lifeless flesh of Sebastian's right hand yields to the pressure of the rope while the left hand of Irene's servant reacts to the same pressure with lively resilience.\\" The servant's right hand is pulling on the tight ropes on Sebastian's wrist, attempting to undo them. She touches her forefinger and thumb together, the same gesture Irene uses with her right hand to pull an arrow from Sebastian's lower torso. Together, these two women parallel each other in hand gesture and action, both trying to remove a source of Sebastian's pain. Interpretation Had this painting been truly intended for an institution dedicated to healing the sick and afflicted with plague or hidden church, it is interesting to see how Ter Brugghen constructs this composition for its audience. Dramatic lighting cast from the upper left corner of the painting and subtle use of iconography such as the tree in the background, symbolic of a crucifixion, delicately suggests the presence of God, perhaps observing the rescue from above. Further stylistic choices made by Ter Brugghen, such as the juxtaposition of his Irene's maid's hands and Sebastian's or the pallor of Sebastian's skin compared to that of lively tones of the maid introduces themes of hope, strength and endurance in the face of despair, as well as alleviation to the afflicted weather in the form of recovery or entrance into heaven. Combining these themes in such a way that it is exhibited in Ter Brugghen's Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene subtlety demonstrates clear consideration for its original intended destination: the plague afflicted, facing their impending mortality. Victims seeking relief and comfort would look upon Ter Brugghen's painting, finding likeness in Sebastian's sickly pallor as he is alleviated from affliction and perhaps encounter respite or be invoked to religious worship. Comparisons Painted the same year, Ter Brugghen's Crucifixion with the Virgin and St. John is accepted to be very similar in stylistic features and perhaps intended for the same destination as Saint Sebastian Tended by Irene. The archaic style of the Christ on the crucifix recalls old Netherland styles but remains in contrast to the more contemporary Mary and John, creating a piece where \\"Ter Brugghen rejects the ahistorical for the meta-historical.\\" A stronger connection is also made between the two paintings based on the similarities between the Crucifixion's Saint John and Sebastian in Saint Sebastian, believed to be the same model. Dirck van Baburen, another Utrecht Caravaggisti who once shared a studio with Ter Brugghen, painted his own rendition of Saint Irene tending to the shot Sebastian a decade earlier. The two paintings share a striking similarity of Sebastian slumping down to the right corner of the canvas, mouth agape as his face is downcast, held right above the breast. Most likely, this painting had the most influence on Ter Brugghen envisioning the biblical scene.

Hall stressed economic development, jobs, and resolving the $1 billion state budget shortfall as the principal issues he would face as state representative. In 2018, Representative Hall announced that he would again run for mayor. In his statement of candidacy, Hall vowed to run on \\"a pro-business, pro-people platform that brings jobs back, grows existing businesses, and makes city government something that actually works. Do you think the city is better today than it was eleven years ago?\\" Mayor Jacques Roy, first elected in 2006, chose not seek a fourth term in the November 6 primary. Hall defeated two white Democratic women attorneys in the mayoral race: Catherine Louise Davidson (born August 12, 1968), who had eighteen years of litigation in private civil practice, four years as the Alexandria assistant city attorney, and three years as an assistant district attorney, and Kay H. Michiels (born c. 1955), a former educator who formerly served as chief of staff and director of planning for Mayor Jacques Roy. Hall won the mayoral election with 7,842 votes (53 percent); Michiels trailed with 5,402 (36 percent), and Davidson held the remaining 1,679 votes (11 percent). Turnout was just under 50 percent of registered voters.

Subtitled a \\"knightly novel\\" by the author, the book received much critical acclaim in Georgia and in Soviet Union as a whole, selling 700,000 copies of 12 publications of its Russian-translated version in the author's lifetime alone. A two-episode feature film The Right Hand of the Grand Master based on the novel and directed by Vakhtang Tabliashvili and Devi Abashidze was premiered in 1969. Plot The story is based on the partially legendary story of renovation of Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in 1010s Kingdom of Georgia by a young enigmatic architect Constantine Arsukidze (stylized as Constantine Arsakidze in the book). It is set during the 11th century and tells of the reign of King George I. George has a host of problems. The most immediate one is that the various mountain tribes, including, in particular, the Pkhovi (Pshavi and Khevsureti), periodically revolt. George is (nominally) Christian. Though he professes the faith and his wife, Mariam, is an enthusiastic builder of churches, he is not as fully committed as either Mariam or the catholicos Melkisedek would have liked, not being averse, for example, to making an alliance with the Saracens when it is convenient. The Pkhovi and other mountain tribes have partially converted to Christianity but are even less enthusiastic than King George and several times during this novel, they destroy churches, imprison and kill priests and put back their pagan idols. At the start of the novel, Lord Mamamze is visiting King George though we soon know and King George soon suspects that he is there more to spy on the king, to see how he will react to the latest rebellion of the mountain tribes. Mamamze has long been a friend and ally of King George, so his rebellion is disappointing. George has other problems. Tbilisi is occupied by the Arabs and there is a continual war in Georgia . He is also at war with the Byzantines under Emperor Basil II, who has taken King George's son, Bagrat (the future Bagrat IV) hostage. But we start with the mountain tribes. Mamamze's son, Chiaberi, seems to be a major part of the rebellion, as is Talagva Kolonkelidze, Dukeof Kvetari, and father of Shorena, who is engaged to Chiaberi. The archbishop is sent to Mamamze's castle where he persuades the assembled lords to recognize Christianity and gets Chiaberi to kiss the cross, which he does reluctantly. When Chiaberi dies soon afterwards, there is a suspicion that the cross has been poisoned in some way. With the aid of his general Zviad, King George is able to put the rebellion down and punishes some of the rebels and pardons others. The rebels will revolt twice more during the book, even though, after the second time, Talagva Kolonkelidze will have his eyes put out and others will suffer the same punishment or be executed. King George, prompted by his wife and the archbishop, is a keen builder of churches, a task made more difficult by regular earthquakes. His chief architect is Parsman the Persian, who is not Persian. Parsman has had a colourful life. He was originally Georgian but when his father was killed after revolting against the king (father and predecessor of George I, ‚Äî Bagrat III), he traveled the world and picked up various languages and religions, hence his nickname. He has faced many difficulties and always managed to survive as he will do in the book when he faces death more than once. But though King George and his political and military problems take up most of the book, the title indicates that the hero is not the King but Konstantine Arsakidze. King George likes to go out hunting incognito, dressed as a poor man, with his friends. They hunt, they drink and they chase women. On one occasion one of them sees what he assumes is a goblin. The others see the same goblin the next day but it turns out to be a young Laz, who is both a good hunter and a good artist. King George is having serious doubts about Parsman at the time and he appoints Konstantine to be his chief architect. He does not have Parsman's skills or ability but he does build cathedrals in the Georgian style, which Parsman does not. However, King George is unaware that Konstantine is the foster-brother of Shorena. In this context, foster-brother means that they both had the same wet nurse. In fact, this turns out not to be true, as Konstantine was the foster-brother of Shorena's older sister but as the older sister died when very young, it is Konstantine and Shorena who grew up together. Problems start when King George falls in love with Shorena while, unbeknownst to him, Shorena and Konstantine start an affair. Gamsakhurdia tells a lively and colourful tale of treachery and military action, of religious clashes and bravery in battle. The plague, earthquakes, wars, rebellions and, of course, love colour this novel and never leave us bored, at the same time, giving us an insight into events in a remote region over a thousand years ago. It is a great read but also fascinating to see the internal politics at play, with the religious clashes, the disputes between the various groupings in the Caucasus (some of which are still prevalent to this day) and the almost permanent upheavals.

The Native American Suquamish Tribe claims the rock, on a public beach at Agate Point on the shore of Agate Passage, as part of their heritage. The exact date the petroglyphs were carved is unknown but is estimated to be around 1000 BCE to 400 or 500 CE, the latest date being when labrets (worn by one of the petroglyph figures) were no longer used by Coast Salish peoples. Haleets is the Coast Salish name of the rock, also transcribed as Halelos, Xalelos and Xalilc, meaning \\"marked face\\". It is known in English as Figurehead Rock. Its purpose is unknown but the Suquamish Museum curator and archivist Charlie Sigo has stated that it may have been a boundary marker. An amateur astronomer has proposed a theory that it has a calendrical function (see Archaeoastronomy). The rock is tall and long. It sits about offshore, and has been marked with chiseled and drilled coast survey features since 1856, and a bronze geodetic mark was placed on it in 1934. Some sources say that the rock is one of three prominent Salish Sea petroglyphs that were always on the shoreline, but tectonic activity around the Seattle Fault may have put Haleets in the intertidal zone.

He is the son of the engineer Aron Kogan, who became known in the 1950s and 1960s for the design and construction of large buildings in S√£o Paulo, such as Edificio S√£o Vito and Edificio Mirante do Vale. During the onset of his carecer, Marcio divided his time between cinema and architecture in partnership with Isay Weinfeld, his friend from university. In 1988, the duo produced a feature-film called ‚ÄúFire and Passion‚Äù, and, between 1995 and 2004, they did 5 exhibitions together about architecture and humor. In 2001, Marcio Kogan's Office changed its name to Studio MK27 and since then has gained greater international projection. Currently, besides his working in Brazil, he is also working on projects in Peru, Uruguay, Chile, United States, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, India, Israel and Indonesia. In 2011, Kogan was selected to be an Honorary Member of the American Institute of Architecture (AIA), for the entirety of his work, in a ceremony in New Orleans. In 2012, Studio MK27 represented Brazil in the Venice Biennale of Architecture, in the exhibition at the national pavilion curated by Lauro Cavalcanti, who also showed an outstanding L√∫cio Costahttp://www.archdaily.com.br/br/01-66243/pavilhao-do-brasil-na-bienal-de- veneza-de-2012-studiomk27 installation. Kogan's projects are characterized by their architectural detail, formal simplicity, strong relations between the internal and external, great climactic comfort through passive sustainability, use of pure volumes and the application of traditional elements such as mashrabiyas and by designing a functional internal plan. Furthermore, he favors the use of raw materials such as wood, concrete and stone. In his projects there is almost always a reference to Brazilian modern architecture, of which Marcio has already declared himself a great fan. The New York Times critic Paul Goldberger cited Kogan in 2013 as one of the main references of Brazilian Contemporary Architecture.  First projects  During the first years of his career, the architectural projects were divided with Kogan's dedication to film-making. Between 1973 and 1979 he produced ‚Äì together with Isay Weinfeld ‚Äì 13 short films in Super 8, winning numerous awards in national festivals. In 1983, the two made another short film, now in 35mm, ‚ÄúIdos com o Vento‚Äù, which received a prize at the Gramado Festival and at the Ibero- American Cine Huelva in Spain.http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia/cinema/index.cfm?fuseaction=Detalhe&CD;_Verbete=5310 Five years later, they launched their first and only long-feature, Fire and Passion (1988),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140053/ with a star-filled cast that included Mira Haar, Cristina Mutarelli, Carlos Moreno, Rita Lee and Fernanda Montenegro. All of their film productions had a strong relation with humor, above all through visual jokes, expressed by the interaction of the characters and the scenario. In Architecture, the principal projects of the onset of his career were the buildings of his office in 1977 (located in S√£o Paulo) ‚Äì where he still maintains his activities ‚Äì and Edificio Ljis (a 12-floor Residential building), finished in 1980. Other than there solo projects, he also did with Weinfeld the Goldfarb House in 1989, which brought references of Vila Arpel From the film My Uncle by Jacques Tati.  The 1990s  During the 1990s, Kogan and Weinfeld designed the Metropolis Building (a residential tower in Morumbi), finished in 1996, and the Hotel Fasano, one of the most important luxury hotels in S√£o Paulo, and headed by a traditional family of restaurateurs of the city. Construction of Fasano started in 1996 and was completed in 2003. The partnership in film-making opened for exhibits about architecture and humor. Among the individual architectural projects developed in the 1990s, the outstanding ones are the Larmod Store and the Uma Store in Vila Madalena. The projects explored the internal spatiality with large ceiling-heights and minimized the use of materials and colors, almost always done in white mortar.  The decade of 2000  In 2001, Marcio Kogan's office became more collaborative and also received a new name, Studio MK27. The work system adopted gave greater freedom as well as responsibility to the architects, who have also now become co-authors of the projects, signing together with Kogan. In this organization, the task division was minimized and each architect accompanied all of the phases of the project, from the briefing with the client until the project delivery. Already in this phase, the Gama Issa House (2002) was greatly published in international magazines. Highlights from these first years of Studio MK27 also include Coser Photographic Studio ‚Äì built within an industrial warehouse in the Cambuci neighborhood of S√£o Paulo ‚Äì and the Microbiology Museum at the Butantan Institute in S√£o Paulo ‚Äì a retrofit of an older structure, transformed into a center for didactic activities. During the first decade of the 20th century, two of Studio MK27 houses won the Record House Award, promoted by the prestigious North-American magazine Architectural Record: the Du Plessis Home (2004), which does a re- reading of the traditional elements of Brazilian architecture, such as veranda, the mashrabiyas and the patio, and shortly thereafter BR House (2005). For Micasa VolB, Studio MK27 returns with humor in architecture, this time in a commentary in Brazilian modernism. The project of this furniture store-showroom was largely defined in discussion on the work-site. The traditional exposed concrete was done randomly, and building elements such as steel reinforcing bars were used as brises-soleil. Paraty House, concluded in 2009, received great attention from the specialized media, winning 10 international awards, including the Wallpaper* Design Award promoted to by the British magazine.  The decade of 2010  This period is marked by the internationalization of Kogan's production and the diversification of the architectural programs. The ongoing projects include hotels in Portugal and Indonesia, and projects being concluded in Chile and Uruguay. In 2011, Kogan was selected to be an Honorary Member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), also given to another Brazilian, Angelo Bucci, that same year.http://www.aia.org/practicing/awards/2011/honorary-fellows/ For the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2012, Studio MK27 produced a video installation representing fictional in the V4 House.http://www.archdaily.com/268852/venice-biennale-2012-convivencia-lucio- costa-and-marcio-kogan-brazil-pavilion/ The Brazilian Pavilion was greatly praised by the international media including the British paper ‚ÄúThe Guardian‚Äù with the critic Steve Rose classifying the installation as the ‚Äúhighlight of the Biennale‚Äù and ‚Äúgreat fun‚Äù.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/29/venice-architecture- biennale-architect-per-favore Furthermore, Studio MK27, during these last few years, began designing furniture, including fixtures, taps and a bathtub. Among the main international awards received recently, highlights include: Leaf Awards with the Punta Casa (2011) and the M&M; House (2013), the Record House with Bahia House (2011) and the World Architecture Festival (WAF) with the Decameron Store (2011), Record Interiors with Studio SC (2012) and the International Design Award with the Redux House (2014). Studio R was selected in 2014 as a finalist in the Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize as one of the 36 projects built in America between 2000 and 2013.https://arch.iit.edu/life/inaugural-mchap-outstanding-projects-announced In 2014, Moleskine launched a supplement about Studio MK27 showing the quotidian in the office, sketches and their main inspirations.http://www.moleskine.com/br/collections/model/product/inspiration- and-process-in-architecture-marcio-kogan-studio-mk27 The book will be a part of the series ‚ÄúInspiration and Process in Architecture‚Äù.

He is currently a member of Brooklyn Rider, The Knights, and the Silk Road Project, and is the Music Director of the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, Principal Conductor of the Greater Bridgeport Symphony, and an artistic partner of the Northwest Sinfonietta.  Personal History  Jacobsen is the son of Edmund Jacobsen, a violinist and former member of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and Ivy Jacobsen, a noted flutist. His brother is violinist Colin Jacobsen, with whom he co-founded Brooklyn Rider and The Knights. The Jacobsen brothers were largely exposed to music through their parents, whose late night chamber music soirees in part influenced the brothers to study music and inspired them to believe in, and later promote, classical music as a party. Jacobsen graduated from The Juilliard School. In 2016, he married folk singer Aoife O'Donovan; their daughter Ivy Jo was born in 2017.  Conducting  He often takes up the baton for The Knights, with whom he has recorded an extensive collection of albums and toured in North America and Europe. The Knights are an orchestral collective, flexible in size and repertory, whose mission is to transform the concert experience. With a collaborative rehearsal process and the desire to promote musical discovery, The Knights have been called ‚Äúone of Brooklyn‚Äôs sterling cultural products...known far beyond the borough for their relaxed virtuosity and expansive repertory‚Äù by the New Yorker. The ensemble has worked with some of the most popular names in music, from Yo-Yo Ma, Dawn Upshaw, Itzhak Perlman, Jan Vogler, and Gil Shaham to Bela Fleck and Joshua Redman. Members include performers, composers, arrangers, improvisors, and singer- songwriters, and the group has many cultural influences across musical genres. Jacobsen has conducted The Knights for concerts at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the 92nd Street Y, Central Park‚Äôs Naumburg Bandshell, (Le) Poisson Rouge, the Dresden Musikfestpiele, Cologne Philharmonie, and the National Gallery of Dublin. Jacobsen and The Knights have returned regularly to perform at the Ravinia Festival in Chicago. Other festival appearances include Caramoor, Tanglewood, and the Dresden Musikfestspiele. Jacobsen led several concerts at the 2014 Ojai Music Festival, where The Knights were in residence, with pianist Jeremy Denk and singer Storm Large. Jacobsen led the Camerata Bern in the European premiere of Mark O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs American Seasons, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with pipa virtuoso Wu Man, the Alabama Symphony, the Orlando Philharmonic, and the Baltimore Symphony, and has conducted the Silk Road Ensemble with Yo-Yo Ma. The 2014-15 season marks Jacobsen‚Äôs first as Music Director of the Greater Bridgeport Symphony and Artistic Partner of the Northwest Sinfonietta. Jacobsen was appointed the Music Director of the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra in 2015, engaging in a five-year appointment with the symphony orchestra.  Cello Performance  Eric Jacobsen plays as a cellist in a number of ensembles. Jacobsen and brother Colin founded string quartet Brooklyn Rider in 2004 along with violinist Johnny Gandelsman and violist Nicholas Cords. The quartet has been called ‚Äúone of the wonders of contemporary music‚Äù by the LA Times and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described the group as playing ‚Äúwith the energy of young rock stars jamming on their guitars, a Beethoven-goes-indie foray into making classical music accessible but also celebrating why it was good in the first place.‚Äù The quartet has recorded extensively and has appeared at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, South by Southwest, and the San Francisco Jazz Festival, among many other prestigious venues and festivals. A longtime member of Yo-Yo Ma‚Äôs Silk Road Ensemble, Jacobsen performs as both cellist and conductor with the group. He has traveled around Asia, Europe, and North America with the ensemble, promoting cultural partnerships and educational opportunities with musicians from around the world. Jacobsen's primary teachers included Harvey Shapiro and Joseph Elworthy.

It is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean where it lives in deep water anchored by its base in sand or mud. It has received its common name because of its resemblance to a quill in a bottle of ink. Description The orange sea pen is a colonial cnidarian, the individual polyps having their own specialised functions. One, the primary polyp, loses its tentacles and forms both the stalk of the colony (known as the rachis), and the bulbous base with which it anchors itself deep into the soft substrate. Other polyps are known as secondary polyps. They include autozooids, which are feeding polyps, being armed with cnidocytes on the eight branching tentacles which form the feathery branches of the sea pen. They also contain the gonads. Other secondary polyps are siphonozooids, which can force water into and out of the colony to ventilate it. When the colony is disturbed, it can pump water out and retract into its bulbous base. At this time it emits bioluminescence, perhaps in order to startle a potential predator. The animal resembles an old-fashioned quill pen. It grows to a height of about and can be white, yellow or orange. Distribution and habitat The orange sea pen is found on the western coast of North America, its range extending from Alaska to southern California. It grows on soft sand or mud substrates at depths ranging from . Biology The orange sea pen feeds on plankton which it catches with the tentacles on its feathery plumes. It orients itself at right angles to the current and can relocate to a new location if it wishes. Breeding takes place when eggs and sperm are produced by the autozooids and expelled through the mouth into the water column. The planula larvae drift as part of the plankton before settling on the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis. The newly formed juveniles are the founding primary polyps of new colonies. Certain starfish prey on the orange sea pen. It can distinguish between the threats posed by the specialist predator leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), the generalist predator sunflower seastar (Pycnopodia helianthoides) and the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus), which does not feed on sea pens. It reacts by emitting a flash of light and diving into the sand when contact is made by the leather star, sometimes behaves similarly when approached by the sunflower seastar and does not react defensively when touched by the ochre sea star.

The series of prints were made by twenty-one-year-old Klinger in 1877-78 and first exhibited at the Berlin Art Association in 1878. They were later exhibited in a mixed technique of engraving, etching, and aquatint in 1881. The etchings are a part of the symbolism movement and hold a story of love, death, and fantasy in which Klinger is most known for. The Paraphrase on the Finding of a Glove etchings are Klinger's first work of narrative sequence. He displays real and imaginary scenes that correspond through dreamlike understanding. Summary Each etching is titled in German: * Ort (Place) * Handlung (Action) * W√ºnsche (Yearnings) * Rettung (Rescue) * Triumph * Huldigung (Homage) * √Ñngste (Anxieties) * Ruhe (Repose) * Entf√ºhrung (Abduction) * Amor (Cupid) The cycle of etchings begins at a skating rink in Berlin where Klinger himself is in the etching and admires a young woman. As the story goes on, people are skating and the young woman happens to drop her glove. Klinger swoops in to pick it up, losing his hat in the process. The glove becomes a fetish item and possesses a power over Klinger. Then the story starts to change into imaginative dimensions in which the intimate and potently sexualized object triggers a series of elaborate visions of longing and loss, conveyed through hallucinatory distortions of scale and jarring juxtapositions.Hess, Heather, \\"German Expressionist Digital Archive Project,\\" The Museum of Modern Art, 2011 The glove torments Klinger because he doesn't return it to the woman and keeps it to himself. Klinger gives the glove personality in the etchings. The glove will get away from Klinger multiple times in different scenes where he struggles to get it back. It also gives Klinger nightmares in the etching Anxieties, in the style of Goya. The glove eventually gets stolen from him in the night by a dreamlike creature in Abduction. In the last etching, Cupid, the viewer sees the glove lying on a table with Cupid sitting next to it. This work of Symbolist art can have multiple meanings. One example is that the glove is a symbol of love and shows how it can be powerful and overwhelming. Also, Paraphrase on the Finding of a Glove is related to and predates Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams.

Background Muhammad Baqir Majlisi counts nearly fourteen pilgrimage books. Of course the phrase of Ziyarat Jamiah does not definite more accurately. Meanwhile it is not such a way that whole of the pilgrimage books attributed to Shi'i imams but the most famous of these pilgrimage attributed to them in spite. There are many famous Ziyarat in spite of Jamiah kabirah such as Amin allah, jamiah gheyre Mashhoura and Mosafeghah Ziyarat. also it is evident that there is no direct to the Ziyarat until Ibn Babawayh. Content We can divide the Jamiah into four parts. The first part started with Greeting and salutation onto pure Shi'i Imams and concerned with in turn with four subfields such as praising Imams in terms of being relativity to prophet Muhammad, guiding of Islamic nations, being the Shi'i Imams as symbols of God's knowledge and generosity. the theme into five main sections divided: * salam (greeting) * Witness * Expressed interests * Because of the width of devotion * Pray and appeal * the reason of width of devotion The first part including five greeting and encompass 20 to 30 features of Imam in relation to his real existence. Validity Ibn Babawayh in his book Man lƒÅ yahduruhu al-Faqƒ´h asserted the validity of the pilgrimage,\\" and also Shaykh Tusi in his book \\"refinement Akhbar\\" have refereed to . Mohsen Fayz Kashani in interpretation \\"Wafi\\", Allama Muhammad Baqir Majlisi in his book \\"Bihar al-Anwar \\"And Ayatollah Boroujerdi in\\" comprehensive Alahadys \\"have acknowledged the validity of the pilgrimage. Javadi Amoli valid document the pilgrimage is a pilgrimage because it believes that the issue of non-innocent is impossible. Many Muslim scholars referred to the text and document as a pilgrimage work to an Imam's grave just as the narrator of \\"Musa Ibn Omran Nakhaee\\" known as a trusted and reliable figures and anecdotal. [13] Allama Majlisi, Mohammad Taghi, Seyed Abdullah Shebra are among them. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi points to the pilgrimage as the best and most eloquent known pilgrimages among the Shia. Interpretation There are many references to the Pilgrimages since the 18th century in theology, jurisprudence and hermeneutics. Some of the interpretations are as follow: * A short interpretation by Allame Majlesi in Bihar * The book of Al Aalam Al lamiah by Mo·∏•ammad Mahdƒ´ Ba·∏•r al- øUl≈´m * A treatise by Ahmad Ahsaei. * A collection of commentaries by Abdollah Javadi-Amoli by the name of\\" politeness of annihilation of those who are approximate to God.

This prosecution was done despite the defendants adherence to Washington State law allowing the growing of cannabis for medical use. One of the defendants, cancer patient Larry Harvey, was not permitted to argue his medical need for the plant in court. Despite this handicap, the defendants were acquitted of 4 out of 5 counts in federal court in Spokane, Washington on March 3, 2015. Background Rhonda Firestack- Harvey, her husband Larry Harvey, her son Rolland Gregg and his wife Michelle Greg, and Jason Zucker were growing cannabis on their 33-acre property near the town of Kettle Falls. The property was marked with a large green cross visible from the air, and consisted of an outdoor garden containing either 74 plants or 68 plants. The defendants had state authorization to grow 15 plants each, and the total number of plants was under the 75 allowed by the Washington State law. All five defendants had doctors' letters recommending marijuana for the treatment of various conditions, including gout, anorexia, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease and chronic back pain from a broken back. This garden was raided by the federal government in 2012, and federal charges were laid against this group. Trial Prosecutors dropped the charges against Larry Harvey citing his terminal cancer. Jason Zucker pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against the other defendants just prior to trial and was sentenced to 16 months of prison time, a reduction from a potential 15 years if convicted on all charges. The remaining defendants faced charges of growing, possessing and distributing cannabis, as well as firearms charges for guns found in their house that adjoined the grow. During the course of the trial, the defense was prohibited from talking about medical marijuana or adherence to state rules regulating it. Verdict The remaining three defendants were acquitted of all charges except growing marijuana, and sentencing was set for June 10, 2015. Sentences *Jason Zucker was sentenced to 16 months as a part of a plea deal. *Larry Harvey had his charges dropped, prosecutors citing terminal cancer. *Rolland Gregg received a sentence of 33 months. *Michelle Gregg and Rhonda Firestack-Harvey both received a year and a day.

Like most sounding rockets, FOXSI flew for approximately 15 minutes per mission and observed the Sun for about 5 minutes while in space. During its first flight, FOXSI successfully imaged a solar microflare in the hard x-ray band for the first time. FOXSI's third mission, led by Lindsay Glesener of the University of Minnesota, had a successful launch in September 7, 2018 from White Sands, New Mexico. This iteration of the payload included a combination of Silicon and improved Cadmium Telluride detectors, as well as one CMOS soft x-ray detector. Two of the telescope modules were updated from 7-shell to 10-shell configurations, and the payload also introduced collimator technology to reduce the impact of singly-reflected rays.

Robertson Chair of Economics at the Adam Smith Business School at the University of Glasgow. He is known for his research contributions in mathematical economics, in particular in the fields of mechanism design, social choice, game theory and fair division. He has written five books and over 100 peer-reviewed articles. Moulin was the George A. Peterkin Professor of Economics at Rice University (from 1999 to 2013):, the James B. Duke Professor of Economics at Duke University (from 1989 to 1999) and the University Distinguished Professor at Virginia Tech (from 1987 to 1989). He is a fellow of the Econometric Society since 1983, and the president of the Game Theory Society for the term 2016 - 2018. He also served as president of the Society for Social Choice and Welfare for the period of 1998 to 1999. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2015. Moulin's research has been supported in part by seven grants from the US National Science Foundation. He collaborates as an adviser with the fair division website Spliddit, created by Ariel Procaccia. On the occasion of his 65th birthday, the Paris School of Economics and the Aix-Marseille University organised a conference in his honor, with Peyton Young, William Thomson, Salvador Barbera, and Moulin himself among the speakers. Biography Moulin obtained his undergraduate degree from the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris in 1971 and his doctoral degree in Mathematics at the University of Paris in 1975 with a thesis on zero-sum games, which was published in French at the M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France and in English in the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and its Applications. On 1979, he published a seminal paper in Econometrica introducing the notion of dominance solvable games. Dominance solvability is a solution concept for games which is based on an iterated procedure of deletion of dominated strategies by all participants. Dominance solvability is a stronger concept than Nash equilibrium because it does not require ex-ante coordination. Its only requirement is iterated common knowledge of rationality. His work on this concept was mentioned in Eric Maskin's Nobel Prize Lecture. One year later he proved an interesting result concerning the famous Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem, which states that any voting procedure on the universal domain of preferences whose range contains more than two alternatives is either dictatorial or manipulable. Moulin proved that it is possible to define non-dictatorial and non-manipulable social choice functions in the restricted domain of single-peaked preferences, i.e. those in which there is a unique best option, and other options are better as they are closer to the favorite one. Moreover, he provided a characterization of such rules. This paper inspired a whole literature on achieving strategy- proofness and fairness (even in a weak form as non-dictatorial schemes) on restricted domains of preferences. Moulin is also known for his seminal work in cost sharing and assignment problems. In particular, jointly with Anna Bogomolnaia, he proposed the probabilistic-serial procedure as a solution to the fair random assignment problem, which consists of dividing several goods among a number of persons. Probabilistic serial allows each person to \\"eat\\" her favorite shares, hence defining a probabilistic outcome. It always produces an outcome which is unambiguously efficient ex-ante, and thus has a strong claim over the popular random priority. The paper was published in 2001 in the Journal of Economic Theory. By summer of 2016, the article had 395 citations.https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=7kaIUXoAAAAJ&hl;=en&oi;=sra He has been credited as the first proposer of the famous beauty contest game, also known as the guessing game, which shows that players fail to anticipate strategic behavior from other players. Experiments testing the equilibrium prediction of this game started the field of experimental economics. In July 2018 Moulin was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). Coauthors Moulin has published work jointly with Matthew O. Jackson, Scott Shenker, and Anna Bogomolnaia, among many other academics.

It is based on Jacques-Louis David‚Äôs 1801 equestrian portrait, Napoleon Crossing the Alps. This painting was chosen by a man who Kehinde had approached in the streets. The basic composition of Wiley's painting is the same as the 200-year-old painting it was based on, and has many of the same elements. The modern painting has a decorative background rather than the battlefield background. It is in the Brooklyn Museum. Background This painting is very typical of the style of Kehinde Wiley in that it is a monumental painting that incorporates brocade/decorative motif as an element of the background. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/arts/design/review- kehinde-wiley-a-new-republic-at-the-brooklyn-museum.html?_r=0Many of Kehinde Wiley‚Äôs paintings, like Napoleon Leading the Army, begin when he approaches a youthful black man in the streets (often from inner cities in the U.S.) and asks them to model for him. Kehinde then asks them to choose a painting from art history books for their portrait, and photographs them in the appropriate pose before beginning the actual painting, just as he probably did with the man who modeled for Napoleon Leading His Army.\\"Kehinde Wiley FAQ.\\" Description of the painting The subject is a youthful black man in fashionable street wear mounted on a rearing horse and pointing upwards. The man has tattoos on his right arm and is dressed in a camouflage shirt and cargo pants. He has a voluminous golden cloak and a saber attached at his waist. He also wears Timberland boots, Starter wristbands, and a white and black bandana.‚ÄúTeaching Source.‚Äù The painting has a decorative, Baroque motif that looks very much like wallpaper in the painting‚Äôs background but also interrupts the foreground a bit, as the motif is painted in front of some of the rocks. This flattened background clashes with the ‚Äúphoto-realist rendering‚Äù of the subject.Shareef, ‚ÄúThe Power of D√©cor,‚Äù 6. The rocky surface that serves as the ground of the painting has names engraved in the bottom left corner of the painting. The names are: Williams (perhaps the name of the subject), Bonaparte, Hannibal, and Charlemagne. There are small sperm cells ‚Äúswimming‚Äù over the whole canvas. The whole painting is set in an elaborate gold colored frame, just as many European portraits of rulers were framed. Similarities between the two paintings The basic composition of Wiley's painting is similar to the well-known portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte by Jacques-Louis David, and the two paintings share many elements http://www.artnet.com/artists/kehinde-wiley/biography. The black male subject of Wiley's painting assumes the same pose as Napoleon does, with the same confidence in his face and similar body language. Napoleon wears the uniform of a general in the painting by David, and while the black male is wearing fashionable street clothing, the camouflage pants and shirt have associations with the military, especially combined with the sword around his waist. In both, there is a deliberate contrast between the confidence and calmness of the subject's expression and the rearing horse's flaring nostrils and wide eyes. Both of the paintings have the names of other military leaders who had taken their armies over the Alps as if they were carved into the mountain's rocky side, with the subject's names among them, asserting them as their equals. Just as David signed and dated his painting on the horse's breastplate, so does Wiley, using Roman numerals.‚ÄúTeaching Source.‚Äù Just as Kehinde's subject did not sit for the portrait, neither did Napoleon sit for David, but rather sent instructions that he should be depicted ‚Äú‚Äòcalm on a spirited horse.‚Äô‚ÄùMunhall, ‚ÄúMyth of Napoleon,‚Äù 5.

He was noted as a moderate; he opposed the execution of Louis XVI.Joseph Thomas, Pierre-Charles-Louis Baudin]. _Universal Dictionary of Biography_ , Cosimo, Inc., 2010v. 1, part 2, p. 290. Biography The Baudin family had originated in Lorraine, but had been fixed since the seventeenth century in Sedan. He was the son of Anne-Alexandre Baudin, lieutenant general of the Bailiwick of Sedan, and Charlotte-Louise Lafeuille, who descended from a family of magistrates. His father destined him to the legal career; he studied in Paris under the tutelage of a disciple of Rollin and Coffin. After law school, he was received into the Bar, but the exile of the Parliament of Paris in 1771 led him to abandon this career. He agreed to become the tutor of the son of General Counsel Gilbert Voisins. Married in 1783 to Marie-Jeanne Elisabeth Terreaux (whose sister Antoinette later married Jean Henri Hassenfratz), he returned to Sedan, where he became director of the Post Office, an appointment facilitated by Voisins.Henry Morse Stephens.

Elected mayor of Sedan in 1790, and subsequently as deputy of the Ardennes to the Legislative Assembly on 2 September 1791 by 168 votes out of 299 voters, he sat among moderates but spoke little.Martin S. Staum, Minerva's Message: Stabilizing the French Revolution, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1996, p. 47. He was, according to historians, useful for his serious approach to social problems. He rarely went on missions, but worked hard on committees, accomplishing some of the real work of reform behind the scenes. On 5 September 1792, he was re-elected to the National Convention. At the trial of Louis XVI, he voted in favor of the appeal to the people and imprisonment of the king until a general peace was reached. Unlike some of the other men who supported this option, he was not a Signatory of the Protest of the Seventy- Three.Stephens, p. 542. Named in Floreal Year III, he was one of the eleven members of the committee that drafted the Constitution of the Year III. By offering the decree of two thirds, he promoted the re-election of two thirds of conventional in the new legislative body. He served as President of the Convention from 24 September 1795 until his replacement by Genissieu on 8 October 1795. During his term, the Convention faced a royalist insurrection and declared the abolition of the death penalty from the date of conclusion of peace. They also voted to accept the Constitution of 1795. His speech honoring the executed Girondins, \\"In honor of the Deputies who died as Victims of Tyranny,\\" which he made on 3 October 1795 during his presidency, illustrated the lasting effect of the Girondin eloquence upon their audiences, and \\"analyses the characters of the chief orators with admirable felicity of expression.\\" It was also the first public tribute to this important group of orators. On 26 October 1795, the last day of the Convention, he proposed a decree of geneneral amnesty \\"for deeds exclusively connected with the Revolution\\" which was accepted and proclaimed. Elected to the Council of Ancients as representative of the Ardennes with 182 votes out of 188 voters on 21 Vend√©miaire Year IV (13 October 1795) and on 22 Germinal Year V (11 April 1797) he again sat among the moderates, fighting both the neo-Jacobins and the royalists of the Club de Clichy, and held positions as secretary, commissioner archives and president, 2 to 23 November 1795 and the 19 June to 19 July 1799 . On 14 December 1795, he was appointed permanent member of the National Institute of France, created a few weeks earlier, and sat in the Social Science and Law division, where with Pierre Daunou, Jean Jacques R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s, Philippe-Antoine Merlin Douai, Emmanuel de Pastoret, Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne, Jean Philippe Coulon Garran, Julien F√©lix Jean Bigot de Pr√©ameneu, etc.Staum, p. 47.

He also served in various committees to examine social and legal issues; for example, he examined the fates of abandoned children in 1795.Staum, p. 59.

After the 2011 South Oxfordshire District Council election the Boundary Commission for England had revised South Oxfordshire's district ward boundaries and reduced the number of seats from 48 to 36. the 2015 elections were the first to be held for the new revised wards. A total of 96,644 votes were cast at polling stations and 13,527 postal votes were received. This amounted to a 66.5% turnout. The Conservative Party won 33 of the 36 new seats. The Labour Party, Liberal Democrats and Henley Residents Group each won one seat. No other party or independent candidate won any seats. The Conservative Party kept overall control of the council, with its majority increased to 30. Summary of results The Conservative Party's share of votes fell from 53.53% in 2011 to 50.65% in 2015. However, as a result of the new boundaries the Conservatives still won 33 seats in 2015, the same number as in 2011. And as the Boundary Commission had reduced the number of seats, this represents an increase in the share of seats from almost 69% in 2011 to nearly 92% in 2015. The Labour Party increased its share of votes from 14.92% in 2011 to 16.70% in 2015, overtaking the Liberal Democrats as the party with the second largest number of votes in the district. But as a result of the new ward boundaries and reduced number of wards the number of Labour members on the district council was reduced from four to one. The Liberal Democrats' share of votes fell from 15.89% in 2011 to 11.93% in 2015. Combined with the new ward boundaries and reduced number of wards, Liberal Democrat members on the district council were reduced from four to one. In 2011 five independent candidates were elected to the district council. In 2015 four of them did not seek re-election. One, Mark Gray, was a candidate again in 2015 but was not re-elected. The boundary revision reduced Henley-on-Thames from two wards which each elected two members in 2011, to one ward which elected three members in 2015. Henley Residents Group's share of votes in Henley fell from an average of 37.17% across the two wards in 2011 to 20.43% in the one new ward in 2015. These factors combined to reduce the number of HRG members on the district council from three to one. Pie charts showing share of total votes (left) and number of seats won (right) In 2011 there was one UK Independence Party candidate, who contested a ward in Didcot. He won 5.09% of the votes in that ward. In 2015 there were 13 UKIP candidates in eight wards. They won an average of 10.91% of votes in the wards that they contested, and 6.48% of the total votes cast in the district, but no seats.

The campaign consisted of a three-pronged attack, with the two main assaults spearheaded by Ahrar ash-Sham, al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra and other Islamist factions under the banner of the Army of Conquest, and the remaining attack force including collaboration with Free Syrian Army brigades. The commander of the FSA 13th Division stated that coordinating with other groups such as al-Nusra Front did not mean they were aligned with them. Within days, the rebels captured the city of Jisr al- Shughur and later on an Army base. The success of the campaign was attributed to better coordination between the Syrian opposition's backers. Still, the operation resulted in a high attrition rate for both sides. Background On 24 March 2015, the newly established Army of Conquest assaulted Idlib city from three sides and after four days of fighting the rebels captured the city and managed to besiege the towns of Kafarya and al-Fu'a. The rebels then attacked the Mastouma military camp, south of the city, but their attack was repelled. During the following days, the Syrian Army launched an offensive on the nearby town of Ariha, and seized three villages. The offensive Rebel capture of Jisr al-Shughur Ahrar ash-Sham fighters in Jisr al- Shughur On 22 April, rebels (organised by the newly created Battle of Victory operations room) launched an offensive against the de facto provincial capital of Idlib governorate, Jisr al-Shughur, threatening to cut off government access to a major highway linking Idlib to Latakia. Other objectives in this offensive were the Brick Factory base (Al-Qarmeed), near Mastouma, and the Al- Ghaab Plain in Hama governorate, where FSA units were tasked with spearheading the cutting of Syrian Arab Army supply lines from the west. An al-Nusra Front suicide bomber detonated a VBIED near the Brick Factory, marking the beginning of the operation. A BMP packed with explosives was also detonated at a checkpoint in the north of Jisr al-Shughur. At the end of 23 April, despite contradictory statements, Jisr al-Shughur was still under control by government troops. Al-Nusra claimed to had sent 15 suicide bombers into the city as part of the assault. Meanwhile, in the Al-Ghaab Plain, a rebel attack on the village of Sirmaniyah was repelled. A car-bomb was detonated in the Sirmaniyah area as well. By the next day, rebels had captured one checkpoint near the Mastouma base and four checkpoints around Jisr al-Shughur, but clashes still continued at a distance of 2‚Äì4 km near of the city. The rebels reportedly also advanced near the city's sugar plant and captured a hill near the Brick Factory base. However, the Syrian Army claimed that it \\"secured the city\\" at the cost of 13 soldiers and denied that rebels advanced near the sugar plant. Later that day, rebels captured the strategic Tal Hekmah checkpoint near the road between Jisr al-Shughur and Ariha. Meanwhile, the Syrian Air Force conducted at least 40 airstrikes in Idlib. Later, an opposition source reported that the rebels controlled the three highest points near the town of Furayqah (Tal Muntar, Tal Hamkah and Tal Mantaf), but the road between Jisr al-Shughur and Ariha was still not cut. However, government reinforcements arrived and recaptured the Tal Hekmah checkpoint. According to the SOHR, since the start of the offensive, 43 rebels, including 13 Chechens, had been killed, government casualties numbered 30 Meanwhile, pro-government sources placed the rebel death toll at 100, with 47 soldiers dying as well. Throughout the first few days of the offensive, FSA brigades such as Fursan al-Haq and the 1st Coastal Division (including notable gunner Osama Abo Hamza) used anti-tank TOW missiles against a number of SAA armored vehicles in the al-Ghaab Plain. The National Hospital where the government loyalists were besieged by rebels Early on 25 April, rebels captured the sugar plant and later, a VBIED was detonated at the Ayn Sibeel checkpoint before an al-Nusra Front-led rebel force captured most of the city, with fighting continuing and air-strikes hitting rebel positions. The national hospital and one checkpoint specifically remained under government control at this point, as clashes continued in the southwestern part of the city. Meanwhile, the Syrian Army claimed that it had captured the village of Kurin. Soon after, rebels fully secured Jisr al-Shughur, except for the hospital where soldiers were still holed up. Clashes also still continued in the vicinity of the city from the south and east. 60 bodies of government fighters were reportedly seen on the streets. During the SAA's retreat, Syrian Army intelligence executed 23 prisoners at the hospital before withdrawing. The Syrian Air Force launched 30 airstrikes around the city after its fall. After the seizure of Jisr al- Shughur, rebels captured five villages in the Al-Ghaab Plain and seized the village of Eshtabraq near Jisr al-Shughur, while 27 people, including 20 rebels were killed by airstrikes on the captured city. The next day, Syrian troops reportedly recaptured the sugar plant and were fighting at the entrance to the city, with one report putting the clashes at around 5 kilometers south of Jisr al-Shughur. Military sources also reported the SAA recapturing a village in the Al-Ghaab Plain and opening a corridor from the sugar plant to the soldiers besieged at the hospital in Jisr al-Shughur. Al-Nusra Front fighters in Jisr al-Shughur On 27 April, rebels captured the Qarmeed Brick Factory base after launching two suicide attacks. After hours of intense clashes, Syrian troops were forced to retreat after the main facility caught on fire. 19 soldiers were killed, while the Syrian Army claimed to have killed 60‚Äì80 rebels. Pro-opposition activist C√©dric Labrousse reported that more than 90 were killed on both sides, while the SOHR reported 10 rebel deaths at the base, including the two suicide bombers, and seven tanks, six cannons and a large quantity of ammunition being seized by the rebels. Three SAA tanks were reportedly destroyed as well. After the fall of the Brick Factory base, 14 airstrikes struck the area. Later, the SAA recaptured the village of Ghaniyah in the Al-Ghaab Plains, while three other villages were contested. During the day, al-Nusra Front used American-made TOW missiles against Hezbollah positions. The SAA also recaptured a village at Jisr al-Shughur, but lost it again two days later. As of 28 April, rebels besieged the hospital where soldiers were still continuing to fight. On the same day, a military source reported that Syrian government troops launched a counterattack on the Brick Factory in Idlib. Video footage emerged of Col. Hassan conducting a phone call to Damascus pleading for reinforcements while surrounded by his troops. According to Elijah J. Magnier from the AL RAI newspaper, Damascus had given the order to retake Jisr al-Shughur at all costs. Meanwhile, rebels blew up a bridge in an attempt to block Hama-based government fighters from reaching Jisr al-Shughur. On 29 April, rebels seized the Musbin area, which links Ariha and Saraqeb. A military source confirmed the loss of the Musbin Quarry, but asserted that the SAA was still in control of the village and its hill. A fourth rebel attack in four days against the hospital was also repelled. Situation in Idlib Governorate, late-April 2015 On 1 May, al-Nusra Front carried out a suicide bomb attack on the government garrison inside the national hospital. By the end of the day, the hospital was still under control by government troops. The clashes around the hospital left 14 al-Nusra fighters and \\"dozens\\" of government soldiers dead and wounded. By this point, around 5,000 soldiers were holed up at the Mastouma military base, east of Ariha, in Ariha itself, and on the hills surrounding it. The FSA Falcons of al-Gab unit blew up three bridges in an attempt to prevent their potential retreat and used TOW missiles supplied by the United States specifically for this operation. Syrian Army counter-offensive On 2 May, SAA units, backed by Hezbollah, launched a counter-attack and recaptured three villages in the al-Ghaab Plain: Al-Misheek, Al-Ziyarah and Tall Waset. The clashes resulted in the death of at least five rebels and five Hezbollah fighters. Military sources additionally stated that Syrian government troops seized a part of Qastoun. The aim of the counter-offensive was to hold and further reinforce supply routes towards Idlib province. The next day, Syrian government troops advanced around Tall Ma'er tab'i, after an attempted rebel attack was repelled and captured the nearby Tall SyriaTel hill. Government forces also reportedly advanced from Ghanya towards Eshtabraq. In addition, the SAA started an operation to encircle the rebel-held Al-Sirmaniyah. On 4 May, the seventh rebel attack in seven days on the National Hospital was repelled. Rebel forces continued attacking Ariha and Mastouma, as well as Ankawi and Ghab in an attempt to cut off the M4 highway linking Latakia to Idlib and Aleppo, forcing SAA units to defend a weak 30-mile W-shaped defensive line. Rebels reportedly advanced in the Hosh Msibin and Bothayna areas after they destroyed two tanks and recaptured Tal SyrianTel. On 6 May, government forces launched an attack on the al-Alawin checkpoint and rebels positions on the hills surrounding Frikka, while the Syrian Air Force conducted more than 50 air raids in the area. Government troops (including non-Syrian militia) advanced in this area. Meanwhile, rebels claimed to have captured the last hill near Ariha, Tal Ma'ar Tab'i, while the Syrian Arab Army stated the rebel attack on the hill was repelled before nightfall. On 7 May, the Syrian Army claimed the Tiger Forces managed to recapture the sugar plant near Jisr al-Shughur, after seizing the village of Qarta. Also, 20 airstrikes were reported while the rebels managed to destroy two tanks and another vehicle during clashes around al-Alawin checkpoint and Frikka hills, where it was later reported by the military that the Army captured both the al-Alawin checkpoint and Malta Hill. According to the SOHR, 14 government soldiers and officers, including the Syrian Brigadier General Kemal Dib, were killed in Jisr al-Shughur. The next day, government forces were confirmed to had seized three points between the al-Alawin checkpoint and Frikka hills, while 24 airstrikes were reported. Two of the locations were the villages of Frikka Al- Abeed and Sheikh Elias, while the third was reportedly Al-Karnaza. On 9 May, government forces advanced towards Jisr al-Shughur, in an attempt to break the siege of the 250 soldiers and family members (including high-ranking officers) at the National Hospital, and came within two kilometers of the hospital. They also reportedly captured Tal Hataab, near Frikka, amid 20 airstrikes in the region. On 10 May, the rebels launched a new assault on the National Hospital, after a second car bomb was detonated, which led to the collapse of the hospital's right wing. Rebels managed to enter one of the hospital buildings during the assault, but their attack was repelled, while the Air Force conducted 33 airstrikes throughout the area, of which 22 were around the hospital. The Syrian Army advanced towards the town, but their push towards Jisr al-Shughur hospital was temporarily halted and the rebels managed to recapture three checkpoints, before they were pushed back again during the fighting that continued early into the next day. The clashes at the hospital and attacks on the relief column left 40 rebels and 32 soldiers dead. Elsewhere, the SAA captured Al-Mushayrafat and its hill (Tal Sheikh Al- Khataab), north of Frikka. At the same time, rebels took the Zeizun thermal plant in the al-Ghaab plain, after damaging several government vehicles. Later during the night, rebel forces were forced to retreat from the plant, but were still in control of the nearby village of Zeizun. The thermal plant sustained severe damage during the fighting. On 11 May, clashes continued in and around the hospital and near the sugar plant, where rebels destroyed a tank and government forces recaptured two checkpoints. 14 airstrikes struck rebel positions throughout the day. On the same day, around 20 rebels from the FSA's 101st Division were killed after a failed attack on the village of Kafr Najd, near Ariha. Renewed rebel advance and capture of Ariha As of 12 May, rebels were still holding a part of the hospital, while the fighting continued in and around it and near the sugar factory. Rebels retreated from the village of Sanqarah after temporally seizing it at dawn and claimed to have killed at least 20 soldiers in the hit-and-run attack. Rebels also attacked and captured al-Kufayr village. Meanwhile, opposition sources claimed that the Syrian Brigadier General Abdel Razak Abu Khader Raml was killed. At the end of the day, the rebels launched an assault against the village of Musbin, near Mastouma, and Jabal al-Arbaeen area, near Ariha, after a tunnel bomb was detonated under the al-Fanar military checkpoint. Rebels captured the Jabal al-Arbaeen area and Musbin, while at least 17 soldiers (including three commanders) and 11 rebel fighters (including three leaders) were killed. However, government forces were able to recapture one checkpoint overlooking Ariha overnight, but eventually retreated after rebels launched a second attack the next day. According to a military source, Musbin was still contested and rebels were not in full control. On 14 May, government forces recaptured the village of al-Kufayr, while Brig. Gen. Kemal Dib and Maj. Gen. Muheiddeine Mansour were killed in and near Jisr al-Shughur. A suicide-car bomb was destroyed near the hospital before it could reach the complex. At the end of the day, rebels recaptured large parts of Al-Mushayrafat, with fighting for the village continuing. The next day, government forces reportedly managed to recapture the al-Fanar checkpoint, near Ariha, but were unable to hold al- Kufayr, which they regained 24 hours earlier, and had to abandon it once again due to heavy rebel presence in the surrounding hills. On 17 May, according to an opposition source, more than 2,500 rebels attacked Mastouma and the nearby Ba'ath military camp. During the attack, an VBIED was detonated near the military camp, while rebels captured al-Moqbili village and advanced in Mastouma, where they captured at least 10 checkpoints and Mastouma hill. Meanwhile, the Syrian army claimed to have advanced towards Kufayr. On 19 May, after several days of violent clashes, rebels took control of Al-Mastumah, its military camp (which was the largest remaining Army base in Idlib in government hands) and Nihlaya after the SAA retreated towards Ariha. Syrian Army defenses \\"disintegrated\\", making Ariha endangered from the northern axis. A spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham claimed that the SAA had already begun withdrawing from Ariha as well. Government forces reportedly destroyed all warehouses with arms and ammunition before they retreated, with opposition media showing, what it claimed to be, footage of several destroyed and overturned army vehicles littered with dead bodies, after a convoy of retreating government troops was interdicted. The clashes led to the death of 16 rebels and 15 government fighters, while others were captured, and the destruction of a number of armored vehicles (including tanks). Several rebel attacks on Kafr Najd were repelled later that day. On 21 May, rebels advanced towards Ariha. The next day at 8:00 am, an estimated 150‚Äì500 government forces attempted a breakout at the besieged hospital in broad daylight and fled towards the government-controlled area south of Jisr al-Shughur. Some were killed, wounded and captured under withering opposition fire, with 3 generals and a colonel killed or captured en route. Rebels claimed to have killed 208 and captured 65 government fighters during the retreat, with figures given of not more than a dozen to 55 surviving. Meanwhile, pro-government sources reported that 127 soldiers out of the garrison of 170 had successfully escaped. Journalist Robert Fisk found that \\"far less than half\\" of those who retreated from the National Hospital reached safety, with some subsequently dying of their wounds after reaching government lines. Syrian State TV declared the retreat a \\"victory\\" amid congratulations by most government supporters, while some voiced criticism. The Syrian Air Force conducted at least 22 airstrikes that day, while the SAA attempted to advance towards Jisr al-Shughur. Opposition forces took the hospital later that day. As of 23 May, SOHR documented the death of 261 Syrian soldiers and pro-government militia, including 90 officers (one Major General, 11 Brigadier Generals, 11 Colonels and three Lieutenant Colonels), since the beginning of the offensive in and near Jisr al-Shughur. Syrian state television claimed that the armed forces killed at least 300 rebels and wounded hundreds others during a Syrian Army operation to free troops in the hospital. On the same day, the Syrian troops attacked the rebel-held the village of Sirmaniyyah in the al-Ghab plain. Situation in Idlib Governorate, late-May 2015 On 28 May, rebels began a large assault on Ariha and were able to enter the eastern districts of the city, whilst fierce fighting continued near the town. Several hours later, opposition forces captured Ariha and Kafr Najd, as government troops retreated towards Urum al-Jawz and Muhambal on the Ariha‚ÄìJisr al-Shughur Highway. In the evening, the rebels also captured Ma'taram. At least 31 government forces were killed that day, including 13 soldiers who were executed by the rebels. The next day, rebels captured the villages of Orm al-Joz and Ein Orm al-Joz. Fighting for the Ariha‚ÄìLatakia highway On 4 June, the Army recaptured the villages of Tal A'our, Al-Zayadiyah and Sararif and the hills of Tall Ghazal and Tall al-Sahan. The next day, the Syrian Army advanced and seized the areas of Marj al-Zohour and the Zayzoun Dam, near the administrative border between Idlib and Hama. On the same day, the rebels launched a large- scale attack on the Sheikh Ali hill area and gained ground in the Basanqul forest, and eventually captured the hill itself. In addition, the rebels captured five villages near Basanqul. On 6 June, the rebels captured Basanqul and Mahambel. The rebels continued advancing that day and captured two checkpoints west of Mahambel, including the largest remaining barrier in Idlib. According to the SOHR, the Syrian Army lost 11 tanks and armoured vehicles during the new rebel assault. The fighting killed 32 soldiers and 13 rebels, according to SOHR. By the end of 6 June, an Ahrar al-Sham spokesman claimed that the Army of Conquest controlled about 99% of Idlib province. On 8 June, the SAAF conducted airstrikes on the village of al-Janodia, which reportedly killed 49 civilians, while Iranian officers were reported to had executed three Syrian Arab Army officers who retreated from the Mahambel and Basanqul checkpoints. Situation in Idlib Governorate, mid-June 2015 On 13 June, the rebels launched an assault on the remaining government-held positions in Idlib, with the SOHR reporting that they captured Al-Mushayrifah, Jannat al-Qura, and Tal Sheikh Khattab, along the highway, although those locations were reported captured more than two weeks earlier. Rebels also advanced in the Sarafif area, which was recaptured by the Syrian Army on 4 June. On that day, one of the two bodyguards of Col. Suheil Al Hassan died of his wounds, after being shot by a rebel sniper. By the next day, the Syrian Army had regained control over the areas it lost on the previous day, after the rebels retreated under heavy airstrikes and shelling. Aftermath ‚Äì Syrian Army retreat from the Jisr al-Shugur area On 28 July, rebels launched an assault to capture the remaining areas surrounding Jisr al-Shugur. Two hours later, rebels had captured the strategic hills of Tal Khattab, Tal 'Awar and Tal Hamka; along with the towns of Frikka, Mushayrafah, Salat Al-Zuhour and Zayzoun. The Army retreated to the south in order to reinforce its positions at Tall Wassit and Tall Sheikh Elyas. The Army responded with 160 airstrikes and dozens of shells and missiles. According to the SOHR, about 90 government fighters were killed or wounded during the assault, while 37 rebels (15 non- Syrian; including a Jordanian leader) were killed. However, three days later, the Syrian Army recaptured Ziyadia and Zezoun, including its power station. In addition, they captured the towns of Khirbat al-Naqus and Mansoura and its surrounding areas. The advances came after the Air Force had conducted more than 270 air-strikes on rebel positions over four days. The fighting had left 39 combatants dead, including 20 soldiers and 19 rebels. Strategic analysis The Jisr al-Shughur offensive has been described as one of the \\"largest and most ambitious operations of the Syrian civil war\\" consisting of some 40 opposition groups, with the main goal being to outflank and interdict Col. Suheil Al Hassan's Tiger forces, who were sent to attempt to push back against the 2015 Idlib offensive, which followed the opposition victory at the Second Battle of Idlib. According to Stratfor, the potential cutting off by opposition forces of the Idlib salient, where the 11th Armor Division and the Tiger Forces found themselves isolated, would perhaps result in \\"an even bigger catastrophe\\" for the Syrian Arab Army. The deployment of elite government forces such as the Tiger Forces and the Desert Falcons to Idlib from other fronts was viewed by Stratfor as a mistake that left the government highly vulnerable in the eastern part of Homs province. Opposition forces were widely reported to be planning to move on the government's stronghold of Latakia, following the capture of Jisr al-Shughur. The reopening of the Latakia front was a focus, at the time, of Saudi Arabian policy to unite opposition factions. Analyst Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre stated that \\"For the opposition as a whole, it would open up the route into Latakia from Idlib and Hama, which could significantly enhance any future offensive on Latakia ... That would be very dangerous for the regime\\", adding that the seizing of Jisr al-Shughur should be seen as part of a bigger strategy. An Ahrar al-Sham spokesperson stated: \\"Jisr al-Shughour is more important than Idlib itself, it is very close to the coastal area which is a regime area, the coast now is within our fire reach\\". As rebels advanced in early June along the Idlib‚ÄìLatakia highway, fighting intensified in the Latakia District near the Jabal al Akrad mountain range, that overlooks Alawite villages close to Qardaha, the ancestral home of the Assad family. After recent rebel victories against the government, some people began to fear a scenario where hardline rebels would swarm Damascus in the near future, despite government reassurances. AL RAI Chief International Correspondent, Elijah J. Magnier, reported that Syria was heading towards partition after recent events in Idlib. Jane's Information Group stated that the offensive threatened to show president Bashar al-Assad as \\"incapable even of protecting the coastal mountain areas where the Alawites (his core support base) are concentrated\\" and speculated Iran would not see him as the primary keeper of their interests in Syria. In early June, a Syrian security source reported that thousands of Iranian and Iraqi fighters were being assembled; \\"[t]he goal is to reach 10,000 men to support the Syrian army and pro-government militias, firstly in Damascus, and then to retake Jisr al-Shughur because it is key to the Mediterranean coast and the Hama region\\". This came days after Iranian Quds force general Qasem Soleimani pledged that \\"In the coming days the world will be surprised by what we are preparing, in cooperation with Syrian military leaders\\", yet Soleimani was reported to be infuriated that his remarks were leaked by a Syrian official in an attempt to boost morale. The SOHR reported the arrival of 6,000 fighters from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Reactions Domestic reaction * - On 28 April 2015, Syria accused Turkey of providing military and logistic support to al-Nusra in their attack on Idlib, with Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem describing the situation in Idlib as having \\"Zionist-American sponsorship\\". International reaction * - Iranian general Qassem Soleimani was reportedly furious with Syrian military commanders when arriving in Syria to assess the opposition gains in Idlib. \\"Why are your heads down? [...] The people of Syria have been paying their taxes to pay your wages for precisely such a day, so that you defend them against a band of evil beasts. Why have you lost your nerve now?\\" he is reported to have berated them.

Born in Salem, New York on 18 March 1785, he died in New York City on 28 January 1870. He was graduated from Union College in 1803, and at the theological seminary of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in 1807, and was associate professor of biblical literature in John M. Mason's theological seminary in 1812. He founded the South Dutch Reformed church in Garden Street, in which charge he continued till 1840. In 1835 he built the Washington Square church, a branch of the South Dutch church.Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography: MATHEWS, James McFarlane. Mathews grew up in the Associate Reformed Church, and in 1807 he was licensed and subsequently ordained by its New York Presbytery. Upon his accepting a call from the South Dutch church and his consequent departure from the Associate Reformed communion, a question arose in the latter church regarding Mathews' finances, as he had been largely supported by church funds while a seminarian. The question was referred to General Synod, which unanimously ruled that in future cases comparable to Mathews', no minister should be permitted to depart until he had arranged for the repayment of the assistance that he had received from the church.Scouller, James B. Manual of the United Presbyterian Church of North America 1751-1881. Harrisburg: Patriot, 1881, 444-445. From 1840 until his death, Mathews held no pastorate, but was active in ecclesiastical affairs, devoted much time to the cause of education, and delivered a series of lectures to students. He was a founder of the University of New York, and its first chancellor, holding office in 1831-1839. He organized and presided over the Christian union council, which met in New York in 1870, and his exertions in its behalf hastened his death. He was in official life for more than fifty years, and was a successful teacher and preacher. He received the degree of D.D. from Yale in 1823. Dr. Mathews was the author of What is Your Life? (New York, 1840); The Bible and Men of Learning (1855); The Bible and Civil Government (1858); and Fifty Years in New York (1858). His daughters, Joanna H. and Julia, also wrote Sunday-school and juvenile books.

He succeeded African-American Democrat Michael L. Jackson, who ran unsuccessfully in 2008 for the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 6th congressional district; the victor was later U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican. Representative Williams was a member of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus and the Democratic Caucus. He was the chairman of the Labor and Industrial Relations Committee and serves as well on the Civil Law and Procedure Committee, and the House Committee on Enrollment. Williams' legislative ratings ranged from 40 to 67 percent from the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In 2013 and 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored him 40 and 17 percent, respectively. In 2013 and 2014, he was rated 50 and 60 percent, respectively, by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2014, Williams voted for the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics; only five House members opposed the measure. That same year, he voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He voted to forbid the transportation of dogs in open truck beds on interstate highways. In 2013, Williams voted to reduce penalties for the possession of marijuana and opposed lifetime concealed carry gun permits and voting to make such information on weapon permits part of the public record. He voted to increase judicial pay and to end the mandatory retirement age for judges. In 2012, he voted to prohibit the use of cell phones while driving and opposed state tax incentives to recruit a National Basketball Association team to Louisiana. He opposed reducing the number of hours that polling locations remain open. Louisiana has traditionally had 14-hour polling days. He opposed the requirement for drug testing of welfare recipients. Opposition to Marriage and Conscience Act On May 19, 2015, Williams was among ten legislators on the House Civil Law and Procedure Committee who voted to table the proposed Marriage and Conscience Act, authored by Republican Representative Mike Johnson of Bossier Parish and strongly supported by the Louisiana Family Forum. Only his fellow Republican Ray Garofalo of Chalmette stood with Johnson. Governor Bobby Jindal, who supported the legislation, then issued an executive order to implement the measure. Johnson said that he will in 2016, if he is reelected, re-introduce the measure because he prefers a statutory law to address the issue. Johnson explained that the measure is designed to block the state government from pulling licenses or tax benefits from a company because of the owner's counter view of same-sex marriage. Other Democrats who opposed the measure were committee chairman Neil Abramson and Joseph Bouie, Jr., both of New Orleans, and Patrick O. Jefferson of Arcadia. Republicans who voted to table the measure were Mike \\"Pete\\" Huval of Breaux Bridge, Gregory A. Miller of Norco, and Clay Schexnayder of Gonzales, and Nancy Landry of Lafayette. Democrat C. Denise Marcel won the right to succeed Williams in the primary election held on October 24, 2015.

History The Waco Boating and Fishing Club was first proposed on January 10, 1890, by prominent Waco citizens.Waco Boating and Fishing Club Records Accession #3794, The Texas Collection, Baylor University. A month later, the club was chartered by the state with 50 initial members. The club purchased a 50-acre site at a cost of $2,000 upon which to construct their headquarters, which they named \\"Fountain Lake\\". They constructed a dam, dug an artesian well, and created a pond which they stocked with fish. The club's name was soon changed to the \\"Fish Pond Club\\", and it would keep this name for the rest of its existence. The group renewed their state charter after its expiration in 1916. Over this time period, the club became a popular Waco gathering point, hosting dinners and social events open to members and, for a fee, non-members. Because of this popularity, the need for improvements, and increasing competition from the newly founded Ridgewood Country Club, in 1947 the group decided to construct a new clubhouse. Thirty years after the new clubhouse's construction, the club again decided to build a new clubhouse at the cost of $500,000. The plan proposed massive improvements including a swimming pool, tennis courts, playground, and new parking. To raise the funds for the improvements, the club raised dues on members several times and took out loans. The new clubhouse was opened in 1979. Dissolution Despite the construction of the new clubhouse, the club was soon dissolved in 1988. The reason for the dissolution are not entirely known. The decision to dissolve was made by a vote of the board of directors, who sold all remaining club property to the Ridgewood Country Club. The remaining landmarks of the club are a Texas Historical Marker and the road named for the club, Fish Pond Road.

The design was one of several new 16-bit computer systems proposing to use a new chipset from Atari Corporate Research. The graphics portion consisted of a two chip system called \\"Silver and Gold\\", Gold was the graphics display processor and Silver was a sprite processor. The audio portion of the chipset consisted of a powerful sound synthesizer known as AMY. Several proposed operating systems were considered including VisiCorps VISI ON and Atari's own internal OS code named \\"Snowcap.\\" The chipset was collectively known as Rainbow, and the system is sometimes referred to by this name. The CPU had not been chosen, but the Motorola 68000, National Semiconductor 32016 and Intel 286 were being considered. Sierra was bogged down since its inception through a committee process that never could come to consensus on the design specifications, so it, unlike other projects such as GAZA, TONG and MICKEY (a system licensed to use the Amiga chipset) had moved to physical development and demonstrations. Sierra was still a paper project when the company was purchased by Jack Tramiel in July 1984 and the majority of SRL was laid off. Only the synthesizer caught the interest of Tramel Technology lead engineer Shiraz Shivji while he ignored the work that had already been done on the Silver & Gold and even the \\"OMNI\\" Chipset. History Earlier 8-bit designs Atari's earlier consoles and computers generally used an off-the-shelf 8-bit central processor with custom chips to improve performance and capabilities. With most designs of the era, graphics, sound and similar tasks would normally be handled by the main CPU, and converted to output using relatively simple analog-to-digital converters. Offloading these duties to the custom chips allowed the CPU in Atari's design to spend less time on housekeeping chores. Atari referred to these chips as co-processors, sharing the main memory to communicate instructions and data. In modern terminology, these would be known as integrated graphics and sound, now a common solution for mainstream offerings. For this role, the Atari 2600 used an all-in-one support chip known as the TIA to provide graphics and sound support to its stripped down MOS Technology 6502-derivative, the 6507. Due to the high price of computer memory, the TIA was designed to use almost no traditional RAM, which led to both a quirky design as well as surprising programming flexibility. It was some time before programmers learned the knack of \\"racing the beam\\", but when they did, 2600 games began to rapidly improve compared to early efforts. The much more powerful Atari 8-bit family used the same basic design concept, but this time supported by three chips. In addition to a 6502B CPU, ANTIC was responsible for handling background graphics (bitmaps) and character-based output, the C/GTIA provided color and sprite support, and the POKEY provided four-channel sound as well as handing some basic input/output tasks like keyboard handling. This separation of duties allowed each sub-system to be more powerful than the all-in-one TIA, while their updated design also greatly reducing programming complexity compared to the 2600. Sierra By the early 1980s, a new generation of CPU designs was coming to market with much greater capability than the earlier 8-bit designs. Notable among these were the Intel 8088 and similar designs using 16-bit internals, which initially became available as daughtercards on S-100 bus machines and other platforms as early as the late 1970s. However, a family of even more powerful 32-bit designs were also in the pipeline, notably the Motorola 68000 (m68k) of 1979. Atari's Sunnyvale Research Lab (SRL), run by Alan Kay and Kristina Hooper Woolsey, was tasked with keeping the company on the leading edge, exploring projects beyond the next fiscal year. They began experimenting with the new 32-bit chips in the early 1980s. By 1983, these efforts had been formalized under the Sierra project. Sierra was, in most ways, an updated implementation of the 8-bit series design concept with dramatically improved hardware at every level. The original design proposal outlines a number of ways the design could be tailored to different markets. Sierra used a new GPU design known as \\"Rainbow\\" that was initially implemented in a pair of VLSI chips known as \\"Silver\\" and \\"Gold\\" and a new synthesizer chip known as \\"Amy\\". Tying all of this together would be a new operating system known as \\"Eva\\". At least one design document outlining the entire system exists, referring to the platform as \\"GUMP\\", a reference to a character in The Marvelous Land of Oz. For the CPU, numerous options were explored, including the Intel 80186 and 286, National Semiconductor NS16032, Motorola 68000 and Zilog Z8000. Each of these was compared for its price/performance ratio for a wide variety of machines. The original design documents suggest different Sierra concepts aimed at the home computer market with a price point as low as $300 using a low power CPU, all the way through business machines, student computers and low-end workstations. Other designs Sierra proceeded alongside similar projects within Atari being run by other divisions, including an upscale m68k machine known as Gaza. Arguments broke out in Atari's management over how to best position any 32-bit machine, and which approach better served the company's needs. The home computer market was in the midst of a price war that was destroying it, and it was not clear that a high-end machine would address this. The business computing market appeared to be weathering the storm, and the new IBM PC was starting off well in spite of being much less sophisticated than Sierra or Gaza, but Atari had no presence in the business world. Workstations were an emerging niche that the company might be able to sell into, but the market was very new. Management vacillated on which of these markets offered a greater chance of success. Work on the various Sierra concepts continued through 1983 and into 1984, by which point little progress had been made on the complete design. Several mock-ups of various complexity had been constructed, but no working machines existed. Likewise, little concrete work on the operating system had taken place, and the idea of using a Unix System V port was being considered. Only the Amy chip had made considerable progress by this point; the first version to be fabbed, the AMY-1, was moving into production for late 1984. At the same time, a team of former Atari engineers now working at a third party design firm led by Jay Miner had been making progress with their new platform, codenamed \\"Lorraine\\". Lorraine was also based on the 68000 and generally similar to Sierra and Gaza in almost every design note, which is not surprising given that the teams originally came from the same company. By early 1984, Lorraine was farther along in design and essentially ready for production. Atari had already licensed the Lorraine chipset for a games console machine, and the Gaza team was told to drop their efforts and begin work on a desktop computer design using Lorraine, codenamed \\"Mickey\\" (semi-officially known as the Atari 1850XLD). Tramiel takeover In July 1984, Jack Tramiel purchased Atari and the company became Atari Corporation. In a desperate measure to restore cash-flow, whole divisions of the company were laid off over a period of a few weeks. This included the vast majority of the SRL staff. The Amy team convinced the Tramiels that their work could be used in other platforms, and their project continued. The rest of the Sierra team were scattered. As a result, any progress on the Sierra platform ended, Gaza was completed and demonstrated and Mickey was completed, awaiting the Chipset from Amiga that would never arrive. The \\"Cray\\" development frame for Gaza and reused for Mickey was used by the Tramiel engineers to develop the Atari ST prototype. The company's option to use Lorraine for a games console also ended, and Amiga would later sign a deal with Commodore International to produce a machine very similar to Mickey, the Amiga 1000. The Atari ST, Atari Corp's 68k-based machine, would be built with custom chips and off-the-shelf hardware, and was significantly less advanced than Sierra, GAZA or Mickey.

These summits are: Signal Mountain - Stormy Peaks - Fall Mountain - Comanche Peak - Hagues Peak - History  The land comprising CSU Mountain Campus has been home to many different communities during its history before becoming the campus that it is today. Early history The original inhabitants of CSU Mountain Campus were Native Americans from the Arapaho, Mountain Ute and Cherokee tribes. Fur trappers arrived in the 1830s followed by gold prospectors in the 1850s. George W. Pingree George W. Pingree In 1867 George W. Pingree traveled up the South Fork of the Poudre River and into the park looking for trees to make suitable railroad ties for the Union Pacific Railroad. In 1868, Pingree established a logging camp in the valley that now bears his name. 1890 fire In 1890, a forest fire engulfed most of the area around the park destroying the Ponderosa pine forest and resulting in the proliferation of Lodgepole pine and Aspen (the current dominant species in the park). Remnants of the original forest can be found along the ridge south of the Pingree Valley. Ramsey and Koenig era The Koenig children along with Joe Bennett (back right) pose with their schoolteacher. Circa 1920. In 1897, two brothers, Hugh and Charles Ramsey, homesteaded the present southern portion of the campus. The homesteads were officially deeded in 1903. The Ramsey's made a living ranching and operating a sawmill. In 1912, Hugh Ramsey hired Frank Koenig. Koenig spent the winter with the Ramsey family and helped build a road over Pennock Pass. In 1913, Ramsey, Koenig, and a helper Tom Bennett built a road to Twin Lakes. Frank Koenig and Hazel Ramsey were married that year. Hugh Ramsey moved to the upper ranch and sold to Frank Koenig most of the property except for which he gave to Hazel as a wedding present. Terrible hardships struck the residents of the Pingree Valley in the early years. In 1907 diphtheria struck killing one son and two infant daughters. In 1919, Frank and Hazel Koenig's twin infants died of whooping cough while the family was snow bound. The children were buried in a plot next to their cousins. The original homestead cabin was burned to the ground and the present structure was built. In addition to the many structures that still stand of the original ranch community, the Koenig's retain their legacy in the region through many geographical names. In 1915, Rocky Mountain National Park was created through an act of Congress. Frank Koenig was selected as one of the initial three park rangers and went on to name many of the surrounding geographic features. (Emmaline Lake after his mother, Hazeline Lake after his wife, and Ramsey Peak after his father-in-law). Integration into Colorado State University As early as 1910, Pingree Valley was the interest of the fledgling university. Through the work of Professor B.O. Longyear, a special act of Congress allowed Colorado Agricultural College (now Colorado State University) the right to select tracts of federal land for biological research and practical study. In 1912, Colorado Agricultural College President, Charles A. Lory; Colorado National Forest Supervisor, H.N. Wheeler; State Forester and Professor, B.O. Longyear; President Edwards of the State Board of Agriculture; and Colorado Governor, E.M. Ammons, selected of land, including the present campus land in Pingree Park. The group traveled by Stanley Steamer and then by horse through Pennock Pass. While selecting the land, they stayed at Hazel and Frank Koenig's cabin. A functional campus was erected quickly with the first building completed in 1913 to serve as bunkhouse, cafeteria and classroom. During construction, Hazel Koenig cooked for construction workers at the site. In 1915 the first Civil Engineering class was held and then in 1917 the first Forestry field camp was held under Professor Longyear with one student in attendance. View from the trail of the Koenig Homestead at CSU Mountain Campus, now a historical site. The campus expanded slowly with a bunkhouse built in 1927 (now the present day Store and Recreation Area) and smaller buildings being constructed for faculty and daily operation. The first automobile to make it to Pingree Valley was a Stanley Steamer in 1919. Telephone lines were installed to the campus in 1928 and electrical lines installed in 1964. Forestry and Natural Resource students have been in attendance every summer with the exception of several years during World War II. In 1976 a conference center was completed that attracts 6,000 visitors per season. In 1972 the university purchased the remaining of land in the valley from Frank and Hazel Koenig. Hazel Koenig died in Loveland, Colorado in 1975, followed by her husband Frank in 1980. In 1997, the Colorado Historical Society named of the Ramsey/Koenig Ranch as a State Historic District. Grants from the society helped to restore the ranch's log barn in 1998 and the homestead in 1999. Hourglass Fire of 1994 The Hourglass fire started on July 1, 1994 near the Hourglass Reservoir which gave the fire its name. It started with a lightning strike which caused a crown fire. It burned down the North Dorm and twelve other buildings. The fire serves as a case-study for natural resources students as the forest regrows.http://www.today.colostate.edu/story.aspx?id=1756 Name Change On April 6, 2015 Pingree Park was renamed Colorado State University Mountain Campus. This name change was brought about to better align the mountain campus with Colorado State University's other campus locations. Additionally, the name change was a conscious effort to separate the Mountain Campus and its land-grant mission from George Pingree. While Colorado State University did not name the campus after Pingree ‚Äì it is a USGS designation for the valley where the campus is located ‚Äì the university acknowledged Pingree's self- proclaimed role in the Sand Creek Massacre and felt it appropriate to remove his name from the title of the Mountain Campus.http://source.colostate.edu/pingree-park-officially-renamed-csu- mountain-campus/http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2015/04/06/colorado- state-university-renames-pingree-park-campus-mountain-campus/25382221/ References External links * Official Website * Webcam from main office of Pingree Park * Pingree weather conditions from NOAA.gov Mountain Campus Education in Larimer County, Colorado Buildings and structures in Larimer County, Colorado ","title":"Colorado State University Mountain Campus"},{"id":"46511038","text":"Sabeen Mahmud (20 June 1974 ‚Äì 24 April 2015) () was a progressive Pakistani human rights activist and social worker who founded the Karachi-based cafe The Second Floor.

Two Fingers Brewing Co. is based in Farringdon, London.  History  Two Fingers Brewing Co. was founded by seven friends, who met whilst working at an advertising agency in London. In 2012, several of their colleagues were affected by prostate cancer and they were shocked to learn that prostate cancer kills roughly as many men as breast cancer does women, despite awareness and funding of it being significantly lower. Around this time, the company where they worked was moving to a new building with its own bar, so they came up with the idea to produce their own craft beer to sell within it ‚Äì and realised the opportunity for that beer to give back to the men that drank it, by donating all its profits to prostate cancer charities. After a positive response to a small batch of beer sold to family and friends, the friends decided to launch the brand nationally. So they spent 2013 building a supply chain of partners who all agreed to work at, near or below cost in support of the cause, as well as forming an official partnership with Prostate Cancer UK. Two Fingers Brewing Co.'s first beer, Aurelio, went on sale to the public in January 2014. Notable retailers have included Tesco, Ocado, Morrisons, Jamie‚Äôs Italian, and Club Gascon, the Michelin-starred restaurant.  Products  Two Fingers Brewing Co. currently sells one beer, called Aurelio, but have stated ambitions to expand their range, giving each beer a man‚Äôs name that describes the characteristics of the drink. Aurelio is a Latin man‚Äôs name meaning golden, due to that beer being a golden ale. Aurelio is a 4.8% alcohol by volume golden ale, brewed with pale ale malt, crystal malt, goldings and admiral hops. Aurelio is brewed and bottled at cost for Two Fingers Brewing Co. by Hepworth & Co, the Sussex-based craft brewer.  Design and branding  Two Fingers Brewing Co.‚Äôs logo features a hand pointing with two fingers, which is designed to represent an oath to better beer, in reference to the brand's commitment to great beer for a great cause, as well as a two-fingered salute to prostate cancer.

Joseph Allan Panuska, S.J. (July 3, 1927 ‚Äì February 28, 2017) was an American priest of the Society of Jesus. Panuska served as the President of the University of Scranton from 1982 to 1998, as academic Vice President and Dean of Faculties at Boston College from 1979 to 1982, as provincial of the seven-state Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus from 1973 to 1979, after serving as a biology professor and director of the Jesuit community at Georgetown University from 1963 to 1973. Early life and education Joseph Allen Panuska was born on July 3, 1927, in Baltimore, Maryland. He is of Bohemian ancestry. He attended the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, a public high school of 2,300 students, and graduated in 1945 as the valedictorian of his class. He received a bachelor of science degree in biology from Loyola College in 1948. In 1954 he was awarded a licentiate in philosophy and in 1958 he earned a doctorate in biology, both from St. Louis University. Panuska received a licentiate in sacred theology from Woodstock College in 1961. In 1974, Father Panuska was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Scranton. Career Early career In 1960, he was ordained as a Jesuit priest at Woodstock. He completed his Jesuit tertianship at M√ºnster, Germany, in 1962. He then served as an instructor and NIH postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Physiology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1962 until 1963. After serving as an assistant professor of biology at Georgetown University from 1963 to 1966, he was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1966 and finally to the rank of full professor in 1972 at Georgetown University. From 1969 to 1970, Panuska was on sabbatical as a visiting scientist and fellow at the Department of Pathology of Cambridge University. He then returned to Georgetown where he continued to serve as a professor of biology and also became the rector of the Jesuit community from 1970 until 1973. From 1970 until 1973, Panuska served as a trustee of the University of Scranton and as a member of the Academic Affairs Committee. Father Panuska held the post of Provincial of the Jesuit community of the seven-state Maryland Province from 1973 until 1979. He then served as the academic vice president, dean of faculties, and professor of biology at Boston College from 1979 to 1982. In this position, he was responsible for overall planning and financial decisions concerning the academic area of the college, comprising the admissions, university libraries, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School, and the Schools of Education, Law, Management, Nursing, and Social Work at the 14,000 student institution. Time as president at the University of Scranton In 1982, Father Panuska became the president of the University of Scranton, succeeding Father Byron. He served in this position until resigning in 1998. During his sixteen-year tenure as the president of the University of Scranton, Panuska led the university through a period of great growth and expansion, including physical improvements to the campus; a significant increase in the amount of faculty members; and increasing the academic excellence and standing of the university. When he became president, the university had not built any new buildings for about fifteen years. Panuska led the university in a construction campaign, beginning with Redington Hall, a student residence, and culminating in the construction of 15 new buildings and renovation of existing facilities, at the cost of around 110 million dollars. In order to fund these ambitious and visionary building projects, he led the university through two successful fundraising campaigns, the Second Cornerstone and the Campaign for Scranton: Shaping the Future of a Jesuit University. The expansion of the physical plant was accompanied by an equally significant growth in the university's academic quality. During Pansuka's tenure as president of the University of Scranton, the student body expanded, its faculty increased, and more academic programs were put into place. Panuska also oversaw the creation of a new undergraduate school, the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources, which grew into a very successful component of the university. After Panuska's retirement, the university renamed this college in his honor as the Panuska College of Professional Studies. Admission standards and selectivity increased, allowing more rigorous academic programs. Additionally, the university began to draw more heavily from outside the area. While the emphasis had previously been on teaching alone, Panuska emphasized scholarly research with the faculty, feeling that this made teachers more inspiring from their grasp of the future. Finally, under him the university grew in stature and reputation, gaining national recognition for the first time and becoming more widely known in academic circles. Since 1983 the university has been ranked consistently as one of the top small universities of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. After his resignation, in recognition of his exceptional service to the university, the board of trustees conferred upon him the title of President Emeritus, making him the first former president to receive such an honor. When news of Father Panuska's appointment was announced, he outlined his hopes and goals for the University of Scranton, stating that his ultimate goal was \\"an excellent educational environment which is filled with a faith that does justice to all.\\" Noting the great contributions of former Presidents Father William Byron and Father Dexter Hanley, Panuska stated that he hoped to \\"make significant strides towards even greater academic quality and service.\\" He stressed the importance of \\"working with the students, faculty, and staff at the university\\" as well as \\"relating to the city,\\" an important part of the university community, in order to allow the university to live up to its full potential. Panuska wanted to help \\"the young people who come to us to learn, ‚Ä¶ achieve their best by supporting an educational situation and campus life that helps them be integrated in their life-value.\\" =College of Health, Education, and Human Resources= In 1987, under Fr. Panuska, the university created a new college, named the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources which took four of its departments, Nursing, Physical Therapy, Education, and Human Resources, from the College of Arts and Sciences and combined them into a new academic college. Dr. Richard Passon, the university's former provost and academic vice-president, stated that \\"We determined that, because of their specialized nature, our programs in these fields should be organized within a separate division.\\" Each of these fields involves the preparation of students for a professional field, requires internships or apprenticeships, is subject to frequent evaluation by various external agencies, and necessitates the licensing or certification of the student in order to allow them to practice the profession. Thus, the university decided that \\"administering these programs through a distinct academic unit [would] enhance [its] ability to respond to these needs.\\" At the time of the college's creation, nearly 15 percent of the university's undergraduate students majored in these programs. Additionally, \\"there is a growing interest among students in the health care and human resources fields, and in fact a revival of interest in education, ... a need for professionals in these fields,\\" requiring the greater focus of a separate academic division. While retaining the university's traditional emphasis on a broad, liberal arts education through required general education courses, the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources incorporated a service-learning component. Committed to the Ignatian mission of creating \\"women and men for others,\\" the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources requires that students perform community service through coursework and projects as a requirement for graduation. In this way they come to understand the service aspects of their prospective careers in personal and comprehensible terms. Since its founding, the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources, later renamed as the Panuska College of Professional Studies, has greatly expanded to include both graduate and undergraduate programs in the fields of Community Health Education, Counseling and Human Services, Education, Exercise Science and Sport, Health Administration, Human Resources, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Physical Therapy. =Campus improvements and new buildings= During Panuska's tenure as president of the University of Scranton, he oversaw a period of considerable improvement and construction on the physical plant of the campus. In addition to renovations to many existing structures, 15 new buildings were built on campus at a cost of over 110 million dollars paid for with the help of two large and highly successful capital campaigns, the Second Cornerstone and the Campaign for Scranton: Shaping the Future of a Jesuit University. Microsurgery Lab In 1983, the university constructed a microsurgery lab, a collaborative effort between Mercy Hospital and the university. Microsurgery, conducted underneath a microscope, permits surgeons to perform sensitive and delicate procedures which could not be done otherwise in areas such as ophthalmology, gynecology, urology, neurosurgery, cardiac and general vascular surgery, plastic surgery, and orthopedic surgery. The lab gives local surgeons the opportunity to develop their abilities to perform such procedures while also allowing students to conduct research and gain invaluable experience. Rev. John J. Fitzpatrick, S.J. Field In 1984, the university completed construction on its very first athletic field in the school's ninety-six history, which began in 1982 after the university acquired the land from the Scranton Redevelopment Authority. The land had previously been used as a rail yard for the Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad. The facility was designed as a multi-sports complex, complete with a regulation-size field for men's and women's soccer along with other sports and intramurals. It has bleachers seating 350, indoor facilities, and a parking lot. Panuska saw the field as fostering \\"the development of a total learning environment, an environment which supports a balanced life.\\" The university's board of trustees named the field in honor of Rev. John J. Fitzpatrick, S.J., a long- time booster of the university's athletic programs and dedicated member of the university community for twenty-two years. Fitzpatrick founded the club football team (which played between 1967 and 1978) and offered pre-game prayers at many of the Royals' sporting events. A dedication plaque on the field reads: \\"Because he is an exemplary priest, long dedicated to the students of the University, and especially to its student athletes, this first athletic field of the University of Scranton is lovingly dedicated to a living proof that 'Reaching for the rising sun is surely worth the cost.'\\" In 1997, a re-dedication ceremony celebrated the installation of new artificial turf and improved lighting for the field. Fitzpatrick Field remains the university's primary outdoor athletic facility and is used for the Royal's varsity soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse teams. The field is also used for intramural flag football, ultimate frisbee, soccer, and field hockey. Gonzaga House In 1984, the University of Scranton acquired the Gonzaga House, located on Clay Avenue between Linden and Mulberry streets. Purchased for $100,000, it was the last house on the block of Clay Avenue that the university bought, after McGowan House, Blair House, and Luzerne House (demolished in 2010). It housed 15 female students, but in 1990 was converted a meeting place for students, faculty, and staff with an interest in education. Currently Gonzaga houses about thirteen upperclassmen. It is named for St. Aloysius Gonzaga, patron of youth. Entering the Jesuits in 1572, he died in 1591 while caring for victims of a plague. Hill House In 1984, the university acquired the Hill House at Linden and North Webster, the gift of an anonymous faculty member. It served as a faculty residence, guest house, and facility for meetings and social gatherings. It was demolished in 2007 and the sophomore dorm Condron Hall was built on the site. Hill House was named in honor of Rev. William B. Hill, S.J. Rev. Hill spent one year teaching at the university as an associate professor of English in 1946 before returning in 1969 to serve as a professor of English. Rev. Hill served in a number of positions at the University of Scranton until his death in 2002. In addition to teaching English, he was the department chair from 1973 until 1975, the academic vice president from 1975 to 1978, special assistant to the president from 1987 until his death in 2002, the chaplain of the board of trustees, and the chaplain of the Pro Deo et Universitate Society. In 1984 on marking his fifteenth year of service to the university, it named the house in his honor. William J. Byron, S.J. Recreation Complex In 1985, the university began construction on its newest building, a new physical education and recreation complex. Completed in 1986, the William J. Byron, S.J. Recreation Complex is a three-level structure which connects to the Long Center, the facility for intercollegiate athletics. It contains three multi-use courts for basketball, volleyball, tennis, and one-wall handball as well as a one-tenth mile indoor running track, a six-lane Olympic-sized swimming pool complete with diving boards and an electronic scoreboard, four 4-wall racquetball courts, a gallery which overlooks the swimming pool and the racquetball courts, two aerobics/dance rooms, men's and women's locker rooms, saunas, and steam rooms. Panuska spoke about the importance of the new recreation complex, stating that it would help the university offer more \\"health-related activities\\" and to serve the recreational needs of the student body, including the intramural program. Panuska also noted that naming this facility for Fr. Byron, the president of the University of Scranton from 1975 until 1982, \\"provides us with a marvelous opportunity to thank him for his leadership at the University and in the region.\\" Francis E. and Elizabeth B. Redington Hall Finished in 1985, Redington Hall is a residence for 244 students and for Jesuit-faculty counselors. Every two rooms share a bathroom although each room contains its own sink. In addition to dorm rooms, the building also contains numerous study and lounge areas and Collegiate Hall, a large conference room for study, assembly, and ceremonial functions, which was modeled after an early Christian basilica, with a clerestory and side aisles, culminating in a four-hundred-square-foot window. The clerestory walls are inscribed in both Latin and English with the founding date of the university and lyrics from the alma mater. The buildings of Redington Hall form a \\"U\\" that is open to the south to take advantage of the year-round sunshine and look out on South Scranton. The west wing contains Collegiate Hall, angled to face the Commons. At the northwest corner of the residence hall, there is a three-storied entry rotunda containing the stairs, lounges, circulation space, a clock tower with a carillon, and a glass-pyramid roof and crucifix designed by Rev. Panuska. The carillon system was produced by the Maas-Rowe Co. of Escondido, California. The five largest bells in the bell tower were cast in Loughborough, England, by John Taylor and Company and range in diameter from 18 to 30 inches and in weight from 147 to 560 pounds. Each is inscribed: one features a quotation from the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises, another marks the 1888 establishment of the university and cites the university motto (Religio - Mores - Cultura), and three others display the text of the second verse of the university's alma mater. The crucifix features a geometric corpus with head bowed, symbolizing the moment of death and illustrating the cost of the love Christ chose to endure. Father Panuska asserted that Redington Hall \\"represents a significant improvement to the living and working environment of [the] campus,\\" in addition to \\"provid[ing] adequate housing for [the] residential students.\\" The facility is named for Francis E. Redington and his wife, Elizabeth Brennan Redington. It houses 242 sophomore students. Rev. Joseph A. Rock, S.J. Hall On December 15, 1983, the University of Scranton purchased the Assembly of God Church from the Reformed Episcopalian congregation who could no longer properly maintain the facility as the costs and utilities were too high. It was renamed Rock Hall to honor the late Rev. Joseph A. Rock, S.J., a well-known and respected educator at the University of Scranton. The university's President Panuska noted that \\"the growth of the university, both in terms of the beauty of its campus and the achievements of its students, was in no small measure due to the efforts of Father Rock, ... [as] his contributions to the university as a teacher, administrator, counselor, and friend were exceptional.\\" Originally, the university intended to use the first floor of the facility for administrative offices which had previously occupied space in St. Thomas and Jefferson Halls, including the Department of Central Services, the Maintenance Department, and the Security Department, while the assembly area was to accommodate smaller social and cultural affairs ‚Äì including lectures, dinners, dances ‚Äì to relieve the over- scheduled Jefferson and Eagen Auditoriums. During the renovations of Rock Hall, however, the need for a new chapel was identified, as the St. Ignatius chapel in St. Thomas Hall did not provide adequate seating and contained structural limitations which were not conducive to acoustics or the aesthetics of the liturgies. The Chapel is named Madonna della Strada (\\"Our Lady of the Way\\") in reference to an image of the Virgin Mary enshrined in the Church of the Gesu in Rome and serves as the primary site for the university's major liturgical services, including the regular Sunday masses. Panuska commented that the chapel \\"provides the university and the surrounding community with a beautiful setting for liturgical celebrations.\\" The chapel was consecrated on February 15, 1985, by Bishop James C. Timlin, D.D. The first floor of Rock Hall became the home of the university's Military Science department and ROTC program. During the 1980s the university also acquired two other churches. In 1986, it acquired the Immanuel Baptist Church at the corner of Jefferson and Mulberry, which houses the university's Performance Music Programs. In 1987 it acquired the former John Raymond Memorial Church at Madison and Vine, which serves as the Smurfit Arts Center with studio space for the Fine Arts department. The university's efforts were cited in a 1988 edition of Inspired, a bi-monthly publication devoted to the preservation of historic religious buildings. Hopkins House In 1985, the University of Scranton acquired the Hopkins House, located at 1119 Linden Street. It originally served as the home for the university's student publication offices, which included the Aquinas student newspaper, the Windhover yearbook, and the literary magazine Esprit. The House was named in honor of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the ‚Äúgreatest poet in the Jesuit order‚Äù and ‚Äúthe first modern poet throughout the world, with the hope that those working for the Scranton student publications would look to him as a role model and a source of inspiration for their work. Fr. J.J. Quinn stated that ‚Äúfor collegiate journalists and writers, Hopkins inspires them to use language not only to communicate a story or a poem, but to see God in all things and all things in God.‚Äù In 1988, because of a shortage of available on-campus beds, the university converted Hopkins House into a student residence. The housing crunch resulted from the city's crackdown on illegal rooming houses, as well as concerns about security and the conditions of off-campus houses, which all led to an increasing demand for on-campus housing. In 1990, the university converted the Hopkins House into the Service House, a themed house meant to bring together students, faculty, and staff with an interest in community service ‚Äúto act as a catalyst to expand the university‚Äôs already considerable involvement in volunteer work‚Äù through getting as many people involved as possible and coordinating the volunteer activities of the other student residences. Before it was acquired by the university, Hopkins House was the home of Terry Connors, the university photographer for over four decades. In 2007, Hopkins House was demolished in order to make room for the construction of Condron Hall, a sophomore residence hall. Houlihan-McLean Center In 1986, the University of Scranton acquired the former Immanuel Baptist Church at the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Mulberry Street in order to house the school's Performance Music Program, which includes the university's orchestra, bands, and singers, as well as to serve as a site for musical and other arts performances, lectures, and special liturgies. The church was built in 1909 in the Victorian Gothic style. In 1984 it was vacated when the congregation merged with the Bethany and Green Ridge Baptist, and was acquired by the university. After its purchase the building underwent extensive renovations and restoration, including plaster repair and floor refinishing, painting and carpeting, extension of the stage, electrical re-wiring, new lighting, a new sound system, refurbishing the organ, pressure cleaning and restoration of the building's masonry, and the installation of a new roof. The main floor of the building houses the Aula, a concert hall which can seat approximately 650 people; the Atrium, a large space which can be used as a recital, reception, or lecture hall that can seat 400 people and formerly served as the church's Sunday School; the Wycliffe A. Gordon Guest Artist Hospitality Suite; and the sound control room. The ground floor of the building includes a large rehearsal hall, small ensembles areas, a musicians' lounge, practice rooms, offices, music library, and secure instrument storage and repair areas. The Nelhybel Collection Research Room is on the top floor, along with the organ loft and organ chamber. Houlihan-McLean features an historic 1910 Austin Opus 301 symphonic pipe organ, one of only a few surviving examples of early 20th-century organ building. The 3,157 pipes, some as large as 17 feet long and weighing 200 pounds while others are smaller than a pencil, were transported to Stowe, Pennsylvania, to be cleaned and repaired by specialists at Patrick J. Murphy & Associates, Inc. On January 30, 2005, President Panuska celebrated the restoration by blessing the organ which was then heard for the first time in decades, as concert organist Thomas Murray performed selections by Vivaldi, Schumann, Grieg, Mendelssohn, and Elgar. The Houlihan-McLean Center also has a bell tower which holds a large bell, forged in 1883 by the Buckeye Bell Foundry and Van Duzen and Tift, Cincinnati, Ohio, and installed by the Immanuel Baptist congregation when the Church moved into the current Houlihan-McLean Center from its former location. The bell's inscription reads, \\"Presented by the Choir in Memory of Mrs. C. F. Whittemore, Who Died July 7, 1883.\\" In 1991, the university installed an electronic bell ringer, programmed to ring the bell every hour, using a motor and hammer manufactured in England. The building is named for Atty. Daniel J. Houlihan and Prof. John P. McLean, two dedicated, longtime faculty members at the university. A former student of theirs was the benefactor whose contribution, made in their honor, enabled the university to acquire the structure in 1986. The Houlihan-McLean Center continues to serve as the home for the Performance Music Programs at the university. Kathryn and Bernard Hyland Hall Completed in 1987, Kathryn and Bernard Hyland Hall is a four-story facility with 16 classrooms and a 180-seat tiered lecture hall, in addition to a cafe and lounge. Hyland housed the bookstore until it was moved to the DeNaples Center in 2008. The site of Hyland Hall was previously occupied by Lackawanna College, prior to its move to 901 Prospect Avenue. Since 2001, Hyland has also been home to the university's art gallery, which had been located in The Gallery, demolished in 2001. Hyland's exhibit space is roughly double the size of the old gallery, with a wall of windows, a cathedral ceiling, and moveable walls to enhance the ambiance of the environment, as well as an adjoining workshop and classroom space for lectures and workshops. In 2004, the art gallery was named in honor of Hope Horn, a vibrant force in the arts community of Scranton and prolific painter and sculptor; she'd bequeathed her estate to the University of Scranton to support art and music education. Harper- McGinnis Wing in St. Thomas Hall In 1987, the university completed construction on the Harper-McGinnis Wing, a two-floor, 14,000 square foot structure connected to St. Thomas Hall which houses offices for the Physics and Electronic Engineering Department's faculty as well as numerous laboratories including a modern and atomic physics lab, an electricity and magnetism lab, a very large system integration lab, and a computer-assisted- design lab. At the time of its completion, the advanced technological features located in the Harper-McGinnis Wing allowed the university and its professors to be on the cutting edge of modern technological research. The wing was named in honor of Dr. Eugene A. McGinnis, a long-time physics professor at the university, and Dr. Joseph Harper, the chairman of the physics department. Loyola Hall of Science As part of the \\"Second Cornerstone\\" campaign, a fifteen million dollar expansion and improvement project, the university extensively renovated Loyola Hall in 1987. Loyola Hall was constructed in 1956, as part of a major campus expansion. Built at a cost of $1,205,000, the reinforced concrete structure featured a porcelain enameled steel \\"skin\\" brickwork as well as aluminum mullions along its exterior. At the time of its opening, the ground floor was dedicated to engineering, the first floor to physics, the second floor to biology, and the third floor to chemistry. The penthouse accommodated the university's radio station (WUSV) and its equipment, including a steel radio tower, later dismantled in 1974. When the building was first constructed, its ultra modern design, technologically advanced features, and ability to house all of the science departments in one building made it a vital part of the University of Scranton campus. Before the construction of Loyola Hall, engineering students had to go elsewhere for the final two years of their education because the university lacked the proper equipment to teach them. In the 1987, $2,750,000 expansion of Loyola Hall, the existing building was remodeled and an expansion towards Monroe Avenue was added, in order to accommodate the growing student body and the expanding science programs. An additional floor and a twenty-foot extension of Loyola's east wall expanded the floor space of the facility by more than 14,000 square feet. The new space provided room for additional chemistry laboratories, classrooms, research areas, and computer facilities for faculty and students. With the construction of the Loyola Science Center in 2011, Loyola Hall was functionally superseded. The science departments, classrooms, and laboratories formerly housed in Loyola Hall were moved to the more modern, technologically advanced, energy-efficient, and safer Loyola Science Center. According to James Devers, Assistant Vice President for Facilities Operations, \\"the overall end result for Old Loyola as part of the master plan is to demolish the building and open up the space in front of the Estate to what it would have looked like in 1871.\\" However, Loyola Hall has not yet been demolished, as it serves as \\"swing space,\\" or a housing site for classes or offices whose buildings are undergoing renovations. Most recently, the building provided housing for the Panuska College of Professional Studies Academic Advising Center and the departments of Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy, all displaced by the demolition of Leahy Hall and the construction of the new Center for Rehabilitation Education. Center for Eastern Christian Studies The Center for Eastern Christian Studies was built as an ecumenical and academic institute designed to promote knowledge about and understanding of the religious and cultural traditions of Eastern Christianity. In addition to the Byzantine Rite chapel in the building, the Center was designed to house a 15,000-volume library, office, social area, and a cloister garden. Construction was begun in 1987 and completed later that year. The Center for Eastern Christian Studies was renamed Ciszek Hall in 2005 in the memory of Fr. Walter Ciszek, S.J., a native of northeastern Pennsylvania and a candidate for sainthood who spent twenty-three years ministering in Soviet prisons and the labor camps of Siberia. Currently, Cisek Hall houses the university's Office of Career Services, a chapel which celebrates service in the Byzantine Rite, and a library containing 15,000 books. St. Edmund Campion, S.J. Hall Campion Hall, opened in 1987, is the university's residence building for the Jesuit community. It is named in honor of Saint Edmund Campion, S.J., a 16th-century Jesuit pastor and scholar who was martyred in England during the persecutions of Roman Catholics for defending his faith, and it provides living and working accommodations for thirty Jesuits. The two-story building also has an interior garden, an office, kitchen and dining facilities, and a chapel in addition to a flexible design with four discrete sections, such that the building could adapt to the changing needs of the Jesuit Community at the university. Before the construction of Campion Hall, the primary residence for the Jesuits at Scranton was the Estate, the former Scranton family residence given to the university by the family in 1941. It provided living accommodations for seventeen of the university's thirty-six Jesuits in the 1980s. The building of Campion Hall, estimated at $1.7 million, was financed entirely by the university's Jesuit community. Jesuits working at Scranton Preparatory School also live in the residence. Michael W. J. Smurfit Arts Center In January 1987, the University of Scranton under Panuska purchased the former John Raymond Memorial Church, Universalist, at Madison and Vine for $125,000. This was one of the three church buildings acquired by the university in the 1980s (supra). Built in 1906, the Romanesque building contains one of the tallest bell towers in Scranton. The main floor of the small but remarkably designed structure, which contains 7,200 square feet of floor space, is used as a studio-art facility for the Fine Arts program. The basement is used for the department's offices and classrooms. During the renovations of the building, the university had to remove the stained glass windows and replace them with clear glass to provide the area with natural lighting. The two stained glass windows from the Smurfit Arts Center, which were crafted by the Tiffany Glass Company, were moved to be displayed in Hyland Hall. The Smurfit Arts Center was named for Michael W. J. Smurfit H'85, a generous Irish benefactor whose two sons, Anthony and Michael, attended the University of Scranton. Smurfit was the chairman and chief executive officer of Jefferson Smurfit Group, Ltd., a multinational corporation with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, Alton, Illinois, and New York City. John R. Gavigan Residence Hall In 1988, the university under Panuska began construction on a new, four-story residence hall as \\"part of [the university‚Äôs] continuing effort to provide high-quality on-campus student housing.\\" Housing 236 students, the facility accommodates four students in each suite, and features lounges on each floor, study rooms, and a kitchen as well as a study area for its residents on the top floor which features two-story-high glass windows with views of the campus and of the city. The building, named the Gavigan Residence Hall, is dedicated to John R. Gavigan to honor his thirty-eight years of service to the university and his devotion to the institution's students. The university has used Gavigan Hall to house sophomore students. Gannon Hall, Lavis Hall, and McCormick Hall Lavis Hall, Gannon Hall, McCormick Hall and the Freshman Patio set up for an event later that evening. Gannon Hall, Lavis Hall, and McCormick Hall, referred to as \\"GLM,\\" comprise a 47,500 square foot, 220-bed student residential complex for first-year females. Each four-story residence hall features a large lounge on the first floor and smaller lounges on the upper three floors as well as a kitchen on the first floor of each building. The three buildings are connected on each floor by an enclosed walkway. The dorm rooms are the traditional, with communal bathrooms on each floor and two people per room. The complex was constructed in 1990‚Äì91 at a cost of approximately $3.7 million in response to the shrinking local student population and increased number of boarders. The university developed Nevils Beach, an open, recreational space, into the new dorm complex. Gannon Hall was named for Rev. Edward J. Gannon, S.J., a member of the philosophy department for 22 years before his death in 1986. Gannon founded the Special Jesuit Liberal Arts Program and served as the editor of Best Sellers magazine and moderator the Alpha Sigma Nu honor society. In 1980, he became the first faculty member to hold the title \\"University Professor,\\" which allowed him to teach in any department. Panuska noted that Father Gannon \\"had a profound effect on countless students and anyone else who knew him,\\" as he \\"taught, counseled, and cajoled ‚Äì using all of his energy to help others take full advantage of their God-given talents,\\" truly living out the Jesuit ideal of turning potential into achievement. Lavis Hall was named for the late Robert G. Lavis, a lifelong resident of Scranton who established two scholarship funds at the university: the Robert G. Lavis Scholarship, a four-year, full- tuition scholarship to assist deserving students, and the Joseph F. Lavis Award named for his father, which provides financial assistance to continuing students whose needs cannot be met through other sources. Lavis hoped that his scholarships would provide students with the opportunity to concentrate on their studies and not be overburdened with outside work. McCormick Hall was named for Rev. James Carroll McCormick, the Bishop of Scranton from 1966 to 1983. In October 1990, the university's board of trustees voted to name the building after him, as Rev. Panuska put it, \\"out of respect for his many years of spiritual leadership in our Diocese, and in gratitude for the Diocese's and his personal friendship and support of the University.\\" Bishop McCormick was present and gave a blessing at the dedication of the Gannon-Lavis-McCormick complex. \\"GLM\\" houses around 210 female freshmen. Royal Way The University Commons, the main walkway through the University of Scranton's campus, runs through the former 900 and 1000 blocks of Linden Street. After twenty five years of agitation on the part of the university, the improvement project was actualized in 1980 in order to create a more attractive, park-like atmosphere on the campus and to eliminate the safety hazards associated with pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The twenty-foot wide brick walkway, lined by trees, benches, and landscaping, runs through the center of campus. In 1991, under Father Panuska, the University Commons was extended on the 300 block of Quincy between Linden and Mulberry, which had been closed to vehicular traffic and owned by the university since 1987. This pedestrian pathway, named Royal Way, serves as an official entrance to the university and the GLM (Gannon- Lavis-McCormick) student residences. At the time of its construction, the 24-foot-wide Royal Way was paved in z-brick and featured landscaping with trees and shrubs. The Mulberry Street entrance to the Royal Way featured a campus gate, a gift from the University of Scranton Classes of 1985, 1990, and 1991, and the opposing terminus was Metanoia, the bronze sculpture of St. Ignatius of Loyola by Gerard Baut. The sculpture has since been moved to the opposite side of the University Commons, in front of the Long Center. Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Memorial Library The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Memorial Library Completed in 1992, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Memorial Library was designed to replace the Alumni Memorial Library, which proved unable to serve adequately the growing student population, to house the vast library collections, and lacked the necessary wiring for modern technologies. More than double the size of the Alumni Memorial Library, Weinberg has five floors which can seating up to 1000 users at cubicles, tables, group study rooms, and lounges. It also holds the Library's collections numbering over 330,000 volumes. On the third floor, there are a number of administrative offices as well as two large classrooms which are used for classes on learning about the library and its services. The fourth floor has a large reading room with a stained glass window and comfortable, quiet environment, with tables and couches. The fifth floor is the Scranton Heritage Room which is a large open hall featuring views of the city, the surrounding mountains, and the Commons, as well as thirty-nine panel paintings by Trevor Southey depicting art, religion, and science in the Lackawanna Valley and worldwide. Throughout the year, the Heritage Room hosts various exhibits including displays of artifacts and documents from the university's archives and special collections, showcases of faculty scholarship and University alumni authors, and the library's Environmental Art Show. It also serves as the venue for many campus and community events such as lectures, receptions, student award presentations, Game Night, and the library's annual Book Sale. Since its completion, the Library has continued to adapt to student needs and incorporate new technological innovations. Renovations at the Library include the opening of multiple 24-hour study rooms, including the Pro Deo Room, the Reilly Learning Commons, and the entire second floor. The Pro Deo Room contains a computer lab with networked PCs, two laser printers, a vending machine area, and a Java City caf√©, as well as a 46-inch touchscreen table PC. The Pro Deo Room is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In order to accommodate the growing needs of students for more 24-hour study space in the library, the Library built a new space in 2010 which contained more than one hundred study spaces for students at cubicles, tables, and couches. This study space was renovated in 2014. Renamed the Reilly Learning Commons, the study room is now an interactive space with high end technology, group study rooms, and areas designed to enhance collaboration. The Learning Commons houses a lecture capture room to practice presentations and record them digitally, two writing center offices, technology support, and iMacs. In Fall 2015, in response to student feedback, the entire second floor of the library was opened for 24-hour use, allowing for more access to carrels, computers, and space for quiet study. In order to raise the $13.3 million needed to build the Library, the University of Scranton launched the \\"Gateway to the Future\\" Fundraising Campaign. During his speech at the Gateway to the Future Library Kickoff, Panuska underscored the importance of building a library which could adequately serve the needs of the university community, stating: In late 1989, Harry Weinberg, a former Scranton businessman and long-time benefactor of the University of Scranton, made significant headway in the fundraising goal by announcing a six-million-dollar donation to the university, with five million dollars going to the library and the other one million going to the school's Judaic Studies Institute. In order to honor the significant contribution of Mr. Weinberg, the new library was named for him and his wife. Before becoming home to the Weinberg Memorial Library, the site was the home of Worthington Scranton until he moved to the Estate in 1899, at which point the house was converted into the Hahneman Hospital, relocated in 1906 to the current Community Medical Center site. In 1941, Scranton donated the land to the university. In the 1950s the site held the A Building barracks, which was purchased by the university to accommodate increased enrollment due to the GI Bill and used as classrooms and offices, until demolished in 1962. Until the construction of the Weinberg Memorial Library in the 1990s, the site housed asphalt playing courts. Joseph M. McDade Center for Literary and Performing Arts The McDade Center for Literary and Performing Arts was constructed in 1992 on the former site of the Lackawanna County Juvenile Center. Home to the university's English & Theatre department's classrooms, offices, labs, meeting spaces, and a black box studio theatre, the McDade Center also houses the 300-seat Royal Theater where the University Players stage their productions. The building's other features include a computer writing and instruction lab, a seminar room, a small screening room for film classes, and an office for Esprit, the university's Review of Arts and Letters. Additionally, the building contains stained glass in the lobby and an engraved quotation above the main entrance. The building's exterior features \\"The Doorway to the Soul,\\" a steel-and-wire sculpture by Pennsylvania artist Lisa Fedon. \\"The Doorway\\" consists of 18 framed images fabricated variously of steel plate, perforated steel, round steel bars and wire cloth which each represent experiences in the human journey towards truth while the grid itself represents a matrix of inner-connectedness. The individual panels within the grid are titled: The Thinker; Reaching Out To My Self; Natural and Curious Yearning of a Child; Eternal Bridge; Acceptance; A State of Calm, Peace, Knowing; Trials and Tribulation/The Ascent; The Void/God; The Writer; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; Hope/Prayer; Christ; The Climb/The Worn Steps/The Invitation to Enter; The Written Word; Unconditional Love and Caring/Innocence of Children; The Self Exposed. The two external panels are: The Self Observing and The Only Begotten Son. Upon completion of the work, Panuska congratulated Fedon for her \\"artistic insight and great sensitivity in fulfilling the terms of the commission.\\" He noted that in addition to bringing greater beauty to the campus, the works of art added to the campus in recent years are intended to help express the meaning and mission of the university to students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors. The commissioned work was a gift of Patrick J. and Marie Connors Roche, generous benefactors of the university and the namesakes of its Wellness Center. At the dedication ceremony in 1993, the building was named in honor of the Hon. Joseph M. McDade because of \\"his continuous support of this area and of the University and its academic mission,\\" Rev. Panuska noted. The McDade Center location was once the site of Crawford House, the 1898 Tudor Revival home of coal operator, baron, and Peoples Coal Company owner James L. Crawford. In 1992, several years after Crawford's wife passed away, Lackawanna County purchased the estate to serve as the Juvenile Detention Center. In 1989, after four years of negotiations, the University of Scranton acquired Crawford House. Originally, the university planned to renovate and restore the property, where it would relocate the Admissions and Financial Aid offices as well as a combinations switchboard and a visitors area. However, the university discovered that the interior damage was too severe and that it would not be economically feasible to renovate it. Its decision to demolish Crawford House ignited fierce opposition from local historical organizations, such as the Lackawanna Historical Society, the State Historic Preservation Office, and the Architectural Heritage Association who believed the house \\"represent[ed] the lifestyle of a coal baron of the late nineteenth century,\\" and was therefore significant for Scranton, a city founded on coal. In an attempt to compromise with those upset by the potential demolition of Crawford House, the university proposed that the building be relocated in order to preserve its historical aspects, but this proved too costly so Crawford House was demolished in 1991. Rather than using the site for administrative offices as originally planned, it would respond to a need identified in 1983 and become the Instructional Arts Facility, home to the English and Theater departments. The Crawford House was subsequently delisted from the National Register in 1992. Alumni Memorial Hall Formerly known as the Alumni Memorial Library, the building was extensively renovated in 1993 after the completion of the new Weinberg Memorial Library. It was converted to house the Psychology Department on the second floor, which had formerly been located in O‚ÄôHara Hall, as well as the Division of Planning and Information Resources, which was formerly known as the University Computing and Data Services Center. The new location in Alumni Memorial Hall \\"significantly enhance[d] educational and research facilities\\" for the Psychology Department, as John Norcross, chairman of the Psychology Department, remarked. It offers faculty offices with adjoining labs, two classrooms designated for psychology, a conference room, open labs for students, facilities which better house experimental equipment, and state-of- the-art animal facilities. The space for the University Computing System included a main computer room, private study areas, several computer labs such as a DOS lab and a Macintosh lab, help desks, staff offices and areas for computer programmers. Currently, the Division of Information Resources is responsible for providing technology-based services and solutions that support the work of the university, and guide the management of its information assets through the departments of Project Management, Network Infrastructure, Database Systems & Data Processing, Systems & Operations, Information Security Offices, IT Services, OIT Services, the Technology Support Center, and IT Development & Applications. Originally, the renovations also provided space for the offices for Institutional Research, Learning Resources and Instructional Development, which was later renamed the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence and relocated to the fifth floor of the Loyola Science Center. Completed in 1960, the two-story Alumni Memorial Library was designed to hold 150,000 volumes, as the collection at the time numbered approximately 62,000 volumes. It also had study space for approximately 500 students. The split-level design also included conference rooms, a music room, a visual aid room, microfilm facilities, and a smoking lounge. The buff, iron-spot building was considered cutting edge at the time, with glare-reducing thermo-pane glass, noise-reducing solid brick walls, radiant heating and cooling, and humidity control. Although originally estimated at $750,000, overall construction costs were approximately $806,000 after complications occurred when a massive mining cavity, complete with a network of surrounding tunnels, was discovered to lie only forty feet below the surface of the building site. Using a digging rig brought in from Texas, contractors sunk 33 steel casings into the ground, each more than 40 feet long, and then poured concrete through them to form pillars in order to support the structure. To raise money for the construction, a fundraising campaign led by Judge James F. Brady sought individual contributions from all the alumni. Roche Wellness Center The Roche Wellness Center, located at the corner of Mulberry and North Webster, was acquired in 1992 and opened in 1996. Originally built in 1986 by pharmacist Alex Hazzouri, the Wellness Center previously housed Hazzouri's pharmacy and drugstore as well as a restaurant named Babe's Place. In 1989, Alex Hazzouri was arrested and arraigned on drug-trafficking charges and his pharmacy was closed indefinitely, as the government seized the building. After the investigation was closed, the government auctioned off the building in 1992. It was purchased by the university for $500,000. Beginning on August 2, 1993, it served as a home to the Scranton Police Department's Hill Section precinct station. A new Student Health and Wellness Center was soon moved in, along with the university's Drug and Alcohol Information Center and Educators (DICE) Office. In 1996, the Roche Wellness Center opened, housing the Student Health Services department. The building holds a reception area, four exam rooms, a laboratory, an assessment room, an observation room, and storage space. Parking and Public Safety Pavilion Completed in 1995, the Parking and Public Safety Pavilion accommodates 510 cars in its five stories. It was constructed to expand on-campus parking, with designated areas for students, faculty, staff, and guests. Additionally, the parking garage contains the offices of the university's police and the offices of parking services. The structure, which occupies 163,000 square feet, is located on the corner of Mulberry and Monroe. The exterior complements the adjacent McDade Center for Literary and Performing Arts by mirroring its design. The Monroe Avenue facade is also covered by a series of topiary planting screens on which climbing vines have grown. Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine Completed in August 1996, the Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine was funded by a $7.5 million grant from the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Defense. The 1,500-square-foot facility houses research laboratories, offices, and the Northeast Regional Cancer Institute. The IMBM is dedicated to molecular biological research, chiefly in the field of proteomics, or the study of the full set of proteins encoded by a genome. The building was created to speed up the process of finding and treating viral diseases and cancer as well as to be able to engineer a patient's immune system to avoid these diseases and to develop DNA probes that could possibly seek out a defective gene that is responsible for cancer. The laboratories are equipped with technologically advanced systems used in the medical research field and each lab was designed for a specific purpose, such as genetic engineering, sequencing of DNA, and fluorescent microscopy. It contains the most advanced proteomics laboratory in the region. Additionally, the Institute has the capability to handle Level 3 pathogens. Mosque In 1996, the university community, under Panuska's direction, renovated a University-owned house at 317 North Webster Avenue into the Campus Mosque as a gift to the Muslim community of Scranton. The university responded to the need for a local mosque for the growing number of Muslim students, as previously Scranton had no mosques, with the closest one being at Wilkes-Barre. Muslim students and faculty recited prayers several times a day in apartments or dorms. The Scranton Muslim community stated that ‚ÄúIt [was] a spiritually uplifting experience to have our own mosque on campus.‚Äù The mosque reflects the growing diversity of the university's student body and its commitment to meeting the spiritual needs of all members of the university community. The Mosque contained two large, spacious rooms, the women's and men's prayer rooms, as well as a library housing countless reference books on the history of Islam and the Muslim religion, including translations of the interpretations of the Koran. The Mosque was also equipped with an upstairs apartment where two members of the Muslim Student Association lived and served as caretakers of the facility. In 2007, the Mosque, along with several other properties, was razed in order to establish a site for the sophomore residence, Condron Hall. The university then purchased and renovated a house at 306 Taylor Avenue for use as the new mosque, which is open to the public for prayer and reflection. Mary Eileen Patricia McGurrin, R.N., M.S.N. Hall Construction on McGurrin began in 1997 while Panuska was serving as president, although it was finished after he had resigned from the presidency. Completed in 1998, McGurrin Hall houses many of the departments in the J.A. Panuska College of Professional Studies, including Education, Nursing, Counseling and Human Services, and Health Administration and Human Resources. The departments of Exercise Science, Occupational Therapy, and Physical Therapy, also part of the Panuska College, are housed in the adjacent Center for Rehabilitation Education. McGurrin's four stories include classrooms, laboratories, teaching instruction labs, and counseling suites as well as the Panuska College of Professional Studies‚Äô advising center and administration offices. When it was built, McGurrin was outfitted with the latest, most advanced technology in its labs and media-based equipment to deal with instruction in electronic media. McGurrin Hall is named in honor of Mary Eileen Patricia McGurrin, R.N., M.S.N., a former student at the University of Scranton and the daughter of Kathleen Hyland McGurrin and the late John F. McGurrin Sr. Ms. McGurrin was an honors student at Abington Heights High School and earned her bachelor's and master's degrees in nursing from Thomas Jefferson College of Allied Health Services in Philadelphia. A member of the American Nurses Association, she was a registered nurse who served on the staff of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia following completion of her training. She died of cancer in 1995 at the age of thirty-nine. In loving memory of his niece, McGurrin's uncle, Bernard V. Hyland, M.D., made a significant contribution to the Campaign for Scranton, which helped finance the building named in her memory. Dr. Hyland hoped that all of the students who pass through the doors of McGurrin Hall will be filled with the same spirit of selfless service animated by Mary Eileen. University President Rev. McShane noted that \\"it‚Äôs really appropriate and magnificent that the home of a professional studies is named for a nurse.\\" Leahy Community Health & Family Center In 2003, the University of Scranton opened the Leahy Community Health & Family Center, which is located on the bottom floor of McGurrin Hall. The Leahy Community Health & Family Center serves the dual purpose of identifying and meeting the health and wellness needs of underserved individuals in the greater Scranton community while providing a place where faculty guide students in a practical educational experience. Faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students from the Panuska College of Professional Studies, along with Pennsylvania licensed staff members, work together to fill gaps in health, wellness, and educational services offered to marginalized and underserved populations. The Center provides a multitude of services to those with special needs, children and families, senior citizens, the homeless, and the uninsured, which include the University of Success, the Alice V. Leahy Food and Clothing Pantry, the Edward R. Leahy, Jr. Center Clinic, \\"Peacemakers After School,\\" and \\"Growing Stronger.\\" The University of Success is a pre-college program designed to provide academic, social, and cultural enrichment and experiences to high school students. The ultimate goal of this program is to assist participating students to successfully complete high school and gain entrance into a college or university. The Alice V. Leahy Food and Clothing Pantry is a student-run effort to provide homeless and at-risk people with clean, decent clothing and the most basic of human needs, food. The Clinic provides free \\"non-emergency\\" health care to uninsured Lackawanna County residents who may otherwise forego health care due to cost, or seek care in hospital emergency rooms. The Clinic also provides physical therapy and counseling services. \\"Peacemakers After School\\" is a program for children between the ages of 9 and 13 and \\"Growing Stronger\\" is a program for area senior citizens. The Leahy Community Health & Family Center also offers numerous educational programs, health fairs and special clinics throughout the year. The Center includes a reception area, administrative offices, interview rooms with observation, and closed circuit video capabilities, examination rooms, disabled access and restrooms, and a large group activity/conference area as well as sophisticated equipment as the region's only motion analysis system, capable of analyzing movement and motor activity of people from infancy to advanced age. The Leahy Community Health & Family Center \\"blends so completely the unique quality of the University of Scranton with [its] Jesuit mission\\" because it \\"provides a place for research, scholarship, and practical experience for faculty and students alike while responding to the needs of children in our region who have special needs,\\" as University President Rev. McShane remarked. It embodies the Jesuit ideals of faith in action and serving others. The Center is named for Edward J. Leahy, the late son of generous benefactors Patricia and Edward R. Leahy who passed away at the age of eight due to his significant disabilities. The Center represents the Leahy's tradition of donating to support individuals with disabilities both indirectly through funding research and directly through assistance and service programs. In memory of Edward, the Leahys have \\"tried to engage in a continuous celebration of his life by helping others, particularly children, with special needs, but without sufficient resources to address those needs.\\" Mr. Leahy noted that the Center \\"is a continuation of that celebration of Edward‚Äôs life, and it stands as proof that the youngest and the smallest among us can make a real difference.\\" Later career and death Upon his resignation as president of the University of Scranton, Fr. Panuska served as the rector of the Jesuit community at the Jesuit Center in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, before eventually returning to the university, where he assisted in the work of campus ministry for a number of years. He later took up residence at health centers for older Jesuits, first at the St. Claude de la Colombi√®re community in Baltimore and then in Manresa Hall in Merion, Pennsylvania, where he died on February 28, 2017. Other achievements and notable events In 1969, Father Panuska received the Danforth Foundation's Harbison Prize for Distinguished Teaching. In 1987, Panuska received the \\"Distinguished Alumni Award\\" from his high school, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, at the school's 100th annual Alumni Association dinner. He addressed the Alumni Association at the dinner and also attended biology classes, where he lectured on aspects of low temperature biology, one of his research specialties. In 1971, he was elected as editor-in-chief of the journal Cryobiology. Throughout his life, Panuska was interested in biology and specialized in studies about environmental physiology, especially in the areas of hypothermia, natural hibernation, and organ preservation. He was a member of the American Physiology Society; the Society for Cryobiology; Sigma Xi; the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine; the American Association for Higher Education; the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, and numerous other educational associations. After his resignation from the presidency at the University of Scranton, the board of trustees made him the first president emeritus, to honor his legacy to the school. In 1999, the university renamed the College of Health, Education, and Human Resources the \\"Panuska College of Professional Studies\\" in order to recognize \\"the vision, leadership, and service\\" of Rev. Panuska, under whom the university developed its strong academic programs, extensive and innovative facilities, and outreach to the community. Rev. McShane noted that Panuska was like the second founder of the university, so it was only fitting that the university should honor him by renaming the College he created in his name. In 1999, Panuska was the first person to receive the University of Scranton's St. Thomas Aquinas Medal, which recognizes \\"persons who have shown clearly in word and action a signal, effective love for this institution\\" because of his extraordinary contributions to the university. At the presentation of the medal, Dr. Gerald P. Tracy, a former member of the university's board of trustees, described how Panuska demonstrated his great love for the university throughout his 16 years as president, stating that \\"Fr. Panuska walked among us, a smiling man of vision, warmed by the youthful students he had come to serve. He loved them and challenged them to grow in wisdom and grace on this campus and into the future. As a scholar with an international-reputation, he challenged a growing faculty not only to be excellent teachers, but to taste more fully the trials and joys of scholarship in their chosen fields.\\" Tracy also noted that, through Panuska's tremendous efforts, \\"a true campus was created, one recognized for spaciousness, unity, and beauty.\\" In 2001, Rev. Panuska was awarded the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Pennsylvania (AICUP) Francis J. Michelini Award for Outstanding Service to Higher Education, which honors individuals whose work has significantly contributed to the quality of private higher education in Pennsylvania. The award recognized Panuska's sixteen-year tenure as the president of the University of Scranton, during which he led the university through a period of great expansion both on the physical plant of the campus as well as its academic programs.

Miss Bessie Heard (1886‚Äì1988) was 80 years old when she saw the need to preserve a place where future generations could visit to experience nature. The museum opened October 1, 1967 and now serves more than 100,000 visitors annually. In keeping with Miss Heard‚Äôs vision, the Heard‚Äôs purpose is threefold: education, conservation, and preservation. Through education, particularly for young people, the Heard emphasizes an appreciation of nature and its conservation. Main attractions A Prairie at the Heard Within the 289-acre wildlife sanctuary, visitors can explore trails, sit in on educational programs, and get their hands dirty with conservation projects. The Heard sanctuary has five habitats including Blackland prairie, wetlands, bottomland forest, upland forest and white rock escarpment. The Heard has been awarded The Audubon Society's designation as an important birding area. Texas has preeminence as a bird-watching area due to its placement on major migratory paths. However, The Heard offers special opportunities for bird-watching by providing a unique resource in a large metropolitan area. Also, the Heard's Pioneer Village features eight buildings in miniature scale that emulate structures that would have been typical in prairie settlements in the late 1800s.
