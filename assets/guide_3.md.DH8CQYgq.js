Design and development Late in World War II, the U.S. Navy began development of a pulsejet-powered bombardment missile,Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p.181. intended to be launched from ships for use against targets ashore; in April 1945, plans for the invasion of Japan called for the production of \\"several hundred\\" missiles, named Gorgon IIC; initially, 20 prototype missiles were to be produced by the Naval Aircraft Modification Unit in Pennsylvania, while an order for 100 was placed with the Singer Manufacturing Company, a sewing machine manufacturer, in August 1945.White 1991, p.36. The end of the war saw the cancellation of the production plans, however development continued, and in October 1945 the Gorgon IIC received the designation KGN-1.Parsch 2005 The Gorgon IIC was very similar in design to the Gorgon IIA air-to-air missile, being of canard configuration with a high- mounted monoplane wing and vertical and ventral stabilizing fins. The pulsejet, developed at the Naval Engineering Experiment Station, was in diameter and was mounted above the rear fuselage; launch was from the ground using a catapult or sled with a rocket booster, or from a carrier aircraft. In its original, bombardment configuration, the Gorgon IIC was intended to use active radar homing, similar to that used on the Bat guided bomb. Operational history Testing of the Gorgon IIC began in 1946; late that year it was redesignated KUN-1 to reflect its non-combat role, while in September 1947 it was redesignated CTV-2, and in 1948 received its definitive designation of CTV-N-2. Gorgon IIC was used to test guidance and control devices for guided missile development; in 1950, an active radar guidance system was trialled using a CTV-N-2, successfully homing from a distance of .Friedman 1982, p.201 Trials of the Gorgon IIC were considered generally satisfactory by the Navy. Eight target drone versions of the Gorgon IIC, originally designated TD3N-1 but, in March 1946, redesignated KD2N-1, were also produced; the KD2N was used in parachute-recovery trials around 1950.Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p.182. RTV-N-15 RTV-N-15 at the Udvar-Hazy Center The RTV-N-15 Pollux was derived from the Gorgon IIC airframe, the pulsejet engine being moved to an internal mounting, and it was intended to use a mixture of radar and infrared guidance.

It has been serialized in Naver Corporation's webtoon platform Naver Webtoon since April 2011, with the individual chapters collected and published by Imageframe under their Root label into one volume as of April 2020. The God of High School received official English translations by Line Webtoon beginning in July 2014. It has received a mobile game and an original net animation short attached to the aforementioned game's original soundtrack. An anime television series adaptation by MAPPA aired from July to September 2020. Synopsis =Setting= In GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms: :The Human Realm is mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world. It is the least powerful realm followed by the Sage Realm and then the Heavenly Realm at the highest. :The Sage Realm (Korean: ÎèôÏäπÏã†Ï£º; Ïã†ÏÑ†Í≥Ñ; Hanja: ‰ªôÁïå, lit. \\"World of the immortal/sage\\"), also known as the Demon Realm, Taoist World, or Other World. It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters (collectively known as demons) such as Dragons, Minotaurs, Phoenixes :The Heavenly Realm (Korean: Ïã†Í≥Ñ; Hanja: Á•ûÁïå, lit. \\"Divine World\\") is the last realm and the most powerful. The Heavenly Realm is home to many powerful gods of various mythologies and legends like the Jade Emperor, Michael the Archangel, Hercules... At the dawn of time, humans, demons and gods lived together on Earth. The gods allowed the weak humans to borrow their powers, creating the \\"Borrowed Power\\" system (or \\"Charyeok\\" in Korean) so they could defend themselves from the demons who wanted to rule over them. Shortly after the demon defeat, the gods split up the humans, demons and gods among the three Realms. Humans are since able to use Borrowed Power freely but are not allowed to attack gods with it. =Plot= The main protagonist is Mori Jin, a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea. At the beginning of the story, he is invited to join a Martial Arts tournament called \\"The God of High School\\" (or GOH). The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked. This intrigues Mori, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \\"Borrowed Power\\", a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: Full-Contact Karate expert Daewi Han and epeeist master Mira Yoo. These two would befriend Mori after their fights with him, and will become teamed together as the Korean Team after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals.  Characters  Mori Jin (, Jin Moli); (Japanese: „Ç∏„É≥„Éª„É¢„É™, Jin Mori (Anime)) :Voiced by: Tatsumaru Tachibana, Hana Sato (Young) (Japanese); Nam Doh-Hyeong, Kim Bo-Na (ÍπÄÎ≥¥ÎÇò) (Young) (Korean); Robbie Daymond (English) :A happy-go-lucky 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices a fictional version of the Korean martial art Taekwondo called Renewal Taekwondo (Korean: Î¶¨Îâ¥Ïñº ÌÉúÍ∂åÎèÑ) later shorted to Re-Taekwondo. Carefree, friendly and (rightfully so) self-proclaimed \\"Tough guy\\" (Korean: ÏéàÎÜà), Mo-Ri participates to the GOH tournament so that he can fight strong opponents and wish to be reunited with his grand-father Taejin. Later in the series, after the mystical \\"Borrowed Power\\" is introduced Mori is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings (one chapter shows that he actually borrowed power from his clone). However, the reason Mori is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical Jaechondaesong, or Sun Wukong, the hero of the Chinese Novel Journey to the West. :After Ragnar√ñk, he assumes a new form and name via Dan Mori as a result of Park Mujin killing his grandfather and sealing his powers. Daewi Han (, Han Daewi); (Japanese: „Éè„É≥„Éª„Éá„Ç§, Han Dei (Anime)) :Voiced by: Kentaro Kumagai (Japanese); Kwak Yoonsang (Korean); Sean Chiplock (English) :A 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices Full-Contact Karate. Daewi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, he participates to cure his friend of the disease. After his friend's death, Daewi finds a new purpose in his life through his friendship with Mori and Mira and now wants to help them fulfill their dreams. A tall, lazy-looking young man with a loner personality, he is nonetheless fiercely loyal to his friends and willing to go to great lengths to protect them. His Borrowed Power is that of a Haetae, a Korean mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks. :After Ragnar√ñk, he has the Wisdom of the Sage, which allows him to manipulate gravity, electromagnetism, and even nature itself. He also becomes one of The Six. Mira Yoo (, Yu Mila); (Japanese: „É¶„Éª„Éü„É©, Yu Mira (Anime)) :Voiced by: Ayaka ≈åhashi (Japanese); Song Harim (Korean); Veronica Taylor (English) :A 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: ÏõîÍ∞ïÎèÑ) which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Thanks to her friends Mori and Daewi, Mira let go of her family burden and will make a new path for herself. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named L√º Bu, which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse (based on Red Hare, the legendary steed of L√º Bu). :After Ragnar√ñk, she becomes one of The Six and leader of Neo Nox, a merger of National Assembly of the Homeless and Sang Man-Duk's faction of Nox. She also gains some abilities of Han Daewi via Fundamental Force Manipulation. Ilpyo Park (Korean: Î∞ïÏùºÌëú, Bag Ilpyo); (Japanese: „Éë„ÇØ„Éª„Ç§„É´„Éî„Éß, Paku Irupyo (Anime)) :Voiced by: K≈çki Uchiyama (Japanese) :One of the main supporting characters in the series. Ilpyo is a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a logical and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of Taekkyon (ÌÉúÍª∏) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: ÏåàÏàòÌÉùÍ≤¨). Ilpyo joined the tournament in order to wish for the recovery of his cousin, crippled during a martial arts competition against Taek Jegal. He later acts as an ally to Mori and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyeok is Hojosa, the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore. Seungchul Baek (Korean: Î∞±ÏäπÏ≤†, Baeg Seungcheol); (Japanese: „Éö„ÇØ„Éª„Çπ„É≥„ÉÅ„Éß„É´, Peku Sunchoru (Anime)) :Voiced by: Y≈´ya Uchida (Japanese) :A 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal baseball bat as a weapon. Seungchul is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting. Manseok Gang (Korean: Í∞ïÎßåÏÑù, Gang Manseog); (Japanese: „Ç´„É≥„Éª„Éû„É≥„ÇΩ„ÇØ Kan Mansoku (Anime)) :Voiced by: Tomokazu Sugita (Japanese); An Jang-Hyeok (Korean) :A 19-year old participant in the God of High School tournament for the metropolitan region who uses ITF Taekwondo to slaughter his opponents. Manseok is a violent street thug with a sadistic streak who has to be restrained by wearing straitjacket and heavy pants. During his match with Gamdo Go whom he tortures mercilessly, Mori intervenes and knocks Manseok out cold. Gamdo Go (Korean: Í≥†Í∞êÎèÑ, Go Gamdo); (Japanese: „Ç≥„Éª„Ç´„É≥„Éâ, Ko Kando (Anime)) :Voiced by: Hiroyuki Yoshino (Japanese); Lee Dong-Hun (Korean) :A skilled practitioner of Tai Chi Chuan with a polite and composed demeanor. After promising debuts during the preliminaries of the tournament, he is pitted against Gang Manseok who proceed to beat him to a pulp and would have maimed him without the intervention of Mori. Gamdo quits the tournament after that. His role in the story substantially decrease, though he is briefly seen in later arcs mastering traditional medicine and helping the protagonists. Taek Jegal (Korean: Ï†úÍ∞àÌÉù, Jaegal Taeg); (Japanese: „Ç∏„Çß„Ç¨„É´„Éª„ÉÜ„ÇØ Jegaru Teku (Anime)) :Voiced by: Kenjiro Tsuda (Japanese); Kaiji Tang (English) :Main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a Might is right philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Taek has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The only exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Ilpyo, his mortal enemy and the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Taek's Charyeok is characterized by \\"Greed\\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers. Taejin Jin (Korean: ÏßÑÌÉúÏßÑ, \\"Jin Taejin); (Japanese: „Ç∏„É≥„Éª„ÉÜ„Ç∏„É≥, Jin Tejin (Anime)) :Voiced by: Kazuhiro Yamaji (Japanese); Min Eung-Shik (Korean) :The adoptive grandfather of protagonist Mori. Probably the strongest Genuine Fighter of the series, Taejin is powerful enough to easily defeat gods by using his sole martial skills. His disdain for Borrowed Power and unlimited potential threaten the statu-quo between gods and humans and have made him the target of many secret organizations. He is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo, whom he taught Mori. His disappearance serves as the main motivation for Mori to join the GOH tournament. Mujin Park (Korean: Î∞ïÎ¨¥ÏßÑ, Bag Mujin); (Japanese: „Éë„ÇØ„Éª„É†„Ç∏„É≥, Paku Mujin (Anime)) :Voiced by: Daisuke Namikawa (Japanese); Ryu Seung-Gon (Korean) :Main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the National Assembly of Korea, he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament. In the series, Mujin acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power in order to create a new world. Considered a prodigy and destined for greatness from a very young age, the best shaman in Korea even told him that he would become \\"a king who will revolutionize the world\\", setting the history of God Of High School into motion. His Borrowed Power is called \\"Longinus\\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mujin's hands. The name Longinus is loosely based on the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of Jesus during the Crucifixion. Longinus allows Mujin control over gravity and as a defensive shield. He commands a group of powerful humans specialized in Charyeok called commissioners or executives (Kor: ÏßëÌñâÏúÑÏõê). These figures are responsible for recruiting contestants and running the God of Highschool Tournament. Commissioner O (Korean: ÏßëÌñâÏúÑÏõê O, Jibhaeng-Wiwon O); (Japanese: ÂØ©Âà§Âì°O, Shinpan-in O (Anime)) :Voiced by: Yuki Kaida (Japanese); Kim Hyun-Wook (Korean) :Member of the judges. Slightly shorter than the other executives, he has white, shoulder-length hair and dark-colored skin. O has won the first G.O.H tournament and, as such, is regarded by his colleagues as the strongest judge. His calm and perky character often makes him act as a mediator between the irritable R and the rash Q, often at each other's throat. He wields the Charyeok \\"Dragon slayer\\" which enables him to summon and command dragons as well as controlling fire. O is the one who recruited Mira for the G.O.H Tournament and appears fearful of the young woman, always avoiding eye contact with her and calling her \\"a monster\\". His true name is Sochun Yang. Commissioner P (Korean: ÏßëÌñâÏúÑÏõê P, Jibhaeng-Wiwon P); (Japanese: ÂØ©Âà§Âì°P, Shinpan-in P (Anime)) :Voiced by: Asami Tano (Japanese); Lee Mi-Na (Korean) :Only female member of the judges, she acts a Mujin personal secretary, almost never leaving his side. P is a serious, dutiful and professional executive as well as caring of her colleagues. She is a tall, slim woman, wearing a female version of the Judge's uniform with blue hair tied in a bun. P uses the Charyeok \\"Marionette\\" to create \\"dolls\\" or copies of other people and be connected to them thus knowing and seeing what they know and see. Commissioner Q (Korean: ÏßëÌñâÏúÑÏõê Q, Jibhaeng-Wiwon Q); (Japanese: ÂØ©Âà§Âì°Q, Shinpan-in Q (Anime)) :Voiced by: Kenji Hamada (Japanese); Lee In-Suk (Ïù¥Ïù∏ÏÑù) (Korean); Xander Mobushttps://twitter.com/XanderMobusVO/status/1300581452598276096 (English) :Member of the judges. Recognizable by his tall stature, green hair and square glass. Q has a laid back if unorganized way of living his life, yet harbors an arrogant and act-before-thinking temper which often put him at odd with his boss and fellow commissioners. A running gag in the series is that whenever Q fights, his salary lessens. His Charyeok is \\"Joker\\", a scythe wielding jester- like entity he can summon with cards. Q recruited Daewi for the tournament and even trained him later on. He eventually married his student's older sister Daeryeong, with whom he has three kids. Commissioner R (Korean: ÏßëÌñâÏúÑÏõê R, Jibhaeng-Wiwon R); (Japanese: ÂØ©Âà§Âì°R, Shinpan-in R (Anime)) :Voiced by: Chikahiro Kobayashi (Japanese); Lee Jae-Beom (Korean) :Member of the judges. R is a tall, slender man and wears the typical Judge uniform. He has straight blonde hair going down his neck with narrow eyes that are often seen closed. Calm and collected, R is, like the other executives, proud of his strength. This makes him appear annoyed or vindictive when he is bested or doesn't get his way. R's Charyeok is unnamed and very unusual, as it enables him to forcibly take power from gods without their consent and control the wind. He was the one to recruit Mori for the tournament, inflicting the high-schooler his first defeat ever. Announcer/Commissioner T (Korean: ÏßëÌñâÏúÑÏõê T, Jibhaeng- Wiwon T); (Japanese: ÂÆüÊ≥ÅT, Jikky≈ç T (Anime)) :Voiced by: Tomokazu Seki (Japanese); Hwang Chang-Young (Korean) :Member of the judge and the announcer of the GOH tournament. He has black spiky hair and orange sunglasses. Being himself blind, T also goes by the nickname Bogsa Sim, probably based on a blind character of a famous Korean Pansori story: Simcheongga. He has a long and pointed nose with shark-like teeth. Being a very skilled sword-man, T provides some advice to Mira for the tournament, even revealing he owes his blindness to an encounter with Mira's own family technique of the Moonlight Sword. His true name is Jeongso Sim.  Development  Author Park Yong-Je majored in cartoon animation at Sunchon National University. Inspired by action genre and Dragon Ball, Park made his debut with \\"Tough Guy\\" (ÏéàÎÜà), published on Naver Webtoon from 2008 to 2009.

The most widely recognized Burmese national costume is the longyi, which is worn by both males and females nationwide. Burmese clothing also features great diversity in terms of textiles, weaves, fibers, colours and materials, including velvet, silk, lace, muslin, and cotton.  History  = Pre- colonial era =  Pagan era  An illustration depicting Pagan-era clothing. During the Pagan dynasty, while cotton was the most commonly used textile material, other imported textiles such as silk, satin, and velvet, were also used in Burmese clothing. Trade with neighboring societies has been dated to the Pyu era, and certainly enriched the material culture, with imported textiles used for ritual and costume. For instance, the Mingalazedi Pagoda, built during the reign of Narathihapate, contains enshrined articles of satin and velvet clothing, which were not locally produced. Pagan-era kings and princes wore robes called wutlon (·Äù·Äê·Ä∫·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂), duyin (·Äí·ÄØ·Äö·ÄÑ·Ä∫), and thoyin (·Äû·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) as upper garments, while wearing dhoti-like loinclothes as lower garments. Meanwhile aristocratic women wore strapless bodices called yinsi (·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä±·Ä∑) over a chemise, before adopting looser jackets and body garments, including longer sari-like garments and baggy trousers, that gained currency in the later Pagan period. Relative social rank was distinguished by the use of gold and silver embroidery patterns; high quality attire and floral designs were worn by the upper class. with floral design belonged only to the king and the people of the upper class.  Konbaung era  Burmese courtiers and the monarch dressed in royal ceremonial costumes during a link=File:Saya_Chone's_%22Royal_Ploughing_Ceremony%22.png Dress was a major cultural aspect of life in pre-colonial Burmese kingdoms. Foreign travelers reported the presence of a loom in every household, enabling every women to weave their family's everyday clothing. Vincenzo Sangermano, an Italian priest who was posted in the Konbaung kingdom at the turn of the 19th century, observed that locals were \\"splendid and extravagant in their dress.\\" Ear- boring ceremonies for girls was a major rite of passage. Locals adorned themselves with gold and silver, including rings set with precious stones, necklaces, bracelets, and anklets. These accessories accompanied traditional attire, consisting of a sarong-like wrap ‚Äì paso for men or a htamein for women ‚Äì both of which were made of cotton or silk. Wooden or leather sandals were worn as footwear. Men and women alike dressed in their finest attire, including ornamented jackets, for visits to pagodas and other important events. Sumptuary laws called yazagaing dictated material consumption for Burmese subjects in the Konbaung kingdom, everything from the style of one's house to clothing appropriate for one‚Äôs social standing, from regulations concerning funerary ceremonies and the coffin to be used to usage of various speech forms based on rank and social status. In particular, sumptuary laws in the royal capital were exceedingly strict and the most elaborate in character. Sumptuary regulations regarding dress and ornamentation were carefully observed as a means of reinforcing social hierarchy. Designs with the peacock insignia were strictly reserved for the royal family and long-tailed hip- length htaingmathein jackets and surcoats were reserved for officials. Fabrics with metallic threads, sequins and embroidery were limited to royals, high- ranking officials, and tributary princes (sawbwa). Velvet sandals were only permitted to be worn by members of the royal family and ministers‚Äô wives. Adornment with jewels and precious stones was similarly regulated. Usage of hinthapada (), a vermilion dye made from cinnabar, was also regulated. = Colonial era = Portrait of a Burmese family dressed in traditional attire at the turn of the 20th century. A Mandalay woman dressed in a trailing htamein commonly worn in until the early 20th century. The dawn of colonial rule led to the demise of sumptuary laws. Unlike in neighboring French Indochina, the Burmese monarchy was completely dismantled, creating a vacuum for state sponsorship of material culture, institutions, and traditions. The colonial era ushered in a wave of non-aristocratic nouveau riche Burmese who sought to adopt the styles and costumes of the aristocrats of pre-colonial times. During the British colonial era, clothing gained new meaning in Burmese life, as an expression of anti- colonial sentiment. Burmese nationalists associated traditional clothing, in particular Yaw longyi (), a type of longyi from the Yaw region, and pinni taikpon (), a fawn-coloured collarless jacket, with anti-colonialism and nationalist sentiment; Burmese who wore this characteristic outfit were arrested by British police. The wearing of \\"traditional\\" clothing was now seen as a mode of passive anti-colonial resistance among the Burmese. Inspired by Gandhi's Swadeshi movement, Burmese nationalists also waged campaigns boycotting imported goods, including clothing, to promote the consumption of locally-produced garments. Clothing styles also evolved during the colonial era; the voluminous taungshay paso and htamein with its train, were abandoned in favor of a simpler longyi that was more convenient to wear. The female sarong (htamein) became shorter, no longer extending to the feet, but to the ankles, and the length of the sarong's top decreased to reveal more waistline. This period also saw the introduction of a sheer muslin blouse for women, revealing a corset-like lace bodice called za bawli (). British rule nonetheless influenced hair fashion and clothing. Western accessories such as belts and leather shoes were commonly worn with \\"traditional\\" attire. Cropped short hair, called bo ke () replaced long hair as the norm among Burmese men. Similarly, women began wearing hairstyles like amauk (), consisting of crested bangs curled at the top, with the traditional hair bun (). The practice of traditional Burmese tattooing similarly declined in popularity. = Modern era = A saung (harp) musician dressed in a traditional blouse and acheik htamein.The onset of independence reinforced the central role of clothing in Burmese national identity. While other Southeast Asian nations sought to \\"modernize\\" preferred clothing choices for their citizens (e.g., Siam with the cultural mandates, or Indonesia, with encouraging trousers over sarong for men), the successive Burmese government have encouraged the continued use of longyi by both men and women as daily wear. In a 1951 speech at the all-Burma Indian Cultural Conference, Burmese prime minister U Nu identified dress as one of the main distinctive markers of a nation, noting that national costume \\"carries with it that distinctive mark of culture of the rice or national which is its very backbone.\\" The Burmese Way to Socialism reinforced the practice of wearing traditional attire in favor of Western clothing.  National costumes  = Longyi = A Burmese woman dressed in a pre-colonial htamein. The national costume of Myanmar is the longyi (, ), an ankle-length wraparound skirt worn by both males and females. The longyi in its modern form was popularized during the British colonial period, replacing the traditional paso worn by men and htamein worn by women in pre-colonial times. The pre- colonial htamein features a broad train called yethina (·Äõ·Ä±·Äû·ÄÆ·Äî·Ä¨·Ä∏) and is only seen in modern times as wedding attire or a dance costume. Similarly, the pre- colonial paso is only commonly worn during stage performances, including dances and anyeint performances. = Acheik textiles = Members of Myanmar's State Peace and Development Council dressed in acheik longyi The indigenous Burmese textile pattern, called acheik (; ) or luntaya acheik (·Äú·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äê·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä°·ÄÅ·Äª·Ä≠·Äê·Ä∫), features intricate waves interwoven with bands of horizontal stripes, embellished with arabesque designs. Luntaya (; ), which literally means a \\"hundred shuttles,\\"refers to the time-consuming, expensive, and complex process of weaving this pattern, which requires using 50 to 200 individual shuttles, each wound with a different color of silk. The weaving is labor-intensive, requiring at least two weavers to manipulate the shuttles to achieve the interwoven wave-like patterns. Acheik is most commonly used as a textile for male paso or female htamein. The color palettes used in acheik incorporate a bold array of contrasting shades in a similar color range to create a shimmering trompe-l'≈ìil effect. Designs for men feature simpler zig- zap, cable and interlocking lappet motifs, while those for women interweave undulating waves with arabesque embellishments such as floral motifs or creepers. The towns of Amarapura and Wundwin remain major domestic centers of traditional acheik weaving, although in recent years, cheaper factory-produced imitations from China and India have significantly disrupted Myanmar's traditional cottage industry. Acheik weaving originates in Amarapura, near the Pahtodawgyi pagoda. The name acheik may derive from the name of the quarter in which the weavers lived, Letcheik Row (·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äª·Ä≠·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏); the term itself was previously called waik (·Äù·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫), referring to the woven zig-zag pattern. While some sources claim that the acheik pattern was introduced by Manipuri weavers during the late 1700s, there are no comparable Manipuri textiles that resemble acheik. The wave-like patterns may have in fact been inspired by Neolithic motifs and natural phenomena (i.e., waves, clouds, indigenous flora and fauna). Acheik-type designs are found on pottery dating back to the Pyu city states (400s-900s CE), as well as in temple wall paintings dating back to the Bagan Kingdom era (1000s-1200s CE). Tributary gifts bestowed to the Burmese royal court may also have provided an additional source of inspiration. The textile became popular during the Konbaung dynasty, during which sumptuary laws regulated who could wear acheik clothing. The acheik pattern was exclusively worn by members of the royal court, officials, their entourages. = Taikpon jacket = For business and formal occasions, Bamar men wear a Manchu Chinese jacket called a taikpon eingyi (, ) over an English collar shirt. This costume was popularized during the colonial era. = Female eingyi = Burmese women wear blouses called eingyi ( ). There are two prevalent styles of eingyi: yinzi () buttoned at the front, or yinbon (), buttoned at the side. For formal and religious occasions, Burmese women typically don a shawl. = Htaingmathein jacket = In this colonial-era photo, a woman is dressed in a yinkhan (bodice), and htaingmathein (jacket). The most formal rendition of Myanmar's national costume for females includes a buttonless tight-fitting hip-length jacket called htaingmathein (, ), sometimes with flared bottoms and embroidered sequins. Htaingmathein in Burmese literally means \\"does not gather while sitting,\\" referring to the fact that the tight- fitting jacket does not crumple up when sitting. This jacket was popular among the aristocratic classes during the Konbaung dynasty, and is now most commonly worn by females as wedding attire, or as traditional dance costume. The htaingmathein is worn over a bodice called yinkhan (, ). Historically, the htaingmathein also had a pair of pendulous appendages on both sides called kalano (). = Gaungbaung = Aung San dons a gaung baung and taikpon (jacket). The Burmese national costume for men includes a kerchief called gaung baung (, ), which is worn for formal functions. During the colonial era, the gaung baung was streamlined as an article of formal attire. The design of the modern Burmese gaung baung emerged in the mid-1900s and is called maung kyetthayay (). It is a ready-made gaung baung made of cloth wrapped in a rattan frame and can be worn like a hat is worn. = Formal footwear = Both genders wear velvet sandals called gadiba phanat (‚Äå, also called Mandalay phanat) as formal footwear.

It is named after the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, where the problem was posed in 1967 by Gerhard Ringel. Formulation In conferences held at Oberwolfach, it is the custom for the participants to dine together in a room with circular tables, not all the same size, and with assigned seating that rearranges the participants from meal to meal. The Oberwolfach problem asks how to make a seating chart for a given set of tables so that all tables are full at each meal and all pairs of conference participants are seated next to each other exactly once. An instance of the problem can be denoted as OP(x,y,z,dots) where x,y,z,dots are the given table sizes. Alternatively, when some table sizes are repeated, they may be denoted using exponential notation; for instance, OP(5^3) describes an instance with three tables of size five. Formulated as a problem in graph theory, the pairs of people sitting next to each other at a single meal can be represented as a disjoint union of cycle graphs C_x+C_y+C_z+cdots of the specified lengths, with one cycle for each of the dining tables. This union of cycles is a 2-regular graph, and every 2-regular graph has this form. If G is this 2-regular graph and has n vertices, the question is whether the complete graph K_n can be represented as an edge-disjoint union of copies of G. In order for a solution to exist, the total number of conference participants (or equivalently, the total capacity of the tables, or the total number of vertices of the given cycle graphs) must be an odd number. For, at each meal, each participant sits next to two neighbors, so the total number of neighbors of each participant must be even, and this is only possible when the total number of participants is odd. The problem has, however, also been extended to even values of n by asking, for those n, whether all of the edges of the complete graph except for a perfect matching can be covered by copies of the given 2-regular graph. Like the m√©nage problem (a different mathematical problem involving seating arrangements of diners and tables), this variant of the problem can be formulated by supposing that the n diners are arranged into n/2 married couples, and that the seating arrangements should place each diner next to each other diner except their own spouse exactly once. Known results The only instances of the Oberwolfach problem that are known not to be solvable are OP(3^2), OP(3^4), OP(4,5), and OP(3,3,5). It is widely believed that all other instances have a solution, but only special cases have been proven to be solvable. The cases for which a solution is known include: *All instances OP(x^y) except OP(3^2) and OP(3^4). *All instances in which all of the cycles have even length. *All instances (other than the known exceptions) with nle 60. *All instances for certain choices of n, belonging to an infinite subset of the prime numbers. *All instances OP(x,y) other than the known exceptions OP(3,3) and OP(4,5). Related problems Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, of grouping fifteen schoolgirls into rows of three in seven different ways so that each pair of girls appears once in each triple, is a special case of the Oberwolfach problem, OP(3^5). The problem of Hamiltonian decomposition of a complete graph K_n is another special case, OP(n). Alspach's conjecture, on the decomposition of a complete graph into cycles of given sizes, is related to the Oberwolfach problem, but neither is a special case of the other. If G is a 2-regular graph, with n vertices, formed from a disjoint union of cycles of certain lengths, then a solution to the Oberwolfach problem for G would also provide a decomposition of the complete graph into (n-1)/2 copies of each of the cycles of G. However, not every decomposition of K_n into this many cycles of each size can be grouped into disjoint cycles that form copies of G, and on the other hand not every instance of Alspach's conjecture involves sets of cycles that have (n-1)/2 copies of each cycle.

He was the co- founder of Ghatge Patil Transports along with Jaykumar Patil in the year 1945 based in Kolhapur. Ghatge was widely recognized as the pioneer in the road transport sector for revolutionizing transportation of cargo or goods. He was born in Kolhapur to Radhabai and Madhavrao Ghatge. He was raised in Kolhapur in the 1920s and completed Master of Science in Botany in the year 1938 from Fergusson College of Pune. During his lectureship at the Rajaram College of Kolhapur, he fell prey to Tuberculosis and had to leave his position due to his prolonged treatment. After fighting TB, he along with his friend Mr. Jaykumar Patil started goods transportation in the year 1946 as Ghatge Patil Transports Ltd. Extensive reach of Ghatge Patil trucks in every corner of Maharashtra had made it a household name. Soon, the organization diversified to multiple industries like spare parts manufacturing unit named as KGP Auto Ltd. (Kirloskar Ghatge Patil Auto Ltd.), the top engine and automobile dealerships like Morris Motors, Lambretta under its wing during the 1950s. The customer service and sales service of Ghatge-Patil was popular in the industry which eventually gained the group more international dealership offers. Ghatge tried his luck in manufacturing and produced an Auto Scooter named 'Laxmi Scooterette' with the support of the Kirloskar Group in 1972. He was a noted participant in the Deccan Association along with influencers like Vasantdad Patil, Yashwantrao Chavan. In 1986, Ghatge succumbed to multiple health disorders and expired on 3 September 1986. After his demise, the Ghatge Group diversified in various verticals. Ghatge Patil Transports Pvt. Ltd. formed in 1958 is the flagship company. It completed 60 years in December 2017 and is currently under the leadership of the youngest grandson of the Ghatge family, Mr. Tushar Satish Ghatge.  Background  = Family = Ghatge belonged to a Deshastha Brahmin family of scholars. Madhavrao had studied Upanishads while his elder brother Amrutrao was an Indian Sanskrit scholar. Ghatge had three brothers and one sister, Ghatge being the youngest. Vishnupant had studied Aeronautics while Sakharam was a builder by profession. Born in a small village Hasurchampu in Gadhinglaj Taluka, the Ghatges are traditional Brahmins with strong roots in Kolhapur. Going back, six to seven generations, it is known that the Ghatges actually belonged to the Kulkarni community of Kolhapur. Madhavrao Venkatesh, father to Ghatge was born into the Vaishav community of Karnataka in 1886. Madhavrao and Radhabai had five children, the youngest being Vasantrao.  Education and business  After finishing Master of Science in Botany from Fergusson College of Pune, Ghatge started his career as a professor in Rajaram College. After teaching for a few months, he had to resign his post when he was diagnosed with Tuberculosis. Ghatge, being calm and understanding by nature made friends very easily; one of his closest friends was Jaykumar Patil. Jaykumar Patil belonged to a Jain family of Kolhapur. The Patil family ran a small goods transportation business which was dependent on a single truck and the route for which was a fixed Kolhapur- Mumbai trip. Many a times, Jaykumar Patil himself drove the truck all the way to Mumbai. Sakharampant, the elder brother of Ghatge was a civil engineer by profession had started with the construction business in Kolhapur. During 1941‚Äì42, Sakharam had bagged an Airport building contract which required regular goods transportation from Kolhapur to Belgaum. Sakharam had one truck to handle the transportation but had a shortage of one truck. Ghatge suggested Jaykumar what for the assignment to which Jaykumar agreed at once to help. After the completion of the assignment in 1943, Ghatge suggested to start a sole goods transport business using the two trucks and that is how Ghatge Patil Transports took birth and the partnership began. In 1945, during the reign of E.W Perry, the business bagged its first major contract of Rajaram Rifles to transport wood under the commandment of Gen. Thorat. With this contract, Ghatge & Patil had struck a gold mine and gained respect in town for handling the Indian Army consignments. Ghatge with his friend & business partner Mr. Jaykumar Patil Ghatge & Patil Showroom in 1971 = Diversification and dealerships =  Spare parts  After the World-War II, the infrastructure and specifically roads were in ruins which directly affected vehicle transport and the motor components. Ghatge noticed a growing need of such replaceable components i.e. spare parts. He identified that if he made Spare parts available in Kolhapur, he can provide to numerous trucks in the town. He would take trips to the Royal Opera House (Mumbai) in Girgaon to would spare parts not just for his business but for creating a market place in Kolhapur. The Mumbai trips not only helped Ghatge to gain entry in the spare components market but he made acquaintances with the vendor and fellow transporters. Later, Ghatge explored the Truck & Body building business started by building variety of closed vans and ambulances but were remembered for building Kolhapur Police Vans and were applauded by the then Inspector G.P Khan Bahadur Sadari.  Motor and automotive components  Ghatge was soon eyeing the Motor or Automobile industry but it was not possible to buy or manufacture in India since every make was outsourced due to better available quality overseas. But in 1959, when Morris Motors company shut down its production, Ghatge was hopeful again. He visited the FRENCH MOTOR CAR CO. who had the spare parts for one of Ghatge's trucks. Along with the spare parts, they also had the agency of Morris Motors. Ghatge & Patil, then held the agency of Morris Motors because of the sheer dedication and strong corporate relations of Ghatge in the Industry. Alongside, Ghatge also bagged the Morris Commercial trucks which gave India its first Diesel truck. With the help of G.P Khan of Kolhapur Police, Ghatge & Patil held the General Motors agency too. Post World War, the small towns generated demands of motor vehicles and components, too. Initially the major distributors isolated the metropolitan cities for supplying their motor components but with the changing era they wished to distribute by giving agencies in the small towns like Kolhapur. Ghatge opened its first showroom at Rajaram Road, Kolhapur with a spacious display of motor equipments and multiple bays and workshops for repair work. Soon, all the verticals of Ghatge & Patil excelled and word spread that they are the top dealership house for automotive components, trucks etc. which brought numerous dealerships under their house.  Bicycle company  The Bicycle demand in the country was booming and Ghatge did not miss the opportunity. Raleigh Bicycle Company, one of the oldest bicycle manufacturing company in the world from England that goes by the brand name Raleigh had given its agency to the Sen & Pandit of Kolkatta. Ghatge & Patil took the Open general licence with the help of Mr. M. F. Vasvani who was the Manager of Raleigh and ordered the bicycles directly to Kolhapur that led to the sale of 300 lot of bicycles in a very short span. In 1952, when TI Cycles of India started its production of Hercules Cycles, Phillips Cycles and BSA motorcycles in Madras, Ghatge had it under his belt too. In the small town of Kolhapur, the only ice factory shut followed by which Ghatge founded the Pearl Ice Factory to meet the demands of the people of his town. In 1952, Ghatge- Patil shocked people with their decision to shut its flagship transport business. They eventually did not stand by it and changed the decision owing to the growing market needs of surface transportation and in 1954, Ghatge Patil Transports resumed its bookings.  Scooters and auto-rickshaw dealers  The growing popularity of Ghatge as the dynamic and social businessman brought multiple dealerships to the doorstep of Ghatge & Patil. The Italian company, Automobile Products of India, the manufacturer at Bombay in 1949, produced Lambretta scooters and autorickshaws & offered Ghatge & Patil to become the distributors of their products in 1956. They also bagged the dealership of Mahindra & Mahindra which started its production in India around 1954; Ghatge founded the dealership showrooms in Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, Satara and Solapur.  Tractors and Agricultural Equipments  Ghatge Patil held the Massey Ferguson agency in 1957, a major American manufacturer of Agricultural Equipments along with Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited TAFE in 1960. = Laxmi Scooterette = API, under the wing of M. A Chidambaram was granted the permission to manufacture two out of the three models of Lambretta by the Indian Government. After having all the major dealerships under his wing, Ghatge decided to manufacture the third model which was better known as an Auto Scooter. It was a big leap for the Ghatge-Patil and under the guidance of Kirloskars, the production of the model started in Uchgaon under KGP Auto Ltd. (Kirloskar Ghatge Patil Auto Ltd.) which was set up near Ghatge Patil Industries Foundry.which was named. The Auto Scooter was named as \\"Laxmi Scooterette\\" touching upon the emotions and connect better with the people. Kirloskar Kisaan, an oil company supplied Engines and Oagle Brother's Delstar supplied the body, fuel tank along with the front and rear fork assembly for Laxmi. Laxmi was released in the market during 1972 with a target to produce 24000 models by the year 1975. Unfortunately, Laxmi could not make a mark in the industry due to technical and market inefficiencies. Around four years after Vasantrao Ghatge's demise, the group saw the end of Laxmi Scooterette in 1990. Laxmi 48 select, a Ghatge & Patil make shown to Abasaheb Garware by Ghatge Commencement of Lambretta Scooter Sale by Ghatge & Patil started in 1956  Philanthropy and social activities  In 1967, Ghatge along with Abasaheb Kulkarni Khebudkar from Sangli was a part of the Deccan Co-operative Spinning Mill Ltd. Although having little or no interest in politics, he soon made friends with noted politicians and influencers namely Vasantdada Patil, Yashwantrao Chavan and Vasantrao Naik who were active members of the Deccan Association. He was the head of the New Education Society of Kolhapur in 1982 after Madan Mohan Lohiya. Ghatge started and supported 24 schools and 3 Junior colleges. On 30 August 1949, Remand Home was established by Lalitadevi Najappa, wife to Chief Administrator Captain V. Najappa. In the next 2 years, Ghatge was heading the departments from funding allocation. A well-known Social activist, Dr. Sunilkumar Lawate was associated with the Remand Home which is now converted to Balkalyan Sankul and admitted 45 boys and 4 girls. With a growing popularity and a huge social circle, Ghatge had notable visitors in Kolhapur. The Ganesh Festival, which was the most coveted and celebrated event in the organization had the most talented artists of India. Pandit Bhimsen Joshi had performed five times at the Ganesh Festival in Ghatge- Patil since 1955; the world-famous sitarist Ravi Shankar, the Indian Tabla player Alla Rakha and the classical singers Kishori Amonkar, Pandit Kumar Gandharva, Bal Gandharva, Pandit Vasantrao Deshpande  References  19.

George Hudson further discussed the species in his 1898 volume New Zealand moths and butterflies and referred to it as Xanthorhoe cataphracta.  Description  Hudson described the species as follows: :\\"The fore-wings are dull yellowish- brown, with numerous slightly waved oblique black and white transverse bands ; one very broad white band is situated near the middle, and another at about three-fourths ; there is a broad longitudinal reddish-brown line on the costal edge, in which the transverse lines almost disappear ; there is also a pale, somewhat triangular, area at the apex. The hind-wings are very pale greyish- ochreous. The cilia of all the wings are very pale ochreous. The female is duller and paler than the male.\\"  Distribution and habitat  A. cataphracta is endemic to New Zealand and can be found in the South Island.

Because the history is complex it is mainly an outline and index to the more detailed articles given in the links. It is a companion to History of the western steppe and History of the eastern steppe and is parallel to the History of Kazakhstan and the History of central Asia. Geography \\"Central steppe\\" is an informal term for the middle part of the Eurasian steppe. It is grassland with some semi-desert and becomes dryer toward the south. On the east it is separated from Dzungaria and the eastern steppe by the low mountains along the current Chinese border. On the west it merges into the western steppe along the narrowing between the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea. On the north it is bounded by the forests of Siberia. The southern boundary has three sections. In the east the Tian Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan extend about 650 kilometres west and give the steppe a sharp southern boundary. The center is approximately the line of the Syr Darya which runs from the eastern mountains northwest to the Aral Sea. South of the Syr Darya the steppe grades into semi- desert but there are cities based on irrigation agriculture which give the area a different history. The western part between the Aral and Caspian Seas is dry and thinly populated. The Syr Darya and the area between the Urals and Caspian were not significant barriers and the low mountains of Dzungaria were fairly easy to cross. The other boundaries were significant barriers to movement. General The central steppe is far from the areas of literate civilization and is therefore poorly documented. Most of the \\"peoples\\" mentioned were some tribe or clan that gained power over its neighbors and became important enough to be noticed by literate historians. Some were definite ethnic groups and some movements were genuine folk migrations, but in most cases it is uncertain. Most dates are circa because they were processes or ill-documented. There are two major facts which theorists have not explained. During the last 2,500 years nearly all movements on the steppe have been from east to west. From about 1000 BC all the known peoples of the western and central steppe spoke Iranian languages. From about 500 AD the Turkic languages expanded from Mongolia and replaced most of the Iranian languages. Before written history Andronovo and Afanasevo cultures. Omits Yamnaya culture northwest of the Caspian. The origins of pastoral nomadism and horse archery are not clearly understood. At some time in the distant past people of European appearance lived in or crossed the central steppe and left the Tarim mummies in the Tarim basin. In the centuries around 3000 BC we find the semi-nomadic and probably Indo-European Yamnaya culture west of the central steppe. East of the central steppe was the rather similar Afanasevo culture. The Yamnaya-Afanasevo complex is probably connected to the eastward spread of the Indo-European languages, especially Tokharian. Between them on the central steppe was the horse-using Botai culture. After 2000 BC the Andronovo Culture complex was southeast of the Urals. They had chariots, fortified towns, spread southeast to much of central Asia and are associated with the rise of the Indo-Iranian languages. Iron appears about 1000 BC. Around 500 BC Herodotus vaguely described the area as inhabited by Massagetae, Issidonians and others. Around 200 BC we begin to get Chinese reports from the east. Eastern third (Zhetysu or Semirechye) Much of Zhetysu is in the Ili River basin. Note the Tien Shan mountains of Kyrgyzstan in the south. The area north of the Tien Shan needs special treatment because of the better documentation and the large number of peoples who moved through it. It is a type of steppe \\"bay\\" bounded on the north by the Siberian forests, on the south by the Kyrgyz mountains and on the east by low mountains. Zhetysu is Turkic and Semirechye is Russian for \\"seven rivers\\". *Sakas (before 200 BC) The Iranian-speaking nomads in the western and central steppe were called Scythians by the Greeks, Sakas by the Persians and Sai by the Chinese, the three words meaning about the same thing. They also occupied the western Tarim basin. Iranian languages extended south to Persia and Afghanistan. *Chinese: Under the Han dynasty the Chinese expanded to the west. In 125 BC Zhang Qian returned with the first reports of the Western Regions. Around 100 BC to 100 AD, with interruptions, the Chinese controlled the Tarim Basin southeast of the central steppe. Chinese historians have given us the first good information about the central steppe. *c. 162-132 BC: Yuezhi: The Yuezhi were originally a major power in Gansu and Mongolia. Around 162 BC they were driven west by the Xiongnu and settled in the Ili valley, driving out the Sakas. About 132 BC they were driven out by the Wusun and moved south and later formed a major state in Bactria as the Kushans. *Wusun: c. 133 BC-100 AD: The Wusun from Gansu drove the Yuezhi out of the Ili valley. By c. 80 BC they had some power in the Tarim basin. After 100 AD they declined and gradually disappear from the records. *Xiongnu (c. 40 BC-c. 155 AD): When the Northern Xiongnu were driven west by the Chinese they occupied Dzungaria and Semirechye, perhaps somewhat north of the Wusun. The Xianbei who defeated them may also reached this area. *Yueban : (c. 160-490): After the Han lost control of the Tarim basin our sources become thin. The Chinese called the local population Yueban or Yuepan. They appear to have been Xiongnu remnants. *?Ephthalites (c. 493?-c. 560): The poorly-documented Ephthalites were based in the south and may have extended north of the Tian Shan. *Tiele people (c. 100-800) is a vague Chinese term for the probably Turkic peoples mainly on the northern edge of the steppe from Mongolia westward. Zhetysu ('Moghulistan') in relation to Dzungaria (east), Tarim Basin (southeast) and the steppe bays of Freghana and Bactria to the southwest *Outside influences (c. 500-800): Turkic-speaking peoples spread from Mongolia and occupied the central steppe. The Chinese returned under the Tang dynasty. Islam arrived about 750. Meanwhile, the Sogdian merchants controlled most of the long-distance trade. Gokturks (c. 558-657): The Gokturks were the first Turkic-speakers to found an empire and were the first to rule both the eastern and central steppe, the only other case being the Mongols. In 552 they took over Mongolia, c. 558 reached the Volga and c. 571 reached the Oxus. By 603 the Western Turkic Khaganate had definitely split from the Eastern Khaganate in Mongolia. Circa 657 they were defeated by the Chinese. Chinese again (c. 657-756): Chinese power was restored by the Tang dynasty. They took over the Tarim basin and the mountains of Kyrgyzstan, captured Tashkent, subjugated what was left of the western Turks and lost a battle to the Arabs in 751. Around 756 they withdrew because of the An Lushan rebellion. Islam (c. 750‚Äìpresent): After the Arab conquest of Merv in 651 there were raids northward. From 705 Islam expanded into the area between the Oxus and Syr Darya. Muslims in central Asia soon became more Persian than Arab. From around 750 Islam expanded slowly north of the Syr Darya and into the Tarim Basin and Gansu. Sogdian Merchants (c. 300-840): Merchants from Sogdia controlled most of the trade between China and the west. They had settlements all the way from Bukhara to northern China. *Dulu Turks (c. 603-659): were the semi-independent eastern half of the Western Turkic Khaganate. *Chinese vassals (c. 658-756): After the defeat of the Gokturks the Chinese had some limited control of the peoples west and north of the mountains, but the matter is poorly documented. *Turgesh (c. 699-766): The Turgesh were Dulu who restored a kind of Turkic Khaganate. Fought Arabs and Chinese. *Karluks (c. 766-840): The Turkic Karluks drove the Turgesh out of Semirechye and later evolved into the Karakhanids. As a tribe they originated in Dzungaria and existed from at least 644 into Mongol times. *Karakhanids (c. 850-1134): The Karakhanid Khaganate was founded by Karluks and others. c. 960 they adopted Islam. c. 999 they conquered Transoxiana. About 1041 they split into an eastern group in Semirechye and a western group in Transoxiana. By 1081 they were Seljuk vassals, at least in theory. Following their defeat in 1134, many Karakhanids remained as local rulers. Karakitai at greatest extent *Karakitai (1134‚Äì1220): The Karakitai rulers were refugees from north China. The Manchurian Kitans ruled north China as the Liao dynasty (907‚Äì1125). After they were overthrown by the Jurchens, Kitan remnants fled west, conquered Semirechye in 1134 and by 1141 held most of the lands of the Karakhanids. They were non-Muslim, had some degree of Chinese culture and generally left the former rulers in place as vassals. In 1211 a Naiman prince who had fled the Mongols usurped power. The Mongols pursued him and by 1220 conquered most of the Karakitai lands. *Mongols and after: After the Mongol conquest in 1220 the eastern third does not need separate treatment, so see the \\"Mongols and after\\" section below. Continuing with Zhetysu we might mention the following. *Chagataids: When the Mongol empire split up central Asia fell to the Chagataids but they never formed a strong state and soon adopted Islam and the local language. *Moghulistan (c. 1450-1500): emerged from declining Chagataids. Zhetysu was split between Mogulistan in the east and the emerging Kazakhs. *Kazakhs (1465‚Äìpresent) first appeared in Zhetysu and soon spread their name all over the central steppe. Semirechye was under the Senior Horde. *Dzungar Khanate (c. 1680-1758) held the area until it was destroyed by the Chinese. *Russians conquered the area from the north in 1847‚Äì68. See Russian conquest of Turkestan. Western two-thirds and Turkic migrations This area is far from areas of literate civilization and sources are scattered. 100BC from Chinese reports *From circa 500 BC we have Greek and Persian reports. The so-called Pointed-Hat Sakas may have lived along the upper Syr-darya and may have some connection to Ptolemy's Sacaraucae. The Dahae lived between the Caspian and Aral Seas. The Massagatae probably lived east of the Aral Sea. Herodotus speaks vaguely of Issedones, Arimaspi, Hyperborians and others. *From 125 BC we have Chinese reports. The Kangju lived along the Syr Darya and the Yancai probably north of the Aral Sea. The Yancai were possibly the Greek's Sarmatians, and specifically the Alans. The above peoples were all independent of the Persian and Macedonian Empires to the south. *Huns (before 370 AD): The Huns formed somewhere in Central Asia, crossed the Volga about 370 AD and raided the Roman Empire. They were probably a mixture of Xiongnu and other peoples. *First Turkic Khaganate (552-659 AD): The first Turkic Khaganate formed in Mongolia and quickly spread to the Volga. It soon split and the central steppe became the Western Turkic Khaganate. It developed two factions, with the Dulu Turks south of lake Balkhash and the Nushibi between them and the Kangars east of the Aral Sea. Circa 1025, Oghuz Pechenegs in the west pushed by the Kipchaks, with main Oghuz moving southwest *Turkic migrations (c.500-1100):Geography for this section from Yuri Bregel, Historical Atlas of Central Asia, Maps 6‚Äì17. Sources for the Turkic migrations are vague and somewhat contradictory. If we group Turkic speakers by language family they moved west in three waves. Basically, the Oghurs disappeared, the Oghuz went southwest and left their languages in Turkmenistan and Turkey and the Kipchaks occupied the whole central and western steppe. The Karluks stayed home and moved somewhat southwest. Since our records refer to the ruling class we do not know how long Iranian languages survived among the common people on the steppe. South of the Syr Darya Turkic slave-soldiers began appearing about 800. This and other causes spread Turkic languages south of the Syr Darya, replacing most of the Iranian languages. Oghur: Circa 500, before the Turkic Khaganate, the Oghur may have been north of the Aral Sea and west of the Tiele. They continued west and founded several kingdoms around the western steppe. Their languages have disappeared except for the Chuvash language. Oghuz: About 700, after the fall of the Turkic Khaganate, the Oghuz Turks appear north of Lake Balkhash east of the Oghurs and west of the Karluks and Kipchaks. Before c. 900 they reached the Aral Sea and soon pushed south on both sides of the Aral Sea, possibly driven by the Kipchaks. Muslim Oghuz came to be known as Turkomans. Under the leadership of the Seljuks they pushed south and west, occupied Turkmenistan and gave their language and religion to modern Turkey. Oghuz who went west and fought Kievan Rus were called Pechenegs. Kipchak: Around 700, after the fall of the Turkic Khaganate, we find the Kipchaks in western Dzungaria north of the Karluks. Before 900 they had replaced the Oghuz north of Lake Balkhash and were somehow associated with the Kimeks to their north. By 1000 they reached the Aral Sea and by 1100 the Volga. They continued west and occupied the whole western steppe where they were known as Cumans and Polovtsi. They may have been ruled by the Kimeks at some point and the Cumans may be somewhat different. Starting about 1500 they were pushed off the western steppe by Russians and Ukrainians, but remained on the central steppe and became the Kazakhs. Maximun extent of the Kipchak *Four peoples on the lower Syr Darya: After the fall of the Gokturks the Kangar union (659‚Äì750?) was based on the lower Syr Darya. They may have been a revived Kangju under Turkic rule. The Pechenegs (750‚Äì790, very uncertain) were either Kangars or replaced them.

The: 4-volume set (The History of Central Asia) 2018 the Oghuz drove them west where they fought Kievan Rus. Circa 790 one of the Oghuz leaders took the title of Yabgu. Around 985 one of his subjects broke with the Yabgu and founded the Seljuks. The so-called Oghuz Yabgu State was overthrown by the Seljuks in 1043. They were followed by the Qangli who lasted until the Mongol conquest. *Other Turkic peoples: The Kimek tribe lived north of the Kipchaks and moved west with them. Their ruler called himself Khan and he may have had some power over the Kipchaks. The Karluks remained in the east. The Qun (Kuns) (c. 1000-1100) were in western Dzungaria and around 1020 pushed the Kipchaks west. They either disappeared or reappeared in Hungary with the Kipchak/Cumans. The Tiele people were probably Turkic. Mongols and after * Mongols (1206-c. 1294): The Mongol Empire was founded in 1206, reached the Ural River about 1227 and reached the edge of western Europe by 1240. The Mongol Empire split into four parts: Golden Horde (west), Yuan dynasty (east), Chagatai Khanate (center) and the Il-Khans in Persia. *Golden Horde (c. 1241-c. 1504): The Mongol Empire gradually split into four parts. The western and central steppe became the Golden Horde. (But the Chagataids held Semirechye and, approximately, the land south of the Syr Darya.) Within a hundred years they adopted Islam and the Kipchak language of their subjects. They reached maximum power before 1350, decayed due to internal conflicts, lost outlying areas and broke up, the last khan dying about 1504. *Sibir (c. 1405-1582): North of the main steppe and east of the Urals, the Khanate of Sibir lasted until it was conquered by the Russians as they began the conquest of Siberia. *Abul-Khayr (c. 1428-67): As the Golden Horde was breaking up, Abu'l-Khayr Khan, a Shaybanid or descendant of Batu's brother, briefly unified the area from the Aral Sea north toward Siberia and east toward Lake Balkash. The term Uzbek appears about this time, originally meaning something like Shaybanid and later applied to Turkic speakers along the Oxus. thumb250 pxrightApproximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh j√ºz in the early 20th century. {    } *Kazakhs (c.1460‚Äìpresent): A group of Abu‚Äôl-Khayr's people broke off and settled in Semirechye. They came to be called Uzbek- Kazakhs, meaning something like free Uzbeks. Because of the disturbances following Abu‚Äôl-Khayr's death more Uzbeks joined them and the term Kazakh spread all over the central steppe. After about 1718 they divided into three Zhuzes. The Russians slowly gained power from 1730 and in 1845 the title of Khan was formally abolished. Kazakhstan became independent in 1991. *Nogai: Around 1500 the Kipchaks north of the Caspian came to be called the Nogai Horde and their name spread to all the Kipchaks west of the Kazakhs. Those on the western steppe were slowly destroyed by the Russians while those on the central steppe seem to have been absorbed by the Kazakhs and Kalmyks. *Kalmyks (1618‚Äì1771): The Kalmyks were Buddhist Mongols from Dzungaria. In 1618 they crossed the central steppe and settled north of the Caspian. In 1771 part of them returned to Dzungaria. *Russians (c. 1743-1991): In 1582‚Äì1639 Russians made themselves masters of the Siberian forests. In 1743 they founded Orenburg on the Ural River from which they watched the steppe and slowly gained control of the Kazakh country. See Russian conquest of Turkestan. Some Russian peasants settled along the northern steppe. Western civilization in its Russian or Soviet form transformed daily life while the results of the industrial revolution made steppe nomadism economically and militarily obsolete. In 1953‚Äì62 the Virgin lands campaign brought a significant number of Russians and Ukrainians to northern Kazakhstan.

The Megalopsychia Hunt of Antioch are two floor mosaics from the late fifth to early sixth century, part of a large group of mosaics known collectively as the Antioch mosaics. They were discovered at the ancient village of Yakto, near Daphne, a suburb of Antioch, near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey. They are representative of the trait or virtue of megalopsychia, which has been interpreted to mean arrogance or the belief of superiority and being worthy of great things and respect. One of the mosaics depicts a medallion with a woman holding a rose in one hand with scenes of animals attacking each other, then an outer ring surrounding it of six scenes of hunters taking down their prey. The mosaics are highly allegorical and carry deep symbolism that operates on multiple levels. One interpretation of these scenes is that they represent not only the strength of those depicted, but courage and the subjugation of the natural world by the ruler. It is a way of showing the assertion of order, bounty, and, above all, the victory or triumph of mankind over nature. Another interpretation would be that the female figure in the center is the representation of serenity of mind and logic, she is serene and undisturbed despite the violence surrounding her. The battles surrounding her show the various rises and falls of human society, the wars they wage, the victories won and the defeats suffered. The other mosaic has a lead male figure in a hunting scene where he is killing a lion, with men and horses fighting animals around him. He remains detached in much the same way the female figure was in the other medallion. One is accepting the world around her and the other is subjugating it to his will, both are apparently unaffected by the actions happening around them because they are meant to be above it. This detachment of the mind and spirit from turmoil is part of the ideal behind the virtue of megalopsychia.

Proving a failure in its designed role, it was repurposed as an experimental testbed for missile technology. Design and development The Gorgon missile program began in July 1943 at the Naval Aircraft Modification Unit in Warminster, Pennsylvania, and was intended to develop a family of small air-launched missiles for air-to-air and air-to-surface roles.Parsch 2005 The Gorgon IIA, the baseline design of the family, was of canard configuration, a conventional high-mounted monoplane wing providing lift; the structure was largely of laminated wood, while propulsion was by a Reaction Motors CML2N liquid-fuel rocket, fueled with monoethylamine and nitric acid.Bowman 1957, p.124. Intended for use intercepting bombers or transport aircraft, the Gorgon IIA was said to be the first American guided missile to be powered by a liquid-fueled rocket. It was fitted with a television guidance system, the pilot of the launching aircraft controlling the missile via radio based on the view from a camera mounted in the nose of the missile. Operational history Production of the Gorgon IIA, designated KA2N-1, was ordered from the Singer Manufacturing Company,Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p.181. a sewing machine manufacturer. A mockup of the missile's configuration was approved in March 1944,White 1991, p.36. and by April 1945, orders for 21 Gorgon IIA missiles had been confirmed, all of which would be built. However, initial flight tests of the system, beginning as unpowered glides early in 1945 and proceeding to fully powered guided trials in March 1945, showed that the guidance system was impractical; the closing speeds of the missile and its target were too great for the Gorgon IIA's limited maneuverability to allow the missile's operator to correctly steer the weapon. Despite this difficulty, the Gorgon IIA was the first jet- or rocket-powered radio-controlled aircraft to successfully fly in the United States. The control issues, combined with the overall immature state of missile technology, led to the Gorgon program being realigned as a testing program; the Gorgon IIA being redesignated in 1946 as KU2N-1, then CTV-4 in 1947, and finally as CTV-N-4 in 1948; the CTV designation reflecting its status as a control test vehicle, although the program was largely concluded by that point. Despite the difficulties with its guidance system, the Gorgon IIA was considered aerodynamically satisfactory. Gorgon IIB A turbojet-powered version of the Gorgon II missile, Gorgon IIB, was also ordered, with four examples being contracted for; the project was cancelled due to a lack of suitable engines.

She served as a medical missionary in China under commission from the Methodist Episcopal Board of Missions from 1908 to 1950 alongside her husband Rev. Francis Gale, a religious missionary. Committed to a lifetime of unpaid social activism, Gale's work emphasized an approach to patient care that focused on preventative care and public health, humane treatment, and consideration for the whole patient, entailing concern for physical, spiritual, and intellectual needs. She also had evangelical motives and sought to promote the status of Chinese women. Gale's years of service in China coincided with major political developments of the time, including the Chinese Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Sino-American alliance during World War II, and implementation of a Communist government. The political and cultural climates created by these events had a great impact on Gale's work both in determining the needs she was to respond to and in influencing interactions between the Gales and the Chinese populations they served. Gale kept active correspondence with her supporters back in the American home field. As a female surgeon in the twentieth century who wrote about her medical successes and spoke at public events, Gale broke into fields dominated by men in the twentieth century‚Äîmedicine and public speaking‚Äîand gave credibility to women's capability for professionalism and leadership. Her readers were encouraged to consider women as active players in the international realm rather than solely restricted to the domestic sphere. At the same time, historians have noted Gale's role in uplifting upper-middle class white Protestant women at the expense of Chinese women, whose religious practices (or lack thereof) and non- Western medicine she considered inferior. Gale returned to New York in 1950 and died in 1958 at the age of 79.  Background  = Early life = Ailie Gale was born in 1878 in Bozeman, Montana to Moses Harrison Spencer, a Methodist circuit rider and dentist, and Elizabeth Spencer. She had one brother, John Spencer. Her upbringing was shaped by her father's fundamentalist beliefs, which allowed for no dissent and no fun. Rather, education and religious piety were highly emphasized. = Education = Gale began attending Colorado College at age 20 while working as a housekeeper and cook in order to financially support herself. Despite the death of her parents and increasing financial hardship after graduation, Gale continued her education at Cooper Medical College in San Francisco in 1902. There, she became involved with the Epworth League and Student Volunteer Movement, serving on missionary trips and eventually becoming president of the Student Volunteer chapter of the University of California at Berkeley. In 1905, she received her medical degree with specialization in surgery. While on furlough from her missionary work in Nanchang in 1922, Gale took postgraduate medical courses at Columbia Medical College in preparation for her work in Tunki Anhwei. = Personal life = Ailie Spencer married Francis Gale, then a theology student, in 1905, thereby changing her name to Ailie Gale. Although her husband received a salary that she did not, Francis Gale himself recognized and was often involved in Ailie's work. He was one of her most vocal supporters. Together, they raised four children, three sons and an adopted Chinese daughter, Mary Gao Chen. Gale found Mary abandoned at the gate of the Nanchang Hospital as a one-month-old. While Mary was raised as Christian, Mary's upbringing also emphasized her Chinese identity as she was taught the Chinese language and wore traditional clothes.Pioneer Chinese Christian Women : Gender, Christianity, and Social Mobility, edited by Jessie G. Lutz, Lehigh University Press, 2010. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/upenn- ebooks/detail.action?docID=3115906. Gale impressed upon her from childhood the importance of her future role in serving the Chinese people and the precedence public service work took over marriage. Mary grew up to become a nurse working in public health, expressing interest in Chinese politics as well as showing talent as a leader and administrator.  Medical Missionary Work in China  = Call to Mission Work = Although Gale received her medical degree, she did not take state board examinations, determined to utilize her medical skills in the mission rather than in America. Additionally, opportunities for medical work were scant for women in America, who faced discrimination in the male-dominated field; Gale was one of only 4 women in her graduating class from Cooper Medical College. China, on the other hand, had many opportunities for women physicians on account of the Manchu abdication of 1911 and new Republican government's recognition of Western medicine after the North Manchurian Plague of 1910 and 1911, and a dire dearth of physicians that left Chinese communities underserved. Nevertheless, there still existed some conflict over the imposition of Western medicine over traditional Chinese healing practices. Gale's mission work was also driven by a desire to spread Christianity, and especially to empower women through Christianity, rather than professional gain. She worked in Nanchang, Tunki, the Shanghai American School, Nanking, and Tzechow as an administrator and physician/surgeon in hospitals, dispensaries, and schools. = Nanchang, Kiangsi: 1908-21 = Gale's arrival in Nanchang in 1908 with her husband and sons Otis Spencer and Lester Sinclair coincided with the death of the Empress Dowager, which signaled a break from traditional Chinese society and the beginning of the acceptance of Western medicine by 1911. Here, Gale held three positions at Methodist institutions. She worked as chief administer at the Nanchang General Hospital until 1922, the only physician available to serve thirty hospital beds and two outside dispensaries until 1920, the year she finally had a Chinese physician join as her assistant.Lacy, Walter N. 1947. A hundred years of China Methodism. Nashville, TN: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press.Isham, Mrs. George (Mary). 1913. \\"Our organization and Task.\\" In Our work for the world, compiled by Mrs. William McDowell. Boston: Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, Methodist Episcopal Church.China Christian Advocate (CCA). 1912-35. Official organ in China of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Shanghai: Methodist Publishing House. She was also the school physician and industrial class teacher for the Stephen L. Baldwin Memorial Girls' School starting in 1910 and provided medical services for the Women's Foreign Missionary Society's Women and Children's Hospital. In addition to overseeing and performing most of the medical work and surgical operations in each location, Gale also made house calls. All social classes were accounted for: treatment for the poor was free, financed by fees to upper-class patients. She also served as a role model for female independence \\"the rapidly growing numbers of modernized Chinese women\\" as Chinese women \\"began their fight for a public role in the new democracy\\" and built a close relationship with the women she served. She further encouraged interaction through invitations to eat dinner with \\"interesting Chinese guests\\" in published letters in Woman's Missionary Friend. = Tunki, Anhwei: 1923-27 = After returning home to complete postgraduate medical courses at Columbia Medical College, the Gale family again arrived in China in the Tunki area in 1923 with three male nurses trained by Gale in Nanchang. The Board had commissioned Rev. Gale to continue evangelical work and Dr. Gale to take over medical work. Gale's time in Tunki was characterized by two major complications: lack of funding and rising anti-foreign sentiment in China. By the 1920s, post-WWI disillusionment, as well as financially stressed Protestant churches, had contributed to the loss of interest in missionary work. As a result, funding from Methodist Episcopal Church Board became scarce, even threatening to force the Gales to leave their missionary post in Tunki altogether. However, Gale took advantage of the increasingly important relationship she had with supporters in the home field and was able to continue medical work, including building the Tunki General Hospital, relying solely upon monetary donations and gifts. Her letters became even more emphatic in relating how vital these gifts were as well as the gratitude of Chinese patients. She also raised money from local Chinese contributions and medical fees to wealthier patients. The rise of anti-imperialist and anti- Christian sentiment and protests as a result of the growing Chinese Nationalist Movement antagonized the relationship between missionaries, seen by many as representatives of Western domination, and the local Chinese population. However, Gale was able to evade attack because of her connections with a local government school, hiring graduates as nurses and befriending Buddhist teachers and students there. This relationship extended military protection over the Tunki Hospital, where Gale treated both Southern and Northern soldiers. Gale had the full support of Tunki officials, receiving a Merit Board from military officials, soldiers, and the police commissioner as they asked the Gales to remain in Tunki.Ibid., Gale to Burtis, 13 February 1927, 4-5 to 12. Gale ran a self-directed and self-administered public health campaign starting in 1925 with malaria as its main target issue. Putting a spin on the nationalist \\"kill the Japs\\" pamphlets widely distributed by students at the time, Gale and her nurses handed out \\"kill the fly\\" pamphlets.Frank C. Gale Collection. Ailie Gale correspondence, 1904-50. The campaign culminated in a week of public health in May 1926 with health parades of school children, nurses, and religious workers carrying banners and Chinese national flags, sanitation lectures held by hospital representatives, and musical entertainment. It was widely popular among Tunki residents, and attendants included the police force and members of the Chamber of Commerce. The campaign was seen as a great success, both educating and encouraging enthusiasm among the Tunki population. Afterwards, wire screen covers were manufactured by the Tunki population and widely used in candy and fruit shops as protection against mosquitoes. = The Shanghai American School: 1927-33 = In April 1927, the American Consulate ordered an evacuation from Tunki in response to escalating anti-foreign sentiment and the potential for violent attacks. The Gales, along with over 75,000 other foreigners, moved to Shanghai where Ailie Gale became a physician and preceptress at the Shanghai American School. The missionary station in Tunki was eventually closed by the Board in December 1931 due to lack of funding, exacerbated by the worldwide depression. = Nanking: 1933-39 = During her time in Nanking, Methodist missionary objectives shifted to emphasize the economic and social needs of rural China rather than evangelical efforts in response to the deteriorating economy. Gale continued her work in a holistic approach to preventative health at two clinics, established by herself, and Ginling College, established by women's Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian societies to \\"offer special courses in premedical sciences, in education,\\" and \\"in religion, fitting women students for service in the three fields of ministry to the needs of body, mind and spirit\\".Boyd, Nancy. 1986. Emissaries: The overseas work of the American YWCA 1895-1970. New York: The Women's Press. Gale was satisfied with her placement in the College as it, with its faculty and Nationalist government backing, promoted education in order to empower a more active public role for women. Here, she held a public health clinic, once performing three hundred physical exams within one week. In addition to her role as a physician, Gale was also an educator and saw herself as a role model who collaborated with her students on public health projects and invited them to her home for meals. Gale became closely associated with the Nationalist movement through her interest in the social programs for rural Chinese populations proposed by the New Life Movement and a friendly relationship with George Shepherd, one of the main Western advisors of the movement appointed by Chiang Kai-Shek. Shepherd would often room in the Gales' home while traveling, and it was through him and his close affiliation with Chiang that Gale would learn much of the latest political happenings that she would later relate to her readers. = Tzechow, Tzechung: 1941-47 = Gale served as hospital administrator for 5 years at Chadwick Memorial Hospital. Her responsibilities included overseeing women's clinics, nurses in the hospital, and religious work. As the hospital was struggling from lack of funding and nurse shortages upon her arrival, she also took on a role managing finances and taking on duties usually filled by nurses with some of the infant patients there. She worked towards a goal of restoring the hospital's reputation and establishing trust between the hospital and the populations it served. She was also concerned with making medical care more accessible for the poor. To these ends, Gale was successful in renovating the hospital and nurses' quarters as well as acquiring modern technology such as an x-ray machine and ultimately in attracting more patients to the Chadwick Hospital. She also began a half-time day school for poor Chinese children in 1942 and set up a \\"poor fund\\" that allowed the hospital to provide services to those who could not pay. Much of this was made possible by supporter contributors from the home field. Due to rising political tension and the invasion of Japanese troops in 1944, the American embassy at Chungking ordered the evacuation of missionaries in 1945. Gale initially refused, citing full faith in the Allied forces' ability to quell violence, but ultimately left in the following years to reunite with her husband, recently released from a Japanese internment camp, as she recognized escalating political conflict. = Nanchang: 1947-50 = Gale returned to Nanchang in June 1947, joining her husband again at the Nanchang General Hospital which had been completely restored and staffed after destruction during Japanese occupation. Gale instead turned her attention to the Nanchang Boys' Academy, which at the time had neither a nurse nor a doctor. During these later years of service, she suffered from illness and an infected kidney; nevertheless, she continued work and ran the boys' clinic, seeing about 200 boys daily, and raised funds for medical supplies. Throughout her years in China, Gale had protested Communism for its opposition to religion, as a Methodist and believer in Christian social activism herself, and for its rule that everyone must work to eat, as she believed that the most needy of society needed to be considered in a different light. Ultimately it was the Communist victory of Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 that necessitated her final departure out of China as the Methodist Episcopal Board gave formal orders that cut all foreign personnel. On August 14, 1950, she returned to New York.  Legacy  = Correspondence with Supporters = Throughout her time as a medical missionary, Gale maintained a close relationship with her supporters through quarterly letters that were widely distributed through journals, newsletters, church services, and both secular and religious newspapers.Robert, Dana L. ‚ÄúThe Influence of American Missionary Women on the World Back Home.‚Äù Religion and American Culture: A Journal of Interpretation, vol. 12, no. 1, 2002, pp. 59‚Äì89. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/rac.2002.12.1.59. This close connection proved essential in times when Gale's missionary funds ran low and her work became substantially funded through supporter contributions. To this end, Gale focused on communicating her many medical successes (rather than failures) and the gratitude of Chinese patients in order to recognize the significance of contributor participation in her missionary work and maintain her audience. Gale's letters also played a significant role in shaping the perception of women's roles in society as well as influencing the perception of China and Chinese women by the American public. = Women's Roles in America = Women's missionary societies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the first organized women's movement for American churches, allowing typically white, upper-middle-class women to take on a greater role in the public sphere than before. Gale's medical missionary work and correspondence with her supporters was notable for the ways in which she broke into male-dominated fields and represented her own success. She challenged the notion that women were incapable of taking on leadership roles or performing complicated surgeries as she did both, successfully, in the many hospitals and clinics she ran in China, overseeing populations of over 1 million. Her position, as self- represented in her letters, was as a powerful older woman and role model for both American and Chinese women. Further credibility was given through the frequent commendations she received from both Chinese and missionary men for her work. Gale's respected status also validated her approach to medicine, typically regarded as \\"feminine\\" and therefore inferior, which focused on preventative care and concern for the patient over highly scientific and emotionless diagnosis of disease. Although public speaking was typically restricted for women, Gale's religious drive led her to engage in frequent speaking engagements during her time in America between‚Äîshe \\"spoke confidently because she believed that prayer would bring guidance from the Holy Spirit.\\" Gale's active interest and involvement in Chinese politics encouraged her female audience in America to participate in public and international affairs; often she would emphasize the precedence social work took over marriage. One woman supporter inspired by Gale's work was lifelong friend Miss Priscilla Burtis, a home field missionary and parishioner who distributed many of Gale's letters and dedicated her life to social activism, never marrying. = Role in Sino-American Relations = American missionaries in the 20th century played a significant role in shaping the public's perception of world affairs as they \\"put a human face on foreign peoples and cultures for ordinary Americans.\\" Gale's letters portrayed her close relationship with the Chinese patients, students, nurses, and other community members she interacted with on a daily basis, thereby bringing her American audience closer to what was largely a foreign people. In particular her readers grew attached to Gale's adopted daughter Mary Gao through the intimate stories Gale would relate about her growth in her letters, and Gale frequently expressed her respect for the Chinese authorities and healthcare workers she worked with. Gale's projection of a strong, accessible, and respectable China contrasted drastically with common perceptions through the early 1900s of China as servile and weak with a backwards culture and government and ultimately had a significant role in shaping public opinion because her letters reached such a wide audience.Pattison, Erin, \\"Changing Perceptions of China in 1930s America\\" (2012). All Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). 769. http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/etd/769 This was especially notable during World War II as it was the willingness of the public to support China that shaped American foreign policy and the Sino-American alliance. Gale was one of many missionaries who influenced a national effort put in place by President Roosevelt to donate to relief for China through the American Red Cross during the 1930s-40s. Despite Gale's respect for Chinese culture and acceptance of traditional Chinese religions such as Buddhism as a Liberal Protestant who allowed a more flexible interpretation of her religion, she was still committed in her mission to bring Christianity to China and has been described as a cultural imperialist, like many women Christian missionaries.Shemo, C. (2012), Directions in Scholarship on American Women and Protestant Foreign Mission: Debates Over ‚ÄúCultural Imperialism‚Äù. History Compass, 10: 270‚Äì283. doi:10.1111/j.1478-0542.2012.00831.x = Honors = Gale was recognized by many Chinese authorities throughout her years of service. Often she would receive commendations and merit boards, such as a 1918 proclamation by Nanchang's chief of Police Yien Ngen-yung that described Gale as \\"an American eminent doctor of medicine. Since she has taken charge of Nanchang Hospital all her surgical operations have been very successful.\\"Ibid. Translation of merit board presented by Dr. Gale by chief of police. Chao Tai ying, Dr. Dung's Almond Forest. Yien Ngen yung, chief of police for Kiangsi Province, November 1918, 1 page. This proclamation reached even secular audiences when it was printed in the San Francisco Examiner in 1919.The San Francisco Examiner, 18 May 1919, Chinese honor Bay City woman, public recognition accorded work of Dr. Ailie S. Gale of Oakland by official. Civil Governor Tsi of the Ministry of Home Affairs at Peking recognized her with a merit board, celebrated with a parade down the streets and posted on a public wall. For providing medical services to soldiers of the Northern and Southern armies during her time in Anhwei, she was given memorial tablets from both armies. She received a written tribute from the China Inland Missionary for her forty years of service in China, which included recognition from Chinese colleagues for her professionalism as a surgeon and medical doctor, bravery, and generosity.

Background into disappearance Kevin Palmer worked as a timeshare salesman in M√°laga, Spain, where his wife and daughter lived with him. For reasons that were never explained, he travelled to the UK on 12 March 1999 with the intention of visiting Newcastle, but in fact went to Titchfield in Hampshire instead. He spent the evening of 12 March at the Abshot Hotel and Country Club with at least four other people, before getting a taxi to Bishop's Waltham with two men (John Howett and Juan Arribas) and a woman. An argument broke out however between Palmer and his two male companions, and the trio left the cab. Arribas and Howett returned to the cab without Palmer and drove off. Palmer was never seen again. His suitcase was never recovered, nor was the taxi driver ever identified. Developments Howett and Arribas claimed that they fought with Palmer and left him lying on the ground of an industrial estate, still alive. In 2003, Hampshire police stated that they were treating Palmer's disappearance as suspicious. Howett was arrested and his home was searched for clues, although he was never charged due to insufficient evidence. At the time, Howett was serving a 12-year sentence for drug smuggling. Another man was interviewed in Spain. A 2009 inquest into Palmer's disappearance resulted in an open verdict, since the coroner felt there was not enough evidence of unlawful killing, although he did also accuse Howett and Arribas of not telling the truth. Witnesses told conflicting stories of what happened afterwards - either Palmer died and his corpse was buried; or alternatively he recovered, went to Newcastle and was never seen again. In 2014, police searched the garden of a pub in Fareham for evidence that Palmer was buried there, but found no clues.

Biography  Born in Strasbourg, Vogt followed his parents to Paris at a very young age, where he entered the Conservatoire de Paris on 7 July 1798 and became a pupil of Fran√ßois Sallantin for oboe. He made such rapid progress that he was awarded the First Prize of this instrument at the end of the following year. He later attended the harmony course of Jean-Baptiste Rey at the same school. He entered the orchestra of the Th√©√¢tre Montansier as second oboe in 1798, then left the orchestra and went on to join that of the Ambigu- Comique, from where he passed, on 31 May 1801, to the Com√©die Italienne of the Theatre de la victoire, as its first oboe. Vogt then followed Emperor Napoleon as oboist of the music of the Imperial Guard during the 1805 campaign. At the same time as the Battle of Austerlitz, he met Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna. Back in Paris, he was the first oboe of the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau and kept this post until 1814. He then joined the Paris Opera as successor of his master Sallantin. He remained there until 1854, the time of his retirement. After he became a member of the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire at the time of his institution in 1838, he was attached to it as its first oboe until 1844. In 1835, he was called to London for the season as first oboe of the Philharmonic Society. In 1838, Vogt made a second trip to London and spent the season there, sought after for his talent in all musical societies. Back in Paris, he returned to his position as first oboe of the Soci√©t√© des concerts du Conservatoire, where he was as much noticed by the beauty of the sound he derived from the instrument as by the quality of his performance. As early as 1808, he had been appointed assistant professor of oboe at the Conservatory, where he became a full professor during the new organization of 1816. He formed there all the French oboists who made a name for themselves at that time, particularly Henri Brod, Stanislas Verroust, Vinit, Barr√©, Lavigne, de La Barre and many others. Appointed first oboe of the King's Chapell in 1815, he retained this position until the 1830 July Revolution. In 1839, he was awarded the Order of the L√©gion d'honneur.

In Russia this plant is known as the \\"Klopovka\\", or \\"the stink-bug berry,\\" due to its distinct, potent scent, resembling that of a secretion produced by bugs of Heteroptera genus. The plant is native to Kamchatka but can be found in North America to Eastern Asia. Mostly growing in the wild, it is also enjoyed as an ornamental plant, most commonly in Japan, where it is used to decorate home gardens. Like many other species in the family Ericaceae, its berries are edible.  Description  Vaccinium praestans is a herbaceous, slow growing perennial shrub, that can grow up to tall in an average growing season. The bark of the stem is a yellowish, gray color and grows almost horizontal with the ground. It has small leafy branches, approximately in length, that extend out, away from its stem. Its leaves are shaped either obovate or orbicular around the head and then taper to a narrower base. These leaves are fairly thin but stiff, usually 2‚Äì6 cm long and are serrulate around the edge. The leaves are known to change color several times a season, from bright green to a purple-red color The Vaccinium praestans flowers in June‚ÄìJuly. Its flowers range from pinkish-white to pink in color with yellowish corollas, and are in length. Later in summer It will fruit a delicious, juicy bright red berry, that can grow up to in diameter. It is referred to as \\"the stinkbug berry\\" due to its characteristic, very pronounced odor that resembles the smell of bugs. Vaccinium praestans berries  Distribution  The plant is native to Kamchatka, Eastern Russia. It ranges from Northern America to Eastern Asia, in spruce, fir and deciduous forests. It is found in higher elevations and slopes, growing in mossy bogs, marshes and swampy woods, often off of rotting fallen tree trunks. It is endemic to the Mountain Taiga region of Primorye, Kamchatka, Khabarovsk Region, Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands (Kunashir, Shikotan, Etorofu Simushir, Uruppu Keta), Honshu, and Hokkaido.  Ecology  Vaccinium praestans is a hardy plant that can grow in harsh cold climates. However, it requires shelter from strong winds and needs insulation from snow and leafs to protect its roots in freezing temperatures. It is best suited for slightly sandy, loamy soils. It also prefers moderately moist, mesic soils with a high acidity, ranging in PH from 4.5 to 6. It can quickly become chlorotic if lime is present in the soil, which means it won't produce enough chlorophyll and its green leaves will become a pale yellow to yellow-white color. It also does not like root disturbances or stagnant water at the roots, preferring moist, yet well drained soils but can not tolerate drought. The plant can grow in semi- shady conditions, but fruits best when in full sunlight. = Reproduction = It flowers hermaphroditic flowers in June‚ÄìJuly that are pollinated by bees. Otherwise new plants can be raised from seed.  Cultivation  This plant is commonly grown in home gardens as an ornamental plant, especially for decorative ground cover, which also fruits a delicious berry as a bonus. In order to grow it from a seed, it is advised to plant the seeds in late winter in a pot, and just barely cover them in dirt. Seeds may require three months of cold to stratify. They are known to germinate very slowly, taking up to a year to sprout. Once seedlings are tall, the pot should be placed in a greenhouse in a lightly shaded area for its first winter. After that, it should be ready to be planted in a permanent location, usually in late spring or early summer, after last expected frost. In climates with cold winters roots must be protected from freezing, and it is commonly done by covering the plant under a pile of leaves before the coming of cold season.  Taxonomy  Vaccinium praestans is a part of the family Ericaceae, which includes species like cranberries, blueberries, and huckleberries. Ericaceae is a family of flowering plants known to be a part of the heath or heather family, usually found growing in acidic and considered infertile soil conditions. The word \\"Vaccinium\\" means \\"huckleberry\\" in Latin and the word \\"praestans\\" means \\"excellent\\" or \\"outstanding\\".  Chemical constituents  The berry contains ascorbic (70‚Äì100 mg%) and benzoic acids, rich in flavonoids and other P-active compounds, also tannins and various microelements. Under- and overripe berries have significantly lower percentage of useful chemical components.  Culinary and Medicinal uses  The berries this plant fruits are known for their ambiguous flavor, which however dissipates when the berries are boiled. The berries can be eaten raw, and exhibit peculiar gustatory characteristics: they are first sweet and then sour, then fade to a bitter, but salty aftertaste. In the confectionery industry, these berries are used in making jellies and jams, preparations of marmalade, soft drinks, and pastries. The berry juice improves digestion and possesses tonic properties. It also helps alleviate common cold and flu. The plant and its berries find use in folk medicine, believed to help with prostate hypertrophy, fever, paralysis, edema, gout, and is used to treat hypertension, due to its effectiveness in reducing blood pressure. However, the berries can cause severe allergic reactions not only though ingestion but also through smell alone.  History of Lamb  The name ‚ÄúLamb.‚Äù in the scientific name, Vaccinium praestans Lamb. is an unresolved name, meaning it is not established as either an accepted name or as a synonym with original publication details. Lamb. is the standard botanical author abbreviation or scientific name, applied to species Aylmer Bourke Lambert described. Lambert lived from 1761 to 1842 and was a British botanist who studied at St Mary Hall, Oxford, in England. Lambert is responsible for assembling an important herbarium collection with 50,000 preserved plant specimens and even now his specimens can be found in botanical collections around the world. However, after Lambert's death, his herbarium collections and library were auctioned off, which has led to obscurities in its history and may be why the use of \\"Lamb.\\" is unresolved.

It takes its name from a wadi, or waterway, west of Sohar in Oman and follows on from the Umm al-Nar culture. Although archaeologists have traditionally tended to view the differences in human settlements and burials between the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods as the result of major external disruption (climate change, the collapse of trade or threat of war), contemporary opinion has moved towards a gradual change in human society which is centred around more sophisticated approaches to animal husbandry as well as changes in the surrounding trade and social environments.  History  Wadi Suq burial at Shimal, near Ras Al Khaimah The transition between Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq is thought to have taken some 200 years and more, with finds at the important Wadi Suq site of Tell Abraq in modern Umm Al Qawain showing evidence of the continuity of Umm al-Nar burials. Evidence of increased mobility among the population points to a gradual change in human habits rather than sudden change and important Wadi Suq era sites such as Tell Abraq, Ed Dur, Seih Al Harf, Shimal and Kalba show an increasing sophistication in copper and bronze ware as well as trade links both east to the Indus Valley and west to Mesopotamia. Wadi Suq era pottery is also seen as more refined and distinctive, with finds of painted ware common, and the development of soft- stone vessels. Studies of human remains from the period do point to a process of aridification taking place over the centuries contiguous between the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods, but do not support a sudden or cataclysmic movement or societal change rather a gradual shift in culture. The Wadi Suq people not only domesticated camels, but there is evidence they also planted crops of wheat, barley and dates. A gradual shift away from coastal to inland settlements took place through the period.  Burials  Some of the most obvious evidence of the change in human habits and society following the Umm Al Nar period can be found in the distinctive burials of the Wadi Suq people, notably in Shimal in Ras Al Khaimah where over 250 burial sites are located. In some cases, cut stone from Umm Al Nar burials has been used to build Wadi Suq graves. Wadi Suq burials are long chambers entered from the side and many have been found to have been used for subsequent burials. Although Shimal has the most extensive Wadi Suq burials, grave sites are to be found throughout the UAE and Oman and vary from simple barrows to sophisticated structures. The notable Jebel Buhais burial ground, the oldest radiometrically dated burial site in the UAE, is an extensive necropolis, consisting of burial sites spanning the Stone, Iron, Bronze and Hellenistic ages of human settlement in the UAE. The widespread area of burials exhibits a number of important Wadi Suq tombs, including a unique clover-leaf shaped burial chamber, but has no evidence of Umm Al Nar era burials, although there are burials representing later eras, including the Hellenistic. The clover-shaped Wadi Suq period tomb at Jebel Buhais, BHS 66 stands as a unique piece of funerary architecture in the UAE.  Artefacts  Wadi Suq electrum alloy plaque, found at Qattara Oasis. Wadi Suq era weaponry shows a marked increase in sophistication, with an explosion in metallurgy taking place in the region. A number of tombs have been found with hundreds of weapons and other metal artefacts and long swords, bows and arrows became the predominant weapons. Long swords found at Qattara, Qidfa, Qusais and Bidaa bint Saud are double-edged and hilted. Light throwing spears also marked the weaponry of the time. Many of these weapons were cast in bronze. One grave excavated in Shimal had no fewer than 18 fine bronze arrowheads. Another explosive growth industry in the Wadi Suq era was the production of soft-stone vessels. While in the preceding Umm al-Nar era these were distinctively decorated with dotted circles, they now gained incised patterns of lines and are found in some profusion. The relative wealth and growing metallurgical sophistication of the Wadi Suq people is displayed by finds of jewellery, including gold and electrum plaques depicting back to back animals. Ongoing links with both Dilmun and the Indus Valley have been demonstrated.

She settled and worked in Britain and became an active member of the Newlyn School of artists and the nearby Lamorna artists colony. Biography Hughes was born in Christchurch in New Zealand, and studied at Canterbury Art College. In 1900 she won a medal from the Canterbury Fine Art Society for a series of drawings of trees. Her parents were originally from the west country of England and she choose to study art in England. She first visited Britain to study with C N Worsley between 1901 and 1903 and also, for a short while, attended the School of Painting and Drawing run by Stanhope Forbes and Elizabeth Forbes in Newlyn. In 1907 Hughes returned to England to study at Frank Spenlove's Yellow Door Studio in London before returning to Newlyn to study at the Forbes School. In Newlyn, she met and, in January 1910 at St Buryan's Church, married a fellow student, the painter Robert Morson Hughes. The couple designed and built their own home, Chyangweal, near St Buryan. The house became a regular social centre for the artists settled in the area. Eleanor Hughes was a skilled pianist and would lead recitals at the house. In Cornwall the couple became lifelong friends with Laura Knight and her husband Harold Knight, both of whom painted them a number of times. Hughes owned her own studio in the Lamorna valley where she created landscape paintings, often featuring the stone walls, waterfalls and streams of the local area. Hughes also painted in France and the Pyrenees on a regular basis. From 1911, she exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and eventually with the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. In total Hughes had some 37 pictures shown at the Royal Academy. In 1933 she was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. As well as in galleries in Newlyn and St Ives, Hughes also had works shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. Hughes sold her studio in 1940 and appears to have produced little after doing so. She died in Lamorna in 1959.

Nelepp's life trajectory from farmhand to celebrated opera singer was marked by two youthful choices‚Äîjoining the Russian Revolution as a member of the Red Army and successfully auditioning for a place in the opera-singing course at the Leningrad Conservatory despite having no previous musical training. Life Of Cossack ancestry, Nelepp was born in Bobruiki, Chernigov Governorate in today's Ukraine. A grandmother of Polish nobility and an uncle employed by the railroad kept the family from hardship. However, both died when Georgii was a boy, and he was set to work to support the family on a landlord's farm.

A cavalryman, he was assigned to units in Ukraine that punished deserters and collected food taxes, i.e., confiscated grain from peasants. According to Russian historian Suzanne Ament, both assignments would likely have exposed him to violence. Deserters and uncooperative peasants alike were shot. For the rest of his life, Nelepp belonged to the Communist Party and served in various capacities, e.g., as Party Secretary of the Bolshoi Theatre and, beginning in 1954, on the Stalin Prize Committee. He enjoyed the privileges of Party membership, such as owning a car in which he took family and friends fishing. Nelepp has been criticized for denouncing persons to the Stalin regime. In her autobiography, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, his co-star in Fidelio, described an incident in which a woman came to the Bolshoi Theater and spat on Nelepp, claiming he had destroyed her family.Galina: A Russian Story.

Encyclopaedia Universalis. Retrieved 28 April 2020 As a young soldier in Ukraine, Nelepp met and married his wife Nadezhda Feodorovna Gregorieva. Later, he would refer to her as his muse. She sacrificed her own musical career for his. As a member of the Young Communist League, Nelepp obtained transfer to Leningrad, where he entered a military topographical school, graduating in 1927. Although he had no formal music education, he nevertheless enjoyed playing the violin and harmonica, and above all singing. In 1927, his wife‚Äîwho was studying to teach music‚Äîalong with some of his friends persuaded him to audition for admission to the Leningrad Conservatory. Hearing Nelepp sing, director Alexander Glazunov appraised the untrained tenor's potential as follows: \\"Superb material (dramatic tenor). His voice is fully blended throughout the registers, metallic, exceptionally beautiful timbre, natural resonance, pure intonation, good musical and rhythmical ability, appearance on stage: promising.\\"Malisch, Kurt. Georgi Nelepp: Lebendige Vergangenheit (1993). CD insert. Competing with a thousand applicants for admission to the Conservatory, Nelepp won one of seven openings. He completed a five-year Conservatory program in three years and was offered a contract at Leningrad's premiere Kirov Theater. His teacher Joseph Tomars trained him to sing both lyric and dramatic tenor parts. He debuted in the lyric role of Lensky in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. Writing about the performance ten years later, E. Ol‚Äôkhovskii described Nelepp's characterization of the romantic hero, which played upon Lensky's weakness, femininity, and hypersensitivity. It won \\"the blessing of the audience.\\"Ol‚Äôkhovskii, E. \\"Put‚Äô pevtsa.\\"/\\"The path of a singer\\" Iskusstvo i zhizn‚Äô/Art and life 1939, no. 4: pp. 31-32. Unpublished English translation by Suzanne Ament. Thus, critic Ivan Sollertinsky predicted Nelepp would be a world class opera star. Renowned Russian tenor Leonid Sobinov commented on the performance: \\"Georgy Nelepp possesses superb vocal material, a beautiful timbre and a sure instinct for dramatic accentuation. I am fully convinced that he is by far the most promising newcomer in sight.\\" In 1939 Nelepp \\"was deemed a sensation\\" and rose to stardom, according to Malisch, in the role of Matiushenko in the world premiere of Oles' Chishko's (Battleship Potemkin. In the years to come, Nelepp would collaborate with composers of Soviet operas, who valued his real experience of the conditions they were theatrically depicting. In 1944, Nelepp left the Kirov to join the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, where he performed until his death from heart disease in 1957 at the age of 53. Artistic achievement With a repertoire of 50 roles, Nelepp sang the dramatic tenor parts in classical Russian operas including the title role in Sadko, the Pretender in Boris Godunov, Gherman in Pique Dame, Czarevitch Guidon in The Tale of Tsar Saltan, Sobinin in Ivan Susanin, Yuri in The Enchantress, Finn in Ruslan and Ludmilla, Tucha in The Maid of Pskov, Toropka in Askold's Grave, Jontek in Halka, Jenik in The Bartered Bride, Andrey in Mazeppa, Vakula in The Slippers, and Golitsin and Andrey in Khovanshchina. He portrayed Kachovsky in Shaporin's The Decembrists. Nelepp was also known for his portrayals in European operas of Florestan in Fidelio, Radames in Aida, and Don Jose in Carmen. He recorded arias from the roles of Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly, Walther in Die Meistersinger, and El√©azar in La Juive. Nelepp took part in 20 recordings of complete operas. During his career of 27 years, he sang in more than 1600 performances.Bolshoi Digest of 21 April 2014. Retrieved 28 April 2020.

Stalin's Music Prize: Soviet Culture and Politics. (New Haven: Yale University Press) pp. 313, 320, 322. Nelepp was and still is known for the beautiful quality of his voice and for his memorable characterizations. He is likewise remembered for his sense of humor, perfectionism, and work ethic. Interviewed for a Russian documentary about Nelepp, opera director Boris Alexandrovich Pokrovsky recalled how the tenor continually asked for even the slightest suggestions to improve his facial expressions, hand gestures, posture and any other conveyance of his character. Rehearsing with Nelepp, he reflected, \\"we felt the process of creating an image, the process of the emergence of a living person on the stage, who understands, suffers and loves.\\"\\"Georgy Nalepp\\". Kino Teatr. Retrieved 28 April 2020 . In a radio program about Nelepp, contemporary Russian opera singer Sergei Givargizova noted that Nelepp often broke with the conventional portrayals of the characters he played. It was difficult to surprise Leningrad, Givargizova observed, but Nelepp did it in his rendering of Lensky in his debut. Givargizova considered Gherman in Pique Dame to have been Nelepp's greatest role. Gherman was stereotypically portrayed as a mentally unstable gambling addict. However, Nelepp's more complicated interpretation incorporated admirable qualities, conveying, for example, that Gherman gambled to provide for his beloved Lisa. Thus, Nelepp's Gherman closely resembled Pushkin's portrayal of the character in the story that is the basis of the opera. According to Givargizova, Nelepp would typically follow the director's interpretation of a role, but with increasing rehearsal, arrive at his own. If necessary, he would argue for it, albeit not always successfully. In his day, Nelepp had a large public following. Frolova- Walker refers to him as \\"a celebrity tenor.\\" However, compared to the marketing of celebrities today, the Bolshoi Theater‚Äôs promotion of Nelepp was minimal, due in part perhaps to his death at the early age of 53. He is visually memorialized in only a small cache of photographs and two videos of him performing. The impressions of contemporary opera fans suggest his staying power decades after his death. In a 1999 Gramophone review of a 1948 recording of Boris Godunov featuring Nelepp, John Warrack writes, ‚ÄúAmong the tenors, there is a splendid Grigory from Georgy Nelepp, his high, clear voice in splendid estate, his characterization of this Pretender strong and suggesting determination and not merely obsession.‚ÄùWarrack, John (November 1999). \\"Mussorgsky, Boris Godunov\\".

It is situated in Alcamo, a town rich with ancient buildings and beautiful churches. We do not know the name of the architect who planned it, but it is very similar to Villa Paino in Palermo, also belonging to the family Chiarelli Rossotti, and whose plan is assigned to the engineer Francesco Naselli of Ernesto Basile school.Roberto Calia: I Palazzi dell'aristocrazia e della borghesia alcamese; Alcamo, Carrubba, 1997 The mansion has been used as a dance hall and for wedding parties in the 1970s, then as a nursery school in the 1980s. Today, after the restoration made in 1980, it has become a refined household, with trees of different types, and multicoloured flowers: a real peaceful haven. =Description= The building has a fine Liberty style tending towards Moorish; with only one raised floor, it is 350 square metres large, with a magnificent garden enriched by fountains and elegant seats. On the main fa√ßade (still surmounted by the owner‚Äôs coat of arms and his initials) there is a big balcony with a fine marble parapet, with some carvings with the shape of a Greek cross, and five artistic openings. There are 14 rooms, with the ballroom, about 110 square metres large, in the middle of them. After the restoration made in 1980 (made according to the project of the architects Valeria De Folly, Dannis and Carlo Bruschi), this room has become a more functional space, like a corner rich with different plants, well-lighted by a large skylight and a big white chandelier made of Murano glass dated 1943. The furniture is very appropriate, as they have maintained the family‚Äôs one, dating back to the early 1900s; there are also two beautiful fireplaces of grey marble, the first is located in the hall and the other in the main bedroom. That one in the hall has geometrical patterns, with the coat of arms of the barons Rossotti Chiarelli, surmounted by a baronial crown. The second fireplace has floral arrangements, with the family crest in the middle of it.

The pair were both instructed to protect moral practices in their town and to ensure that the faith was safeguarded in the face of pagan and tribal beliefs and practices. But this put them into conflict with some locals who decided to hunt them down and kill them after the pair interrupted a ritual and confiscated their possessions. The two men were slain after being captured in a local Dominican convent and after having professed their faith to their attackers. Both men were venerated long after their murders and a beatification cause was introduced. It later remained dormant for sometime due to a lack of interest but was reignited during the late 1980s and into the 1990s when the formal process was launched. The two were beatified on 1 August 2002 in Mexico on the occasion that Pope John Paul II visited the nation. Lives =Backgrounds= Juan Bautista was born circa 1660. He married Josefa de la Cruz and the pair had a daughter named Rosa. Jacinto de los √Ångeles was born circa 1660. He was married to Petrona and the couple together had two children named Juan and Nicolasa. He was descended from a line of important tribal chiefs. Both Juan Bautista and Jacinto de Los √Ångeles - who were both born in San Francisco Cajonos - were Zapotec Indians and were catechists. =Life and murder= Both Juan and Jacinto were altar servers in their childhood and often aided their local parish priest in duties. The two later secured jobs that would see them work to ensure the protection of moral practices and to safeguard the faith in their town of San Francisco Cajonos. On 14 September 1700 the pair learnt that there would be a ritual for idols in the evening to be held at the home of the local Indio Jos√© Flores. The two alerted the Dominicans and it was agreed that both Juan and Jacinto would intervene. The two went to Flores' home and managed to enter without being seen though their presence came as a great surprise to all those present since Juan and Jacinto were well known in their town. Juan and Jacinto - as well as the now-arrived Dominicans - began reproving those present to which the Indios blew out their candles and ran out of Flores' house covering their faces. The idolater's items were all confiscated and taken to the Dominican convent. During the morning on 15 September the Dominican provincial-superior for the Oaxaca region was informed of what had transpired the night before. But Juan and Jacinto learned at around noon that the idolaters were preparing to retaliate which prompted both men to flee to the convent to hide. But the Indio mob learnt of this and around 8:00pm burst into the convent with clubs and spears and with their faces and feet covered so as not to be identified. The mob ordered the priests to hand over Juan and Jacinto lest all others in the convent be killed. But the priests Gaspar and Alonzo refused which prompted the mob to threaten burning down the church. Members of the mob then broke one of the doors leading to their confiscated possessions all the while setting fire to Juan's home which was not too far from the convent. Both men realized that remaining hidden meant the senseless deaths of all those in the convent so stepped forward to face the mob. Jacinto asked the priest to hear his confession and to give him Communion before leaving with the mob since he desired to \\"die for love of God and without using weapons\\". The two were whipped out of the convent with one of the men asking the priests: \\"Fathers - commend us to God!\\" Juan and Jacinto were beaten and tortured as the mob attempted to persuade them to abjure their faith. Both were defiant and continued to profess their faith. The mob took the men for further torture and during the morning on 16 September moved them to San Pedro village to be taken to the Tanga Hill. That afternoon both Juan and Jacinto were thrown down the hill before being beaten with clubs and cut down with machetes. Their chests were cut open and their hearts removed to be given to the dogs. Their remains were thrown into an open pit but later recovered and preserved in the church at Villa Alta. But in 1889 their remains were given to the Archbishop of Antequera de Oaxaca who moved them into the archdiocesan cathedral. Beatification The beatification process had not been initiated until several preliminaries were launched in the 1970s and the 1980s to assess if evidence existed to support a formal canonization process. But it remained dormant until 25 January 1991 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict and titled Juan and Jacinto as Servants of God. The diocesan process of investigation was inaugurated a month later on 21 February and closed months later that 12 December before the C.C.S. validated the process in Rome on 20 November 1992. The cause's leading officials (the postulation) compiled and submitted a Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for evaluation in 1999 before a board of historians approved it that 7 December. Theologians confirmed on 22 May 2001 that the two men were murdered \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) which was a verdict that the C.C.S. also accepted in their meeting on 11 June. Pope John Paul II approved the cause (and their beatification) on 7 July. John Paul II beatified the two men on 1 August 2002 during his apostolic visit to Mexico; those Mexican immigrants from Oaxaca living in Los Angeles attended the beatification.

Historical background Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania Lithuania's statehood dates to the 13th-century Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On 6 July 1253, Mindaugas was crowned as the King of Lithuania. In 1385, Lithuania joined Poland in a union that grew into the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth by 1569. Between 1772 and 1795, most of Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. Towards the end of World War I, on 16 February 1918, twenty people signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania, which proclaimed the restoration of an Independent State of Lithuania, creating a modern state. During World War II, Lithuania was forcibly occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, followed by Nazi Germany in 1941, and again by the Soviets in 1944 as one of its constituent republics. During the late 1980s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lithuania fought to restore its independence which culminated in the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania signed on 11 March 1990.https://www.15min.lt/tema/lietuvos-valstybes-atkurimo- simtmetis-71970 Goal and tasks In order to have every Lithuanian citizen experience the significance of this jubilee, the Government of Lithuania has initiated a celebration of the centenary of the restoration of Lithuania.

Early years and military career Von Schenk was born in Laibach now Ljubljana in Slovenia, into a Roman Catholic middle-class family, to Moriz, a retired senior civil servant, and Eulalia Zwierzina. His mother descended from a long line of military officers. The young Alfred received his fundamentals in Ljubljana, and moved to Praha in Bohemia to complete his education, where thanks to his German-Austrian sounding last name, was able to join the local and prestigious Gymnasium. Life in Prague was very good at the time and being a German Austrian he could have lived well enough, even without speaking the local Czech language, but notwithstanding, he became very fluent in Czech, a fluency described next to be a bilingual, showing a great attitude, in learning languages, an ability he was to exploit with success, during the assignment, in the Balkans and in Russia, to the intelligence and counterintelligence unit. After having successfully completed three of the eight classes, on July 11, 1880, he volunteered into the Common Army and was assigned to the 21st Infantry Regiment ‚ÄúFreiherr von Mondel‚Äù then based in Prague. On September 18, 1880 he was promoted Sergeant, and on August 18, 1881 he entered into the Cadet Company of the 24th Feldjager (Rifles) Battalion. His personal files described him as an excellent marksman, with a calm and relaxed personality, with a high sense of duty and a strong morality. A disciplinarian with his juniors, he was, however, very attentive to their problems. The early months of 1882 Alfred von Schenk saw action during the suppression of the second Krivo≈°ije uprising in southern Dalmatia. His commission was highly recommended by Colonel Paul Hostinek. He was commissioned 2nd Lieutenant in the 91st Infantry Regiment ‚ÄúRitter von Fr√∂hlich‚Äù on May 1, 1884, and promoted to 1st Lieutenant on November 1, 1888. A year later he was assigned to the 9th Infantry Brigade staff in Olomutz and on November 24, 1891, he was a staff Officer of the 2nd Mountain Brigade in Trebinjie (now Bosnia and Herzegovina). During this assignment he was to become familiar with the Istria, Kraina, Carinthia and Styria regions, and also improved his knowledge on south-west Hungary and Turkey, while attached to military missions. In the meantime, he also learned French. On May 5, 1892, he was promoted Captain and assigned to staff of the 12th Army Corps in Hermannstadt, today Sibiu in Rumania. He started the study of Russian language, and from May 1, 1895 until May 14, 1896, he was in Kazan, presently the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan, officially to study the language, but in reality serving as an undercover Agent. Promoted to the rank of Major on November 1, 1898 he was assigned as Chief of Staff of the 16th Infantry Division. On May 1, 1902 he was made Lieutenant Colonel and assigned to the 1st Bosnian Herzegovinian Infantry Regiment, becoming its commander on April 13, 1907. On November 27, 1905 he was promoted to Colonel. Ennoblement and World War I In February 1911, Schenk was ennobled and thus he added the predicate ‚Äúvon‚Äù to his last name; the following May 11, he was promoted to Generalmjor. In February 1914 at the approach of World War I, he was commanding the 97th Infantry Brigade in Vienna and with the coming of war against Russia he was an army rear area commander. In late August 1914 he was appointed commander of the 15th Infantry Division. And the promotion to Feldmarschall-leutnant or Field Marshal Lieutenant arrived on November 1, 1914. =The Isonzo Front= Appointed commanding officer of the 9th Infantry Division he saw further service in Italy on the Isonzo Front as Sector Commander of \\"Abschnitt\\" or Sector III B. The units deployed on Sector III B were; the 9th Infantry Division, the 24th Landsturm Mountain Brigade, the 59th Infantry Brigade and the 43rd Artillery Brigade. The area of responsibility stretched from the southern end of the Carso Mountains, to the east of the port city of Monfalcone and was subsequently renamed as ‚ÄúGroup Schenk‚Äù. The strength of the group grew up when the 10th Infantry Division, stationed in Josefstadt or Josefov in Bohemia, in peacetime, was added to the group which become the XXIII Army Corps, on November 10, 1916. With the creation of the XXIII Army Corps, General Shenck was no longer depending from the army corps commanded by Archduke Joseph August of Austria, but was directly at the orders of the Isonzo Army commander, Field Marshal Svetozar Boroeviƒá. At the beginning of the 7th Isonzo Battle Sector III B had a strength of 18 infantry battalions, 13,650 rifles, 77 piece of field artillery and 45 pieces of heavy siege artillery. The 24th Mountain Brigade, assigned to the sector between Nova Vas, and Hill 208, was composed by three territorial battalions, the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th part of the 11th Regiment of Infantry. Most of its personnel was recruited in the Jiƒç√≠n District of Bohemia, and were of Czech and Sudeten German descent, meanwhile, the 27th Territorial Infantry Regiment of Ljubljana, was composed mainly by Slovenians from the Carniola and Gorizia Counties. The entire 9th Infantry Division was deployed to cover the left part of the sector, from Hill 208 to Lisert, east of the seaport city of Monfalcone. It was composed by two infantry brigades: The 60th Lvov Brigade with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd battalions of the 30th Lvov Infantry Regiment, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the 80th Zloczow Infantry Regiment, the ethnic make up of those units was mainly of Ruthenians and Polish; the other Infantry Brigade of the 9th Division, was the 17th Infantry Brigade of Praha, which included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions of the 91st Budweis Infantry Regiment of Ceske Budejovice, and the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Regiment of Beneschau, now Bene≈°ov, in Czech republic. The ethnic composition of the 91st Regiment was a mixture of the Czech and Sudeten German, while the 102nd Regiment was entirely made by Czechs. The 9th Division Infantry headquarters and the divisional hospital were located in the village of Gorjansko a village now in the southwestern part of the Municipality of Komen in the Littoral region of Slovenia on the border with Italy. During the eight and inconclusive, battle of the Isonzo, the ‚ÄúGruppe Schenk now XXIII Army Corps‚Äù had a strength of 30 infantry battalions, with 20.180 rifles, 118 pieces of field artillery, and 37 pieces of heavy siege artillery. The corps was reinforced with another division, the 16th Infantry Division Nazysbzen (Sibiu) from Siebenb√ºrgen (now Transylvania in Rumania), which was composed of the 31st and 32nd brigades. The 31st Brigade was formed by four battalions of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of Brasov, composed by Hungarians in majority with some Rumanians and Germans, and by the 1st Battalion of 62nd Infantry regiment from Mars-Vasarhely, now T√¢rgu Mure»ô in Rumania, formed by Hungarians and Rumanians. =Kerensky Offensive, retirement and death= On June 23, 1917, he was given the command of the XIII Army Corps part of the Colonel General Karl Terszty√°nszky von N√°das (October 28, 1854 ‚Äì March 7, 1921) 3rd Army, deployed in Stanislau, modern day Ivano-Frankivsk, in western Ukraine, a sector of the Russian theater. It was there that his career had a major setback. During the June offensive or Kerensky Offensive, first led by General Aleksei Brusilov soon replaced by General Lavr Kornilov, the Russian Army attacked the Austrian positions. The Austrian forces first suffered a heavy bombardment, and then were unable to contain the shock Russian battalions, that had penetrated the broad gap created. The 3rd Army broke out, leaving behind almost all the artillery and suffering heavy casualties. The offensive was later contained, thanks to the stubborn resistance of the German troops assigned to the German South Army. Following the defeat, Alfred Edler von Schenk was removed from command and replaced by General Citek. On February 1, 1918 he was promoted General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) and assumed command of the IX Army Corps on February 21., 1918. The speedy and dramatic collapse of Austro- Hungarian Monarchy found General von Schenk as the Military Governor of Zagreb. He officially retired on the January 1st, 1919 after 44 years of active duty. His annual pension was 16.800 Krones with a house rent compensation of 1.152 Krones. On December 23, 1923 he was hired by the new Czechoslovak government, and moved into the new state, where he remained until the end of 1930. When the country was partitioned, he returned in Austria. He died in Vienna on October 12, 1952. Personal life While studying in Russia, he met Viktoria von Grahe, the daughter of the Imperial Russian State advisor, Gustav Ferdinand Ritter von Grahe, and Viktoria Blonfeld from Kazan. She had a deposit of 1.200,00 Florins, a high sum for those years, and therefore the marriage was authorized, according with the marriage officer laws in the Austro-Hungarian Army. The couple married on December 14, 1896.  Decorations and awards  Among his many decorations the general, was a Knight First Class of the Order of the Iron Crown (with war decoration and swords), holder of the Military Merit Cross Second Class (with war decoration and swords) and a Knight of the Order of Leopold (with war decoration and swords).  Assessment  Von Schenk was considered to be a high level professional soldier, with a deep knowledge in conventional war, intelligence and counterintelligence. He had the qualities that a good commanding officer should have. A focused and dedicated inferior, and a disciplinarian but compassionate, senior. His great capability to learn languages made him a valuable element in the Multiethnic and Multilanguage Austrian-Hungarian Army. This attitude might have been helped by having been born in Ljubljana, where German was widely spoken, but the main language was Slovenian, a language whose knowledge may be useful in learning other Slavic languages. His language ability, added to a keen mind made him eligible to be selected for the k.u.k. Evidenzbureau, the Austrian-Hungarian directorate of intelligence and counterintelligence. While assigned to the directorate, to the Russian section, he had a role in the exposure and arrest of Colonel Alfred Redl ‚Äì Russia's leading spy.

Life de Vitr√© was born in Hampstead Norreys in 1905. Her parents paid for her to attend a boarding school and she then moved on to the University of Manchester. Her career was chosen when she began a six-week course under Mary Allen's Women Auxiliary Service. Allen was a controversial figure as she had been a militant suffragette and she went on to be a leading fascist. In 1928 she joined the police in Sheffield. This was helpful to her career as that constabulary had a more enthusiastic attitude to women in the force and she impressed the Chief constable. In 1931 she was appointed to lead and train women policewomen in Cairo. She assisted with the laws pertaining to brothels, prostitutes and drug dealing and in training. She returned to the UK in 1933 and became the lead policewoman in Leicester taking over from Eileen Claire Sloane. de Vitre was able to create an essential role dealing with cases of indecent assault and child protection. This was reinforced by the 1933 Children and Young Person's Act which required a policewoman to be present with any under-age or female person who was detained. However she did not become a sergeant until 1933. The following year she was able to organise a national convention of policewomen which attracted half the country's policewomen from outside London. This was 36 women from 26 constabularies who gathered in Leicester. In 1944 Sir Percy Sillitoe who had been her boss in Sheffield was made the Chief Constable of Kent and he employed de Vitre to lead the women's force. When she arrived she had two policewomen and the following year there were nearly 150. The following year she was promoted into a national role in Her Majesty's Inspectorate. She became the most senior ranking woman police officer in Britain as she took a leading role in seeing a massive growth in the number of women serving within Britain's police.

One of these translations was completed in 1768 with the assistance of Thomas von Herbert, an Austrian interpreter, whereas the other one, Boerhaave's Aphorisma, was completed in 1771.

Language Djaru is a member of the Ngumbin language family, and is related to Walmajarri. Country The Djaru people ranged along Margaret River as far as the Mary River Junction. Their land took in the headwaters of Christmas Creek, ran eastward to Cummins Range, Sturt Creek Station up to the border with the Northern Territory. Its northern boundary lay in the vicinity of the Nicholson Station homestead, and the headwaters of the Ord River above the Dixon Range, and including the areas east of Alice Downs as far as Hall's Creek and the Margaret River gorge. In Norman Tindale's estimation the total land range encompassed something like . The area is now known as the Kutjungka Region. Trade The Djaru, like the Gija, much admired the composite spears, fitted with barbed pegs, of their southern neighbours, fashioned from mulga hardwood and witjuti bush shrubs and to obtain them would exchange them for stone knives and pressure-flaked spear blades (tjimbala), and pearl shells which filtered down from the coast where they had been collected by the distant Jawi. History of contact Massacres of aborigines in the Kimberleys were commonplace as the land was cleared for settlement and pastoral stations. An early massacre at Hangman's Creek, otherwise undocumented in colonial archives, remains undated, but is associated with the name of Sergeant Richard Henry Pilmer. Djaru had been responsible for killing in separate incidents 4 outsiders: a stockman, a surveyor, a miner, and a Chinaman, at Ruby Plains Station. Native tradition holds that Pilmer rode out in a buggy and rounded up a mob of Djaru to get them to dig a 'well'. Once this work was completed he then strung them all up on a walarri gum tree and buried them in the well. The place thereby earned the name of Hangman's Creek. The primary victims of this particular slaughter were, according to Norman Tindale, the Margaret River Djaru. In September 1922, two settlers, Joseph Condren and Tim O'Sullivan, were murdered at Billiluna homestead. According one account, a Guluwaring man Goose Hill near Kununurra, known as Banjo, seized a gun and shot first Sullivan, and then Condren, while the latter two were branding cattle with the assistance of several natives. The reason given for the murder was Banjo acted to revenge himself on Sullivan who had taken away his wife, Topsy. The other blacks, who tried to intervene, were held at bay by Banjo who threatened them with the rifle. According to indigenous traditions, the first massacre which ensued in retaliation for these killings took place at Kaningarra between wells 48 and 49 on the Canning Stock Route. The incident is undocumented, and relies on the testimony of the three sons of Riwarri, the only adult survivor. In this account a police punitive expedition came across an encampment where aboriginals were cooking camel meat, and keep shooting into it until they ran short of ammunition. Those who survived were led off tethered by neck-chains to a site called the 'Goat Yard' at Denison Downs. A police party led by Constable J.J. Cooney, engaged ostensibly in a search for the culprit, was in this Walmajarri area from 12 and 31 October at the time of the reported slaughter. The second incident, soon after, took place at the former Denison Downs homestead on the Sturt Creek Station, in a site referred to as Chuall Pool where many Djaru, together with Walmajarri, were murdered. The victims were the survivors of the Kaningarra massacre. A recent archaeological study of two sites, identified by the tribal custodians, as the goat yard and the women and children's site, turned up ample evidence of calcinated bone fragments that were the residue of exposure to prolonged extreme heat, created by a fire accelerant like kerosene wholly atypical of hunter-gatherer hearths. On the other hand, the 'well-digging' story, it was inferred, cannot have been accurate, since the indicated well had been constructed before that time. Otherwise, the archaeological study confirmed the likelihood that police had massacred an unknown number of aboriginals at this second site.

It became the Salford and Pendleton Royal Hospital and Dispensary in 1847 and the Salford Royal Hospital in the 1870s. In June 1941, during the Manchester Blitz, the hospital on Chapel Street was struck by German bombs and 14 nurses died. Following the formation of the NHS Trust in 1990 and budget cuts imposed by the Government in the early 1990s, the hospital on Chapel Street closed in 1994 and was converted into luxury flats. A memorial stone tablet to commemorate the nurses killed during the blitz remains above the original Chapel Street entrance. Meanwhile the original hospital in Hope, which was built on the south side of Eccles Road between 1880 and 1882 to accommodate sick paupers working at the local workhouse, was known as the Salford Union Infirmary. The hospital became known as Hope Hospital, taking the name of the medieval Hope Hall, which had been demolished in 1956. A redevelopment scheme for Hope Hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2007. The construction work, which was designed by Ryder / HKS and carried out by Balfour Beatty at a cost of ¬£136 million, was completed in 2012. The hospital at Hope was rebranded as the Salford Royal Hospital during the redevelopment.

Roughly bounded by Walnut Hill Park and the New Britain General Hospital, as well as West Main, Main, Arch, and Hart Streets, the area mirrors in residential architecture the growth of the city as an industrial center between 1840 and 1930. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history New Britain was a primarily agricultural community and part of Berlin and Farmington until its separate incorporation in 1850. Its industrial history began with small metalworking shops that grew in size and scope, until it was one of the leading centers of tool manufacture in the country. The Walnut Hill neighborhood is sandwiched between the city's downtown and Walnut Hill Park, which was originally built out as a water supply reservoir, but was converted into a public park in the 1860s. The area now contains an architecturally diverse collection of housing, built between about 1840 and 1930. Most of the houses are of wood frame construction, and are generally of similar size and scale, set on similarly sized lots with uniform setbacks, giving the area a cohesive feel despite its architectural diversity. The district boundaries are generally drawn to exclude commercial development along its northern and eastern boundaries (West Main, Main, and Arch Streets), as well as larger apartment blocks. On Arch Street, the Lutheran Church and state armory building are included. On the southern boundary, frame residences on both sides of Hart Street are included. There are a total of 145 principal structures that are of historic significance. The single most-represented architectural style is the Italianate, reflective of the city's growth in the 1850s and 1860s. One particularly fine example of this style is the David Nelson Camp House at 9 Camp Street. Institutional exceptions to the area's residential character include buildings of the 1881 state normal school on Hillside Place.

The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The area that became Walnut Hill Park was a barren hillside when it was purchased by a group of leading citizens in 1857. In 1858 a reservoir was built on the site, intended to provide additional water for fire protective services. It never adequately fulfilled this role, and was formally decommissioned in 1912 and subsequently filled in. The city hired Frederick Law Olmsted, a native of Hartford who was then in the early years of his partnership with Calvert Vaux, to design the landscaping around the reservoir. The land was formally conveyed to the city in 1867, which in 1870 acquired additional parcels to increase the park size to about . Cornelius B. Erwin, one of the original proprietors, gave the city an endowment for maintenance of the park. Principal construction of the park roadway took place in 1870-72, and was halted by the financial Panic of 1873. In 1919 the city designated the park as the site of its World War I memorial, an Art Deco structure designed by H. Van Buren Magonigle and installed in 1928. The location was one that Olmsted had designated for the placement of a tower, just to the north of the reservoir. Geography The eastern portion of the park is characterized by hilly terrain, with a relatively flat area formerly occupied by the reservoir. The reservoir site was eventually reduced to a small wading pool, and was then completely filled in and replaced by an oval space with more formal landscaping. The western portion of the park is more level, and features a variety of athletic fields as well as the Darius Miller Band Shell. There are seven entrances to the park; the principal one is at the northeastern corner on West Main Street.

He was also a champion of Yugoslavia in full-contact in 1984 and 1989. and worked as a bouncer in night clubs.  Croatian War of Independence  In 1991. he joined Croatian National Guard where, at first, he was assigned to do the physical preparation of Croatian soldiers. He took part in Battle of Barracks, after which his company was transferred to 4th Guards Brigade of Croatian Army. He soon again saw action at battlefields near Zadar and Mostar in 1992. He survived a chemical attack near Mostar when Yugoslav People Army's aviation dropped poison gas on him and his men, which took toll on his liver. Nevertheless, that same year he took part in Operation Tiger. whose goal was to push Serb forces away from Dubrovnik towards inner Herzegovina. During the course of action, he was severely wounded while he was attempting to fire M80 Zolja at enemy machine gun nest. His fellow soldiers carried him for 3 hours across the rough stone terrain towards the nearest hospital. By 1993, he recovered and was again leading Croatian attack in Operation Maslenica, during which he stepped on a mine while he was carrying his wounded comrade. As he was second time wounded, hospital doctors wanted to give him eighty percent disability status which would prevent him to go back in action. He rejected that saying he wants to go back to the battlefield, so doctors gave him \\"only\\" fifty percent disability. Afterwards, that same year he spent six months in officers school in Zagreb after which he returned to 4th Guards Brigade, where he remained until the end of war.  Post war  In 1997., he took part in 76 kilometers long soldier marathon that he won after running for eight hours and seventeen minutes. He ended the run being \\"eight kilos lighter\\" and losing all ten nails on his feet. This victory earned him the title of \\"The Best Soldier of Croatian Armed Forces\\".

The settlement of the Americas is widely accepted to have begun when Paleolithic hunter-gatherers entered North America from the North Asian Mammoth steppe via the Beringia land bridge, which had formed between northeastern Siberia and western Alaska due to the lowering of sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum. These populations expanded south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and spread rapidly throughout both North and South America, by 14,000 years ago. The earliest populations in the Americas, before roughly 10,000 years ago, are known as Paleo-Indians. The peopling of the Americas is a long-standing open question, and while advances in archaeology, Pleistocene geology, physical anthropology, and DNA analysis have shed progressively more light on the subject, significant questions remain unresolved. While there is general agreement that the Americas were first settled from Asia, the pattern of migration, its timing, and the place(s) of origin in Eurasia of the peoples who migrated to the Americas remain unclear. The prevalent migration models outline different time frames for the Asian migration from the Bering Straits and subsequent dispersal of the founding population throughout the continent. Indigenous peoples of the Americas have been linked to Siberian populations by linguistic factors, the distribution of blood types, and in genetic composition as reflected by molecular data, such as DNA. The \\"Clovis first theory\\" refers to the 1950s hypothesis that the Clovis culture represents the earliest human presence in the Americas, beginning about 13,000 years ago; evidence of pre- Clovis cultures has accumulated since 2000, pushing back the possible date of the first peopling of the Americas to 33,000 years ago. The environment during the latest glaciation For an introduction to the radiocarbon dating techniques used by archaeologists and geologists, see radiocarbon dating. =Emergence and submergence of Beringia= Figure1. Submergence of the Beringian land bridge with post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) rise in eustatic sea level During the Wisconsin glaciation, the Earth's ocean water was, to varying degrees over time, stored in glacier ice. As water accumulated in glaciers, the volume of water in the oceans correspondingly decreased, resulting in lowering of global sea level. The variation of sea level over time has been reconstructed using oxygen isotope analysis of deep sea cores, the dating of marine terraces, and high resolution oxygen isotope sampling from ocean basins and modern ice caps. A drop of eustatic sea level by about from present-day levels, commencing around 30,000 years BP, created Beringia, a durable and extensive geographic feature connecting Siberia with Alaska. With the rise of sea level after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Beringian land bridge was again submerged. Estimates of the final re-submergence of the Beringian land bridge based purely on present bathymetry of the Bering Strait and eustatic sea level curve place the event around 11,000 years BP (Figure 1). Ongoing research reconstructing Beringian paleogeography during deglaciation could change that estimate and possible earlier submergence could further constrain models of human migration into North America. =Glaciers= The onset of the Last Glacial Maximum after 30,000 years BP saw the expansion of alpine glaciers and continental ice sheets that blocked migration routes out of Beringia. By 21,000 years BP, and possibly thousands of years earlier, the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets coalesced east of the Rocky Mountains, closing off a potential migration route into the center of North America. Alpine glaciers in the coastal ranges and the Alaskan Peninsula isolated the interior of Beringia from the Pacific coast. Coastal alpine glaciers and lobes of Cordilleran ice coalesced into piedmont glaciers that covered large stretches of the coastline as far south as Vancouver Island and formed an ice lobe across the Straits of Juan de Fuca by 15,000 14C years BP (18,000 cal years BP). Coastal alpine glaciers started to retreat around 19,000 cal years BP while Cordilleran ice continued advancing in the Puget lowlands up to 14,000 14C years BP (16,800 cal years BP). Even during the maximum extent of coastal ice, unglaciated refugia persisted on present-day islands, that supported terrestrial and marine mammals. As deglaciation occurred, refugia expanded until the coast became ice-free by 15,000 cal years BP. The retreat of glaciers on the Alaskan Peninsula provided access from Beringia to the Pacific coast by around 17,000 cal years BP. The ice barrier between interior Alaska and the Pacific coast broke up starting around 13,500 14C years (16,200 cal years) BP. The ice-free corridor to the interior of North America opened between 13,000 and 12,000 cal years BP. Glaciation in eastern Siberia during the LGM was limited to alpine and valley glaciers in mountain ranges and did not block access between Siberia and Beringia. =Climate and biological environments= The paleoclimates and vegetation of eastern Siberia and Alaska during the Wisconsin glaciation have been deduced from high resolution oxygen isotope data and pollen stratigraphy. Prior to the Last Glacial Maximum, climates in eastern Siberia fluctuated between conditions approximating present day conditions and colder periods. The pre- LGM warm cycles in Arctic Siberia saw flourishes of megafaunas. The oxygen isotope record from the Greenland Ice Cap suggests that these cycles after about 45k years BP lasted anywhere from hundreds to between one and two thousand years, with greater duration of cold periods starting around 32k cal years BP. The pollen record from Elikchan Lake, north of the Sea of Okhotsk, shows a marked shift from tree and shrub pollen to herb pollen prior to 26k 14C years BP, as herb tundra replaced boreal forest and shrub steppe going into the LGM. A similar record of tree/shrub pollen being replaced with herb pollen as the LGM approached was recovered near the Kolyma River in Arctic Siberia. The abandonment of the northern regions of Siberia due to rapid cooling or the retreat of game species with the onset of the LGM has been proposed to explain the lack of archaeosites in that region dating to the LGM. The pollen record from the Alaskan side shows shifts between herb/shrub and shrub tundra prior to the LGM, suggesting less dramatic warming episodes than those that allowed forest colonization on the Siberian side. Diverse, though not necessarily plentiful, megafaunas were present in those environments. Herb tundra dominated during the LGM, due to cold and dry conditions. Coastal environments during the Last Glacial Maximum were complex. The lowered sea level, and an isostatic bulge equilibrated with the depression beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, exposed the continental shelf to form a coastal plain. While much of the coastal plain was covered with piedmont glaciers, unglaciated refugia supporting terrestrial mammals have been identified on Haida Gwaii, Prince of Wales Island, and outer islands of the Alexander Archipelago. The now-submerged coastal plain has potential for more refugia. Pollen data indicate mostly herb/shrub tundra vegetation in unglaciated areas, with some boreal forest towards the southern end of the range of Cordilleran ice. The coastal marine environment remained productive, as indicated by fossils of pinnipeds. The highly productive kelp forests over rocky marine shallows may have been a lure for coastal migration. Reconstruction of the southern Beringian coastline also suggests potential for a highly productive coastal marine environment. =Environmental changes during deglaciation= Pollen data indicate a warm period culminating between 14k and 11k 14C years BP (17k-13k cal years BP) followed by cooling between 11k-10k 14C years BP (13k-11.5k cal years BP). Coastal areas deglaciated rapidly as coastal alpine glaciers, then lobes of Cordilleran ice, retreated. The retreat was accelerated as sea levels rose and floated glacial termini. It has been estimated that the coast range was fully ice-free between 16k and 15k cal years BP. Littoral marine organisms colonized shorelines as ocean water replaced glacial meltwater. Replacement of herb/shrub tundra by coniferous forests was underway by 12.4k 14C years BP (15k cal years BP) north of Haida Gwaii. Eustatic sea level rise caused flooding, which accelerated as the rate grew more rapid. The inland Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets retreated more slowly than did the coastal glaciers. Opening of an ice-free corridor did not occur until after 13k to 12k cal years BP. The early environment of the ice-free corridor was dominated by glacial outwash and meltwater, with ice- dammed lakes and periodic flooding from the release of ice-dammed meltwater. Biological productivity of the deglaciated landscape was gained slowly. The earliest possible viability of the ice-free corridor as a human migration route has been estimated at 11.5k cal years BP. Birch forests were advancing across former herb tundra in Beringia by 14.3ka 14C years BP (17k cal years BP) in response to climatic amelioration, indicating increased productivity of the landscape. Analyses of biomarkers and microfossils preserved in sediments from Lake E5 and Burial Lake in northern Alaska suggest early humans burned Beringian landscapes as early as 34,000 years ago. The authors of these studies suggest that fire was used as means of hunting megafauna. Chronology, reasons for, and sources of migration thumbupright=1.3525,000 years ago Beringia during the LGM 16-14,000 years ago peopling of the Americas just after the LGM The archaeological community is in general agreement that the ancestors of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas of historical record entered the Americas at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), shortly after 20,000 years ago, with ascertained archaeological presence shortly after 16,000 years ago. There remain uncertainties regarding the precise dating of individual sites and regarding conclusions drawn from population genetics studies of contemporary Native Americans. It is also an open question whether this post-LGM migration represented the first peopling of the Americas, or whether there had been an earlier, pre-LGM migration which had reached South America as early as 40,000 years ago. =Chronology= In the early 21st century, the models of the chronology of migration are divided into two general approaches. The first is the short chronology theory, that the first migration occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum, which went into decline after about 19,000 years ago, and was then followed by successive waves of immigrants. The second theory is the long chronology theory, which proposes that the first group of people entered the Americas at a much earlier date, possibly before 40,000 years ago, followed by a much later second wave of immigrants. The Clovis First theory, which dominated thinking on New World anthropology for much of the 20th century, was challenged by the secure dating of archaeosites in the Americas to before 13,000 years ago in the 2000s. The \\"short chronology\\" scenario, in the light of this, refers to a peopling of the Americas shortly after 19,000 years ago, while the \\"long chronology\\" scenario permits pre-LGM presence, by around 40,000 years ago. The archaeosites in the Americas with the oldest dates that have gained broad acceptance are all compatible with an age of about 15,000 years. This includes the Buttermilk Creek Complex in Texas, the Meadowcroft Rockshelter site in Pennsylvania and the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. Archaeological evidence of pre-Clovis people points to the South Carolina Topper Site being 16,000 years old, at a time when the glacial maximum would have theoretically allowed for lower coastlines. It has often been suggested that an ice-free corridor, in what is now Western Canada, would have allowed migration before the beginning of the Holocene, but a 2016 study has argued against this, suggesting that the peopling of North America via such a corridor is unlikely to significantly pre-date the earliest Clovis sites. The study concludes that the ice-free corridor in what is now Alberta and British Columbia \\"was gradually taken over by a boreal forest dominated by spruce and pine trees\\" and that the \\"Clovis people likely came from the south, not the north, perhaps following wild animals such as bison\\". An alternative hypothesis for the peopling of America is coastal migration, which may have been feasible along the deglaciated (but now submerged) coastline of the Pacific Northwest from about 16,000 years ago.

The green arrow indicates the \\"interior migration\\" model along an ice-free corridor separating the major continental ice sheets, the red arrow indicates the \\"coastal migration\\" model, both leading to a \\"rapid colonization\\" of the Americas after c. 16,000 years ago.Figure 4 of Pre-Last Glacial Maximum migration across Beringia into the Americas has been proposed to explain purported pre-LGM ages of archaeosites in the Americas such as Bluefish Caves and Old Crow Flats in the Yukon Territory, and Meadowcroft Rock Shelter in Pennsylvania. At the Old Crow Flats, mammoth bones have been found that are broken in distinctive ways indicating human butchery. The radiocarbon dates on these vary between 25,000 and 40,000 years BP. Also, stone microflakes have been found in the area indicating tool production. Previously, the interpretations of butcher marks and the geologic association of bones at the Bluefish Cave and Old Crow Flats sites, and the related Bonnet Plume site, have been called into question. In addition to disputed archaeological sites, additional support for pre-LGM human presence has been found in lake sediment records of northern Alaska. Biomarker and microfossil analyses of sediments from Lake E5 and Burial Lake in suggest human presence in eastern Beringia as early as 34,000 years ago. These analyses are indeed compelling in that they corroborate the inferences made from the Bluefish Cave and Old Crow Flats sites. Pre-LGM human presence in South America rests partly on the chronology of the controversial Pedra Furada rock shelter in Piau√≠, Brazil. A 2003 study dated evidence for the controlled use of fire to before 40,000 years ago. Additional evidence has been adduced from the morphology of Luzia Woman fossil, which was described as Australoid. This interpretation was challenged in a 2003 review which concluded the features in question could also have arisen by genetic drift. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The ages of the earliest positively identified artifacts at the Meadowcroft site are safely within the post-LGM period (13.8k‚Äì18.5k cal years BP). ‚Ä¢ Stones described as probable tools, hammerstones and anvils, have been found in southern California, at the Cerutti Mastodon site, that are associated with a mastodon skeleton which appeared to have been processed by humans. The mastodon skeleton was dated by thorium-230/uranium radiometric analysis, using diffusion‚Äìadsorption‚Äìdecay dating models, to 130.7 ¬± 9.4 thousand years ago. No human bones were found, and the claims of tools and bone processing have been described as \\"not plausible\\". The Yana River Rhino Horn site (RHS) has dated human occupation of eastern Arctic Siberia to 27k 14C years BP (31.3k cal years BP). That date has been interpreted by some as evidence that migration into Beringia was imminent, lending credence to occupation of Beringia during the LGM. However, the Yana RHS date is from the beginning of the cooling period that led into the LGM. But, a compilation of archaeosite dates throughout eastern Siberia suggest that the cooling period caused a retreat of humans southwards. Pre-LGM lithic evidence in Siberia indicate a settled lifestyle that was based on local resources, while post-LGM lithic evidence indicate a more migratory lifestyle. The oldest archaeosite on the Alaskan side of Beringia date to 12k 14C years BP (14k cal years BP). It is possible that a small founder population had entered Beringia before that time. However, archaeosites that date closer to the Last Glacial Maximum on either the Siberian or the Alaskan side of Beringia are lacking. Biomarker and microfossil analyses of sediments from Lake E5 and Burial Lake in northern Alaska suggest human presence in eastern Beringia as early as 34,000 years ago. These sedimentary analyses have been suggested to be the only possibly recoverable remnants of humans living Alaska during the last Glacial period. Genomic age estimates Studies of Amerindian genetics have used high resolution analytical techniques applied to DNA samples from modern Native Americans and Asian populations regarded as their source populations to reconstruct the development of human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups (yDNA haplogroups) and human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (mtDNA haplogroups) characteristic of Native American populations. Models of molecular evolution rates were used to estimate the ages at which Native American DNA lineages branched off from their parent lineages in Asia and to deduce the ages of demographic events. One model (Tammetal 2007) based on Native American mtDNA Haplotypes (Figure 2) proposes that migration into Beringia occurred between 30k and 25k cal years BP, with migration into the Americas occurring around 10k to 15k years after isolation of the small founding population. Another model (Kitchen et al. 2008) proposes that migration into Beringia occurred approximately 36k cal years BP, followed by 20k years of isolation in Beringia. A third model (Nomatto et al. 2009) proposes that migration into Beringia occurred between 40k and 30k cal years BP, with a pre-LGM migration into the Americas followed by isolation of the northern population following closure of the ice-free corridor. Evidence of Australo-Melanesians admixture in Amazonian populations was found by Skoglund and Reich (2016). A study of the diversification of mtDNA Haplogroups C and D from southern Siberia and eastern Asia, respectively, suggests that the parent lineage (Subhaplogroup D4h) of Subhaplogroup D4h3, a lineage found among Native Americans and Han Chinese, emerged around 20k cal years BP, constraining the emergence of D4h3 to post-LGM. Age estimates based on Y-chromosome micro-satellite diversity place origin of the American Haplogroup Q1a3a (Y-DNA) at around 10k to 15k cal years BP. Greater consistency of DNA molecular evolution rate models with each other and with archaeological data may be gained by the use of dated fossil DNA to calibrate molecular evolution rates. =Source populations= There is general agreement among anthropologists that the source populations for the migration into the Americas originated from an area somewhere east of the Yenisei River (Russian Far East). The common occurrence of the mtDNA Haplogroups A, B, C, and D among eastern Asian and Native American populations has long been recognized, along with the presence of haplogroup X. As a whole, the greatest frequency of the four Native American associated haplogroups occurs in the Altai-Baikal region of southern Siberia. Some subclades of C and D closer to the Native American subclades occur among Mongolian, Amur, Japanese, Korean, and Ainu populations. A 2019 study suggested that Native Americans are the closest living relatives to 10,000-year-old fossils found near the Kolyma River in northeastern Siberia. Human genomic models The development of high-resolution genomic analysis has provided opportunities to further define Native American subclades and narrow the range of Asian subclades that may be parent or sister subclades. For example, the broad geographic range of haplogroup X has been interpreted as allowing the possibility of a western Eurasian, or even a European source population for Native Americans, as in the Solutrean hypothesis, or suggesting a pre-Last Glacial Maximum migration into the Americas. The analysis of an ancient variant of haplogroup X among aboriginals of the Altai region indicates common ancestry with the European strain rather than descent from the European strain. Further division of X subclades has allowed identification of subhaplogroup X2a, which is regarded as specific to Native Americans. With further definition of subclades related to Native American populations, the requirements for sampling Asian populations to find the most closely related subclades grow more specific. Subhaplogroups D1 and D4h3 have been regarded as Native American specific based on their absence among a large sampling of populations regarded as potential descendants of source populations, over a wide area of Asia. Among the 3764 samples, the Sakhalin ‚Äì lower Amur region was represented by 61 Oroks. In another study, Subhaplogroup D1a has been identified among the Ulchis of the lower Amur River region (4 among 87 sampled, or 4.6%), along with Subhaplogroup C1a (1 among 87, or 1.1%). Subhaplogroup C1a is regarded as a close sister clade of the Native American Subhaplogroup C1b. Subhaplogroup D1a has also been found among ancient J≈çmon skeletons from Hokkaido The modern Ainu are regarded as descendants of the J≈çmon. The occurrence of the Subhaplogroups D1a and C1a in the lower Amur region suggests a source population from that region distinct from the Altai- Baikal source populations, where sampling did not reveal those two particular subclades. The conclusions regarding Subhaplogroup D1 indicating potential source populations in the lower Amur and Hokkaido areas stand in contrast to the single-source migration model. Subhaplogroup D4h3 has been identified among Han Chinese. Subhaplogroup D4h3 from China does not have the same geographic implication as Subhaplotype D1a from Amur-Hokkaido, so its implications for source models are more speculative. Its parent lineage, Subhaplotype D4h, is believed to have emerged in east Asia, rather than Siberia, around 20k cal years BP. Subhaplogroup D4h2, a sister clade of D4h3, has also been found among J≈çmon skeletons from Hokkaido. D4h3 has a coastal trace in the Americas. The contrast between the genetic profiles of the Hokkaido J≈çmon skeletons and the modern Ainu illustrates another uncertainty in source models derived from modern DNA samples: The descendants of source populations with the closest relationship to the genetic profile from the time when differentiation occurred are not obvious. Source population models can be expected to become more robust as more results are compiled, the heritage of modern proxy candidates becomes better understood, and fossil DNA in the regions of interest is found and considered. HTLV-1 genomics The Human T cell Lymphotrophic Virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a virus transmitted through exchange of bodily fluids and from mother to child through breast milk. The mother-to- child transmission mimics a hereditary trait, although such transmission from maternal carriers is less than 100%. The HTLV virus genome has been mapped, allowing identification of four major strains and analysis of their antiquity through mutations. The highest geographic concentrations of the strain HLTV-1 are in sub-Saharan Africa and Japan. In Japan, it occurs in its highest concentration on Kyushu. It is also present among African descendants and native populations in the Caribbean region and South America. It is rare in Central America and North America. Its distribution in the Americas has been regarded as due to importation with the slave trade. The Ainu have developed antibodies to HTLV-1, indicating its endemicity to the Ainu and its antiquity in Japan. A subtype \\"A\\" has been defined and identified among the Japanese (including Ainu), and among Caribbean and South American isolates. A subtype \\"B\\" has been identified in Japan and India. In 1995, Native Americans in coastal British Columbia were found to have both subtypes A and B. Bone marrow specimens from an Andean mummy about 1500 years old were reported to have shown the presence of the A subtype. The finding ignited controversy, with contention that the sample DNA was insufficiently complete for the conclusion and that the result reflected modern contamination. However, a re-analysis indicated that the DNA sequences were consistent with, but not definitely from, the \\"cosmopolitan clade\\" (subtype A). The presence of subtypes A and B in the Americas is suggestive of a Native American source population related to the Ainu ancestors, the J≈çmon. Physical anthropology Paleoamerican skeletons in the Americas such as Kennewick Man (Washington State), Hoya Negro skeleton (Yucat√°n), Luzia Woman and other skulls from the Lagoa Santa site (Brazil), Buhl Woman (Idaho), Pe√±on Woman III, two skulls from the Tlapacoya site (Mexico City), and 33 skulls from Baja California have exhibited craniofacial traits distinct from most modern Native Americans, leading physical anthropologists to the opinion that some Paleoamericans were of an Australoid rather than Siberian origin. The most basic measured distinguishing trait is the dolichocephaly of the skull. Some modern isolates such as the Peric√∫es of Baja California and the Fuegians of Tierra del Fuego exhibit that same morphological trait. Other anthropologists advocate an alternative hypothesis that evolution of an original Beringian phenotype gave rise to a distinct morphology that was similar in all known Paleoamerican skulls, followed by later convergence towards the modern Native American phenotype. Resolution of the issue awaits the identification of a Beringian phenotype among paleoamerican skulls or evidence of a genetic clustering among examples of the Australoid phenotype. A report published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology in January 2015 reviewed craniofacial variation focussing on differences between early and late Native Americans and explanations for these based on either skull morphology or molecular genetics. Arguments based on molecular genetics have in the main, according to the authors, accepted a single migration from Asia with a probable pause in Berengia, plus later bi-directional gene flow. Studies focusing on craniofacial morphology have argued that Paleoamerican remains have \\"been described as much closer to African and Australo-Melanesians populations than to the modern series of Native Americans\\", suggesting two entries into the Americas, an early one occurring before a distinctive East Asian morphology developed (referred to in the paper as the \\"Two Components Model\\". A third model, the \\"Recurrent Gene Flow\\" [RGF] model, attempts to reconcile the two, arguing that circumarctic gene flow after the initial migration could account for morphological changes. It specifically re-evaluates the original report on the Hoya Negro skeleton which supported the RGF model, the authors disagreed with the original conclusion which suggested that the skull shape did not match those of modern Native Americans, arguing that the \\"skull falls into a subregion of the morphospace occupied by both Paleoamericans and some modern Native Americans.\\" ‚Ä¢ Stemmed points Stemmed points are a lithic technology distinct from Beringian and Clovis types. They have a distribution ranging from coastal east Asia to the Pacific coast of South America. The emergence of stemmed points has been traced to Korea during the upper Paleolithic. The origin and distribution of stemmed points have been interpreted as a cultural marker related to a source population from coastal east Asia. Migration routes =Interior route= Continental Divide, separating the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. Also indicated are the locations of the Clovis and Folsom Paleo-Indian sites. Historically, theories about migration into the Americas have centered on migration from Beringia through the interior of North America. The discovery of artifacts in association with Pleistocene faunal remains near Clovis, New Mexico in the early 1930s required extension of the timeframe for the settlement of North America to the period during which glaciers were still extensive. That led to the hypothesis of a migration route between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets to explain the early settlement. The Clovis site was host to a lithic technology characterized by spear points with an indentation, or flute, where the point was attached to the shaft. A lithic complex characterized by the Clovis Point technology was subsequently identified over much of North America and in South America. The association of Clovis complex technology with late Pleistocene faunal remains led to the theory that it marked the arrival of big game hunters that migrated out of Beringia then dispersed throughout the Americas, otherwise known as the Clovis First theory. Recent radiocarbon dating of Clovis sites has yielded ages of 11.1k to 10.7k 14C years BP (13k to 12.6k cal years BP), somewhat later than dates derived from older techniques. The re-evaluation of earlier radiocarbon dates led to the conclusion that no fewer than 11 of the 22 Clovis sites with radiocarbon dates are \\"problematic\\" and should be disregarded, including the type site in Clovis, New Mexico. Numerical dating of Clovis sites has allowed comparison of Clovis dates with dates of other archaeosites throughout the Americas, and of the opening of the ice-free corridor. Both lead to significant challenges to the Clovis First theory. The Monte Verde site of Southern Chile has been dated at 14.8k cal years BP. The Paisley Cave site in eastern Oregon yielded a 14C date of 12.4k years (14.5k cal years) BP, on a coprolite with human DNA and 14C dates of 11.3k-11k (13.2k-12.9k cal years) BP on horizons containing western stemmed points. Artifact horizons with non-Clovis lithic assemblages and pre-Clovis ages occur in eastern North America, although the maximum ages tend to be poorly constrained. Geological findings on the timing of the ice-free corridor also challenge the notion that Clovis and pre-Clovis human occupation of the Americas was a result of migration through that route following the Last Glacial Maximum. Pre-LGM closing of the corridor may approach 30k cal years BP and estimates of ice retreat from the corridor are in the range of 12 to 13k cal years BP. Viability of the corridor as a human migration route has been estimated at 11.5k cal years BP, later than the ages of the Clovis and pre-Clovis sites. Dated Clovis archaeosites suggest a south-to-north spread of the Clovis culture. Pre-Last Glacial Maximum migration into the interior has been proposed to explain pre-Clovis ages for archaeosites in the Americas, although pre-Clovis sites such as Meadowcroft Rock Shelter, Monte Verde, and Paisley Cave have not yielded confirmed pre-LGM ages. Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian language family proposal A relationship between the Na-Den√© languages of North America (such as Navajo and Apache), and the Yeniseian languages of Siberia was first proposed as early as 1923, and developed further by others. A detailed study was done by Edward Vajda and published in 2010. This theory received support from many linguists. Also archaeological and genetic studies gave it further support. The Arctic Small Tool tradition of Alaska and the Canadian Arctic may have originated in East Siberia about 5,000 years ago. This is connected with the ancient Paleo-Eskimo peoples of the Arctic, the culture that developed by 2500 BCE. The Arctic Small Tool tradition source may have been the Syalakh-Bel‚Äôkachi-Ymyakhtakh culture sequence of East Siberia, dated to 6,500 ‚Äì 2,800 calBP. ‚Ä¢ The interior route is consistent with the spread of the Na-Dene language group and subhaplogroup X2a into the Americas after the earliest paleoamerican migration. Nevertheless, some scholars suggest that the ancestors of western North Americans speaking Na-Dene languages made a coastal migration by boat. =Pacific coastal route= The Pacific 'coastal migration theory' proposes that people first reached the Americas via water travel, following coastlines from northeast Asia into the Americas, originally proposed in 1979 by Knute Fladmark as an alternative to the ice-free corridor hypothesis. This model would help to explain the rapid spread to coastal sites extremely distant from the Bering Strait region, including sites such as Monte Verde in southern Chile and Taima-Taima in western Venezuela. The \\"marine migration hypothesis\\" is a variant of coastal migration which postulates the use of boats. The proposed use of boats adds a measure of flexibility to the chronology of coastal migration, because a continuous ice-free coast (16k-15k cal years BP) would no longer be required as migrants would have settled in coastal refugia during deglaciation of the coast. A coastal east Asian source population is integral to the marine migration hypothesis. A 2007 article in the Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology proposed a \\"kelp highway hypothesis\\", a variant of coastal migration based on the exploitation of kelp forests along much of the Pacific Rim from Japan to Beringia, the Pacific Northwest, and California, and as far as the Andean Coast of South America. Once the coastlines of Alaska and British Columbia had deglaciated about 16,000 years ago, these kelp forest (along with estuarine, mangrove, and coral reef) habitats would have provided an ecologically homogenous migration corridor, entirely at sea level, and essentially unobstructed. A 2016 DNA analysis of plants and animals suggest a coastal route was feasible. Mitochondrial subhaplogroup D4h3a, a rare subclade of D4h3 occurring along the west coast of the Americas, has been identified as a clade associated with coastal migration. This haplogroup was found in a skeleton referred to as Anzick-1, found in Montana in close association with several Clovis artifacts, dated 12,500 years ago. Problems with evaluating coastal migration models The coastal migration models provide a different perspective on migration to the New World, but they are not without their own problems. One such problem is that global sea levels have risen over since the end of the last glacial period, and this has submerged the ancient coastlines that maritime people would have followed into the Americas. Finding sites associated with early coastal migrations is extremely difficult‚Äîand systematic excavation of any sites found in deeper waters is challenging and expensive. Strategies for finding earliest migration sites include identifying potential sites on submerged paleoshorelines, seeking sites in areas uplifted either by tectonics or isostatic rebound, and looking for riverine sites in areas that may have attracted coastal migrants. On the other hand, there is evidence of marine technologies found in the hills of the Channel Islands of California, circa 10,000 BCE. If there was an early pre-Clovis coastal migration, there is always the possibility of a \\"failed colonization\\". Another problem that arises is the lack of hard evidence found for a \\"long chronology\\" theory. No sites have yet produced a consistent chronology older than about 12,500 radiocarbon years (~14,500 calendar years) , but research has been limited in South America related to the possibility of early coastal migrations.

Petry (November 1, 1968 ‚Äì July 17, 2018) was a psychologist known for her research on behavioral treatments for addictive disorders, behavioral pharmacology, impulsivity and compulsive gambling. She was Professor of Medicine at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Petry served as a member of the American Psychiatric Association Workgroup on Substance Use Disorders for the DSM-5 and chaired the Subcommittee on Non-Substance Behavioral Addictions. The latter category includes Internet addiction disorder and problem gambling. She also served as a member of the Board of Advisors of Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development. Petry received the American Psychological Association (APA) Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology in 2003 for \\"groundbreaking work on the problem of gambling and substantial contributions to the treatment of other addictive behaviors.\\" Petry's other awards include the APA Young Psychopharmacologist Award (1999), the National Center for Responsible Gaming Award for Scientific Achievement in Gambling Studies (2002), the Joseph Cochin Award from the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (2007), and the Connecticut Technology Council‚Äôs Women of Innovation Award for Research Innovation and Leadership (2017). Biography Petry completed a bachelor's degree at the Randolph Macon Woman's College in 1990 and a PhD in Experimental Psychology at Harvard University in 1994. She conducted clinical research on drug abuse at the University of Vermont from 1994-96, where she evaluated optimal dosing strategies for opioid-dependent patients. Petry joined the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Connecticut Health Center in 1996 and she conducted clinical research on the effectiveness of contingency management as treatment for addiction. She served as the Editor-in-Chief of the journal Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. Petry was the author of Contingency Management for Substance Abuse Treatment: A Guide to Implementing This Evidence-Based Practice, which provided an overview of clinical behavior analysis, utilizing positive reinforcement and stimulus control to treat problematic behavior. Petry also authored Pathological Gambling: Etiology, Comorbidity, and Treatment, and was the editor of the volume Behavioral Addictions: DSM-5¬Æ and Beyond. Her research was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. =Death= Dr. Petry died of breast cancer, aged 49, on July 17, 2018, in Canton, Connecticut.  Research  Petry conducted research that aimed to improve behavioral treatments for individuals with addictive disorders, ranging from substance use disorder to pathological gambling to Internet addiction. She aimed to increase patient adherence to treatment through contingency management, which is a form of behavior modification. Petry was involved analyzing data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a large-scale study involving a diverse sample of over 36,000 individuals. Petry's work on this study examined various forms of impulsive behavior including gambling and shoplifting, and comorbidity of addictive behavior with other conditions including obesity and other medical problems. Other work examined delay discounting in relation to impulsiveness. Delay discounting refers to the decline in the value of a reward when there is a delay in its receipt. Petry's work demonstrated that heroin addicts showed a steeper decline in the value of a delayed reward relative to controls, indicative of a stronger preference for immediate rewards.

Photoacoustic microscopy takes advantage of the local temperature rise that occurs as a result of light absorption in tissue. Using a nanosecond pulsed laser beam, tissues undergo thermoelastic expansion, resulting in the release of a wide-band acoustic wave that can be detected using a high-frequency ultrasound transducer. Since ultrasonic scattering in tissue is weaker than optical scattering, photoacoustic microscopy is capable of achieving high- resolution images at greater depths than conventional microscopy methods. Furthermore, photoacoustic microscopy is especially useful in the field of biomedical imaging due to its scalability. By adjusting the optical and acoustic foci, lateral resolution may be optimized for the desired imaging depth.  Photoacoustic signal  The goal of photoacoustic microscopy is to find the local pressure rise p_0, which can be used to calculate the absorption coefficient mu_a according to the formula: p_0 = Gammaeta_{th}mu_aF, where eta_{th} is the percentage of light converted to heat, F is the local optical fluence (J/cm2), and the dimensionless Gruneisen parameter Gamma is defined as: Gamma = frac{beta}{kapparho C_V}, where beta is the thermal coefficient of volume expansion (K‚àí1), kappa is the isothermal compressibility (Pa‚àí1), and rho is the density (kg/m3). Following the initial pressure rise, a photoacoustic wave propagates at the speed of sound within the medium and can be detected with an ultrasound transducer.  Image reconstruction  One of the major benefits of photoacoustic microscopy is the simplicity of image reconstruction. A laser pulse excites tissue in the axial direction and the resulting photoacoustic waves are detected by an ultrasound transducer. The transducer then converts the mechanical energy into a voltage signal that can be read by an analog-to- digital converter for post-processing. A one-dimensional image, known as an A-line, is formed as a result of each laser pulse. Hilbert transform of an A-line reveals depth-encoded information. A 3D photoacoustic image can then be formed by combining multiple A-lines produced by 2D raster scanning. =Synthetic Aperture Image Reconstruction= Altering delays of the elements on an ultrasound transducer allows one to focus ultrasound waves similar to passing through an acoustic lens. This delay-and-sum method enables one to find the signal at each focal point. However, the lateral resolution is limited by the presence of side lobes, which appear at polar angles and are dependent on the width of each element.  Contrast  In photoacoustic imaging modalities, including photoacoustic microscopy, contrast is based on photon excitation and is thus determined by the optical properties of the tissue. When an electron absorbs a photon, it moves to a higher energy state. Upon returning to a lower energy level, the electron undergoes either radiative or nonradiative relaxation. During radiative relaxation, the electron releases energy in the form of a photon. On the other hand, an electron undergoing nonradiative relaxation releases energy as heat. The heat then induces a pressure rise that propagates as a photoacoustic wave. Due to the fact that almost all molecules are capable of nonradiative relaxation, photoacoustic microscopy has the potential to image a wide range of endogenous and exogenous agents. By contrast, fewer molecules are capable of radiative relaxation, thus limiting fluorescence microscopy techniques such as one- photon and two-photon microscopy. Current research in photoacoustic microscopy takes advantage of both endogenous and exogenous contrast agents to gain functional information about the body, from blood saturation levels to cancer proliferation rate. = Endogenous Contrast Agents = Absorption profile of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin Endogenous contrast agents, molecules naturally occurring within the body, are useful in photoacoustic microscopy due to the fact that they may be imaged non-invasively. Endogenous agents are also non- toxic and do not affect the properties of the tissue being studied. In particular, endogenous absorbers can be classified based on their absorbing wavelengths.  Ultraviolet Absorbers  Within the ultraviolet light range (Œª = 180 to 400 nm), the primary absorber in the body is DNA and RNA. By using ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy, DNA and RNA can be imaged in the cell nuclei without the use of fluorescence labeling. Since cancer is associated with DNA replication failure, UV photoacoustic microscopy has the potential to be used for early cancer detection.  Visible Light Absorbers  Visible light absorbers (Œª = 400 to 700 nm) include oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, melanin, and cytochrome c. Visible light photoacoustic microscopy is particularly useful in determining hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation due to the difference in absorption profiles of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. Real-time analysis can then be used to determine blood flow speed and oxygen metabolism rate. In addition, photoacoustic microscopy is capable of early melanoma detection due to the high concentration of melanin found in skin cancer cells.  Near-Infrared Absorbers  Near-Infrared absorbers (Œª = 700 to 1400 nm) include water, lipids, and glucose. Photoacoustic determination of blood glucose levels can be used for treating diabetes, while studying lipid concentrations within blood vessels is important for monitoring the progression of atherosclerosis. It is still feasible to quantify and compare deoxyhemoglobin and hemoglobin concentrations at this wavelength, trading deeper tissue penetration for lower absorption. = Exogenous Contrast Agents = Although endogenous contrasts agents are noninvasive and simpler to use, they are limited by their inherent behavior and concentration, making it difficult to monitor certain processes if optical absorption is weak. On the other hand, exogenous agents can be engineered to specifically bind to certain molecules of interest. In addition, the concentration of exogenous agents can be optimized to produce a greater signal and provide more contrast. Through selective binding, exogenous contrast agents are capable of targeting specific molecules of interest while also enhancing resulting images.  Organic Dyes  Organic dyes, such as ICG-PEG and Evans blue, are used to enhance vasculature as well as to improve tumor imaging. In addition, dyes are easily filtered out of the body due to their small size (‚â§ 3 nm).  Nanoparticles  Nanoparticles are currently being researched due to their chemical inactivity and ability to target tumor cells. These properties allow for cancer propagation to be monitored and potentially enables intraoperative cancer removal. However, more studies on short-term toxicity effects are necessary to determine if nanoparticles are suitable for clinical research. Gold nanoparticles have shown promise as a contrast agent for image-guided medicine. AuNPs have been widely used as contrast agents due to their strong and tunable optical absorption.  Fluorescent Proteins  Fluorescent proteins have been developed for fluorescence microscopy imaging and are unique in that they can be genetically encoded and therefore do not need to be delivered into the body. Using photoacoustic microscopy, fluorescent proteins can be visualized at depths beyond the limit of typical microscopy methods. Frequency-dependent acoustic attenuation in tissue and dampening of higher frequencies limits the bandwidth of light propagation through deeper regions in tissue. Fluorescent proteins act as light source at the target region, bypassing the limitation of optical attenuation. However, the effectiveness of fluorescent proteins is limited by low fluence changes, as the light diffusion equation predicts lower than 5% increase.  Resolution  Mouse ear vasculature imaged using OR-PAM at 532 nm Mouse ear vasculature imaged using AR-PAM at 532 nm Photoacoustic microscopy achieves greater penetration than conventional microscopy due to ultrasonic detection. As a result, axial resolution is defined acoustically and is determined by the formula: R_{axial} = 0.88frac{ u_A}{Delta f_A}, where u_A is the speed of sound in the medium and Delta f_A is the photoacoustic signal bandwidth. The axial resolution of the system can be improved by using a wider bandwidth ultrasound transducer as long as the bandwidth matches that of the photoacoustic signal. The lateral resolution of photoacoustic microscopy depends on the optical and acoustic foci of the system. Optical- resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) uses a tighter optical focus than acoustic focus, while acoustic-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM) uses a tighter acoustic focus than optical focus. = Optical-Resolution Photoacoustic microscopy = Due to a tighter optical focus, OR-PAM is more useful for imaging in the quasi-ballistic range of depths up to 1 mm. The lateral resolution of OR-PAM is determined by the formula: R_{lateral, O} = 0.51frac{lambda_O}{NA_O}, where lambda_O is the optical wavelength and NA_O is the numerical aperture of the optical objective lens. The lateral resolution of OR-PAM can be improved by using a shorter laser pulse and tighter focusing of the laser spot. OR-PAM systems can typically achieve a lateral resolution of 0.2 to 10 Œºm, allowing OR-PAM to be classified as a super-resolution imaging method. = Acoustic-Resolution Photoacoustic microscopy = At depths greater than 1 mm and up to 3 mm, acoustic-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (AR-PAM) is more useful due to greater optical scattering. Acoustic scattering is much weaker beyond the optical diffusion limit, making AR-PAM more practical as it provides higher lateral resolution at these depths. The lateral resolution of AR-PAM is determined by the formula: R_{lateral, A} = 0.71frac{lambda_A}{NA_A}, where lambda_A is the central wavelength of the photoacoustic wave and NA_A is the numerical aperture of the ultrasound transducer. Higher lateral resolution can therefore be achieved by increasing the center frequency of the ultrasound transducer and tighter acoustic focusing. AR-PAM systems can typically achieve a lateral resolution of 15 to 50 Œºm.  Dark-field Confocal Photoacoustic microscopy  Depiction of PAM raster scanning path By ignoring ballistic light, dark-field confocal photoacoustic microscopy reduces surface signal. This method uses a dark-field pulsed laser and high-NA ultrasonic detection, with the fiber output end coaxially aligned with the focused ultrasound transducer. Filtration of ballistic light relies on the altered shape of the excitation laser beam instead of an opaque disk, as used in conventional dark-field microscopy. The general reconstruction technique is used to convert the photoacoustic signal into one A-line, and B-line images are produced by raster scanning.  Biomedical applications  Photoacoustic microscopy has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field. Due to its ability to image a variety of molecules based on optical wavelength, photoacoustic microscopy can be used to gain functional information about the body noninvasively. Blood flow dynamics and oxygen metabolic rates can be measured and correlated to studies of atherosclerosis or tumor proliferation. Exogenous agents can be used to bind to cancerous tissue, enhancing image contrast and aiding in surgical removal. On the same note, photoacoustic microscopy is useful in early cancer diagnosis due to the difference in optical absorption properties compared to healthy tissue.

The company was founded in 1997 as a spin-off from Charit√©. MagForce has developed a solution of iron oxide nanoparticles that is directly injected into the tumor. A couple of days later, the person with the tumor is placed inside a large piece of equipment similar to an MRI machine, also manufactured by MagForce, which creates a strong, fast-changing magnetic field. The changing magnetic field causes the particles to vibrate, which in turn generates heat, destroying the tissue, or at least making the tumor more vulnerable to other treatments, like radiation. Generally there are six such sessions in the machine. The company was listed on the Frankfurt exchange in 2007, and received the CE mark for its system in 2010. By 2013, sales of the system were poor; one reason for that was that the company had been run with little money, raising only about 11 million euros by 2010, and had scant clinical trial with which to convince oncologists that its system was effective and safe.

Early life and education  Tom Smith was born Thomas Joseph Smith on December 10th, 1984 in Pennsylvania. Smith is the middle of three children, and was primarily raised in Elkton, Maryland. Smith‚Äôs mother was a craft artist who later became a web designer, and his father worked in a chemical plant in Wilmington, DE. Smith attended Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), where he majored in illustration, and also became interested in colors, inspired by the artists Josef Albers and James Turrell. Furthermore, following his undergraduate at MICA, Smith spent a semester abroad in France, attending Centre pour l'art et la culture in Aix en Provence. Subsequently, Smith traveled to New York where he would go to the School of Visual Arts for his graduate school.  Career  Tom Smith is a painter, sculptor, and video artist who exhibits a strong technological influence that he describes as ‚Äúdigital output‚Äù. In 2009, Tom Smith experimented with collages of found superhero/comic images by taking the pictures and slicing them into tiny strips to combine characters. Due to the limitations of this technique, he instead began painting his own pictures on paper and combining them together. Currently, Smith‚Äôs work is a culmination of this technique of visual effects through the combination of imagery, described as ‚Äúviewing a scene through a filter.\\" Smith‚Äôs first notable exhibition was Double Vision in Brooklyn in 2009, followed by Making Strange featured in Spring Break Art Show in 2016 in Brooklyn and Heavenly Bodies in New York City in 2014. Heavenly Bodies was an exhibit in which Tom Smith showcased his collages and multimedia artworks. These collages were inspired by his time in Brazil and Iceland.

She is Professor at the School of Psychology of the University of East Anglia. Samuelson was the recipient of the 2010 Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology (area: Developmental Psychology) from the American Psychological Association.  Biography  Dr. Samuelson received a Bachelors of Science with honors in 1993 and a joint Ph.D in Psychology and Cognitive Science from Indiana University in 2000, where she worked under the supervision of Linda B. Smith. From 2000 to 2015, she was faculty of the Department of Psychology at the University of Iowa. She and her husband, John Spencer, joined the faculty of School of Psychology at the University of East Anglia in 2015. Samuelson's research has been funded by grants from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.  Research  Samuelson and her associates have conducted numerous studies of word learning in toddlers examining the basis for children's extensions of nouns to novel referents. These and earlier studies suggest that toddlers operate with a \\"shape bias\\" that prompts them to generalize usage of count nouns to other objects of the same shape, for example by referring to a zebra as a horse. Samuelson and her colleagues claim that children are \\"biased to attend to the shape of solid rigid objects when learning novel names.\\" This association between count nouns and shape is learned as children develop their early noun vocabularies, resulting in their attention being drawn to shape as a common organizing principle. Samuelson's lab has examined conditions under which children will generalize usage of a noun based on various features in addition to shape, such as material. In one of her studies, Samuelson and her colleagues gave 16-month-olds a variety of substances, including applesauce, pudding, soup and juice. Some of the toddlers got to play with the food in their high chairs whereas others sat at a table. When presenting each substance, the researchers named it using a made-up word, such as dax or kiv. After allowing the child a minute to explore the substance, the researchers showed them the same food in a different container and asked them to say its \\"name\\" (i.e., the made-up word). Children tested in the highchair demonstrated better recall of the names of the substances. Their results support the view that toddlers' learning of words is contextually bound; that is, toddlers benefit from learning new words for substances in a context that they already associate with food.

Early life and education  He spent the first 10 years of his childhood in Moscow, during the difficult times associated with the fall of the Soviet Union.Clines, Francis X. (1991, September 20). Moscow doubles estimate of need for foreign food: Seeks $14.7 billion in aid; half is sought from Europe - Russian oil sales and hard currency fall short. The New York Times, p. A1. His mother was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, his father was from Moscow. They both were professional violinists who played in professional orchestras in the Soviet Union. They lived four blocks away from the Red Square. When his parents separated, he and his mother immigrated to Los Feliz, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. There, he hung out with skateboarders and within the LA punk rock scene. He is self-taught. Instead of formal art school, he studied graffiti, comic books, and Japanese animation.

The company was acquired in 2015 by Macy's, which opened in-store Bluemercury shops in its department stores, as well as expanding the number of free-standing stores. History Bluemercury was founded in 1999 as an online shopping website for luxury cosmetics. The co-founders Marla Malcolm (later Marla Malcolm Beck) became CEO and Barry Beck became COO. However, luxury brands that Bluemercury courted were unsure whether they wanted to sell their goods on the internet, while consumers were not accustomed to buying cosmetics without trying them first. The couple found two struggling independent beauty boutiques in Georgetown and Dupont Circle called EFX, which they used to help fill their online orders. They bought and rebranded the stores \\"Bluemercury,\\" converting them to their developing concept, a neighborhood store offering beauty products, personalized advice and samples. By 2006, Bluemercury was generating $17 million in annual revenue and operated 12 stores. In June 2006 the Becks sold a stake in the company to the private-equity firm Invus Group. =Macy's acquisition= In 2015 the Becks sold the company to Macy's Inc. for $210 million, while retaining their positions as CEO and COO.

Each store location has a spa and provides other services. The stores' collection of brands includes Nars, Bobbi Brown, and Laura Mercier, among others. In 2016, the company opened its 100th store, in Savannah, Georgia. At 2,400 square feet, it was their first entry into a larger store-size retail format. In 2017 the company opened a 2,700 square-foot flagship store in Manhattan, its 145th store. =Products= Bluemercury opened its own cosmetics design laboratory, M-61 Laboratories, in 2006.

She is the co-founder and CEO of Sparrho, a London-based startup blending machine learning and expert human curation to democratise science.  Early life  Born in Hong Kong, Chan's family moved to Australia aged 6. She grew up back and forth between Hong Kong and Australia, eventually settling in Australia's Gold Coast. Her parents worked in education and her grandparents in publishing.  Education  Chan attended Trinity Lutheran College and went on to study biotechnology at the University of Queensland (UQ), achieving a BBiotech (First-Class Honours) in Drug Design and Development. After spending a year working at UQ as an Investment Process Manager in life sciences for the venture fund Uniseed, she received a Cambridge Commonwealth scholarship to study for a PhD in protein crystallography at the University of Cambridge. Whilst at Cambridge, she was voted into the role of president of the Cambridge University Technology & Enterprise Club (CUTEC) from 2010-2011. Chan was still in this role when she was approached by Alice Bentinck and Matthew Clifford of Entrepreneur First, who were seeking to recruit 30 graduates with entrepreneurship ambition. Chan had recently completed her PhD and was a member of the EF student advisory board, so decided to apply \\"at the last minute\\" and was selected to take part in EF's first cohort in 2012-13. Here, she met Nilu Satharasinghe, an experienced startup founder with a background in machine learning and a MSc in computer science from the University of Oxford.  Sparrho  Chan and Satharasinghe founded Sparrho in 2013 as a solution to issues in staying up to date with scientific literature encountered over the course of Chan's biochemistry PhD. Inspiration for Sparrho came from Steve, a postdoctoral researcher in Chan's research lab who would read several key journals and bring paper recommendations to Chan's research group every morning. When Chan described this problem to Satharasinghe, he suggested 'digitising Steve'. This idea grew into the creation of Sparrho, a science research discovery platform combining artificial and human intelligence to help research professionals and layman users stay up-to-date with new scientific publications and patents. Sparrho combines the work of industry experts and artificial intelligence in a three-phase process. Sparrho¬¥s machine learning platform searches amongst over 60 million scientific works, the equivalent of over 80% of all current scientific literature. As of Q2 2017, Sparrho has raised a total of $3 million of funding.  Honours and awards  In November 2018, Chan was named to the Financial Times' list of the 'Top 100 minority ethnic leaders in technology.' In 2017, Chan was selected by MIT Technology Review as one of its 35 Innovators Under 35. Executive director of HAG Consulting & Ventures and Startup Grind and jury member for Innovators Under 35 Europe 2017, Rodrigo de Alvarenga, commented that Chan's project \\"focuses on broadening and levelling out the access to scientific research to anyone interested and, in so doing, democratizing science and innovation through availability.\\" In 2016, she was named one of the Top 5 Women within the Top 100 Asian Stars in UK Tech. In 2015, she was named one of Management Today's 35 Women Under 35. In 2014, she was selected as a semifinalist for The Duke of York (UK) New Entrepreneur of the Year.

She is known for her research on emotion and memory over the human lifespan. She is the author of the book Emotional Memory Across the Adult Lifespan, which describes the selectivity of memory, i.e., how events infused with personal significance and emotion are much more memorable than nonemotional events. This book provides an overview of research on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the formation and retrieval of emotional memories. Kensinger is co- author of a second book How Does Emotion Affect Attention and Memory? Attentional Capture, Tunnel Memory, and the Implications for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Katherine Mickley Steinmetz, which highlights the roles of emotion in determining what people pay attention to and later remember. Kensinger received the Searle Scholar Award in 2008, the Springer Early Career Achievement Award in Research on Adult Development and Aging from American Psychological Association, Division 20 in 2009, the F.J. McGuigan Early Career Investigator Research Prize on Understanding the Human Mind from the American Psychological Association in 2010, and the Janet Taylor Spence Award from the Association for Psychological Science in 2010.  Biography  Kensinger graduated from Harvard University in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts degree (summa cum laude) in Psychology, and Biology. She went to graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and obtained her PhD in Neuroscience in 2003, working under the supervision of Suzanne Corkin. Kensinger subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Department of Radiology of Massachusetts General Hospital and at Harvard University, where she worked under the supervision of Daniel Schacter. Kensinger joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at Boston College in 2006 and was promoted to Professor in 2013. She directs the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory which uses behavioral testing and neuroimaging techniques to understand how age and emotional content influence how information is stored and remembered. Kensinger has been involved in the Innocence Project, a national pro-bono network with ties to the Innocence Program Clinic at Boston College.[1] Research suggests that eyewitness testimony played a role in wrongful convictions in nearly three-quarters of DNA exonerations in the United States. In collaboration with the Innocence Program clinic, Kensinger has conducted seminars with law school students to educate them about wrongful convictions, false confessions, flawed forensics, and mistaken identification, and more generally about the fallibility of human memory.  Research  Kensinger's laboratory investigates the cognitive and neural processes supporting memory for emotional and nonemotional information, with a focus on how emotion influences the vividness and accuracy of memory over the lifespan. One of Kensinger's studies, conducted in collaboration with Suzanne Corkin, explored the effect of negative emotional content on working memory. The researchers asked participants to perform an n-back working memory task with negative and neutral stimuli. They found that participants' accuracy in performing the n-back task was unaffected by the emotional content of the stimuli, which suggested that the memory enhancements observed for emotional stimuli in long term memory do not extend to working memory. Another line of research has investigated whether context is encoded when emotional information is presented. Across a number of studies, Kensinger and colleagues have demonstrated that emotional information tends to be remembered well, but the contextual information is remembered less well. This memory effect becomes exaggerated over delays that include sleep (e.g., Payne, Chambers, & Kensinger, 2012) and does not seem to be attributable merely to visual attention (e.g., Steinmetz & Kensinger, 2013). Kensinger and her colleagues have studied the effects of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease on emotional memory. Alzheimer's disease is associated with the atrophy of limbic structures including the amygdala, which plays an important role in processing emotional (especially negative) stimuli. The authors reported that Alzheimer's patients showed a disproportionate impairment in remembering negative words and pictures when compared with healthy elderly controls. These findings implicate the amydala in accounting for the memory boost associated with processing information with a negative emotional valence. Results also show that young and older adults but not Alzheimer's disease patients portray better memory for emotional versus neutral pictures and words. Older adults and Alzheimers patients show no benefit from emotional context, on the other hand, young adults remember more items buried in an emotional versus neutral context.

It is especially useful for sensing the optical properties of tissues to guide developments of both diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. These optical properties are described by the absorption coefficient Œºa, scattering coefficient Œºs, and anisotropy factor g. In the collimated transmission method, a laser beam is directed perpendicularly to the material and the detection of reemitted light gives information about the total interactive effect of the optical properties of the material.Wang, Lihong V., and Hsin-I. Wu. Sensing of optical properties and spectroscopy. Biomedical optics: principles and imaging. John Wiley & Sons, 2012. The use of multiple wavelengths can produce a spectra with more detailed information about the composition of the tissue or material (spectroscopy). While this method is simple and requires only minimal instrumentation, it produces error related to multiple scattering events and specular reflection.Wang, Lihong, and Steven L. Jacques. \\"Error estimation of measuring total interaction coefficients of turbid media using collimated light transmission.\\" Physics in Medicine and Biology 39.12 (1994): 2349. Some useful equations governing the properties include: Œºa = absorption coefficient = Naùúéa; Œºs = scattering coefficient = Nsùúés; g = scattering anisotropy = ; Œºt = extinction coefficient = Œºa + Œºs Where Na is the number of absorbers in a medium, ùúéa is the absorption cross section, Ns is the number of scatterers in a medium, ùúés is the scattering cross section, and ùõ≥ is the scattering angle. History The collimated transmission method has been used to measure the optical properties of biological tissues since the early 1980s. A collimated light source was generated by a laser or with a diffuse source and a collimator. Unscattered light transmission through the tissue was detected and Beer's law was used to estimate the extinction coefficient Œºt. This was done for human, porcine, rodent, bovine, and chicken tissues and compared with theoretical models to predict reliable optical properties.Cheong, Wai-Fung, Scott A. Prahl, and Ashley J. Welch. \\"A review of the optical properties of biological tissues.\\" IEEE journal of quantum electronics 26.12 (1990): 2166-2185. Knowledge of these properties were crucial for dosimetry studies. Illustration of collimator filtering a stream of rays Collimator Additionally, this method has been applied to measuring optical properties of turbid media for improving the simulation of tissue phantoms.Flock, Stephen T., et al. \\"Optical properties of Intralipid: a phantom medium for light propagation studies.\\" Lasers in surgery and medicine 12.5 (1992): 510-519. By the late 1980s, several studies also tested optical properties of biological tissues at different wavelengths to produce spectra.B. C. Wilson, W. P. Jeeves, and D. M. Lowe, ‚ÄúIn vivo and post mortem measurements of the attenuation spectra of light in mammalian tissues,‚Äù Photochem. Photobiol., vol. 42, pp. 153-162, 1985.M. Keijzer, R. R. Richards- Kortum, S. L.

Deustch, ‚ÄúMeasurement of the optical and thermal properties of biliary calculi using pulsed photothermal radiometry,‚Äù Lasers Surg. Med., vol. 7, pp. 461-466, 1987. Theory The general setup for collimated transmission is as follows: 1) A collimated light source travels through the sample 2) Transmitted light is filtered by two pinholes 3) A photodetector collects the transmitted (mainly ballistic) photons Illustration of collimated transmission method A clear medium, whose refractive index closely matches that of the sample to be tested, must be measured to provide a reference ballistic-light signal Io. This calibration step is included to account for any light intensity that is lost at the interfaces of the cuvette or other sample holder. Intensity loss can occur due to reflection at either interface and/or absorption by the cuvette. Assuming different amounts of light intensity attenuation due to sample holder, differences in calculated extinction coefficients for including calibration and ignoring calibration phase and the associated percent error Once a reference signal is acquired, it is compared to the transmitted light Is of the measured sample. In order to calculate the associated extinction coefficient Œºt , Beer's law can be applied as follows: Is = Ioexp(-Œºt d), where d is the sample thickness. The extinction coefficient is therefore: Œºt = -ln(Is/Io)/d. Example figure of Beer's Law, indicating decreased light intensity as sample thickness increases Applications Spectrophotometry: Quantitative measurement of transmittance based on wavelength. It is important in a number of biomedical fields ranging from the measurement of a solute in a sample to determining enzyme kinetics for a given substrate-enzyme pair. Spectrophotometry requires multiple wavelengths for a wide variety of samples. Therefore, an arc lamp is used to generate multiple wavelengths for collimating mirrors and diffraction gratings to generate collimated light at narrow bandwidths. Spectrophotometry Illustration Pulse oximetry is a non- invasive clinical technique that utilizes collimated light transmission in order to measure oxygen saturation. Two wavelengths are passed through a thin piece of tissue (earlobe or fingertip) and a photodetector on the other side detects the transmission at each wavelength. Due to the changing absorbance at varying wavelengths, it is possible to derive the absorbances due to arterial blood and exclude absorbances due to venous blood, skin, etc. This technology is utilized for the specific determination of certain optical properties such as absorption coefficients and scattering coefficients. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous media can be analyzed in order to learn these parameters. In addition to the purity of the sample, a variety of material types can be analyzed by this method. Agarose, agar, water, polystyrene, TiO2, and a variety of other materials can all be analyze utilizing this method. Aside from the experimental setup, there is limited technology required to gather and analyze the data.

Born in Alexandrovsk, in the Solikamsky Uyezd of the Perm Governorate of the Russian Empire, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1907. Siding with Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks, after the February Revolution, he became a member of the Ural Regional Party Committee, represented the Ural Bolsheviks at the Party Conference in April 1917, and subsequently became Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Ural Regional Council of Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Deputies, more commonly known as the Ural Soviet (Uraloblsovet). In July 1918, in coordination with Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow, Beloborodov ordered the execution of the former Tsar Nicholas II and his family, signing the decision by the Ural Soviet which was taken by Filipp Goloshchekin, after a final consultation with party leadership in Moscow, to deliver to Yakov Yurovsky with the final orders to murder the Imperial Family. In March 1919 he was elected a full member of the Orgburo of the 8th Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, and subsequently became a candidate member of the 9th Central Committee in April 1920. After the death of Yakov Sverdlov, he was considered a candidate for the post of Chairman of the All- Russian Central Executive Committee, the head of state of the Russian SFSR, but lost to Mikhail Kalinin. He subsequently served as the fourth People's Commissar for Internal Affairs of the Russian SFSR and the second for the Soviet Union, succeeding Felix Dzerzhinsky. A member of the Left Opposition associated with Leon Trotsky, he signed the Declaration of 46 in October 1923, making himself a lifelong enemy of future Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin. Like most Old Bolsheviks, especially those close to Trotsky, Beloborodov fell afoul of the Great Purge and was arrested in 1936. He was executed on 10 February 1938. Two decades after his death, he was posthumously rehabilitated in 1958.  Biography  = Early life = Born 26 October 1891 in the Solikamsk District, Perm Governorate, Russian Empire, Beloborodov's parents were Russian workers employed in the Alexandrovsk Factory in Solikamsk. He left school at 14 to work in a factory as an apprentice electrician. He joined the Bolsheviks in 1907, and created a local revolutionary organization in Solikamsk while working as an electrician in a mine. He was arrested early in 1908 and as a juvenile, aged 16, was sentenced to confinement in a young offenders' institute, and subsequently exiled to Siberia, where he spent about four years educating himself. After his release, he settled in the Urals and resumed his political activities. = Revolution and Civil War = After the February Revolution he became a member of the Lysva Soviet, and of the Local Committee of the RSDLP (Bolshevik), and in April, a member of the Ural Regional Party Committee. He represented the Ural Bolsheviks at the Party Conference in April 1917, and at the Sixth Congress of the RSDLP. In October 1917 following the October Revolution he became a member of the Perm Party Committee. In January 1918, he was appointed as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Ural Regional Soviet amidst the beginning of the outbreak of the Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War. = Execution of the Romanovs = N. G. Tolmachyov 2. A. G. Beloborodov (Chairman) 3. G. I. Safarov 4. F. I. Goloshchekin In June 1918, Beloborodov approved an initiative by the regional Cheka led by Gavril Myasnikov to murder Grand Duke Michael, either in advance, or after the fact. It was under Beloborodov's administration that the former Emperor Nicholas II, his wife, their five children, and a number of their former retainers were transferred to Yekaterinburg, though it was Bolshevik War Commissar Filipp Goloshchyokin who was in overall charge of the family's incarceration, while Yakov Yurovsky was appointed as commandant of the Ipatiev House, and Pavel Medvedev headed the external guard. Along with Pyotr Voykov, Beloborodov directed the smuggling of letters written in French to the imprisoned Romanovs at the Ipatiev House, claiming to be a monarchist officer seeking to rescue them, composed at the behest of the Cheka. These fabricated letters, along with the Romanov responses to them, written either on blank spaces or on the envelope, were ultimately used by the Ural Soviet, and likely the Central Executive Committee in Moscow, to justify murdering the Imperial Family amidst the rapid gains made by the White Army in the region. In July 1918, when Yekaterinburg appeared to be at risk of being captured by the Czechoslovak Legion, Beloborodov and the other members of the Ural Soviet ordered the immediate execution of the prisoners. Beloborodov and Georgy Safarov remained at the local Cheka headquarters at the Amerikanskaya Hotel while Goloshchyokin arrived at the Ipatiev House to personally direct the executions. Following the killings, which took place during the early morning hours of July 17, Beloborodov sent a coded telegram to Lenin's secretary, Nikolai Gorbunov. It was found by White investigator Nikolai Sokolov and reads: Beloborodov and Yurovsky's deputy Nikulin later oversaw the ransacking of the Romanov quarters, seizing all the family's personal items, the most valuable piled up in Yurovsky's office, whilst things considered inconsequential and of no value, such as family photo albums, were stuffed into the stoves and burned. The Ural Soviet subsequently ordered the summary execution of the Tsarina's sister, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, and five other men from the House of Romanov in Alapayevsk on July 18, only a day after the killing of Nicholas and his family, with Georgy Safarov being dispatched to oversee the killings in Alapayevsk. On 25 July, Yekaterinburg was taken by soldiers of Colonel Sergei Wojciechowski, and Beloborodov and most of the Ural Soviet were evacuated first to Perm, then to Vyatka. = Career in Moscow = Following the capture of Yekaterinburg, Beloborodov was appointed in January 1919 Chairman of the Vyatka Provincial Revolutionary Committee, then the Executive Committee of the Vyatka Regional Soviet. At the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party in March 1919, he was elected a full member of the Orgburo of the Central Committee of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik). On March 25, 1919, he was a candidate considered for the post of Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets following the death of Yakov Sverdlov, but Mikhail Kalinin was ultimately elected in his place. From July 1919, he was deputy head of the Political Directorate of the Revolutionary Military Council. = Activities in the Caucasus = In April 1919 he was sent to suppress the Vyoshensky Uprising on the Don. He participated in the battles with the troops of the All-Union Federal Socialist League in the Don, Kuban and the Caucasus. From the end of 1919 for two years, his work was mainly connected with the North Caucasus. Appointed a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 9th Army of the South-East-Caucasus Fronts from 9 October 1919, he served in this capacity until 28 June 1920. In this position, he played a major role in the trial and subsequent execution of the commander of the Red Cavalry Corps, Boris Dumenko. After the 9th Party Congress in April 1920, he was made a candidate member of the Central Committee, a member of the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee, and deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Caucasian Army. During this period, he frequently called for the complete physical extermination of all counter-revolutionaries. He wrote in one of his letters, complaining to Nikolay Krestinsky about the leniency of the sentences being handed down by the local Don Revolutionary Tribunals: = Head of the NKVD = On November 29, 1921, Beloborodov was appointed Deputy People's Commissar for Internal Affairs of the Russian SFSR acting under Felix Dzerzhinsky, and on August 30, 1923 was named People's Commissar of Internal Affairs (NKVD). He was subsequently named on 19 November 1923 Chairman of the Commission for the Improvement of Children's Lives. On November 15, 1923, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR decided to transform the GPU under the NKVD into the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU) under the direct control of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR. The NKVD was therefore released from the function of ensuring state security during this period, but maintained other responsibilities. In 1923, the working apparatus of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs under Beloborodov's leadership included: *Central Administrative Department *General Directorate of Places of Detention *General Directorate of Communal Services *Business Management *Russian-Ukrainian Delegation *Russian-Ukrainian-Polish Mixed Repatriations Commission = Membership of the Left Opposition = Opposition leaders in 1927, shortly before they were expelled from Moscow. In October 1923, Beloborodov was one of the signatories of the Declaration of 46, which called for greater freedom of debate within the Communist Party. This evoked a sarcastic response from Stalin writing in Pravda on 15 December 1923 that \\"in the ranks of the opposition there are men like Beloborodov, whose 'democracy' is still remembered by the workers of Rostov\\". From then on Beloborodov was associated with the Left Opposition, centered around Leon Trotsky. After Trotsky was evicted from the Kremlin in 1927, he lodged in Beloborodov's rooms in the House of the Soviets in Granovsky Street, Moscow. Beloborodov was relieved of his duties and expelled from the Communist Party in December 1927 and exiled to northern Siberia, but recanted in 1929, and was readmitted to the party in 1930, and employed in the system of the Committee of State Purchases of the USSR. = Arrest and execution = Beloborodov was arrested in 1936, early in Stalin's great purge of the upper echelons of the Communist Party, but resisted making the confession required of him, so although his name was mentioned at the trial of Karl Radek and others in January 1937, he was not produced in court. In May 1937, Stalin sent a note to Nikolai Yezhov, head of the NKVD, saying: \\"One might think that prison for Beloborodov is a podium for reading speeches, statements which refer to the activities of all sorts of people but not to himself. Isn't it time to squeeze this gentleman and make him tell about his dirty deeds? Where is he, in prison or in a hotel?\\". It can be assumed that after receiving this instruction, the NKVD subjected him to brutal torture. A fellow prisoner reported hearing him being dragged along a prison corridor shouting, \\"I am Beloborodov! Pass the word on to the Central Committee that I am being tortured!\\". He was shot on 10 February 1938 at Kommunarka firing range after being sentenced the same day.  Legacy and Rehabilitation  In 1958, he was posthumously rehabilitated, and in 1962 he was posthumously reinstated in the ranks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Unlike many of the other Ural Bolsheviks such as Tolmachyov, Goloshchekin, and Voykov, Beloborodov did not receive any further posthumous honors.

It features a career mode where the player works to become world No. #1, starting by being world No. #1500. Gameplay The game includes licences for players including Rafael Nadal and Angelique Kerber. AO Tennis allows players to create their own athletes, sponsorship logos, clothing and stadiums to play in. Development The game's release featured a \\"day one patch\\" that added many features. The game's release for iOS, and Android came before the console release, which was released in time for the start for the real-world Australian Open. In April 2018, Big Ant Studios announced AO International Tennis for a global release on May 8, 2018. AO International Tennis would be a significantly reworked and enhanced title, with significantly improved gameplay and \\"more than twice\\" the number of gameplay modes that AO Tennis had at launch. In an interview with WCCFTech, Big Ant Studios CEO, Ross Symons, said: \\"It‚Äôs not so much ‚Äútweaks and changes‚Äù as AO International Tennis is genuinely a new game. It‚Äôs got double the gameplay modes, far greater levels of customization, and a vastly improved gameplay engine to what AO Tennis launched with.

Reception for the game ranged from 3/10 to as high as 8/10 largely based on whether reviewers had downloaded the \\"day one patch\\" or not. Stevivor, having downloaded the appropriate \\"day one patch\\", was positive on the game, writing \\"This is definitely a game I‚Äôd recommend to tennis fans\\" in its 7/10 review. Fox Sports reviewed the game without downloading the \\"day one patch\\", scoring it 4/10 calling the movement \\"clunky\\", and commenting that the game's AI often \\"decided not to swing at the ball\\", \\"rather than us mis-hitting it\\". Kotaku were highly negative about the game's release, commenting on the lack of gameplay footage released before launch. but also admitted to not downloading the \\"day one patch\\", later apologising for this oversight. Kotaku called the release build of the game \\"rough\\", particularly commenting on the game's doubles action, where players were \\"lifeless, stiff, and unresponsive to the action around them\\". GameSpot scored AO Tennis 3/10, noting \\"bland visuals\\", \\"inconsistent\\" physics. GameSpot were critical of the game's graphics, referring that \\"each real-life pro looks wooden.\\" Press Start Australia, after playing AO Tennis a few weeks after launch, wrote \\"After 10+ updates and the last one being quite major, it‚Äôs honestly quite insane to see just how far this game has come over the last few weeks.\\" AO International Tennis received a far more positive response from critics. The Xbox Hub wrote that AO International Tennis is \\"right up there with the very best tennis titles available today,\\" and gave it 8/10. The Spanish-speaking SomosXbox wrote \\"AO International Tennis is an interesting video game for tennis fans, the game has a nice gameplay,\\" and scored the game 6.5/10. Forbes, in scoring the game 6.7/10, praised the customisation options, writing \\"All non-license sports games should emulate AO International Tennis' approach to create-a-player and create-a-stadium suites.\\" Sequel AO Tennis 2 was released on January 9, 2020 in Europe and February 11, 2020 in North America for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch.

The film stars George Eads, Jaime Pressly, Lance Henriksen, Fred Thompson, Beau Bridges, Matt Gordon and Peter MacNeill. The film premiered on TNT on July 30, 2004. The movie is well known for its many gaffes and inaccurate portrayal of Knievel and his career. Plot The film begins with Knievel preparing to jump the fountains at Caesars Palace in front of a large audience. A flashback to Butte, Montana in 1950,12 year old Bobby Knievel steals some hubcaps and then escapes on his bicycle before being caught and arrested. In 1958, while working for the Anaconda Mining Company, he observes the lung damage affecting the older miners and resolves to make a living performing motorcycle stunts instead. He meets Linda Bork, whose friends advise her to stay away from him. They marry and have two children as Knievel's reputation as a stunt rider grows. Knievel makes a deal to jump the fountains at Caesars Palace on New Years Eve 1967 (subtitled with the incorrect date of 1968 and using Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1974 song, Call Me the Breeze). John Derek and his wife Linda Evans film the event. Knievel's assistant Bill tries to keep alcohol away from him but Knievel finds it and drinks some. He clears the fountains but tumbles off of his motorcycle from the force of the landing. He breaks many bones, including his pelvis, and falls into a coma. Linda stays with him at the hospital until he awakens. The doctors tell her that they have inserted metal rods to hold his bones in place and that Knievel will never be able to jump again but when he leaves the hospital he continues to tell the press that he will jump the Grand Canyon. Knievel fights with Linda over his desire to return to doing stunts. In 1970, an employee of the Ideal Toy Company attends an event where he witnesses Evel Knievel get into a fight with bikers after one throws a tire iron at him. Knievel's fans attack the bikers and injure several. Recognizing his broad appeal, Ideal creates a line of Evel Knievel action figures. During a rafting trip, Knievel, his two sons, and his father-in-law John Bork fall out of the raft. Knievel is unable to reach John, who is carried away by the river and dies. On August 20, 1974, at the Canadian National Exhibition, Knievel has his sons Kelly and Robbie ride as part of the performance. Unable to get a permit to jump the Grand Canyon, Knievel conducts test jumps over Snake River Canyon using rockets. The jump is broadcast on closed-circuit television on September 8, 1974, and Knievel gets into a fight with one of the reporters before the jump. He ultimately uses the Skycycle X-2 for the jump but the parachute deploys early and the drag prevents Knievel from reaching his intended landing spot. He instead crashes into the river bank at the bottom of the canyon but manages to survive. The public is dissatisfied and the media criticizes his effort. In October 1975, Knievel performs his second stunt since the failed jump over Snake River Canyon. He jumps fourteen buses at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio to break his previous record. He retires from Jumping in 1980 and retires to Florida. The film ends with a compilation of footage of Knievel's jumps and crashes.

Under the Gaslight is an 1867 play by Augustin Daly. It was his first successful play, and is a primary example of a melodrama, best known for its suspense scene where a person is tied to railroad tracks as a train approaches, only to be saved from death at the last possible moment.Kabatchnick, Ammon. Blood on the Stage, 1800 to 1900: Milestone Plays of Murder, Mystery, and Mayhem, pp. 351-52 (2017)Fisher, James. Historical Dictionary of American Theater: Beginnings, pp. 441-42 (2015) Reception The show had a successful initial run at the Worrell Sisters' New York Theatre in New York, starting on August 12, 1867, and running through October 1, a total of 47 performances. Rose Eytinge starred at Laura Courtland.Advertisement, New York Herald (advertisement for play with positive quotes from reviews) It returned for an additional two-month run in December 1867, with the Worrell Sisters playing the lead three female roles. The play is an example of Daly's mixture of realism and melodrama, with authenticity of his depiction of real locations in New York in the play, and in his use of social commentary.Walter J. Meserve, An Outline History of American Drama, 2nd ed., 1994. Though the play introduced the now-clich√©d device of the villain tying someone to railroad tracks, it was also a reversal of the usual roles because a male character (Snorkey, a comic sidekick) was tied up, and the heroine saves him. In the book Vagrant Memories, critic William Winter recalls how Daly came up with the device: \\"He was walking home toward night, thinking intently about the play which he had begun to write, when suddenly the crowning expedient occurred to him and at the same instant he stumbled over a misplaced flagstone, striking his right foot against the edge of the stone and sustaining a severe hurt. \\"I was near my door,\\" he said, \\"and I rushed into the house, threw myself into a chair, grasping my injured foot with both hands, for the pain was great, and exclaiming, over and over again, 'I've got it! I've got it! And it beats hot-irons all to pieces!\\" I wasn't even thinking of the hurt. I had the thought of having my hero tied on a railroad track and rescued by his sweetheart, just in the nick of time, before the swift passage of an express train across a dark stage. Some have argued that Daly borrowed the train device from the English play The Engineer, which also put a train on the stage though the circumstances of the storyline were not identical. Daly was able to successfully get an injunction against Dion Boucicault over his 1868 play After Dark, which also had a train scene, a case that became an important decision in copyright law.The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature, p. 249 (2005)(31 May 2000).

It was formed in February 1896 by Cleveland Walcutt and Edward F. Leeds at 53 E. 11th St. in New York City. Walcutt and Leeds had previously been partners in the firm Walcutt, Miller & Co., which had purchased the record manufacturing plant of the North American Phonograph Company at 120 E. 14th St. in New York City, including a large stock of records, blanks, and recording phonographs. upright=2 The company recorded George J. Gaskin extensively, accompanied on piano by Frank P. Banta, who would become Edison's main accompanist in later years. They also recorded many artists formerly associated with North American, like banjoist Vess Ossman, the Unique Quartette, Edward Clarance and Herbert Holcombe in addition to the \\"Greater New York Band\\". For most of the first year, records sold were original or master records, but in November 1896 they began manufacturing duplicates using devices made by Edison and the National Phonograph Company. The American Graphophone Company sued each iteration of Walcutt and Leeds' enterprise (among many others) to assert that phonographs could not be sold due to their incorporation of graphophone technology while they were both licensed by North American. American Graphophone sued Walcutt and Leeds in February 1897 and were granted an injunction in January 1898. In December 1897, before the case was finalized, Walcutt and Leeds incorporated a new company, Walcutt and Leeds Limited, in association with George Tewksbury of the United States Phonograph Company and continued doing business in that name, and as the \\"Consolidated Phonograph Company\\" despite the injunction. Since the organization of the National Phonograph Company, Edison had focused on manufacturing phonographs and blanks, and had left record manufacture to the United States Phonograph Company. In August 1898, National began purchasing from Walcutt and Leeds instead, because the association with United States (who had illegally shipped phonographs to Great Britain) may have threatened the closure of the North American receivership. National began manufacturing their own cylinders, and stopped ordering from Walcutt and Leeds in April 1899. At this time Walcutt and Leeds finally dissolved and Cleveland Walcutt moved to France to help Emile Berliner organize a Gramophone company there, while Leeds would join with L. Reade Catlin to form the Leeds and Catlin Company. This company would sell cylinders for a few years before transitioning into the rising disc record format in 1903 in association with the Talk-O-Phone Company of Ohio.

IvO 240/241 is the catalogue number of a bronze discus awarded to Publius Asklepiades after his victory in the ancient Olympic Games in the year 241 CE. The inscription on the discus reads that he won the pentathlon in the 456th Olympiad and that this object be dedicated to the Zeus. The original currently resides in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia in Greece, but a replica is on display in the Glyptothek Museum in Munich, Germany.  Description  This discus follows the trend of most discuses found from this era. It weighs about 9 lbs (4.08 kg), and this specific discus and is about 6 inches in diameter (15.24 cm). It is made of bronze. In general, discuses in the ancient Olympics varied greatly in size and weight, so this discus should not be considered a part of any trend. Common materials for discuses include stone, iron, bronze, and lead, but each material would make the discus weigh very differently. The use of bronze material for this dedication suggests Asklepiades' access to funds because, of these materials, bronze is more expensive.  Purpose and use  Bronze discuses were known for their use in the ancient Greek pentathlon. Occasionally this equipment would be offered as votive dedications to the gods for their success in the Olympic Games. These games took place in Olympia. For the discus portion of the pentathlon, individuals attempted to throw the discus the furthest. Different distances were marked by wooden pegs in the ground. In terms of form for throwing discuses, there was no set form or technique in antiquity that has been recorded. Publius Asklepiades, a man originating from the polis of Corinth, won the pentathlon in the year 241 AD, and because of his victory, he dedicated a discus to the god Zeus as thanks. Most likely, as with other votive dedications, this artifact was not used for the sport but rather just as a votive dedication. Although mainly used for sporting events, oftentimes these objects would be offered as votive dedications to the gods. The symbolic nature of a lot of these votive dedications tell modern historians of the nature of the individuals making these dedications.  Votive dedications  In general, this artifact demonstrates the dedication of objects to supernatural beings for the victories of individuals in the Olympic games. Although mainly used for sporting events, oftentimes these objects would be offered as votive dedications to the gods.

Early life Melvin \\"Mel\\" Cheren was born on January 21, 1933, in Everett, Massachusetts, and grew up in the Boston area. His first job in the music business was in 1959 as salesman for ABC-Paramount Records. In the 1960s Cheren joined the Army and served in Germany. In 1964 he was in charge of production for ABC Records. In the 70's he accepted a position for Scepter and began campaigning with the company to start producing dance music. West End Records In 1976, Mel Cheren and Ed Kushins founded West End Records, the music label that defined the sound of New York City in the heyday of disco. Cheren created the 12-inch vinyl single, which permitted longer playing time than the standard seven-inch, and which gained its greatest popularity in discos. Paradise Garage Cheren was business partner and former lover of Michael Brody, who created the Paradise Garage in 1977 with the financial back-up of Cheren. In the 2006 \\"The Godfather of Disco,\\" a documentary about Cheren, he himself called the Garage \\"the ultimate expression of the whole fabric\\" of gay night life. Gay Men's Health Crisis When Rodger McFarlane began a crisis counseling hotline about AIDS in 1982 as a program of the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) organization, he operated it out of a couple of rooms in a building in Chelsea owned by Mel Cheren. The building subsequently became the first headquarters and office of GMHC, rent-free. In 1984, when GMHC moved to larger quarters, Cheren turned the building into the Colonial House Inn, a 20-room gay-oriented guesthouse where he himself lived until his death. 24 Hours for Life In the late 1980s Cheren founded the nonprofit group \\"24 Hours for Life\\" to raise money for AIDS relief. Through the organization he published his autobiography, \\"My Life and the Paradise Garage: Keep On Dancin'\\" (2000). Personal life Mel Cheren died on December 7, 2007, from complications associated with AIDS.

It is located at the southern end of the present Maria-Theresien- Stra√üe, once the southern road out of the city. History This triumphal arch was built in 1765 on the occasion of the wedding of Archduke Leopold, the second son of Empress Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen of Lorraine, to the Spanish princess, Maria Luisa, on 5 August 1765. Because Leopold‚Äôs father, Francis Stephen, died unexpectedly shortly after the wedding on 18 August 1765, a memorial motif was worked into the Triumphal Arch when he died. Its south side portrays motifs of the wedding of the young couple; its north side commemorates the death of the emperor. In Innsbruck, contrary to normal practice, it was decided to build the Triumphal Arch from stone rather than wood. So ashlars of H√∂ttinger Breccia, which originated from the demolished outer city gate at the exit of the old town into today's Maria-Theresien- Stra√üe, were reused. The work was carried out by Constantin Walter and Johann Baptist Hagenauer. In 1774, the reliefs made out by Hagenauer in stucco were worked by Balthasar Ferdinand Moll in Sterzing into marble.

He was born in Austin, Texas in 1852 to James and Lucy Shinn. The family moved to Vallejo's Mills, California in 1856. Vallejo's Mills became the town of Niles in 1869 (now a District in Fremont). Much of Charles Shinn's childhood was spent at the ranch and nursery of his family in Niles. His sister, Milicent Shinn, was an American child psychologist, while his first cousin Edmund Clark Sanford was a prominent psychologist.  Education  Shinn attended the state university for two years (now the University of California, Berkeley) and Johns Hopkins University. While at Johns Hopkins University, his roommate was Woodrow Wilson.  Career  Charles Shinn was a teacher in four counties in California from 1870 to 1876 and at Washington Corners in 1876. He was also a writer. In 1878, while teaching in Shasta County, he began the study of the mining district codes or laws of the 49ers and after. His most famous book, Mining Camps (1885), was a result of field work there and in the Sierras. The emphasis of the German folk moot tradition espoused while he was at John Hopkins influenced his often romanticized writings about the early mining camps. Also, between 1879 and 1889 he wrote for newspapers and magazines in San Francisco, Baltimore, and New York. In 1878 he edited the California Horticulturalist and Floral Magazine. He was elected to be a director of the State Horticultural Society in 1879.

He was killed in 2005 when a robber threw a piece of steel through the windshield of his vehicle. Early life M√©rida was born in 1928 in Matur√≠n. In his youth he read Marx and admired Fidel Castro. Revolutionary activity =Democratic Action= In 1949, M√©rida joined the Democratic Action party and assisted its exiled leaders by directing the group's armed resistance activities from inside the country. Merida eventually became their general secretary after uniting the group with the Venezuelan communists. This resulted in him being detained 1954, and then eventually lead to his exile in 1956. In 1958, he reentered the country illegal to participate in the overthrow of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. =Revolutionary Left Movement= In 1960, M√©rida left the Democratic Action party to found the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria. He was then elected to the National Assembly. At the same time, he was organizing an armed insurrection against R√≥mulo Betancourt. In May 1962, he participated in the El Carupanazo rebellion, which resulted in his imprisonment in 1964. This ended with M√©rida being exiled to Europe in 1959. However, later in 1959, the government of Venezuela instituted the Democratic Pacification Program, which granted leftist revolutionaries amnesty, and allowed him to return to the country. Later years M√©rida spent his time after his return to the country focused on teaching, the union, and on editing leftist magazines. His editing work included Reventon, Al Mar-gen, and F27. In 1998 he voted for Hugo Chavez, but two years later accused him of being \\"a continuation of the past\\" and a neoliberal who was only concerned with continuing Rafael Caldera's agenda.

Corradini was commissioned by Raimondo di Sangro to sculpt a memorial for his mother in the Cappella Sansevero in Naples, where the marble sculpture remains today.  About the work  Corradini worked mostly in Venice but also spent some time in Vienna and Naples before his death in 1752. Modesty was the last in Corradini's series of veiled female nudes, a subject he developed and refined throughout his career. His mastery of the medium of marble is seen in the increasingly skilled representation of seemingly weightless cloth over human flesh in his commissioned pieces. Modesty is positioned on a pedestal in the chapel and can sometimes be lost in the beauty of the space and its surrounding statues created by other various artists. Raimondo wanted this commemoration to depict his mother's untimely death when he was not even a year old.  Visual features  Detail of the work The figure is in a contrapposto stance, having her weight on one foot more than the other. This pose gives her human-like qualities and a motion as if she is in the middle of an action. The way her classical drapery falls on her body also shows this movement. The artists of eighteenth-century Italy were especially interested in the depiction of movement as Corradini was. Her face is turned away from the viewer, shielding her eyes with the transparent veil. Her stance is inviting; however, her face is telling a different story. The veil seems heavy but also see-through. It falls just so over her chest to accentuate her breasts, but also covers her pubic area so that it is not overtly sexual. She is exposed yet metaphorically shielded by the drapery. Her supple body is fluid almost as though she has no bones and is just a smooth and perfect human. These idealized qualities lead to a feeling that she is a divine woman and not of this world.  Sansevero Chapel  Modesty is one of two sculptures Corradini completed for the Sansevero Chapel, both a part of a ten-statue series of the Virtues. The veiled female figure embodies modesty but can also be considered a representation of wisdom. There is a clear reference to the veiled statue of Isis at Sais in Egypt. It is said that there is a quote on the ancient statue that reads \\"I am past, present, and future‚Ä¶\\".Ferber,\\"Veil,\\" 234 This allegory furthers Modestys aspect of wisdom and the statue is often referred to as Veiled Truth. The symbols such as the cracked plaque illustrate her life being cut too short. On the pedestal that the statue stands there is a relief of a biblical scene of Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene as a gardener portraying the importance of the Christian faith to the family. Corradini's other work is Decorum, which is also in the series of virtues. Decorum is a depiction of a youthful male nude scantily clothed in lion skin. He was also commissioned to make the piece Veiled Christ for the chapel but it was completed by Giuseppe Sanmartino instead when Corradini died suddenly. His two statues line the wall of Sansevero along with eight others. Modesty is positioned in its original location giving viewers the ability to see the statue in its intended arrangement.  Patronage  This series of virtues was commissioned by Raimondo di Sangro who was the seventh Prince of Sansevero. Patronage is imperative in the art world and is meant to convey the visions of the person paying for the artwork. Raimondo was known for his interest in science and the arts. Raimondo acquired the church in the mid eighteenth century and transformed it into what is seen today.D'Agostino, The Second Prince of Sansevero's Tomb, 228. He was very particular about his ideas for the mausoleum and hired what he thought were the best artists to work on it. The visual theme of the Rococo movement is seen in the adorned building with a painted ceiling, marble tombs and relief sculptures.  Veiled figures  Corradini's Vestal Virgin Tuccia in the Palazzo Barberini Corradini's interest in the veiled human form spanned his long career. His subjects were usually woman and often allegorical.

As a child, his surroundings were of Lancashire, England, an area known to be an epicenter of Britain‚Äôs primarily industrial region.

Lake with Dead Trees and The Hudson River School When Cole emerged from the Catskill mountains in 1825, not only would he bring with him some of the first renderings of the Catskills in his first five landscape paintings, but in those paintings, he brought a new style of art.‚ÄúModern Landscapes‚Äù, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Accessed October 23, 2017.

Olney.‚ÄúModern Landscapes‚Äù, Allen Memorial Art Museum. Visual Analysis and Composition Simply named, Lake with Dead Trees exemplifies the typical stylistic traits of the Hudson River School art movement. The viewer‚Äôs eye is drawn first to the stand of snags foremost, which is highlighted starkly by warm morning light. They are skeletal, stripped of leaves, of bark, of any branch that would not bend. They embody death and they are surrounded by life. The trees are twisted splintering apart at the core as if by some great ravaging storm. The exposed raw wood shines sun-bleached in shades of pale yellow, white, and gray, the only darker pigments used to define shadows cast by light from the upper right side of the painting. Following vibrant trees along the lakeside, and along the bottom of the painting, there is further evidence of a great storm; downed and fallen trees lie by ample water, sunlight, and nutrient rich soil, conditions in which the surrounding trees thrive. The 27 x 33 3/4 in. dimensions of Lake with Dead Trees make it reminiscent of a picture window offering a portal to the Catskill mountains in southeastern New York State. The painting does not present a specific moment in time, rather it exists. It seems to indicate that within the delicate balance of beauty and life, there is also a strength that will slowly rise and reclaim where ruin has set foot. As the viewer‚Äôs gaze sweeps from the bottom left of the painting, a scene of destruction evokes emotions of loss and regret. Moving up to the right side of the painting and across the sky, sentiments shift with the change in light. From left to right, the sky clears from a ruminating storm to the respite of a clearing sky. On the left of the painting, the dead trees are prominent, as evident by their size and proximity. As the scene moves right, the dead trees become smaller; they decrease in importance, fade, and give way to living trees and new life. Each of these transitions, from left to right, are smooth, natural motions across realistic spectrums of extremes, until the viewer‚Äôs eye is caught and disrupted by the two deer crossing the painting. Captured in the pristine and graceful scene, the deer appeared overly poised, lacking the fluidity found elsewhere. In 1825, an unnamed contemporary viewer noted Cole might easily have omitted the two deer, as they ‚Äúdetracted from [the] foreground.‚Äù‚ÄúModern Landscapes‚Äù, Allen Memorial Art Museum. Influence The introduction of Thomas Cole‚Äôs works at the emergence of the Hudson River School style, gave voice to conservation, an idea that was just beginning to develop. It was at nearly the same time that Lake with Dead Trees was sold, as were the other four paintings, and Thomas Cole‚Äôs name was starting to become familiar as a noteworthy artist, that the Erie Canal officially opened across upstate New York.‚ÄúModern Landscapes‚Äù, Allen Memorial Art Museum. The opening of this major transportation system, second worldwide only to the Grand Canal in China, swept the nation up in a surge of patriotism and celebration of the innovations of this great country. In this outpouring of nationalism, Thomas Cole was wholeheartedly embraced and became championed as the \\"American Adam of landscape painting.‚Äù‚ÄúModern Landscapes‚Äù, Allen Memorial Art Museum. Cole is considered to be one of the pioneers of American environmentalism, for his concern for the impending destruction by ‚ÄúCopper-hearted barbarians ‚Ä¶ pushing a railroad up through his valley to exploit its natural resources ‚Äì through mining, quarrying, and logging‚Äù and in his effort to inform the public, Thomas Cole‚Äôs labors are among those that motivated the creation of the National Park Service.Christopher, ‚ÄúLiving Off the Landscape,‚Äù 4. Catskill Park was established in 1904 to protect thousands of acres, incredible vistas, and mountain ranges including thirty-three Catskill‚Äôs high peaks, a natural inheritance that will remain forever wild, an event that without Thomas Cole, and Lake with Dead Trees, likely would not have transpired.Christopher, ‚ÄúLiving Off the Landscape,‚Äù 4.

Masterson was born and raised in Galveston, Texas. She was a survivor of the 1900 Galveston hurricane, losing her mother in the carnage. With the passing of her mother, Masterson took over the domestic duties in her household. She eventually attended university receiving her Bachelor of Science, and paving her career in geology as an independent geologist. She made many contributions to the field of geology over the course of her career. Until her death on September 22, 1969, she kept the mineral rights in more than 20 Texas counties and a tungsten mine in Colorado.  Family life  Masterson lost her mother in the 1900 Galveston hurricane that she survived. Masterson had one brother and one sister, Wilmer D. Masterson and Lewis Fisher. Masterson also employed her nephews to mine the ore in her tungsten mine in Nederland. Both her great niece, Amanda Masterson, and her great-great nephew, Wilmer Dallam Masterson IV, attended UT. During the year 1908, Reba's father, Branch T.Masterson, had filed a lawsuit on the behalf of his wife inheritance, who had passed away in the 1900 Great Galveston Hurricane. Branch Masterson worked with a wealthy lawyer named John W Harris, who had an adopted daughter, Anne Wilmer Dallam. Masterson would end up marrying Dallam (Reba's mother), however, at the time of their marriage it was the general consensus that Harris did not legally adopt her, but just generously took her in. Several years later, Harris would die as a Judge and his estate handed down to his natural children, since the adoption had scepticism surrounding it, Dallam was not on that list. Therefore, Branch filed the lawsuit after finding legitimate adoption papers. The finding of the papers meant that Reba's mother had a claim to Harris's estate. Reba first attended the University of Texas in the same year that her father filed the lawsuit. The lawsuit carried on for nine years against close family friends, the Harrises. Reba missed several semesters during the years 1910, 1911 and 1912, which could be explained by helping her father with the lawsuit. After nine long years, the lawsuit was completed in 1917, with Reba and her other family members as beneficiaries (according to the Houston Post) to an settlement which concluded with land holdings in 60 Texas counties and shares in the Galveston Wharf. The total value of the shares and properties topped out at $2,223,860, which due to inflation, would have a grand total of $43,917,065.26 in 2019. Due to the winnings, after years of hardship, Reba and her family had a way to get ahead in the world. Her father, Branch used this opportunity as an way to become more involved with the oil business. Branch ended up becoming a director in The New York and Texas Oil Companies. According to ‚ÄúBudge‚Äù (Anthony Dallam) Sheppard, Reba's great nephew, there is a family story where Reba lost a hand of poker to Dad Joiner, where the pot consisted of an oil and gas lease. Furthermore, Budge also accounted for a story where Reba was testifying as a witness in a lawsuit and received several threats trying to deter her from testifying. In response to the threats, her father, Branch, purchased an .32 caliber pistol for her to travel to and from the trials with. Reba Masterson had an everlasting influence on her family who continue to love petroleum geology. Reba's great-great nephew, Wilmer Dallam Masterson IV is a University of Texas graduate in geology and works in the oil and gas business. Furthermore, his daughter, Kathleen, is in the process of completing her degree in geology at Colorado State University. Moreover, Reba's great niece, Amanda Masterson, spent the duration of her career at the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology. Amanda, while working for the Bureau, discovered a prospect map of a configuration south of Castroville, which Reba, when she was 49, submitted to the Bureau while doing consulting work for them.  Education  In 1908, Masterson enrolled at the University of Texas where she began studying geology. She was the second female graduate student at the University of Texas. She then moved to the University of Colorado where she received her Bachelor of Science in 1915. During her time as a student, Masterson, participated in multiple geology activities and scouting. Reba decided to enroll in college at 26 years old. She wasn't able to go to college right away as her father believed women should not attend college. He eventually gave in, allowing Reba to attend at the University of Texas. The geology department at the University of Texas was very small with only one professor, professor F.W. Simonds and one tutor, Alexander Deussen. Later on, another tutor was hired, by the name Francis Whitney. Reba Masterson and Francis Whitney were the same age. Reba studied at the University of Texas from 1908 to 1912 and had joined a sorority called Kappa Kappa Gamma. Reba also joined the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and was very active in the club. Through her efforts in joining clubs Reba made life-long friends like Eunice Aden in Texas. Reba missed multiple semesters in 1910 to 1912 due to helping her fathers with a long legal battle. In 1912, she left college without finishing her degree and moved to Colorado where she attended the University of Colorado. It is unknown as to why she moved and what caused her three-year delay. She attended classes at the University of Colorado from the fall of 1912 to the summer of 1915. Reba had taken extra time to finish her degree because she left Colorado, which may have been because of another hurricane in Galveston in August 1915. This was right before her final semester at CU. She finished her degree through correspondence in 1916. During her time in Colorado she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma and became active in the YWCA as she missed her friends in Texas. She was teased by her fellow students and her teachers for her Texas accent, but Reba did not care as the geology in Colorado was great. Reba was intrigued by the mountain range in Colorado known as the Front Range. A professor at the University of Colorado, Russell George helped Reba throughout her schooling in Colorado. He provided her the guidance she needed as the faculty was extremely small with only three instructors, Reba struggled with this as there was much more strength and diversity at the University of Texas. Luckily, the University of Colorado accepted all of her credits from the University of Texas, so Reba finished her degree at the University of Colorado and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1916. She was 34 years old. During Reba's time in the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma, she met Eleanor Brackenridge who at the time was a notable activist for the rights of women and a city member of the Fraternity. She was quite influential with all the Kappa Kappa Gammas. Reba was most likely responsible for Eleanor's trip to Galveston in 1910 where she was there to speak about women's suffrage. Reba introduced Eleanor to Ava Ellisor who helped Eleanor a lot with woman's rights, thanks to Reba. Ava Ellisor was heavily influenced by Reba as she followed Rebas path by enrolling in the University of Texas and majored in geology.  The Hurricane  Reba Masterson survived the Great Galveston Hurricane when she was only 18 years old. The following is a direct account from her brother Wilmer D. Masterson on the faithful day that stripped their family of their mother and nine other family members. \\"Debris was now jammed against our row of trees and we knew that they would go down very soon. I was pretty well fogged trying to keep my mother from falling, so after my brother had a brief rest he took my place and I moved to another branch of the tree. Only a few minutes later the tree went down and piles of debris swept over us. Somehow under the water he lost my mother. A few months later her body was found about seven miles distant on the mainland.\\" Reba was able to avoid being swept under the current by holding onto a tree and later found refuge at her aunts house. The family strategically cut large holes in the floor to relieve pressure of the waves which prevents the house being swept away. Her ability to survive this catastrophe led to her become the first female petroleum geologist. The tragedy of losing her mother led Reba to take more responsibility around the household.  Career  Once Masterson graduated from the University of Colorado she started her career in geology. Learning the ropes of the oil industry from her father, Branch Masterson, she started to make a name for herself by traveling across the South and Midwest scouting oil leases. During her years in Colorado she was involved in acquiring and overseeing oil and gas properties in Texas. Reba's great nephew, Budge related that Reba was present in November 1915 when the discovery well for Damon's Mound wells located 30 miles west of Galveston. Family members enjoyed royalties from that field for years. Over the years, she gained experience conducting reconnaissance work in oil fields in Kansas, Illinois, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Kentucky. She also studied the structural geology of Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas by working as an independent geologist. Her work in the oil and gas industry was widely controversial, as many companies did not allow women to work on wells. Reba's interest in geology lead her to buy land, not for ordinary surface uses, but for the minerals. When time came to sell, she would retain half of the mineral rights to the land, only selling the surface itself. This was most likely possible for a woman in her time because of her brother Thomas, who was a lawyer. Reba's great nephew, Budge, recalls that Reba had mineral rights to properties in 20 counties in Texas. Masterson used her geological knowledge of microfossils to earn herself mineral rights and the ability to work in a male dominated field. She was the first female geologist to work fully in the oil patch, and due to her successful entrepreneur she was also the first independent oil woman. Her great nephew, Budge, spent two summers working with her on her tungsten mine near Nederland, Colorado. Budge and Bill worked on a mine together one summer after WWII when tungsten prices had dropped and the mine needed to produce a certain tonnage for the claim to not be reverted. The two would mine ore and add dirt to what they mined to make up for the tonnage, take it to the smelter in Nederland all while fulfilling the requirements and retaining the claim. She continued to mine the property during WWII when tungsten prices were very high. In 1923 Masterson joined the AAPG (American Association of Petroleum Geologists). At this time, Masterson was one of the seven women among the 74 members in the AAPG. She joined after a few years after her fathers‚Äô death in 1920 in Colorado. On her application card, she stated that she was a ‚Äústudent of geology‚Äù and that she had spent a year in Kansas, Illinois, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Kentucky doing reconnaissance work on the oil fields. Furthermore, she also wrote about how she spent five years studying the structural geometry of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas. In 1923 AAPG's 9th annual meeting was hosted, Reba and her six young prot√©g√©s, Alva Ellisor, Esther Richards Applin, Hedwig Knicker, Laura Lane, Emma Jne Coffman, and Bess Stiles were among the 74 founding members. She has been a member for 48 years, until her death in 1969. It is suspected that between leaving Boulder, Colorado and her time of membership to AAPG, she was evaluating and investigating oil properties, and most likely began her work on oil patches the summer she left Boulder in 1915. There is a possibility she was doing reconnaissance work between her coursework in University of Texas, Austin and enrolling in Colorado. Reba and Eunice, a friend from the University of Texas, started a girl's camp (Camp Kiva) which became very popular, at Medina Lake, 30 miles west of San Antonio. They both dedicated significant time and money to make it successful, and it was. Reba and Eunice were frequently written about in the San Antonio Express and other Texas newspapers regarding their travels and participation in society events, including notices about Camp Kiva. Reba eventually set up a scholarship at the University of Texas in Eunice's name for physical education students honoring Eunice's years there as a physical education innovator.

Located in downtown Austin, Texas (the county seat), the courthouse holds civil and criminal trial courts and other functions of county government. The courthouse was built between 1930 and 1931 in the then- contemporary PWA Moderne style, and it was later expanded in 1958 and 1962. History Travis County's first purpose-built courthouse was a modest two- story stone structure built in 1855 near Republic Park in downtown Austin. This courthouse was replaced by a larger building in 1876 and was eventually demolished in 1906. The second Travis County Courthouse was a three-story limestone building designed in a monumental Second Empire style, built along the south side of the Texas State Capitol. The county's needs outgrew this building, too, and in 1931 it was replaced by the current courthouse, after which it was used as office space for Texas state agencies and then finally demolished in 1964. In 1930 the county selected a site on the north side of Wooldridge Park for the building of a third and larger county courthouse. Construction began with the laying of the cornerstone in 1930; on June 27, 1931, the courthouse was completed and had its grand opening, and the county's courts and offices moved in from the previous courthouse building. As the county continued to grow, substantial additions to the facility were made in 1958 and 1962. =Sweatt v. Painter= In 1946, an African-American law student named Heman Marion Sweatt was denied admission to the University of Texas School of Law on the grounds that the Constitution of Texas prohibited racially integrated education. Sweatt sued the University with the support of the NAACP, and his suit was heard in Texas District Court in the Travis County Courthouse in June 1946 and again in May 1947, where Sweatt's case was argued by a young Thurgood Marshall. After the state established a temporary \\"School of Law of the Texas State University for Negroes,\\" the district court found that the state had fulfilled its constitutional obligations to Sweatt; Sweatt appealed his suit to the Supreme Court of the United States, however, and in 1950 the Supreme Court ruled in Sweatt v. Painter that Sweatt should be admitted to the University of Texas. On October 21, 2005, Travis County renamed its courthouse the \\"Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse\\" in honor of this notable trial in the history of the Civil Rights Movement. =Replacement efforts= In the early 2010s, as population growth in Travis County continued to strain the courthouse's capacity, the county made plans to replace the 1931 courthouse with a new, still larger facility. Officials selected a county-owned downtown lot near the site of the first county courthouse, and on August 18, 2015, the Travis County Commissioners Court voted to propose a $287 million municipal bond issuance to fund a new courthouse complex. In the November 2015 general election, however, the bond measure was rejected by Travis County voters, and the county instead enacted a \\"preservation master plan\\" in January 2016 to provide for necessary repairs to the existing courthouse. After the defeat of the courthouse bond, the county began pursuing ownership of the 1936 United States Courthouse that had recently been left vacant by the completion of a new federal courthouse complex. At a press conference on December 29, 2016, officials from Travis County and the federal judiciary and local U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett announced that ownership of the old federal courthouse had been transferred to Travis County. The county then budgeted $28 million to bring the structure up to current building codes and adapt it to house the county probate courts by 2020. On July 10, 2018, Travis County entered a negotiation agreement with developers to design and build a new downtown court facility, and on January 15, 2019, the county approved funding for the project. Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony on May 31, 2019, with the new facility scheduled for completion in 2022. Architecture The carved lintel above the main entrance in the east facade The Travis County Courthouse is a six-story steel-and- concrete building clad with cream-colored limestone. Its design exemplifies the PWA Moderne architectural style of many Great Depression-era public buildings, with its symmetrical rectangular forms, recessed vertical window bays, and smooth stonework exterior decorated with neoclassical flourishes and geometric detailing. The building was designed by the firm of local architect Charles Henry Page (well known for his work on other Texas courthouses of the period). The construction contractor was H.E. Wattinger. =Exterior= The original main entry (now closed for security reasons) is in the east facade, where a staircase leads from street level up to bronze doors within a projecting doorframe, with an elaborately carved lintel depicting a judge releasing shackled prisoners to a celebrating crowd. The windows in the building's central mass are joined into five recessed vertical window bays, with decorative cast-iron spandrels between the windows and pilasters running vertically between bays. The facade was originally symmetrical north and south, but large expansions to the north side (added during renovations in 1958 and 1962) now give the building a lopsided silhouette. =Interior= The building's interior exhibits Art Moderne and Art Deco finishes and detailing. The structure was originally built to hold three courts and all county government offices, with the county jail on the top two floors. , it now houses two county civil courts, a justice of the peace court, thirteen Texas district courts, two district clerks, and two probate courts, though the probate courts are set to be relocated into the former federal courthouse building by 2020.

The park was initially named after Viceroy Charles Hardinge and was built in his honour as he was instrumental in the creation of Bihar as a separate province. The name was changed to Shaheed Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park post independence. The park also hosted a garden party for then Prince of Wales - Edward VIII - in 1921 on his visit to Patna. The park completed its centenary in 2016. History On 28 September 1913, the Hardinge Memorial Committee was constituted by state authorities to design and set up a park in Patna. A deed of grant was signed between the Patna collector and the Hardinge Memorial Committee on 8 September 1915 for development of a public park as Hardinge Park to be maintained by the committee. The Park was officially opened to the public on 31 January 1916 by the then Lieutenant-Governor of Bihar and Orissa, Edward Albert Gait. It was built in honour of Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst and was named after him. At the opening of the Park Lt Governor had also unveiled a 5 tonne life-size bronze statue of Lord Hardinge. The statue was created by renowned British sculptor Herbert Hampton in London. After protests in late 1960s the statue was removed from the park and placed in Patna Museum. The park was also the location of Garden party for then Prince of Wales - Edward VIII - during his Patna visit in 1921. The party was hosted by Bihar Landholders' Association led by Maharaja of Darbhanga. The park is one of the oldest parks in the city of Patna. The name of the park was changed to Shaheed Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park after Kunwar Singh who was a notable leader during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The park used to be the location of Flower Shows in Patna for many years. Design and Location The park is located on north of Hardinge Road and Delhi-Howrah railway line in east‚Äìwest direction. It is spread over an area of 22 acres and is somewhat triangular in shape. The park is dotted with ornamental fountains and perpendicular pathways are present across the area of the park. The pedestal of the bronze statue still stands in the park. Present Day The park has not been well maintained by the government and is in a state of neglect. It was recently being used as a land fill and garbage dump by the municipal corporation. Bihar Government plans to redevelop the park as a model park. The plan includes recreational facilities like toy train, musical fountains and a small boating space. Sporting facilities in its adjoining open area is also on the plan.

It first flew on 28 June 2016 with a second aircraft successfully flying in 2017. Internal development of the Aquila aircraft was stopped in June 2018. Development Aquila was developed by Facebook's Connectivity Lab. The prototype airframe design and construction was led by Ascenta, a Somerset, England-based company acquired by Facebook in 2014. Several scale models of the Aquila were built and flown to prove the concept prior to the full scale prototype being built. Following construction at Ascenta's factory in Bridgwater, England, the Aquila prototype was disassembled and shipped to Arizona, where it was first flown on 28 June 2016. The 96-minute flight was considered successful. However, during landing, the aircraft touched down short of the intended landing zone and was damaged; the National Transportation Safety Board conducted an investigation into the accident, as the drone suffered a structural failure just before touching down. The aircraft was designed such that a production version would be able to support continuous flight in the stratosphere for 90 days. Following the crash, the prototype Aquila was modified with spoilers, provision for feathering the propellers, and refinement of the exterior surface of the aircraft; the second flight took place on 22 May 2017, with the one-hour, 46-minute flight being considered successful. In November 2017, a partnership with Airbus was announced to further development of the Aquila and the \\"high altitude platform station broadband connectivity system\\" (HAPS) project. The same month, it was announced that Aquila would be displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum's spring \\"The Future Starts here\\" exhibition in 2018. In June 2018, as aerospace manufacturers start designing and building HAPS, Facebook decided to stop its program to work with partners like Airbus on HAPS connectivity and their technologies like flight control and high- density batteries. In 2018, it was reported that Facebook and Airbus have scheduled test flights in Australia using the latter's Zephyr drone technology. Zephyr share the same blueprint with Aquila as it also uses solar power. Design The drone has a wingspan roughly the same as a Boeing 737, but weighs only . Aquila is of flying wing configuration, the upper surface of the wing being covered in solar cells to power the aircraft's four electric motors; batteries, composing half the aircraft's weight, provide power storage for night flight. Aquila is claimed to use the same amount of power as three blow dryers. While the prototype used a launch trolley to become airborne, production Aquilas are intended to be launched using helium balloons, carrying the aircraft to their operational height and releasing them; landings would take place on grassy surfaces. Aquila is intended to fly at altitudes of up to during the day, dropping to at night, with an endurance of up to three months, providing Internet service to a -radius area below its flight path; if communications spectrum was assigned for the project, it would allow the 66% of Earth's surface that has poor or no internet access to be connected. The technology, which used high-bandwidth lasers to beam the Internet to remote locations, was intended to provide access to 4 billion users, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

It was given its name when, in 1703, the last Bavarian troops were driven from the Tyrol on St. Anne's Day (26 July), as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1704, in gratitude, the Landst√§nde vowed to build a monument commemorating the event. The column was made by Trient sculptor, Cristoforo Benedetti, from red Kramsach marble. On the base are four statues of saints: * in the north, Saint Anne, the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary * in the west, Cassian, patron saint of the Diocese of Bozen- Brixen. * in the east, Vigilius, patron saint of the Diocese of Trient. * in the south, Saint George with dragon and lance, then and since 2006, patron saint (now together with Saint Joseph) Towering above these four statues is the column with its statue of Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse. The column was consecrated on 26 July 1706 by Prince-Bishop Kaspar Ignaz, Count of K√ºnigl. It has been restored several times over the centuries. In 1958, mainly for conservation reasons, the figure of Mary was replaced by a replica and the original was loaned to the Abbey of St. Georgenberg-Fiecht, where it has been placed in a side chapel of the abbey church of Fiecht (near Schwaz) above Saint Mary's altar.

His name Julins was apparently a form of Joscelin, and has been generally misspelt Julius. Early life He was the son of Roger Palmer, mercer or upholsterer, who was sheriff of Coventry in 1525 and mayor in 1533.Coventry's MayorsMayors, Bailiffs, and Sheriffs of Coventry, 1830, p. 3, &c; He was born at Coventry, but at an early age entered Magdalen College School, Oxford, where he was for some time a pupil of John Harley, afterwards Bishop of Hereford. Under Edward VI He then became clerk at Magdalen College, and graduated B.A. in March 1548; in 1549 he was elected fellow, and in 1550 was appointed reader in logic. He soon attracted notice by his uncompromising Roman Catholic opinions, and in 1552 was accused of having written libellous verses on the president, Walter Haddon. Palmer denied the charge, but attacked the reformers with such vehemence that his name was struck off the list of fellows before July. He then became a tutor in the household of Sir Francis Knollys. Under Mary I On the accession of Mary he was restored to his fellowship, but a perusal of Calvin's ‚ÄòInstitutes‚Äô began to unsettle his religious opinions, and his orthodoxy was further shaken by reading Peter Martyr's ‚ÄòCommentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians‚Äô and by witnessing the execution of Ridley and Latimer, which he strongly denounced. He now became as vehement a Protestant as he had before been Roman Catholic, absented himself from mass, and made a point of walking out whenever obnoxious ceremonies occurred in the church service. He avoided a second expulsion from his fellowship by voluntarily leaving Oxford, and obtained the grant of a mastership in Reading School. He was not long left in peace, for his study was searched by some of his enemies, and various anti-Roman catholic manuscripts discovered, including a poem called ‚ÄòEpicedium,‚Äô written in answer to an epitaph on Gardiner by Peter Morwen. They threatened to inform against him unless he at once left Reading. Palmer sought shelter with his mother, who, after her husband's death, had retired to Eynsham, but she refused it on account of his heretical opinions. He now apparently obtained letters from the president of Magdalen, Arthur Cole, recommending him for a mastership in a school in Gloucestershire; but an incautious visit to Reading to secure his manuscripts and arrears of pay led to his arrest. He was brought before the mayor, Robert Bowyer, and then taken to Newbury. Here he was examined before the consistory of Dr. Jeffrey on 16 July 1556, and, after refusing to subscribe certain articles drawn up for him, was condemned to be burnt. The sentence was carried out on the following morning at the sandpits, which tradition identifies with some pits near the town on the Enborne road.Newbury and its Environs, pp. 91‚Äì102.

It was Vee's 6th album and The Crickets' second release following the departure and subsequent death of their front man, Buddy Holly. The album contains new versions of three songs written by or recorded by Holly‚ÄîPeggy Sue, Bo Diddley, and Well...All Right‚Äîand a host of cover versions of 1950s rock'n'roll songs by artists like Little Richard and Chuck Berry. Originally released as an LP record on July 14, 1962, the album was re-released on CD in 1991, with bonus tracks not featured on the original album. Background After Buddy Holly's departure, The Crickets recorded with Earl Sinks serving as lead vocalist, with Crickets Jerry Allison and Sonny Curtis also sharing vocals. David Box also recorded a single as lead vocalist in 1959. Several weeks after relocating to Los Angeles in 1960, guitarist and songwriter Sonny Curtis was drafted and began a two-year stint in the US Army,http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/61192. Curtis was stationed in Fort Ord and limited in his ability to continue working with the band.https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sonny-curtis-mn0000044455/biography With Curtis away, Jerry Allison offered fellow Texan Jerry Naylor the position of lead singer with the group in 1961. He would remain through early 1965. Tommy Allsup, the guitarist who had toured with Holly during the fateful Winter Dance Party frequently played with the band. Singing star and Liberty records artist Bobby Vee had a number of connections with Holly and the Crickets. After Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper were killed in the tragic February 1959 plane crash, Fargo, North Dakota teenager Bobby Vee was among several local young musicians recruited to join the rest of the Winter Dance Party tour, beginning with the next scheduled concert in Fargo.Hyatt, Wesley (1999).

The painting measures 97 √ó 116 cm. and dates from 1881, and is part of a series of seven portraits of Richard Gallo, one of the best childhood friends of the artist, composed between 1878 and 1884.  Description  This portrait of 1881 shows a young man dressed elegantly in black, which contrasts with the muted colors of the sofa's fabric. The social position of the portrait subject, a member of the big bourgeoisie and the son of a banker, is suggested by the refinement of the decoration with gilded woodwork, the expensive fabric of the sofa, the care of his costume and the confident but reserved attitude he observes, arms crossed with a newspaper unfolded on the left thigh. This newspaper evokes the function of Richard Gallo who came that year to enter as a journalist in the conservative and republican newspaper, The Constitutional which his brother-in-law, Alcide Grandguillo, is the owner. However, if you look closely, this unfolded newspaper is not Le Constitutionnel, but a new competitor recently launched, Le Figaro, as an allusion to the competitive world of the French press of that time and the new law of 1881 on the freedom of the press which caused great debate that year. Richard Gallo then lived at 40 rue du Rocher in Paris, near the apartment of Gustave Caillebotte and his brother Martial of 31 Boulevard Haussmann, in a modern and prestigious district inhabited by the upper middle class of finance. Caillebotte also painted his friend with him in his studio in Autoportrait au chevalet (1879-1880) which proves their closeness and their agreement on the cultural, artistic and political life of that time. This painting was exhibited at the last impressionist exhibition in 1882, but it went relatively unnoticed. The influence of the master of Caillebotte, Leon Bonnat, seen in the rendering of the face and the black suit, but the diagonal perspective (with the play of angle), the look of Richard Gallo and the decoration of arabesques and stripes of the fabric of the sofa, express the impressionist point of view of the artist.

Its half-light radius is about , assuming a distance of , and it has an estimated mass of about . The Gaia 1 cluster was detected by researchers applying automated \\"star gauging\\" to the Gaia observatory's data on star locations. This analysis surprisingly indicated a prominent concentration of stars, previously unknown and uncataloged, adjacent to Sirius. Gaia observed a cluster population of approximately 1,200 stars down to Gaia magnitude 19. Analysis of 2MASS data for those stars shows a red giant branch and a pronounced red clump that allows the absolute magnitude of the stars to be deduced and the distance calculated. Fitting the red giant branch also allows the age of the cluster to be calculated.  References External links * How do you find a star cluster? Easy, simply count the stars.

Location The university's main campus is in the central business district of the city of Kabwe, approximately by road north of Lusaka, the capital and largest city in Zambia. The geographical coordinates of Kwame Nkrumah University are:14¬∞26'41.0\\"S, 28¬∞28'02.0\\"E (Latitude:-14.444722; Longitude:28.467222). History The institution was opened in 1967, as Kabwe Teachers Training College. It trained junior secondary school teachers at its inception. Four years later, the president of Zambia at the time, Kenneth Kaunda, re-named the college Nkrumah Teachers College, in honor of Kwame Nkrumah, the founding president of Ghana. During the period when Levy Mwanawasa was president (2002 to 2008), the college began transforming into a university, a process that concluded while Michael Sata was in office (2011 to 2014). Kwame Nkrumah University was established by Part IV, Section 14 of the Higher Education Act No. 4 of 2013. At its inception, the university could only accommodate 600 students, a number that has since increased to 6,000. As of August 2016, it employed 74 full-time academic staff. At that time, the university was undergoing a major infrastructure expansion, including four student hostels; each capable of accommodating 600 students. Hua Jiang Investment Limited, a Chinese construction firm, is carrying out the construction works, on which the government of Zambia had spent in excess of ZMW:57,518,410 (approx. US$5.68 million). The university held its first graduation ceremony under its own university letterheads in August 2015. Locations Nkrumah University has two campus locations. The main campus -- Munkoyo Street Campus -- is about 3 km from the Kabwe city center. Nkrumah University has recently acquired the PAID-ESA campus along the same street (Previously the Pan African Institute for Development - East/Southern Africa); this campus will help expand the capacity of the university. Academics The following undergraduate degree courses are offered by Kwame Nkrumah University: * Bachelor of Arts with Education in the Humanities and Social Sciences * Bachelor of Science with Education in the Natural Sciences * Bachelor of Business Studies with Education =Departments= The Nkrumah University is divided into 4 schools: *School of Natural Sciences with departments for: # Life Sciences # Physical Sciences # Mathematics and Statistics # Physical Education *School of Business Studies with departments for: # Computing and Communication Technologies # Accounting, Economics and Finance # Marketing and Management Studies *School of Education with departments for: # Psychology And Sociology # Educational Administration and Policy Studies # Languages and Social Sciences Education # Mathematics and Science Education # Special Education *School of Social Sciences with departments for: # Social Sciences # Languages # Religious Studies # Linguistics Governance The University Senate runs the university under the supervision of the University Council.

The separation energy is different for each nuclide and particle to be removed. Values are stated as \\"neutron separation energy\\", \\"two-neutron separation energy\\", \\"proton separation energy\\", \\"deuteron separation energy\\", \\"alpha separation energy\\", and so on. The lowest separation energy among stable nuclides is 1.67 MeV, to remove a neutron from beryllium-9. The energy can be added to the nucleus by an incident high-energy gamma ray. If the energy of the incident photon exceeds the separation energy, a photodisintegration might occur. Energy in excess of the threshold value becomes kinetic energy of the ejected particle. By contrast, nuclear binding energy is the energy needed to completely disassemble a nucleus, or the energy released when a nucleus is assembled from nucleons. It is the sum of multiple separation energies, which should add to the same total regardless of the order of assembly or disassembly. Physics and chemistry Electron separation energy or electron binding energy, the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral atom or molecule (or cation) is called ionization energy. The reaction leads to photoionization, photodissociation, the photoelectric effect, photovoltaics, etc. Bond-dissociation energy is the energy required to break one bond of a molecule or ion, usually separating an atom or atoms.

George Hourani indicated that the Iqtisad and Mizan al-amal were completed before or during Ghazali's crisis of faith. It led him to abandon his notorious post at the Ni·∫ìamiyya school in Baghdad and enter the path of Tasawwuf. In it, he offers what scholars consider as the best defence of the Ash'arite school of Islamic theology. He also expressed strong reservations about a theology based on taqlid and marked by polemics. In this book, Ghazali makes an attempt to respond to the extreme literalists and the Mu øtazilites. It is the balance between reason and revelation that led to the title of book The Moderation in Belief.  Contents  Ghazali begins the book with praise for God and importance of revelation. On one hand, he says, a person who is not guided by reason will misunderstand the revelation while on the other hand a rationalist may exceed the limits leading to rejection of the plain meaning of revelation. The right course, he says, is to reconcile reason with revelation, one that puts reason at the service of understanding and then interprets the revelation. Reason, together with the Revelation, is light upon light as mentioned in Quran chapter 24, verse 35. Next comes an explanatory chapter with its four introductions and four main sections. Ghazali's main topic throughout is in praise of God, depicting it as a work of theology.  Translations  A translation into English of the first sections was published as a dissertation by Dennis Morgan Davis Jr. in 2005. The first complete English-language edition of was made by Aladdin M. Yaqub, and published by the University of Chicago Press in 2013.

It formerly claimed that each token was backed by one United States dollar, but on 14 March 2019 changed the backing to include loans to affiliate companies. The Bitfinex exchange was accused by the New York Attorney General of using Tether's funds to cover up $850 million in funds missing since mid-2018. Tether is called a stablecoin because it was originally designed to always be worth $1.00, maintaining $1.00 in reserves for each tether issued. Nevertheless, Tether Limited states that owners of tethers have no contractual right, other legal claims, or guarantee that tethers will be redeemed or exchanged for dollars. On 30 April 2019 Tether Limited's lawyer claimed that each tether was backed by only $0.74 in cash and cash equivalents. Tether Limited and the tether cryptocurrency are controversial because of the company's failure to provide a promised audit showing adequate reserves backing tether, its alleged role in manipulating the price of bitcoin, the unclear relationship with the Bitfinex exchange, and the company's apparent lack of a long-term banking relationship. Author David Gerard was quoted by the Wall Street Journal saying that Tether \\"is sort of the central bank of crypto trading ... [yet] they don't conduct themselves like you'd expect a responsible, sensible financial institution to do.\\" Tether's price decreased to lows of $0.90 on 15 October 2018 on speculation that investors are losing faith in the token. On 20 November 2018, Bloomberg reported that U.S. federal prosecutors are investigating whether Tether was used to manipulate the price of bitcoin. In 2019, Tether surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume with the highest daily and monthly trading volume of any cryptocurrency on the market. History Beginning with a whitepaper published online in January 2012, J.R. Willett described the possibility of building new currencies on top of the Bitcoin Protocol. Willett went on to help implement this idea in the cryptocurrency Mastercoin, which had an associated Mastercoin Foundation (later renamed the Omni Foundation) to promote the use of this new \\"second layer\\". The Mastercoin protocol would become the technological foundation of the Tether cryptocurrency, and one of the original members of Mastercoin Foundation, Brock Pierce, would become a co-founder of Tether. Another Tether founder, Craig Sellars, was the CTO of the Mastercoin Foundation. The precursor to Tether, originally named \\"Realcoin\\", was announced in July 2014 by co-founders Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars as a Santa Monica based startup. The first tokens were issued on 6 October 2014, on the Bitcoin blockchain. This was done by using the Omni Layer Protocol. On 20 November 2014, Tether CEO Reeve Collins announced the project was being renamed to \\"Tether\\". The company also announced it was entering private beta, which supported a \\"Tether+ token\\" for three currencies: USTether (US+) for United States dollars, EuroTether (EU+) for euros and YenTether (JP+) for Japanese yen. Tether said \\"Every Tether+ token is backed 100% by its original currency, and can be redeemed at any time with no exposure to exchange risk.\\" The company's website states that it is incorporated in Hong Kong with offices in Switzerland, without giving details. In January 2015, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex enabled trading of Tether on their platform. While representatives from Tether and Bitfinex say that the two are separate, the Paradise Papers leaks in November 2017 named Bitfinex officials Philip Potter and Giancarlo Devasini as responsible for setting up Tether Holdings Limited in the British Virgin Islands in 2014. A spokesperson for Bitfinex and Tether has said that the CEO of both firms is Jan Ludovicus van der Velde. According to Tether's website, the Hong Kong-based Tether Limited is a fully owned subsidiary of Tether Holdings Limited. Bitfinex is one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges by volume in the world. For a while, Tether was processing US dollar transactions through Taiwanese banks which, in turn, sent the money through the bank Wells Fargo to allow the funds to move outside Taiwan. Tether announced that on 18 April 2017, these international transfers had been blocked. Along with Bitfinex, Tether filed suit against Wells Fargo in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit was withdrawn a week later. In June 2017, the Omni foundation and Charlie Lee announced that Tether would soon be issued on the Omni layer of Litecoin. In September 2017, Tether announced they would be launching additional ERC-20 tokens for United States dollars and euros on the Ethereum blockchain. Tether later confirmed the ethereum tokens were issued. Currently, there are a total of four distinct Tether tokens: United States dollar tether on Bitcoin's Omni layer, euro tether on Bitcoin's Omni layer, United States dollar tether as an ERC-20 token, and euro tether as an ERC-20 token. From January 2017 to September 2018, the amount of tethers outstanding grew from about $10 million to about $2.8 billion. In early 2018 Tether accounted for about 10% of the trading volume of bitcoin, but during the summer of 2018 it accounted for up to 80% of bitcoin volume. Research suggests that a price manipulation scheme involving tether accounted for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017. More than $500 million Tethers were issued in August 2018. On 15 October 2018 the tether price briefly fell to $0.88 due to the perceived credit risk as traders on Bitfinex exchanged tether for bitcoin, driving up the price of bitcoin. Tether Limited has never substantiated their claim of full-backing through a promised audit of their currency reserves. In April 2019 New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a suit accusing Bitfinex of using Tether's reserves to cover up a loss of $850 million. Bitfinex had been unable to obtain a normal banking relationship, according to the lawsuit, so it deposited over $1 billion with a Panamanian payment processor known as Crypto Capital Corp. The funds were allegedly co-mingled corporate and client deposits and no contract was ever signed with Crypto Capital. James alleged that in 2018 Bitfinex and Tether knew or suspected that Crypto Capital had absconded with the money, but that their investors were never informed of the loss. Reggie Fowler, who is alleged to have connections with Crypto Capital, was indicted on 30 April 2019, for running an unlicensed money transmitting business for virtual currency traders. He is believed to have failed to return about $850 million to an unnamed client. Investigators also seized $14,000 in counterfeit currency from his office. Tether runs on Ethereum and has been linked to Ethereum network congestion. Alleged price manipulation Research by John M. Griffin and Amin Shams in 2018 suggests that trading associated with increases in the amount of tether and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange account for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017. Reporters from Bloomberg, checking out accusations that tether pricing was manipulated on the Kraken exchange, found evidence that these prices were also manipulated. Red flags included small orders moving the price as much as larger orders, and \\"oddly specific order sizes‚Äîmany going out to five decimal points, with some repeating frequently.\\" These oddly sized orders might have been used to signal wash trades in automated trading programs, according to New York University Professor Rosa Abrantes-Metz and former Federal Reserve bank examiner Mark Williams. According to Tether's website tether can be newly issued, by purchase for dollars, or redeemed by exchanges and qualified corporate customers excluding U.S.-based customers. Journalist Jon Evans states that he has not been able to find publicly verifiable examples of a purchase of newly issued tether or a redemption in the year ending August 2018. JL van der Velde, CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether, denied the claims of price manipulation: \\"Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.\\" Subpoenas from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission were sent to Tether and Bitfinex on 6 December 2017. Tether's former auditor, Friedman LLP, has also been issued a subpoena. Noble Bank in Puerto Rico was reportedly handling dollar transfers for Tether. Noble, in turn, used the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation as its custodian. As of October 2018, Nobel Bank has put itself up for sale and reportedly no longer has banking relationships with Tether, Bitfinex, or Bank of New York Mellon. Though Bitfinex lacks the banking connections to accept dollar deposits, it has denied that it is insolvent. Tether announced a new banking relationship with Bahamas-based Deltec Bank in November 2018, releasing a letter, purportedly from Deltec, that said it had $1.8 billion on deposit with the bank. The letter was two paragraphs long and signed with an illegible squiggle, without a printed author's name. A Deltec spokesperson declined to confirm the information in the letter to Bloomberg reporters. Some studies have argued that use of Tether in trading on online cryptocurrency exchanges has resulted in arbitrage trading strategies between countries. In fact, it has even been thought that arbitrage trading of Tether in countries of low Bitcoin premium to high Bitcoin premium accounts for up to 80% of all Bitcoin returns on these exchanges.  Security and liquidity  Tether claims that it intends to hold all United States dollars in reserve so that it can meet customer withdrawals upon demand, though it was unable to meet all withdrawal requests in 2017. Tether purports to make reserve account holdings transparent via external audit; however, no such audits exist. In January 2018 Tether announced that they no longer had a relationship with their auditor. About $31 million of USDT tokens were stolen from Tether in November 2017. Later analysis of the Bitcoin distributed ledger showed a close connection between the Tether hack and the January 2015 hack of Bitstamp. In response to the theft, Tether suspended trading, and stated it would roll out new software to implement an emergency \\"hard fork\\" in order to render all of the tokens that Tether identified as stolen in the heist untradable. Tether has stated that as of 19 December 2017, it has re-enabled limited cryptocurrency wallet services and has begun processing the backlog of pending trades.  Questions about dollar reserves  A blockchain critic has raised questions about the relationship between Bitfinex and Tether, accusing Bitfinex of creating \\"magic Tethers out of thin air\\". In September 2017, Tether published a memorandum from a public accounting firm that Tether Limited then said showed that tethers were fully backed by US dollars; however, according to the New York Times, independent attorney Lewis Cohen stated the document, because of the careful way it was phrased, does not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars\\". The documents also fail to ascertain whether the balances in question are otherwise encumbered.\\". The accounting firm specifically stated that Tether has repeatedly claimed that they would present audits showing that the amount of tethers outstanding are backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars on deposit. They have failed to do so. A June 2018 attempt at an audit was posted on their website in June 2018 which showed a report by the law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan LLP (FSS) which appeared to confirm that the issued tethers were fully backed by dollars. However, FSS stated \\"FSS is not an accounting firm and did not perform the above review and confirmations using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,\\" and \\"The above confirmation of bank and tether balances should not be construed as the results of an audit and were not conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.\\" Stuart Hoegner, Tether's general counsel said \\"the bottom line is an audit cannot be obtained. The big four firms are anathema to that level of risk. We‚Äôve gone for what we think is the next best thing.\\" During the course of a price manipulation investigation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United States Department of Justice, Phil Potter, Chief Strategy Officer of Bitfinex and an executive of Tether Limited, departed Bitfinex in 2018. The investigation was continuing on 20 November 2018 and focusing on Tether and Bitfinex, according to Bloomberg.

The majority held that the Ktunaxa Nation's rights were not violated by the decision of the Province of British Columbia to allow the Jumbo Glacier ski resort to expand into area within Ktunaxa territory known as Qat‚Äômuk where Grizzly Bear Spirit is believed to live. This is because the belief in Grizzly Bear Spirit and the ability to act upon it were not impinged, only the location, and so is not within the scope of s.2 of the Charter.

Ktunaxa title to the area would have to be tried separately. The minority held that the duty to consult and accommodated was met, but that freedom of religion was impinged.

They were led by head coach Kevin Donley, who served his 14th year as the first and only head coach in the history of Saint Francis football. The Cougars played their home games at Bishop John D'Arcy Stadium and were members of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA) Mideast League (MEL). The Cougars finished in 3rd place in the MSFA MEL division, but they received an at-large bid to participate in the postseason NAIA playoffs.  Schedule  (9-3 overall, 3-2 conference) Game summaries The 2011 season opened with the Cougars ranked #4 in the coaches preseason poll. 9/10/2011 - After a hard-fought 1-point victory over St. Ambrose, the Cougars gained two spots in the NAIA national rankings. After their first game, the Cougars trailed only conference rival Saint Xavier in the polls. 9/24/2011 - The game was over early as Saint Francis ran back the opening kickoff for a touchdown. With 30 seconds gone off the clock, the score reached 14-0 after Saint Francis capitalized on a Concordia turnover. The score was 41-0 after one period of play. This was the first season for football at Concordia, so the lop-sided outcome was not a surprise. The win sets up an anticipated game next week as undefeated and NAIA #1 Saint Xavier visits undefeated and NAIA #2 USF. 10/1/2011 - The NAIA's #1 ranked Saint Xavier visited the #2 ranked Saint Francis in a battle for the conference and national lead. The anticipated matchup between the two teams, both nicknamed the Cougars, never materialized. Saint Francis took the opening kickoff and turned it into a field goal for a quick three-point lead. But from that point to the end, Saint Xavier controlled both sides of the ball and won more convincingly than the final score indicated. Saint Xavier‚Äôs offense ended with 452 yards while Saint Francis totaled 360 yards. The Saint Francis effort included 27 rushes for 72 yards, or 2.7 yards per attempt. Passing tallied another 268 yards on 19-46 and 4 interceptions. Additionally, the offense fumbled the ball 6 times and lost 2 to Saint Xavier. The surprisingly uncharacteristic total of 10 turnovers and 6 fumbles for the USF Cougars was the same disappointing play that has resulted in 4 straight losses to SXU. One bright spot was the play of the special teams. Early in the first quarter, a Saint Francis punt bounced off the Saint Xavier punt returner and was recovered in the end zone for a Saint Francis touchdown, pushing the lead to a hopeful 10-0 margin. Saint Francis still lead 17-16 at halftime when Saint Xavier lined up for the third quarter kickoff. Instead of kicking the ball deep, SXU successfully executed an onside kick, and their offense soon capitalized on the play. A touchdown gave Saint Xavier their first lead of the game, 23-17. However, the Saint Francis return team took the ensuing kickoff 98 yards to quickly regain the lead, 24-23. That was the last highlight for Saint Francis except for an inconsequential touchdown late in the game after the outcome was already determined. The loss dropped USF to 7th in the national polls. Saint Xavier retained the #1 position and was closely followed by MSFA conference foe Marian, who took over the #2 spot held the prior week by Saint Francis. The latter two teams will meet in two weeks in Fort Wayne, and Saint Francis hopes to get another shot at Saint Xavier in the postseason tournament. 10/8/2011 - After last week's loss, USF had another difficult opponent in Walsh. Formerly a MSFA conference meeting, the game was a non-league contest this year due to the transition of Walsh from the NAIA to NCAA-II football. The game was won in the 2nd overtime period when USF scored and converted the extra point kick after a missed extra point effort by Walsh. The game was highlighted by USF redshirt freshman Antoin Campbell, who set a new Cougar record by scoring 5 touchdowns in the game. For the week's effort, the Cougars moved up one spot in the national rankings to 6th. The tough opponents continue next week with another conference game, Homecoming Week against Marian, the nation's #2 ranked team. 10/15/2011 - Facing their second top-2 ranked team in 3 weeks, the outcome this week was known from the start. Marian drove the opening kickoff to a touchdown and a 7-0 lead, and they were up 14-0 before Saint Francis put any points on the board. Marian dominated the game, led by the nation's top-ranked scoring and passing defense, and USF never raised a serious threat. The final outcome was another home defeat for USF, by a final score of 40-13. The 27-point deficit was the largest differential for a home game in the history of Saint Francis football. The 2-game home losing streak matched a feat not seen since the inaugural 1998 football season. With the loss, the Cougars dropped to 12th in the national rankings. Marian stayed undefeated and set up a likely showdown in the final game of the regular season, a home contest against Saint Xavier. The game could feature two undefeated teams, ranked #1 and #2 in the NAIA national polls, vying for the top seed in the playoffs, an undefeated regular season, and the MSFA Mideast division championship. 10/22/2011 - The Cougars returned to their winning ways with a 47-10 victory over visiting Malone. This might be the last game ever against the Cougars' former conference rival. Malone has begun a transition to leave the NAIA to join the NCAA Division II football level. Therefore, today's game was not a conference win for USF. 10/29/2011 - The Cougars posted a 34-7 road win over conference opponent Quincy University. After the win, USF rose one spot in the national polls to 11th among all NAIA football programs. 11/5/2011 - Turnovers plagued the Cougars offense this week just as they have all season. A pick-6 interception resulted in one Taylor touchdown, and a muffed field goal attempt was returned for a second touchdown, and the Cougars found themselves tied with Taylor at the half, 14-14. But the Cougars settled down in the second half, scoring 32 unanswered points for a 46-14 victory. The defensive play was solid for the Cougars, completing a TSO (technical shut- out) for the day. With two losses and one game left in the regular season, the Cougars likely need to win their final game to enter the 16-team, post-season NAIA football playoffs. 11/12/2011 - The Cougars finished the regular season with an impressive 59-20 home win over NCAA Division II opponent Central State. The victory completed a season whose two losses ironically came to conference foes who were ranked #1 and #2 in the nation at the time the games were played. The USF season was extended with an invitation to the NAIA playoffs, playing the following week as the 9th seed in the 16-team tournament. 11/19/2011 - The Cougars opened the 2011 NAIA playoffs with a 28-14 road win at Missouri Valley. The win was the 9th straight first round postseason win for the Cougars. 11/26/2011 - The USF season ended with their 3rd loss of the year to an undefeated, top-3 ranked team. Each of the 3 teams advanced to the NAIA Championship semifinal round. This time, the Cougars traveled to undefeated and #3 Georgetown College (KY), and they were handed a 26-14 loss. Turnovers and untimely penalties once again contributed significantly to the loss. With their performance against the tough 2011 schedule, including a first round postseason win, the Cougars were elevated to 7th place in the final Coaches poll of the season.

Cool pavement is a road surface that uses additives to reflect solar radiation unlike conventional dark pavement. Conventional dark pavements contribute to urban heat islands as they absorb 80‚Äì95% of sunlight and warm the local air. Cool pavements are made with different materials to increase albedo, thereby reflecting shortwave radiation out of the atmosphere. Increasing albedo reduces heat transfer to the surface and can hypothetically cause local cooling if the spatial scale of the albedo reduction is sufficiently large. The EPA reports \\"that if pavement reflectance throughout a city were increased from 10 to 35 percent, the air temperature could potentially be reduced by 1¬∞F (0.6¬∞C).\\"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2012. \\"Cool Pavements. In: Reducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies. Draft. . Existing dark pavement can be altered to increase albedo through whitetopping or by adding reflective coats and seals. New pavement can be constructed to increase albedo by using modified mixes, permeable pavements, and vegetated pavements. Benefits * Reduction in energy usage. Energy usage is reduced as local temperatures are cooled. Lower temperatures allow air conditioners to cool buildings with less energy. Temperature reductions attributed to increased pavement albedo in Los Angeles resulted in over $90 million per year in savings. Reflective pavement also reduces energy at night as they demand lower street light usage. * Improvement in air quality. A reduction in energy usage would lower greenhouse emissions and air pollution (dependent on electric power fuel mix). Lower temperatures would also slow chemical reactions that create smog. In 2007, Surabi Menon and Hashem Akbari estimated that an increase of global pavement albedo of 35 to 39 percent could reduce carbon dioxide emissions worth about $400 billion. * Improvement in water quality. Permeable pavements reduce stormwater runoff by allowing water to soak into the pavement and soil. Permeable pavements can reduce runoff by up to 90 percent. Reducing runoff minimizes sewer overflows and stream scouring. Permeable pavements also act as a filter, removing dust, dirt, and pollutants from the water before it seeps into the Earth's groundwater. * Increased quality of life. Lower temperatures reduce heat- related illnesses and illnesses from the formation of smog. Permeable pavements can \\"enhance safety because better drainage reduces water spray from moving vehicles, increases traction, and may improve visibility by draining water that increases glare.\\"  Drawbacks  * Brightness. Cool pavement reflects much more light into the eyes of drivers, thus having the potential to temporarily blind them. * Considerable variation in unit price. Cool pavement costs vary as a result of numerous factors:  Geographical region  Local climate  Labor contractors  Time of year  Site accessibility  Underlying soils  Project size  Expected traffic  The desired life of the pavement * Greater cost than dark pavement.  According to the FHWA, the cost of porous pavement is approximately 10 to 15 percent higher than the cost of regular asphalt, and porous concrete is about 25 percent more expensive than regular concrete.

Model  The word RAM model is an abstract machine similar to a random access machine, but with additional capabilities. It works with words of size up to bits, meaning it can store integers up to size 2^w. Because the model assumes that the word size matches the problem size, that is, for a problem of size , w ge log n, the word RAM model is a transdichotomous model. The model allows bitwise operations such as arithmetic and logical shifts to be done in constant time. The number of possible values is , where U le 2^w.  Algorithms and data structures  In the word RAM model, integer sorting can be done fairly efficiently.

History  The club was first opened in 1913 by an American, Jack Mays, and an Englishman, Ernest A. Cordell. The club is known for its scantily-clad showgirls and its association with Christine Keeler and the 1960s Profumo affair. It was a members-only club providing food and drink for its wealthy patrons along with music, space to dance and other entertainment. The entertainments included demonstration dancing, tableaux and fashion parades. Bands such as the Versatile Four performed there. As well as following musical fashion trends, such as tango and jazz, the club also provided cabaret-style presentations. It was open into the early morning but also offered popular afternoon tea dances. It remained open during the First World War and continued to be popular in the interwar years, keeping up with trends to continue attracting a wealthy clientele. Its song and dance shows became more ambitious. Among the performers was Gertrude Lawrence in the chorus near the start of her career. In 1923 it was renovated and re-named Blanchard‚Äôs. In the late 1930s, Murray's Club was re-opened at a different location, 16 -18 Beak Street. In the 1950s Murray‚Äôs had a total staff of 130, including 65 showgirls and understudies. The club was run by Percival Murray, then later by his son David Murray. David Murray was a friend of Stephen Ward and spent weekends at Ward‚Äôs cottage at Cliveden, where showgirl Christine Keeler was introduced to John Profumo. David ran the club until 1967 when he fell out with his father over proposals to introduce a gambling floor. The club eventually closed in 1975. In 2018, Murray's was the subject of an exhibition mounted by the Museum of Soho in collaboration with poster dealer Charlie Jeffreys, and curator and historian Ben Levy. It featured costume designs by the illustrator Ronald Cobb along with a selection of club ephemera. The club location at 16‚Äì18 Beak Street is now a restaurant called \\"Byron\\".

It was demolished in 1976 to make way for Junction 39 of the new M4 motorway. The village was built in the 1830s, designed by the architect Edward Haycock. It included the octagonal Beulah Calvinistic Methodist Chapel (built in 1838) and later a school (built in 1860); the school was paid for by Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot, then owner of Margam Castle. Despite Port Talbot Council's deputy engineer proposing an alternative route for the M4 motorway, in 1974 it was confirmed the village would be destroyed. The village's 21 families were rehoused and the houses and school were demolished in 1976.

He is known for his studies of extinct marine invertebrates, especially the Brachiopoda and Ammonoidea of the Jurassic era ( Ma (million years ago)). Biography Buckman was the eldest son of James Buckman (1814-1884), Professor of Geology, Botany, and Zoology at the Royal Agricultural College 1848-1863, and his wife Julia (1834‚Äì1865). His first scientific paper (which related to Brachiopoda) was published in 1883, in the Proceedings of the Dorsetshire Natural History Field Club. He was a prolific author. He showed that ammonites could be used as index fossils to subdivide the Jurassic strata. His major work, A Monograph of the Ammonites of the \\"Inferior Oolite Series\\" (never really completed), was published in several volumes by the Palaeontographical Society 1887-1907. He described numerous genera and species of marine fossil. During his lifetime, he gained a reputation as a \\"splitter\\". His obituary in Nature says that through his studies he \\"was led to create a multitude of genera and species far beyond what had hitherto been deemed necessary\\". In 1897 he was awarded the Murchison Fund by the Geological Society. From 1897 to at least 1899, Sydney and his wife Maude were active in the early modern feminist movement, promoting practical clothing for women through organisations such as the Western Rational Dress Movement and Cycling for Women. Posthumous reputation His reputation as an over-zealous splitter seems to have been justified. As one example, a 1966 analysis of his observations on Sonninia (a genus of ammonite in family Sonniniidae) reduced 70 species down to two. His splitting has been called \\"extreme\\". He seems also to have argued on what was, according to the modern scientific consensus, the wrong side of the ontogeny vs. phylogeny debate. That reputation hindered recognition of his contributions to chronostratigraphy. In 1995, J. H. Callomon acknowledged their significance. In 1996, Peter Doyle wrote, \\"Buckman's orginal work involved a high degree of precision in collecting and measurement of stratigraphical sections which demonstrated the potential for the high-resolution scheme he later constructed. Although Buckman's later excesses cast doubt on the accuracy of this work, detailed observations have shown it to be broadly correct and of great importance in long-distance correlation with North America, for example. Clearly, the excesses of Buckman's later theorising have long held back an important contribution to detailed, high-resolution ammonite biostratigraphy\\". In 1997, H. S. Torrens re-assessed and vindicated Buckman's work.  Publications  Several of his many publications are available online through the University of Pennsylvania.

The Plaza has roots dating back to 1886 when Orange was one of the first towns to originate out of Southern California. It was here where the founders of Orange (A. B. Chapman and Andrew Glassell) designed the layout for the city of Orange. In the center of the plaza is a large round-a-bout with spokes coming off from the north, south, east and west. The two roads that intersect at The Plaza are Chapman Avenue, also Orange County Route S-18, from the east and west and Glassell Street from the north and south. The road names change slightly depending on the compass direction of each street. The east side is E. Chapman Ave. while the west spoke is considered W. Chapman Ave. Likewise, the north spoke is N. Glassell St. and the south spoke is S. Glassell St. The roundabout also features a park, which is the centerpiece of the Plaza as well as downtown Orange. This park is open to the public year- round, 24/7 and can feature a wide range of decorations during festivals. During the Christmas season, a large Christmas tree is set up as well as a nativity scene. The park also features a fountain, which replaced the original that was created in the late 1800s. The current fountain was erected on December 1, 1937, with the original moving to nearby Hart Park. The park also features a time capsule, set to open in 2073. Also in the park is a large flagpole, about 75 feet tall. The park is full of lush grass, which attracts locals for picnics on the weekends.

The marina is primarily for residential usage, containing a large array of boat docks, gardens, and a public observatory overlooking the city and waterfront. The marina's harbor discharges into the Niagara River and Lake Erie. Erie Basin Marina sits immediately south of the Black Rock Canal and the north of Buffalo's Inner Harbor and Naval Park area, where it is joined by a promenade walkway. It is protected by a long breakwall constructed and maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.it also looks like a Buffalo from your maps app.  History  Marina under construction, July 1973 Before the marina was constructed, it was the site of the Erie Basin, one of two connections from Buffalo's Outer Harbor to the Erie Canal in the 19th and early 20th- centuries. The excavation occurred between 1848 and 1852, then protected by a seawall of stones, wood and gravel. Its entrance was the site of Buffalo's first waterfront grain elevator constructed by Joseph Dart. Later on, railroad tracks for Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad were put in place in the same location, specifically for loading ships with coal ore. It was reported that in 1900, a steamer owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Columbia, was stolen by two tugboats from the basin on a June night. Constructed began in the 1950s and was completed by 1974, from slag of Bethlehem and Republic Steel. When viewed from above, Erie Basin Marina has the shape of a buffalo, an intentional design feature paying homage to the city's metonym. In recent years, contamination and sewage has become an issue for the harbor.

However, the growth of the mobile gaming market in the early 2010s led to several successive fiscal quarters where they were running at a loss. Nintendo, led by president Satoru Iwata at the time, developed a strategy for entering into the mobile games market with development partner DeNA, as a means of introducing their franchise properties to mobile players with a goal of bringing them to buy Nintendo's consoles later. Since 2015, Nintendo has internally developed a number of mobile games, while also publishing games with other developers, including games outside of the initial DeNA partnership. Several of them have been entered the top-downloaded games list on the iOS App Store and Google Play stores, earning over in revenue in total. History =Prior to 2015= Leading into the 2010s, Nintendo principally offered its home console, the Wii, and its portable console the Nintendo DS, along with several in-house games of their major franchises, such as Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda, a business method that had worked for the company for the previous 30 years. A distinguishing element of Nintendo's approach compared to other video game hardware computes was its unique take on hardware that allowed for novel gameplay elements, such as the motion-sensing Wii Remote and the dual-screen nature of the DS line. Nintendo is also unique in that their first-party games depend on their unique hardware, making a significant portion of their revenues tied to the success of these games. However, the 2010s also saw the growth of mobile gaming with wide adoption of smartphones and tablet computers. By 2012, the mobile gaming market was estimated to be worth , compared to the overall video game industry's net value of , and expected to be the largest driver of growth in the video game market over the next several years, according to research firm Newzoo. By 2016, mobile gaming accounted for of the global video game market. As mobile gaming grew, Nintendo was criticized for not taking risks in this area, prompted when the valuation of GungHo Online Entertainment, the publishers of the financially successful Puzzle & Dragons, exceeded that of Nintendo's in June 2013. These concerns were also compounded by lower-than-projected sales numbers for the successors of Nintendo's consoles, the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, which had caused Nintendo's stock price to drop. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal during E3 2013, Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata addressed the lure of developing for the mobile market, but had opted to not take Nintendo in that direction, focusing instead on providing compelling games that would drive their hardware sales, retaining their unique approach. Iwata said that while they could easily obtain short-term gains by addressing the mobile market, \\"20 years down the line, we may look back at the decision not to supply Nintendo games to smartphones and think that is the reason why the company is still here.\\" Previously, Iwata had asserted that \\"Nintendo would cease to be Nintendo\\" if they started development for mobile games. The company was also against simply making games from their core franchises available for mobile, with Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aim√© saying \\"When the consumer wants to play Mario, Zelda, and Pok√©mon, they have to purchase our hardware to do so. And that preserves our overall financial model.\\" The only exception that Nintendo had made for mobile gaming has been limited licensing of its properties, particularly the Pok√©mon property, via The Pok√©mon Company, to third-party developers who made games on a variety of platforms. Some of these titles were games developed for non-mobile devices and later brought to mobile, such as Pok√©mon TCG Online (initially released in 2011 for web browsers, and brought to mobile in 2014) and Pok√©mon Shuffle (initially released on Nintendo 3DS in early 2015, arriving on mobile later that year). Nintendo has licensed other properties, for example, the Chinese mobile game King of Glory (known as Arena of Valor in Western markets) has used Mario characters under license from Nintendo. The decision to stay out of the mobile gaming area, along with poor sales of the Wii U, lead Nintendo to undergo several underperforming quarters up through 2014. With Nintendo issuing a lowering of its financial forecast for its 2014 fiscal year, Iwata said \\"Given the expansion of smart devices, we are naturally studying how smart devices can be used to grow the game-player business,\\" but that \\"It's not as simple as enabling Mario to move on a smartphone.\\" In the fiscal report to investors that year, Iwata wrote \\"... I believe that the era has ended when people play all kinds of games only on dedicated gaming systems.\\" =2015‚Äìpresent= Following the end of the 2014 fiscal year, Iwata, Tatsumi Kimishima, Genyo Takeda, and Shigeru Miyamoto crafted a new strategy for Nintendo to bring them back into profitability, which included approaching the mobile market, creating new hardware, and \\"maximizing [their] intellectual property\\" The hardware direction resulted in the development of the Nintendo Switch, released in March 2017. While promoted as a home console, the Switch can operate in several modes similar to a handheld console and a tablet computer. For the mobile gaming area, Iwata initiated discussions with DeNA, a large Japanese mobile platform developer and provider. By March 2015, Nintendo and DeNA announced a partnership to jointly develop at least five mobile game titles, with one title planned to be released by the end of that year. Part of this deal including Nintendo acquiring 10% of DeNA's stock, while DeNA obtained about 1.24% of Nintendo's. Iwata said that Nintendo had found a way with DeNA to bring its franchises to mobile devices that took advantage of unique control methods offered by these devices. \\"We have come to the stage where we can say that we will be able to develop and operate software which, in the end, will not hurt the value of Nintendo IP but, rather, will become an opportunity for the great number of people around the world who own smart devices‚Äîbut do not have interest in dedicated video game hardware‚Äîto be interested in Nintendo IP and eventually to become fans of our dedicated game systems.\\" At the time of announcement, Nintendo had not committed to whether their mobile games would be free-to-play or require a single up-front cost, but Iwata did assure that they would stay to payment schemes that parents would be comfortable with for letting their children play. Iwata also said that Nintendo would be able to avoid issues that other mobile developers had, where their success usually rested on one key game; Nintendo instead can take advantage of several of their franchises and develop a range of games. Iwata died from health complications in July 2015, and Kimishima was named Nintendo's new president. Kimishima continued to have Nintendo follow the mobile approach that Iwata had set forward, considering it a core pillar of Nintendo's strategy. In statements to investors made in November 2017, Kimishima acknowledged Nintendo was still adapting to mobile, pointing to missed expectations with Super Mario Run, stating: > Nintendo has a large stock of valuable IP characters and has developed many > games. We cannot, however, simply port our existing games and IP to smart- > device applications. A lot of thought is going into what kind of games for > smart devices will further our business and how we can continue to foster > good relationships with our existing dedicated video game platform business. > Among the various ideas, a primary concern is enabling our consumers to play > on not only smart devices, but also our dedicated video game systems. We > want to build up the smart-device business as a core pillar of Nintendo ºs > various businesses, but we have not yet reached that level. Nintendo is not > at a stage where we can consider becoming a smart-device platform developer. Near the end of calendar year 2017, Nintendo was reportedly in talks with additional mobile platform providers including GungHo to expand their mobile game offerings, as well as extending their current DeNA deal, according to The Wall Street Journal. Upon announcement of the jointly developed and operated title Dragalia Lost in April 2018, Nintendo also announced it had acquired about a 5% stake in Japanese mobile game developer Cygames. Around the same time, Kimishima announced he was stepping down as Nintendo's president, to be replaced by Shuntaro Furukawa. Furukawa stated that he plans to continue Nintendo's drive into mobile games towards being a revenue source for the company, and try to create more games that were as successful as Pok√©mon Go. In June 2020, an article from Bloomberg stated that Nintendo was unlikely to further pursue major efforts on the mobile market. While they still would publish and develop games for it and maintain the current ones already available, they would focus less on the mobile market as the success of the Nintendo Switch console would make them to be able to do that. Nintendo joined the mobile market due to the failure of the Wii U and pressure from investors but now the company could sustain itself from the already released games between the successful ones on mobile, and also on Switch.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-21/nintendo-chills- mobile-ambitions-after-animal-crossing-success In its 80th shareholder meeting in June 2020, president and CEO Furukawa answered a question in the Q&A; about the mobile business and confirmed that while the company don't have any new title to announce as right now, and while mobile still is a secondary market and don't make as much money as console for the company, the business still remains important to the company for different reasons outside of revenue including exposure of the brand of Nintendo, its franchises and the establishment of Nintendo accounts into customers.https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/nintendos_mobile_business_is_here_to_stay Games Nintendo, through either its internal development division such as Entertainment Planning & Development division (EPD), or its closely affiliated studios such as Intelligent Systems, have developed at least five mobile apps in partnership with DeNA with Miitomo, Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp and Mario Kart Tour. The other games otherwise are outside of that partnership. = Miitomo (2016) = Miitomo was the first mobile app developed through the Nintendo/DeNA partnership, released in March 2016. It is a social networking game, having players interact with their virtual Mii avatars and those of others through the My Nintendo service. The game used a freemium structure, allowing players to use real-world money to purchase in-game currency (which could also be earned through other in-game actions) that can be then used to buy customization options for the player's Mii within the game. Miitomo attracted more than 10 million downloads within a month of its release, though interest waned in the following months. Nintendo ended support for the app in May 2018. = Super Mario Run (2016) = Super Mario Run was first released in December 2016 for iOS, and a few months later for Android. The game is a type of auto runner, where the player guides Mario and other characters through a course to collect coins, only requiring the player to control the timing and length of Mario's jump. Unlike most mobile games, Nintendo released Super Mario Run as a single-purchase title for , though offering a free limited demo to allow players to try the game. Nintendo had planned on profiting on the sale of conversions from the demo into the full game. While the game was downloaded more than 200 million times, topping app store charts, Nintendo affirmed that they had not reached a 10% target conversion rate worldwide, but were still exploring this approach for future titles. Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated that Super Mario Run had about $56 million in revenue in its first year. = Fire Emblem Heroes (2017) = Fire Emblem Heroes was first released in February 2017, developed primarily by Intelligent Systems. It uses the same tactical role-playing game elements from the Fire Emblem series, in which players control a party of heroes to battle foes. Unlike Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes used a more traditional free- to-play model; players could play as many missions as they could while their party still had stamina, which otherwise refreshes by waiting some amount of time or by using in-game purchases to restore stamina and heal the party. In- app purchases could also be used to purchase new heroes for the player's party. While the game was only downloaded 10 million times by April 2017, it had made , about 10 times more reported for Super Mario Run. Within its first year, it had brought in nearly in revenue according to Sensor Tower. = Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp (2017) = Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was released in October 2017.

The game was initially released on July 9, 2019, in 59 territories, and follows the approach set by Candy Crush Saga. As with Dr. Mario, players attempts to clear colored viruses on a stage by matching 2-colored capsules in a match-3 style game. Rather than an open-ended game, Dr. Mario World follows the approach for mobile games set by Candy Crush Saga, with each level designed with a fixed number and location of viruses and blocks, and the player required to complete the level with a limited number of capsules. Monetization is also similar to Candy Crush Saga - the player earns coins in-game and can spend real-world money on diamonds, both which then can be used to purchase special power-ups, or new doctor characters such as Dr. Peach, Dr. Yoshi, and Dr. Toad each with their own unique skill. = Mario Kart Tour (2019) = In January 2018, Nintendo announced a mobile version of the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart Tour, for iOS and Android devices.

In 2017, Rob Fahey of GamesIndustry.biz stated that the commercial success of Nintendo's mobile games were not as great as they could be, believing that while Fire Emblem Heroes had made the transition to mobile well, Nintendo was still struggling with how to take its IP into a mobile format that would entice people to play. He noted that while Super Mario Run approach to monetization was counter to most mobile titles, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was more of a standard free-to-play game, but lacked significant attention since its gameplay format was atypical for mobile devices. By January 2020, Sensor Tower estimated that the total revenue from all of Nintendo's mobile games had reached , with the most having come from Fire Emblem Heroes with .

There is evidence that he may have traveled to Roman Egypt: in the 14th century was seen the first six lines of a poem inscribed on one of the Pyramids of Giza, addressed to \\"a most sweet brother\\" named \\"Decimus Gentianus\\". Hermann Dessau, and others after him, identify that person with this Gentianus, although Dessau may be wrong in further identifying the author of the poem as his sister.See Dessau's notes at ILS 1046a Gentianus' cursus honorum is known in frustratingly incomplete detail from a fragmentary inscription in Sarmizegetusa. Prior to acceding to the consulate, Gentianus held the usual posts of military tribune, quaestor, plebeian tribune, praetor, then governor of an imperial province; however, the portions of the inscription which identifies which legion he was tribune of and the name of the province he governed are both missing. However the inscription from Sarmizegetusa attests Gentianus was admitted to the College of Pontiffs. He also supervised the census of the public province of Macedonia. More information is available about his death. According to the Historia Augusta, during the reign of Hadrian, Gentianus had become highly esteemed by his fellow Senators. In spite of this, or because of it, towards the end of his reign Hadrian came to dislike him, although the emperor had considered making Gentianus his successor.

In August 2018, Yanjaa broke a third world record at the Korean Memory Championships 2018 by memorizing 145 random words in 5 minutes. Yanjaa and Mongolian teammate Munkhshur Narmandakh became the first women in history to place at the world event, placing in bronze and silver position respectively out of over 130 contestants.  Early life and education  Yanjaa was born in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to a Buryat-Mongolian mother and a Khalkha-Mongolian father. She grew up in Mongolia, Stockholm, Tokyo and attended boarding school in Kenya at the Swedish School of Nairobi where she studied Swahili and philosophy. Yanjaa graduated from Stockholm Business School with a degree in Business and Economics, where she was an active member of the student council marketing team. She also attended the University of Uppsala to study art history during this time.  Career  Yanjaa was originally inspired to compete in memory after reading Moonwalking with Einstein by American author and former US memory champion Joshua Foer. She entered her first memory competition two months after reading it, receiving the newcomer award and placing first in the discipline names and faces at a German Open Memory competition in Munich, Germany. She has since medalled in a number of competitions as well as broken numerous memory records (see Records). In 2015 Yanjaa was invited as one of the top 200 Leaders of Tomorrow at the 46th St. Gallen Symposium in St. Gallen, Switzerland for her achievements in memory sports at a young age. In 2015 Yanjaa starred in the Swedish documentary Masterminds, following the moments leading up to the Swedish Memory Championships 2014 where she placed second overall. Yanjaa was featured in the 2016 documentary How to Remember Everything, which covered the 2014 World Memory Championships in Haikou, China. Yanjaa was invited to speak at Investor AB's 100th anniversary, where she demonstrated recall of 10 of the 100 names and faces she had to memorize. She has also been interviewed and featured for memory training and language learning on Today, The Guardian, Wired as well as numerous national media publications in Sweden, China and Mongolia. Yanjaa was a contestant on the final season of the Chinese television program The Brain in 2017, defeating her opponent Yu Yipei by memorizing more synthesized images winning on accuracy over speed. She was a contestant on the 2017 comeback season of the talent show Talang, the Swedish version of Got Talent. In the audition round, Yanjaa received the golden buzzer from judge Alexander Bard and immediately advanced to the semifinals by memorizing twenty names and faces in 90 seconds. After a successful semi-finals round in which she memorized 30 digits in 30 seconds, she advanced to the finals where she ended up in fifth place. In September 2017 Yanjaa was featured as the \\"IKEA Human Catalogue 2018\\", having memorized the entire catalogue in just a week before the launch of the new catalogue. The campaign was a success landing press conferences in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore and multiple appearances on the Steve Harvey show and other talk shows. In May 2018, the campaign was voted as people's voice and the official jury's Webby award for best social media ad campaign. In 2017, she began production for a documentary called Memory Games with Emmy Award- winning director Janet Tobias. The documentary premiered in New York in November 2018. An additional screening was scheduled because the premiere sold out. Memory Games was bought by Netflix and launched on June 19th, 2019. Yanjaa was featured in her second Netflix project on September 11, 2019. The Mind, Explained is a limited series narrated by Emma Stone in collaboration with Vox Media.

It consists of an iron head piece and face mask, the latter of which is covered in a sheet of silver and presents the individualised portrait of a face, likely its owner. Decorations, some of which are gilded, adorn the head piece. Confiscated by Syrian police soon after looters discovered it amidst a complex of tombs in the modern-day city of Homs in 1936, eventually the helmet was restored thoroughly at the British Museum, and is now in the collection of the National Museum of Damascus. It has been exhibited internationally, although as of 2017, due to the Syrian Civil War, the more valuable items owned by the National Museum are hidden in underground storage. Ornately designed yet highly functional, the helmet was probably intended for both parades and battle. Its delicate covering is too fragile to have been put to use during cavalry tournaments, but the thick iron core would have defended against blows and arrows. Narrow slits for the eyes, with three small holes underneath to allow downward sight, sacrificed vision for protection; roughly cut notches below each eye suggest a hastily made modification of necessity. The helmet was found in a tomb near a monument to a former ruler of Emesa and, considering the lavishness of the silver and gold design, likely belonged to a member of the elite. As it is modelled after those helmets used in Roman tournaments, even if unlikely to have ever been worn in one, it may have been given by a Roman official to a Syrian general or, more likely, manufactured in Syria after the Roman style. The acanthus scroll ornamentation seen on the neck guard recalls that used on Syrian temples, suggesting that the helmet may have been made in the luxury workshops of Antioch. Description The neck guard of the Emesa helmet The Emesa helmet is made of iron and consists of two parts: a head piece and a face mask. The head piece, which includes a neck guard, is made of one piece of iron and attached decorations. Attached to it are silver decorations, some of which are gilded in whole or in part: a diadem, a circular forehead rosette, a strip of metal serving as a crest, two ear guards, and a decorative plate over the neck guard. The ear guards are each attached by three rivets, the top and bottom of which help hold the diadem and decorative plate, respectively, to the head piece; the edges of the diadem and plate are folded over the iron core for additional support. The face mask hangs from the head piece by a central hinge, and would be fastened with straps connecting a loop under each ear with corresponding holes in the neck guard. The entire helmet, the iron core of which is between 1 and 6 millimetres thick, weighs , of which the face mask comprises . The head piece is made of iron, now rusted. The top contains a dent, and shows the rusted impression of what once was a woven and likely colourful or patterned fabric. From ear to ear around the forehead runs a gilded diadem in the image of a laurel wreath, a traditional symbol of victory. Each side contains thirteen elements, each of three leaves and two berries. The leaves are worked in repouss√©, and stand out in strong relief with nearly straight walls. Above the centre of the diadem is a rosette; it shows a flower with two rows, each of six petals, and an outer beaded border. The beading and the outer row of petals are in white silver, contrasting with the gilding of the inner row, the background, and the central rivet anchoring the rosette to the head piece. A narrow fluted strip serving as a crest, smooth silver with beaded edges, runs down the middle of the head piece from the rosette to the neck guard. The relative simplicity and inferiority of artisanship expressed by the crest and rosette may reflect repairs made locally, away from the luxury workshops of Antioch; unlike with the diadem, for example, the background of the rosette was not carefully punched down, but was flattened with a tubular instrument and now presents as a series of rings. funerary mask from tomb 1 The neck guard, flared outward to protect the shoulders, is covered with a decorative plate consisting of three horizontal designs. At the top, over the base of the skull, a large torus of ivy leaves is bordered by cords; the ivy is gilded, though the cords are not. In the middle, a smooth and concave transitional zone corresponds to the hollow of the neck. At the bottom, an acanthus rinceau, or scroll, is interspersed with birds and butterflies. Portions of the bottom ornamentation are gilded, giving the helmet, with all its silver, gold, and iron components, a polychrome appearance. The ear guards encroach slightly on the bottom design, suggesting that it was not created specifically for the helmet. The face mask is made of iron, and covered with a sheet of silver. The central hinge from which it hangs is made of three parts: an iron tube welded to the interior head piece with an exterior silver tube, a notched silver tube fixed to the face mask that envelops the first part, and a pin which passes through both and has a silver knob at each end. The mask is shaped in the form of a human face. Holes are drilled between the lips and as nostrils; the eyes each have a narrow slit, with three holes in a trefoil design, two round holes outside and a heart-shaped hole in the middle, underneath each eye to allow for a greater range of vision. These apparently were not enough, for a small and rudimentary notch was carved into each of the heart-shaped holes to increase the wearer's vision. The mask is approximately 2 millimetres thick, of which the silver, which is folded around both the edges and each hole to hold it to the iron, accounts for between .25 and .5 millimetres. Distinctive features cover the face mask. The nose is long and fleshy with a prominent bump, and extends high between the eyes. The cheekbones are low yet prominent, and the small mouth, which droops toward the sinister side, shows a thick lower lip. Other features‚Äîthe eyes and eyebrows, and the chin‚Äîare more conventional. The distinctive features suggest that the maker of the Emesa helmet attempted to translate some of the individual characteristics of the wearer's face into the helmet. Function The Emesa helmet is highly functional, and was likely made for both parades and battle. It is thick and heavy, which would have offered protection against heavy blows or arrows, the former of which may have caused the dent on the head piece. Exceptionally narrow eye-slits also indicate care taken to increase protection; the rough manner in which the holes underneath were enlarged is likely the consequence of an emergency requiring a better field of vision. Although classified as a cavalry sports helmet, the type worn in equestrian displays and tournaments known as the hippika gymnasia, it was unlikely to have been used in such events. Tournament helmets were robust and manufactured without finesse, to withstand the rigours of contest unscathed. The delicate ornamentation of the Emesa helmet, by contrast, would have been damaged easily, and thus suggests that it would have only been subjected to such risks in the exceptional circumstance of battle. Discovery One of six Medusa ornaments from tomb 1's sarcophagus The helmet was discovered by looters in August 1936, in the modern-day city of Homs. Known as Emesa at the start of the first century AD, the city was at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, and ruled by the Emesene dynasty, a client kingdom of the Romans. Nearly 2,000 years later, the looters‚Äîdigging near the former site of a monument to Sampsiceramus‚Äîfound a complex of rich tombs, and removed the grave goods. Their looting was uncovered because small golden plaques, adorning the burial shroud of the body in tomb 11, flaked off when disturbed. The next morning, children noticed these gold flakes mixed in with the earth and brought them to a bazaar, where it came to the attention of the police; it ultimately led to the arrest of the looters, and the confiscation of the grave objects. The objects, including the helmet, were then secured for the state collection by Emir Djaafar Abd el-Kader, curator of the National Museum of Damascus‚Äîeven as merchants, eager to capitalise on the stories, hawked modern forgeries and unrelated ancient objects said to come from the tombs of Emesa. The prompt intervention of el-Kader, who investigated the finds and interrogated the looters, allowed the finds to be recovered and well-understood. He also led further excavations, as did the French archaeologists Daniel Schlumberger and Henri Seyrig. The tomb in which the helmet was found‚Äîlabelled tomb number 1, of the 22 in the complex‚Äîwas a pitted grave with two chambers, one upper and one lower. The lower chamber, constituting the proper tomb, had soil for a floor and rock for walls; it measured , and was high. Between five and seven eroded basalt beams were placed over the opening connecting the lower chamber with the upper, which was then backfilled to surface level. Tomb 1 included a rich assortment of objects. As well as the helmet, it contained a gold funerary mask; a gold and turquoise bracelet; an ornate gold ring with a royal bust in relief; a gold ring with carnelian intaglio; a gold appliqu√© with a sheep's head and a bird's head; a star-shaped fibula; a gold hook; a small tongue of gold; a spearhead decorated with gold; a silver vase; and a triangle of glass. The looters may have been incorrect in also attributing 19 gold plaques to the tomb, as these were seemingly identical to those from tomb 11. Decorations from the sarcophagus included fragmentary silver rings; 22 gold leaves in repouss√©; six masks of Medusa; four rectangles adorned with a lion; four Victories; and eight busts of Apollo. According to Mohammed Moghrabi, who looted tomb 1, the helmet was found next to the skull. =Restoration= 30 April 1955 front cover of The Illustrated London News, issued shortly after the helmet's restoration After its discovery, the Emesa helmet underwent several unsuccessful restorations. The primary problem was the oxidisation of the iron core, which created blisters and cracks in the silver covering. Immediately after discovery, the helmet was sent to Paris for restoration by \\"MM. Andr√© p√®re et fils\\"; only light work was carried out due to the hope that the Syrian climate would help slow the rate of oxidisation, and due to limited funds, but the helmet continued to deteriorate. By 1952, the helmet was described as being significantly more damaged than it had been when excavated, and in urgent need of further work. Eventually it was taken to the British Museum, where a final restoration was finished in 1955. This was done by Herbert Maryon, who in 1946 had reconstructed the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo helmet. In 1956, an account of the process was published by Harold Plenderleith, keeper of the museum's research laboratory. Examination found the silver to be brittle, with cracks that had been filled in by a dark stopping substance. The iron behind the face mask had rusted, putting further stress on the silver and forcing the cracks open by as much as . The face mask‚Äîheld on by wire, as the hinge had detached‚Äîwas therefore removed from the helmet to be worked on. The rusted iron was cut out from the back of the face mask around the mouth and jaw, where the distortions were greatest. To strengthen the silver enough that it could be manipulated, the mask was placed in an electric furnace, and the temperature raised to over three hours; blackened rust was then removed by brushing the mask with 9% oxalic acid, before heating it again, at for eighteen hours and at for thirteen. The silver was then cleaned again, on both sides, with silver gauze temporarily soldered over the cracks in the back to allow the front to be wiped down. The gauze was removed, the silver manipulated to close the cracks, and new gauze installed, permanently, using soft solder. Thin lines of solder showing through the closed cracks were concealed with a surface coating of applied silver. Finally, the iron that had been removed to expose the back of the silver was cleaned and placed back in position. Although a few cracks remained visible higher up on the face mask, they were closed, as the iron behind them was sound and not exerting pressure, yet would have to be removed for restoration to occur. =Display= Nijmegen helmet is also classified as a cavalry sports helmet. After restoration at the British Museum, the helmet was displayed in the museum's King Edward Gallery as a month-long loan from 25 April 1955, then returned to Damascus. From 1999 to 2002 the helmet was part of a travelling exhibition, Syria: Land of Civilizations, with stops in Switzerland, Canada, and the United States. In 2017 the National Museum reopened after closing during the Syrian Civil War, but with the more valuable objects still hidden in underground storage. Typology The helmet is dated to the first half of the first century AD, based on the style of the acanthus scroll on the back of the helmet, and other objects found with the helmet and in the tombs nearby. It is the earliest known Roman helmet with a face mask, and is broadly classified as a cavalry sports helmet‚Äîtype D, according to the typology put forward by H. Russell Robinson. Type D helmets are characterised by a single horizontal hinge attaching the face mask to the head piece, and by head pieces that are decorated to represent helmets. Several type D examples exist, such as the Nijmegen helmet, but unlike these, the Emesa helmet was probably never intended for sporting use. It may instead have been given as a gift by a Roman official to a general of the ruling family of Emesa, or manufactured in Syria to the likeness of helmets seen during Roman tournaments. The latter circumstance is thought more likely, for the acanthus ornamentation resembles that seen on Syrian temples. The helmet may therefore have been commissioned from the workshops of Antioch, known for their luxury.

The old pilings present challenging problems during restoration as they age and are destroyed by organisms and decay. Replacing the foundation entirely is possible but expensive. Regularly inspecting and maintaining timber piles may extend the life of the foundation.  Historic use and treatment in water  Timber pile construction in the aquatic and marine environment has a long history in Europe dating as far back as the bronze and stone age in Switzerland. = Swiss lake dwellers = During severe droughts in Switzerland in the mid-nineteenth century, lake areas that had been previously inundated with water, were exposed to reveal ancient archaeological remains of various types of timber piling support assemblies that served has foundations for both individual houses and community buildings. The design of these timber assemblies varied by the time of occupation, whether during the bronze or stone age, and also by geological conditions where the timbers rested. The communities were called the Swiss Lake Dwellers and were located in various fresh water lakes around Zurich and other areas in Switzerland. During the archaeological excavations, many of the piles dissolved after being in contact with air. = Early building piling foundations in Venice, Italy = In Venice, some of the early piling foundations were built on timber piles. The early Venetian constructors used building techniques that included using impermeable stone supported by wooden rafts and timber piles. The timber piles did not rot because they were set into the mud at the bottom of the lagoon which prevented oxygen and harmful microbes from reaching them.  Historic treatment and preservation in marine waters  = Treatment methods used prior to 18th century = Over 2,000 years ago, wood builders were aware of marine borers and decay and protected wood using crude extracts and various chemicals. Further study on how to address marine borer activity and decay accelerated in the 18th century. = Treatment methods revived in 18th & 19th centuries = In the 18th and 19th centuries the study of wood preservation was revived due to the deterioration of the timber pile dikes that protected Holland as well as the high level of decay and marine borer activity in English Navy ships. The early dikes in Holland were supported by timber piles. Creosote derived from coal processing, was discovered in the mid-18th century to prevent timber pile decay. The development of Creosote pressure treatment by John Bethel was also an important advancement in timber piling construction. Historic buildings supported by timber piles may either be either treated with Creosote or Chromated Copper Arsenate.  Types of wood used  Douglas-Fir timber piles are used most often in the Pacific Northwest while Southern Pine are used most commonly on the East Coast. Douglas-Fir is used most commonly used on the west coast due to its high strength, renewability and low cost.  Piling deterioration problems  = Marine borers = There are three groups of marine borers in West Coast waters including gribbles, shipworms, and pholads, and each differs in the type of damage it causes.  Gribbles  A Gribble (Limnoria) is a destructive crustacean that burrows into the wood surfaces. Unlike other marine borers, gribbles travel easily from timber to timber using the wood for food and shelter. Gribbles burrow to a shallow depth but can still reduce pile diameter by one inch per year; a gribble infested pile typically has an hour-glass shape at the tide line.  Shipworms  Teredolites 012416 Shipworms (Teredolite) are wood-boring bivalves that burrow deeply into submerged wood. Although piles attacked by shipworms may appear sound on the surface, they may be completely riddled with a maze of tunnels. Shipworms can spread to new wood only when they are in the free-swimming larval stage. Once they attack and bore into the wood, they become imprisoned within it. Ancient mariners, realizing that shipworms were imprisoned in the wood of their ships, would sail far up river and remain in fresh water for a number of months to kill the shipworms. Experienced divers look for siphons that project from the wood or use sonic devices to estimate the extent of internal damage. Shipworm and gribble attacks can also be detected by immersing untreated wood panels and destructively sampling them at monthly intervals.  Pholads  Pholads, rock-burrowing clams, burrow into and damage untreated wood in warmer waters near Hawaii and Mexico and along Oregon beaches boring only into the surface of the wood. Ensuring that the shell of the wood is undamaged will keep this Pholad borer at bay. = Insects = Wood above the waterline may be attacked by a number of insects, including termites, carpenter ants, and beetles. One beetle, the wharf borer (Nacedes melanura), can attack untreated or damaged treated hardwoods and conifers with high moisture contents by tunneling extensively and leaving behind dark brown fecal matter that further degrades the wood. = Wood decay = Wood decay describes wood in all stages of fungal attack, from the initial invasion of hyphae into the cell walls to the complete destruction of the wood. Wood-inhabiting fungi are most common on timber piles above the water surface since the lack of oxygen below water inhibits fungal growth.  Methods of detecting decay  Incipient decay may develop in untreated pile tops within 1 year and reach the visible, advanced stage, termed rot, within 2 to 4 years and can extend 4 feet or more from the internally rotting areas of a Douglas-fir pile. A triangular blade scraper, a sharp shovel, or a dull probe are useful when inspecting piles for surface deterioration or marine borer attack because they allow the inspector to estimate the depth of deterioration. Because untreated wood can often be exposed while these tools are being used, a preservative solution or paste should be applied to exposed areas. = Cracks = Cracks that have developed after the wood has been treated are highly susceptible to borers, insects and decay in the right conditions. Cracks need to be evaluated during an initial pile inspection to ascertain depth, location and treatment condition.  Decay treatment options  = Liquid preservatives = Apply a liquid preservative to cutoff tops of piles and timbers by flooding them with hot creosote (150 to 200 ¬∞F), pentachlorophenol in diesel oil, or copper naphthenate in mineral spirits. = Solid Preservatives = A solid preservative, such as Fluor- Chrome-Arsenic-Phenol (FCAP), can be applied dry or as a paste where hawsers rip off caps and expose wood to moisture and decay organisms.  Borer attack treatment options  = Creosote, CCA, and ACA = Creosote effectively prevents attack by marine borers in coastal waters north of San Francisco and inorganic salts [Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) or Ammoniacal Copper Arsenate (ACA) are recommended south of San Francisco because of the likelihood of attack by the wood borer that is predominantly located in warmer waters. = Barriers and plastic wraps = Impermeable barriers can protect preservative- treated wood piles under the waterline from marine borer attack by inhibiting the entry of borers into the wood and creating anaerobic conditions that kill established borers by limiting the available oxygen. = Wood and concrete reinforcement = A heavily damaged piling structure can be reinforced by cutting out the damaged section and replacing it with preservative-treated wood. Wrapping piles with plastic barriers can provide protection from marine borers for 25 years or more. Pile reinforcement with concrete can be sufficient by filling the void with coarse stone and mortar. Where damage is more severe, forms made of metal, wood, concrete, woven nylon, or pitch- impregnated fiber are attached to the pile as far down as 2 feet below the mudline.  Required maintenance & inspection  = Inspection interval = In order to effectively preserve and maintain timber piles, regular inspection is required to detect deteriorating structures before replacement is necessary. Pile inspections should take place every five years.  Inspect pilings removed from service  One of the best ways to ascertain the cause of deterioration as well as what stage the deterioration is in, is to inspect a piling that has been removed from service. The loss of one piling used for inspection might save the remaining timber pilings and members from being replaced. In order to diagnose the problems, cut the timbers into short sections and longitudinally split each section in order to see how far the preservative has penetrated. Reuse of any treated timber pile supplied by an outside source is not recommended. Not knowing the applied treatment, past use, or if diesel fuels have been applied to the surface used to give the appearance of a recent retreatment could decrease the life of the pile. Some unscrupulous suppliers of used timber piles should be avoided, because some contractors have applied diesel fuel to the outside of the piles to bring the embedded creosote to the surface.

The brigade is headquartered at Frankenberg, Saxony. The history of the brigade began in 1990 with the dissolution of the GDR's National People's Army. In 1991, the brigade was established from the 7th Panzer Division of the NVA as Homeland Security Brigade 37. In 1993, the training of the first conscripts began. In 1995, the brigade was renamed Panzergrenadier Brigade 37, and relocated from Dresden to Frankenberg/Saxony, before it was renamed 1996 as J√§gerbrigade 37. The brigade consisted at that time of a paratrooper battalion, a mountain light infantry battalion, and a Panzergrenadierbataillon. In 1997, the brigade assisted with the Oder flood. When the 39th Panzer Brigade (Bundeswehr) \\"Th√ºringen\\" was dissolved in 2001, the brigade took over the 391st Panzer Grenadier Battalion and the 39th Tank Battalion. The brigade transferred the 373th Parachute Battalion to the 31st Airborne Brigade. In 2001-2002 the brigade provided the bulk of the 4th German contingent to SFOR in Bosnia; 2003, the Panzerpionierkompanie 370 was disestablished in Doberlug-Kirchhain. In 2004-2005 the brigade provided forces for the 6th German ISAF task force and the 2nd rotation for the German \\"PRT Kunduz\\" in Afghanistan. In 2005, the dissolution of Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion 375 took place. In 2006, the brigade provided forces for the 11th German ISAF rotation and took over Logistics Battalion 131 in Bad Frankenhausen. On January 25, 2007, the Panzerpionierkompanie 390 was disbanded at Bad Salzungen. The brigade again became a panzergrenadier formation on 1 April 2007. In addition, Repair Battalion 131 became Logistics Battalion 131 and Pioneer Battalion 701 the Panzerpionierbataillon 701. In addition, the Panzeraufkl√§rungsbataillon 13 was reclassified to the Aufkl√§rungsbataillon 13. The J√§gerbataillon 371 was reclassified in July 2007 as Panzer Grenadier Battalion 371. In 2008, Mountain Battalion 571 dissolved. The brigade is now part of the 10th Panzer Division (Bundeswehr).

Reyna (born 1955) is a psychologist and Professor of Human Development at Cornell University and an expert on false memory and risky decision making. In collaboration with her husband Charles Brainerd, Reyna developed fuzzy-trace theory, a dual-process model of mental representations underlying memory, judgement, and decision making. According to fuzzy-trace theory, there are two independent types of memory traces: a verbatim trace that records the exact details and a gist trace that extracts general features. Brainerd and Reyna used fuzzy-trace theory to provide a comprehensive account of the phenomenon of false memory, where individuals recall events or details of events that did not happen; their work on this topic and that of others is summarized in their co-authored volume The Science of False Memory. Reyna and other colleagues have co-edited books on risky decision making and adolescent cognition including The Neuroscience of Risky Decision Making, The Adolescent Brain: Learning, Reasoning, and Decision Making, and Neuroeconomics, Judgment, and Decision Making. Reyna is a Fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, and Charter Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and Member of the National Academy of Sciences. She served as President of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making and on the Governing Board of the Psychonomic Society. Reyna received the SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities in 2012 and the Hispanic Professional Action Committee Woman of the Year Award in 2001.

Subsequently, Reyna joined the faculty of the University of Arizona and was promoted to Professor in 2000 while affiliated with the Departments of Surgery, Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Mexican-American Studies, and Women's Studies. Reyna moved to the University of Texas at Arlington in 2003 as Professor of Psychology. Professor of Human Development at Cornell University since 2005, she is the director of the Human Neuroscience Institute, the co-director of the Center for Behavioral Economics and Decision Research and the co-director for the Cornell University Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility at Cornell.  Research  Reyna's research program adopts a cognitive neuroscience perspective on topics pertaining to judgement, decision making, and memory over the life span. In collaborative work with Brainerd, Reyna focused on how emotions can distort memories, especially for events that have negative emotions associated with them. To account for why people often remember things that never happened (i.e., experience false memory or memory illusions), fuzzy-trace theory proposes that verbatim and gist memories are stored separately and activated in parallel. Verbatim memory stores a detailed representation of the event at the same time as gist memory captures its general features. After a couple of days, the representation stored in verbatim memory is typically lost, while the gist remains accessible and can be further interpreted. Reyna and Brainerd have suggested adults make connections and rely on their gist memory to a greater extent than children, making them more susceptible to false memories under some circumstances (e.g., in experiments using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm). Their research findings challenge the widely held view that susceptibility to memory distortion declines from childhood into adulthood, and have implications for research on the reliability of eyewitness testimony. In applications of fuzzy- trace theory to risky decision making, Reyna and her colleagues distinguish \\"rational\\" decision-making, involving deliberate analysis of trade offs between risks and benefits, and nondeliberative reactions, in which the gist of the situation cues action. As youth develop into adolescents and young adults, they are increasingly likely to rely on intuitive gist-based responding, and less likely to engage in rational consideration of risks. Rayna disagrees with the view that adolescents underestimate risks and have a sense of invulnerability. Rather, it is their tendency to respond intuitively to contextual cues and their motivation to maximize immediate pleasure that leads adolescents to engage in risky behaviors involving sexual activity, reckless driving, smoking, drug and alcohol use, and the like.

Background and education Rassam is the son of actress Carole Bouquet and film producer Jean-Pierre Rassam. He has one half-brother, Louis, born in 1987 to his mother's relationship with the photographer Francis Giacobetti. Rassam was four years old when his father died from a drug overdose. Rassam finished secondary school at √âcole Active Bilingue with a Bac scientifique, then prepped at Sciences Po. He began work on a business degree at HEC Paris, but changed course to earn a degree in history (from the Sorbonne) instead. Career At the age of 23, Rassam founded the production company \\"Chapter 2\\". His first credit as producer was the film Judas, directed by Nicolas Bury and J√©r√¥me Fansten in 2006. In 2014, \\"Chapter 2\\" merged with Alexis Vonarb's Onyx Films and Aton Soumache's Method Animation to form \\"ON Entertainment\\". Method Animation is the parent company, with Soumache as CEO and Mediawan, which founded by Xavier Niel, Matthieu Pigasse, and Pierre-Antoine Capton as ultimate owner since 2018. Rassam has worked with various directors of animation films, including Mark Osborne, director of Kung Fu Panda and The Little Prince. Filmography Rassam is credited as producer of the following films: * Our Lady of the Nile (due out in 2020) * Playmobil: The Movie (2019) * Le Brio (2017) * Daddy or Mommy (2015) (original French title: \\"Papa ou Maman\\") * The Little Prince (2015) - for this film, Rassam, Aton Soumache, Alexis Vonarb, and Mark Osborne received the 2016 C√©sar Award for Best Animated Film. * Escobar: Paradise Lost (2014) * The Scapegoat (original French title, Au bonheur des ogres) (2013) * What's in a Name?

His daughter, Darya, was born in 2011. At the end of 2016, he separated from Novoselova and, reportedly, began to date Charlotte Casiraghi, the daughter of Caroline, Princess of Hanover, and niece of Albert II, Prince of Monaco. In March 2018 Rassam and Casiraghi were reported to be engaged, with plans to marry in the summer; however, that did not happen. Their son, Balthazar, was born on 23 October 2018. On 7 April 2019, Paris Match ran the headline (in French) \\"Charlotte et Dimitri: Mariage en Juin\\", combining a report on Monaco's Rose Ball, where Rassam's mother, Carole Bouquet, was guest of honor, placed in the seating beside Prince Albert II, with the news that the couple were planning a summer wedding. The same report revealed that Rassam divides residency between Paris and Los Angeles. Rassam and Casiraghi were wed at the Prince's Palace of Monaco on 1 June 2019. On 29 June 2019 they married religiously at Sainte-Marie de Pierredon Abbey, Saint- R√©my-de-Provence.

It was built by the Intercolonial Railway in the North End of Halifax and was the second largest railway station in Canada when it opened in 1878. Damaged, but repaired after the Halifax Explosion, it served until the current Halifax terminal location opened as part of the Ocean Terminals project in the city's South End in 1919. Background The first railway station in Halifax was built by the Nova Scotia Railway in 1854 at Richmond, Nova Scotia. A large wooden structure, it consisted of an enclosed train shed covering one track and platforms with series of wings for the ticket offices, waiting rooms and a lunch room and saloon. The station was functional and without ornamentation as well as inconveniently located two miles from downtown Halifax, connected by a horse- drawn street railway. After Confederation in 1867, the Nova Scotia Railway was taken over by the Government of Canada and became part of the Intercolonial Railway. In 1873, the Intercolonial made plans for a large new landmark station worthy of their eastern terminus. Construction The new station was located much closer to downtown at the corner of North Street and Barrington Street thanks to negotiations between the Canadian Government and the British Royal Navy whose Halifax Dockyard had blocked the railway's extension into downtown. The new station was the second largest in Canada when built, exceeded only by Toronto's Union Station.Douglas N. W. Smith, The Ocean Limited: A Centennial Tribute The layout of the new Halifax station was designed by the Intercolonial's Chief Engineer Alexander McNab. The architectural details and working plans were drawn up architects Andrew Dewar and David Stirling, who also designed the Provincial Building and St. David's Presbyterian Church on Grafton Street.Peter M. Latta, ' 'Old Railway Stations of the Maritimes' ', St. Agnes Press (1998), p. 12 The station was built by the construction firm of Henry Peters.Paul A. Erickson, ' ' Historic North End Halifax' ', Nimbus Publishing (2004), p. 73 The station followed the Second Empire architectural style with a mansard roof, a large central clock tower and elaborately decorated dormers. The main station structure was 113' x 50' with walls of decorated pressed brick rising from a granite base. The first floor contained a general waiting room, a ladies‚Äô waiting room (fitted with plush seats, a marble fireplace and a separate ticket office), a reading room as well as ticket offices for the Intercolonial Railway and the Windsor and Annapolis Railway as well as offices for the station master and passenger superintendent. The second floor contained more railway offices and a balcony where railway officials could observe operations in the large glass-covered passenger shed, the second glass railway canopy built in Canada. The shed was 400' by 87' and contained five enclosed tracks and platforms. A sixth track on the west side outside the shed was used for private railway cars where the rich could disembark in privacy and hook their private cars up to steam heating from the station. The glass roof was supported by a canopy of 24 iron trusses. Extensive iron awnings sheltered express wagons on the east side and passenger cabs on the North Street side.Latta, p. 12 A covered and heated staircase led from the station up to Barrington Street's sidewalks and streetcars. The ocean liner and immigration terminal at Pier 2 was only a few blocks away making for a convenient transfer to trains at the North Street Station for ocean liner travellers. Ships with large numbers of immigrants were served by special immigrant passenger trains of Colonist cars ran directly into the wharf side sheds on Pier 2, co-ordinated by the North Street Station. Service The station opened on August 8, 1877 with a special ceremonial train carrying Canadian Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie, followed by a public opening the next day.Erickson, p. 74 The North Street Station was a union station as it served the Intercolonial but also the Windsor and Annapolis Railway (known as the Dominion Atlantic Railway after 1893) and the Halifax and Southwestern Railway after 1901. The station was the first departure point for such famous named trains as the Ocean Limited in 1904, the Maritime Express and the Flying Bluenose. In 1902, the King Edward Hotel, the most modern, and one of the largest, hotels in Halifax was built immediately across Barrington Street to the station's west. The North Street Station served as the focus for important civic events such as the departure of Halifax's contingent in the North-West Rebellion of 1885 and the departure of Canadian troops for the Boer War in 1898. The entire front of the station was decorated for the return of Boer War troops in 1901. Following the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912, numerous private cars of the wealthy filled the special spur beside the station as wealthy families arrived in hopes of identifying and claiming bodies of their loved ones and so many reporters congregated that the station installed extra telegraph lines for their use. However, by 1912, the North Street Station was reaching its limitations. Built for fewer and shorter trains in the era of 50-foot wooden passenger cars, the newer longer trains with 80-foot steel cars exceeded the size of the station's platform. The increased number of trains taxed the station's limited number of platforms. Hemmed in by Barrington Street to the west, and the Navy dockyard to the east, the station had no room to expand. Plans announced in 1912 for a much larger combined passenger station and ocean liner terminal in Halifax‚Äôs South End. Construction of the railway cutting to access the new South End site began in 1913. World War I Construction of the tracks, piers and terminal grounds in the south end had just begun when World War I erupted in 1914. While track work slowly continued towards the site of the south end terminal, the North Street Station remained the gateway to Halifax and saw the heaviest use in its history. Thousands of troops arrived in the city prior to embarking overseas followed by thousands of family members and wartime workers piling into the busy wartime port through the North Street Station. As the war dragged on, increasing numbers of wounded arrived back in Canada aboard hospital ships, met at Pier 2 by special hospital trains outfitted and organized at the North Street Station.Jay Underwood, ' 'Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway' ', Railfare DC Books (2005), p. 121, 127 =Halifax Explosion= Workers clear debris from the North Street Station's collapsed train shed. On December 6, 1917, the French ammunition ship SS Mont- Blanc blew up following a collision in Halifax Harbour, a tragedy known as the Halifax Explosion which killed nearly 2000 people. Although numerous accounts of the Halifax Explosion erroneously state that the North Street Station was destroyed, it was only damaged, albeit seriously, and quickly resumed service. On the morning of the Halifax Explosion, the Ocean Limited had just departed and the local train from Truro had just arrived. The air blast from the explosion collapsed two thirds of the train shed roof. Virtually all the windows in the station were blown away. Doors and walls on the exposed third floor were knocked over and the roof was damaged. In the blizzard that followed the explosion, heating pipes and radiators froze and burst, and portions of the roof collapsed. More significantly, two miles of the approach tracks to the North Street Station were deeply buried in debris and blocked by wrecked railway equipment. This included the destruction on 16% of all the Intercolonial's passenger cars.Douglas N. W. Smith, ‚ÄúThe Railways and Canada‚Äôs Greatest Disaster: The Halifax Explosion, December 6, 1917‚Äù, Canadian Rail, No. 431, November ‚Äì December 1992, pp. 202-204 A few railway employees were killed at the North Street Station, but most railway deaths occurred in the Richmond yards north of the station, including the entire engine crew of a train that had just left the North Street Station.Many sources inaccurately state that over 60 people were killed at the station, but this was the total number of Intercolonial railway employees killed all over Halifax. Most of these 67 deaths were in the Richmond Railway Yards. Jay Underwood, \\"The Railway's Toll (December 6, 1917)\\", ' 'Canadian Rail' ' January-February 2003, pp. 28-29 A passenger train departs through devastated Richmond after December 9 when tracks were cleared and service resumed. Relief and passenger trains were temporarily diverted over the recently-laid tracks to the unfinished south end terminal on December 6 and December 7. However railway workers quickly repaired and cleaned up the North Street Station. The remaining train shed roof was hauled down and the platform tracks were cleared on December 8. Windows were boarded up until they could be replaced. Cranes and track crews cleared the wreckage from the track through Richmond allowing the North Street Station to open for a modified passenger schedule on the evening of December 8. The Dominion Atlantic‚Äôs Kentville train was the first train to leave from the reopened North Street Station at 6 pm on December 8. Full service resumed from the station on December 9.Smith, ‚ÄúThe Railways and Canada‚Äôs Greatest Disaster‚Äù, p. 209 By January 1918 a new roof had been constructed on the train shed and the express offices had reopened. . Smith, ‚ÄúThe Railways and Canada‚Äôs Greatest Disaster‚Äù, p. 213 Final year Despite its battered exterior, the North Street Station served for another year of intense passenger traffic as the fighting drew to a close and troops returned home following the Armistice on November 11. However, the heavy wartime traffic highlighted the limited size of the station's terminal tracks, already noted before the war. The Royal Canadian Navy was also eyeing the property in hopes of dockyard expansion. As a result, the South End terminal was brought into permanent operation in 1919. The last regularly scheduled passenger train left the North Street Station on January 4, 1919.‚ÄùNew Station Opens‚Äù, Halifax Chronicle, January 5, 1919 Although the North Street station saw a few months of sporadic use for freight and special passenger trains, it was demolished sometime in the 1920s. Today the site of the station is a parking lot opposite the main gate to HMC Dockyard just north of the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge where it crosses Barrington Street. In popular culture The North Street Station provides an important setting in the Canadian novel Barometer Rising by Hugh MacLennan where two major characters are killed in a vivid, although wildly-exaggerated depiction of the station's canopy collapse during the Halifax Explosion. The station is also depicted the Canadian Heritage Minute about the heroic telegraph railway dispatcher Vincent Coleman, although Coleman worked at the smaller Richmond station in the nearby railway freight yards.

At a biallelic locus with alleles 1 and 2, the additive disequilibrium exists according to the equations : begin{align} f_{11} & = p_1^2 + D [5pt] f_{12} & = 2p_1 (1-p_1) - 2D [5pt] f_{22} & = (1-p_1)^2 + D end{align} where fij is the frequency of genotype ij in the population, p is the allele frequency in the population, and D is the additive disequilibrium coefficient. Having a value of D > 0 indicates an excess of homozygotes/deficiency of heterozygotes in the population, whereas D < 0 indicates an excess of heterozygotes/deficiency of homozygotes. When D = 0, the genotypes are considered to be in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. In practice, the estimated additive disequilibrium from a sample, widehat{D} , will rarely be exactly 0, but it may be small enough to conclude that it is not significantly different from 0. Finding the value of the additive disequilibrium coefficient provides an alternative assessment in accepting or rejecting Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium in a set of genotypic frequencies. Because the genotype and allele frequencies must be positive numbers in the interval (0,1), there exists a constraint on the range of possible values for D, which is as follows: : max_{u,in, (1,2)} -p_u^2 le D le p_1 (1-p_1) To estimate D from a sample, use the formula: : widehat{D} = widehat{f}_{11} - widehat{p}_1^2 = frac{n_{11}}{n} - left( frac{2n_{11}+n_{12}}{2n} right)^2 where n11 (n12) is the number of individuals in the sample with that particular genotype and n is the total number of individuals in the sample. Note that widehat{f}_{11} and widehat{p}_1 are sample estimates of the population genotype and allele frequencies. The approximate sampling variance of widehat{D} (given by operatorname{var}(widehat{D})) is: : operatorname{var} widehat D = frac{widehat p_1^2(1 - widehat p_1^2)} n From this an estimated 95% confidence interval can be calculated, which is : widehat{D} pm 1.96 sqrt{operatorname{var}(widehat{D})} Note: sqrt{operatorname{var}(widehat{D})} is also equal to the estimated standard deviation . If the confidence interval for widehat{D} does not include zero, we can reject the null hypothesis for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. * Similarly, we can also test for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium using the z-statistic, which uses information from the estimate of additive disequilibrium to determine significance. When using the z-statistic, however, the goal is to transform the statistic in a way such that asymptotically, it has a standard normal distribution. To do this, divide widehat{D} by its standard deviation, which gives the simplified equation: :: z = frac{widehat{D}sqrt n}{widehat{p}_1 (1-widehat{p}_1)} When z is large, widehat{D} and thus the departure from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium are also large. If the value of z is sufficiently large, it is unlikely that the deviations would occur by chance and thus the hypothesis of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium can be rejected. To determine if z is significantly larger or smaller than expected under Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium, find \\"the probability of observing\\" a value as or more extreme as the observed z \\"under the null hypothesis\\". The tail probability is normally used, ‚Ñô(y > z), where y is standard normal random variable. When z is positive, the tail probability is 1 ‚àí ‚Ñô(y ‚â§ z). Because normal distributions are symmetric, the upper and lower tail probabilities will be equal, and thus you can find the upper probability and multiply by 2 to find the combined tail probabilities. If z is negative, find the negative tail probability, ‚Ñô(y ‚â§ z), and multiply by 2 to find the combined probability in both upper and lower tails. The probability values calculated from these equations can be analyzed by comparison to a pre-specified value of Œ±. When the observed probability p ‚â§ Œ±, we can \\"reject the null hypothesis of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium\\". If p > Œ±, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Commonly used values of Œ± are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001. At a significance of Œ± = 0.05, we can reject the hypothesis of Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium if the absolute value of z is \\"greater than or equal to the critical value 1.96\\" for the two-sided test.

He is known for assembling what was the largest private library of its time in Norway. Book collection Boeck acquired his first book at the age of nine. He received his examen artium in 1854 from Heltberg High School and his candidate of law degree in 1860 from Royal Frederick University. At that time, he had collected 2,000 books and had worked for a few years as a stipendiary magistrate in Namdalen before returning to his native Kristiania and a new job as a copying clerk at the Ministry of Church and Education in 1863. In 1864 he won the H.R.H. Crown Prince Gold Medal for a thesis on prices of wood and fish. In 1874 Boeck was promoted to royal envoy. He headed the Oslo Workers' Society from 1877 to 1879, and he chaired the \\"flag meeting\\" on March 13, 1879, where the participants considered a new tricolor flag as proposed by Hagbard Emanuel Berner. After marrying in 1866, Boeck relocated to a larger detached residence at Professor Dahls gate (Professor Dahl Street) no. 29, where he had room for his large book collection. However, space was limited, and he sold 754 volumes to the National Library of Iceland. In 1899, Boeck sold 31,467 books for NOK 25,000 to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in Trondheim together with a large number of maps, letters, and 610 manuscripts. The sales contract specified that the collection could not be split up. Most of the material was incorporated into the Gunnerus Library and, among other things, was an important addition to its collection of autographs. Today the collection is largely intact and is called the Thorvald Boeck Collection (Thorvald Boecks boksamling) with its own collection of handwritten material. Among other items, it includes: * A first edition of Saxo Grammaticus's Gesta Danorum from 1514 * A Ludvig Holberg collection consisting of 300 volumes and four letters * Much work by Henrik Ibsen * Material by Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, including a handwritten draft of \\"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\\" * A Henrik Wergeland collection consisting of 100 volumes plus some manuscripts, including a draft of \\"Til min gyldenlak\\" (To My Wallflower) Family Boeck was the son of the natural scientist and zoologist Christian Peder Bianco Boeck (1798‚Äì1877). He was born in the Calmeyerl√∏kken neighborhood of Kristiania (now Oslo) and grew up in Kristiania with his brothers, including the marine biologist Jonas Axel Boeck (1833‚Äì1873). In 1866 Boeck married Julie Pauline Louise Maschmann (1841‚Äì1923), the daughter of the priest Bernt Sverdrup Maschmann (1805‚Äì1869). In 1889, Boeck's daughter Elisabeth (1868‚Äì1958) married the architect Herman Backer (1856‚Äì1932).

Organized and run by priests, the society supported and promoted Roman Catholic ideas and worldview. The society organized primary schools and later gymnasiums. In 1907, it established pro-gymnasium for girls in Marijampolƒó. In 1918, it established several gymnasiums. ≈Ωiburys, along with other Lithuanian organizations, was closed by the new Soviet regime following the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. Establishment After the failed Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist regime enacted strict Russification policies: the Lithuanian press was prohibited, all non-government schools were closed, and government schools prohibited the use of the Lithuanian language. Lithuanians resisted such policies and organized illegal schools taught by daraktorius. The restrictions were lifted in 1904 and Lithuanians organized societies Saulƒó (Sun) in the Kovno Governorate and ≈Ωiburys in the Suwa≈Çki Governorate to fund and operate Lithuanian schools. The Lithuanian Education Society Rytas in the Vilna Governorate was established only in 1913. Leftist Lithuanians established ≈†viesa (light), led by future president Kazys Grinius, in December 1905. However, seven of its members left it in protest when the new society voted that the religious class should be taught by a regular teacher and not a priest. (The Tsarist regime closed ≈†viesa in 1908). Priest Justinas Staugaitis then took on to organize ≈Ωiburys and the founding meeting took place on 6 January 1906 in Marijampolƒó. Staugaitis was elected as chairman, but he was soon reassigned to Lekƒóƒçiai and priest Motiejus Gustaitis became the long-term chairman of ≈Ωiburys. The society was officially approved and registered on 15 May 1906. Before World War I In the Suwa≈Çki Governorate, most teachers were Lithuanian and taught in the Lithuanian language. Thus, the establishment of Lithuanian-language schools was less urgent than elsewhere. Initially, ≈Ωiburys established unofficial schools building on the traditions of daraktorius. In 1910, it officially registered nine primary schools with 465 students. In total, before World War I, the society had about 20 primary schools. On 22 September 1907, ≈Ωiburys opened a girls' pro-gymnasium with a dormitory in Marijampolƒó. It had 52 students in 1909 and 91 students in 1914. In 1908, the society invited Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó (≈†atrijos Ragana), who had studied pedagogy in Switzerland, to direct the pro-gymnasium. Twice the society petitioned the government of the Congress Poland for a permission to elevate the school to gymnasium status but was refused. Its petitions for a boys' pro-gymnasium in Sejny were similarly rejected. In 1907, the society established an evening school for adults in Vilkavi≈°kis (50 students). The society also established local chapters that had small libraries and reading rooms. In 1909, there were 54 chapters with 3,556 members. In total, it had 58 libraries and 38 reading rooms. In 1911‚Äì1914, the society published five issues of the ≈Ωiburys magazine which reported on the activities of the society and discussed issues of Lithuanian education. Until 1918, the society did not receive any government funding and had to rely on school tuition, membership fees, and donations. To raise funds, ≈Ωiburys organized various public lectures (speakers included Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Petras Leonas, Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó), music performances, amateur theater plays. The plays included drama Ponas ir mu≈æikai by Aleksandras Fromas-Gu≈æutis, comedy by Jean-Fran√ßois Bayard, adaptation of Genovefa by Christoph von Schmid, opera Birutƒó by Mikas Petrauskas, Velnias spƒÖstuose by ≈Ωemaitƒó and Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó-Bitƒó, The Bear by Anton Chekhov, Nepadƒójus nƒór ko kasti by Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas. In 1914, society's chairman Motiejus Gustaitis traveled to United States to collect donations from Lithuanian Americans for the construction of a dedicated school building in Marijampolƒó, but the plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Interwar period During World War I, the girls' pro-gymnasium evacuated to Tambov where it had about 180 students. In 1918, the society and its schools returned to newly independent Lithuania. Gymnasiums were established in ≈†akiai, Prienai, Vilkavi≈°kis, Sejny (moved to Lazdijai in 1921 due to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War), Kra≈æiai even before the Lithuanian Ministry of Education was organized. In 1930s, these gymnasiums, except for the ones in ≈†akiai and Prienai, were taken over by the Lithuanian government. It was an intentional effort by the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church and by extension its main political opponent the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. The society also established specialized schools, including an agricultural school for girls in Karkliniai in 1924 and a higher school of commerce in Kybartai in 1925. To raise teachers' qualifications, ≈Ωiburys established two-year courses for teachers in Pilvi≈°kiai and Kudirkos Naumiestis. The society also established a kindergarten, several shelters for children and the elderly.

Located on Poydras Street, the main thoroughfare in the city's Central Business District (CBD), it is the tallest building completed in the city in the 2010s and the first residential skyscraper completed in the city following Hurricane Katrina. Some sources affirm that the building was financed via Gulf Opportunity Zone financing that was enacted by the United States Congress to aid in the recovery from Katrina, while other sources state that alternative financing was used. The building's construction was the subject of a court battle regarding damage to surrounding buildings. Nonetheless, the building's design, which was scaled back from early plans, has won many awards. Details 930 Poydras from the east along Poydras Street The building is the first residential high-rise constructed in downtown New Orleans following the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. In fact, it had been over a generation since a new-construction residential high-rise had been built in downtown New Orleans. Poydras Street is the main corridor of the New Orleans Central Business District, and 930 Poydras is the first ever residential building in the CBD portion of Poydras. Developed by Brian Gibbs, the building is the second residential structure (One River Place) with an address on Poydras Street. It is the tallest building completed in the city in the 2010s and the most recently completed skyscraper. The building which was originally planned to have 37 floors, was scaled back to 35% glass skin from an all-glass structure due to financial considerations. The building was also scaled back from to . Designed by Eskew+Dumez+Ripple, the building has of mixed-use space, including ground floor retail and 250 residential apartments above a 500-car garage. Located at the intersection of Poydras and O'Keefe Streets, the structure is composed of 146 one-bedroom units, 99 two-bedroom units and five townhouses. The structure has 8 floors of parking spaces. Steve Dumez served as lead design architect of the 21-story L-shaped structure. During construction, the adjacent three-story building which is among the National Register of Historic Places listings in Orleans Parish, Louisiana and is owned by the Birdsall Law Firm was said to have endured structural damage. This led to a lawsuit in Orleans Parish Civil District Court, but a judicial stay of construction was denied. Instead, the judge ruled that a monetary compensation would be determined after construction was completed. The ground floor and parking garage elevators lead to the 9th floor and another set of elevators from the 9th floor leads to the residential units. All common tenant amenities are located on the double-height 9th floor, which includes a coffee bar and movie screening lounge inside as well as an outdoor pool and covered fitness center. The narrow pool has a tiered-seating pool deek. There are five two- story townhouses on the south side of the building with direct pool deck access. The 9th floor atrium lobby and its communal spaces are intended to be a social space reminiscent of the French Quarter courtyard, according to Dumez. In addition to the gathering space, the continuous skin from parking to residences, has been critically acclaimed. The design has won numerous awards, and Eskew+Dumez+Ripple won the American Institute of Architects 2014 Architecture Firm Award. It was funded based on Congressional incentives intended to promote recovery. Design and construction were expedited to meet the December 2009 sunset clause, that required that the building begin service by December 31, 2009. The financing combined tax credits and Gulf Opportunity Zone incentives according to a February 2009 story in The Times-Picayune by Kate Moran, while a January 2009 story in The Times-Picayune by Robert Travis Scott claimed that the GO Zone bonds were not used when an alternate funding source was found. Although the first tenants did not take full occupancy until March 2010 and 100% occupancy of the 250 apartments was not achieved until July 2010, partial temporary occupancy was granted just before the deadline. The building is financed by Federal and state new-market tax credits for the garage and United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's 221(d)(4) loans for the apartment residences.
